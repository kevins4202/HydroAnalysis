6490,bayesian averaging of climate models is an important tool in streamflow predictions climate models have parametric and structural differences and thus have variable hydrological output performance of the individual climate models before they are averaged in a bayesian framework should be consistent with their respective performance indices in a bayesian framework to ensure that bayesian averaging follows the physical process priors are required to compute posterior probability distributions in the bayesian predictions robustness of bayesian predictions therefore depends on use of a suitable prior in this study combinations of bayesian regression model priors and regression parameter priors for streamflow prediction have been evaluated to investigate consistency of streamflow simulation performance of rcms individually outside the bayesian framework individually inside the bayesian framework and collectively inside the bayesian framework using twelve widely used bayesian formulations the performance of rcm streamflow simulations outside the bayesian framework is evaluated using widely used statistical indices the willmott s index of agreement d1 root mean square error rmse and percent bias error pbias the performance inside the bayesian framework is evaluated using posterior inclusion probability pip results suggest that performance of climate models inside bayesian framework may not be the same as that outside bayesian framework therefore there is need for climate model performance evaluation both inside and outside bayesian framework as a precursor to bayesian prior selection for example the non empirical bayes g local non ebl based bayesian priors give consistent climate model performance inside and outside bayesian framework and therefore is the best prior for simulating high flows based on the participating climate models in low flow modelling the results suggest that both ebl and non ebl priors can be used in averaging low flow in the bayesian framework keywords bayesian formulation schemes streamflow low flow high flow regional climate models rcms posterior inclusion probability pip 1 introduction the number of climate models used to estimate the current and future hydrological conditions continues to increase bukovsky et al 2013 eslamian et al 2011 farzaneh et al 2012 mearns et al 2009 however due to structural and parametric differences the climate models produce different results baumberger et al 2017 jackson et al 2008 knutti et al 2010 wallach et al 2016 in order to reduce uncertainty in the hydrological simulation results of the climate models bayesian model averaging is widely used to combine different climate models in order to produce reasonable results since different climate models best simulate different aspects of hydrologic conditions chen et al 2015 many previous climate change impact studies typically assumed an equally probable prior model probability in the bayesian framework such as in the study conducted on irish river catchments bastola et al 2011 the streamflow study in mississippi s leaf river basin ajami et al 2007 the study to analyze model parameter uncertainty of streamflow prediction models vrugt et al 2008 streamflow studies conducted in australia averaged climate models streamflow predictions in a bayesian framework using dirichlet prior distribution as the prior model probability pokhrel et al 2013 because high uncertainty associated with determining actual prior model distribution bayesian based combination of climate model forecasts of precipitation and sea surface temperature used a normal distribution to describe the prior distribution of model parameters luo et al 2007 assumption based prior model probability in rainfall runoff modeling problems e g uniform prior distribution has been found to have a potential of an ill posed posterior model parameter estimates because of the subjectiveness with which these assumptions are made kavetski et al 2006 most bayesian based hydrological studies khoshravesh et al 2017 tebaldi knutti 2007 wang et al 2012 weisheimer et al 2009 w√∂hling et al 2015 evaluated the performance of climate models and bayesian averaged climate models forecast but did not assess the performance of the individual climate models inside a bayesian framework making sure that the rcms performance indices observed outside the bayesian framework match those inside the bayesian framework allows us to select bayesian formulations that follow the physical process assessment of climate models capability to simulate hydrological processes involves statistically quantifying degree of fit or correlation with respect to the climate model bias and or variance between simulated data and observed ones evaluation of the climate models performance is necessary to assess the capability of the models to simulate historical current and or future hydrological conditions inform the climate models parameter tuning based on performance indices assess advancement of the climate models with respect to their corresponding previous versions and compare different climate models there are a number of widely used classical performance indices to assess climate models hydrological predictions including root mean square error rmse legates mccabe 1999 r squared dawson et al 2002 gupta et al 1998 pearson correlation coefficient r pearson 1948 percent bias error pbias gupta et al 1998 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 among others this study investigates the performance of rcms to simulate total low and high streamflow individually outside the bayesian framework and individually and collectively under different bayesian formulation schemes in a relatively small basin and a relatively large basin respectively bayesian model parameter e g mean variance and regression model coefficients priors are the fundamental requirement for computing the posterior distribution that is needed to compute the predictive probability for bayesian predictions the posterior distribution is directly proportional to the product of the prior and the likelihood function the bayesian model parameter priors are selected either based on expert elicitation hoeting et al 1999 zellner 1986 which consists of expert beliefs and opinions based on previous data or experiments or based on ignorance in which case no prior knowledge exists and therefore model parameters are assumed to be equally likely fernandez et al 2001 ley et al 2012 the selection of the priors is subjective either way however including existing prior knowledge about model parameters would enhance model performance therefore the priors need to be carefully included in bayesian model averaging in order to get robust and reliable results in the face the already existing climate models uncertainty many different priors have been used in several hydrological studies bennett et al 2013 coelho et al 2004 obeysekera et al 2011 sanderson knutti 2012 tebaldi et al 2007 tebaldi et al 2005 westerberg et al 2016 the impacts of these priors on predictions of physical hydrologic processes however have not been properly investigated therefore the current study proposes and investigates a holistic process of selecting bayesian formulations including twelve combinations of widely used model and parameter priors these combinations of priors broadly fall into the two main categories of subjective and objective based bayesian prior selections selecting a bayesian formulation whose priors result in posterior inclusion probabilities of climate models inside the bayesian framework that are consistent with the performance of the corresponding models outside of the bayesian framework is important in ensuring physical processes to be properly captured specifically the aim of this study is to investigate the performance of rcms to simulate total low and high streamflow with respect to performance of individual rcms outside a bayesian framework which is assessed using three widely used assessment indices rmse pbias and index of agreement performance of individual rcms inside a bayesian framework which is assessed using marginal posterior density and posterior inclusion probability pip computed using bayesian formulation schemes the pip is a measure of the probability of a given rcm to reproduce the observed streamflow performance of bayesian averaged rcms under the bayesian formulation schemes which is assessed using pbias 2 methods 2 1 study area and source of streamflow data the two basins used in this study in a same region are cedar river basin near austin and rainy river at manitou rapids which are located in minnesota and have an area of 1500 km2 for the relatively small basin and 30 000 km2 for the relatively large basin respectively cedar and rainy river basins gauging stations are located at 92 97 43 64 and 95 54 44 72 respectively the long term 1968 1998 annual average rainfall for cedar and rainy basins are 834 and 671 mm whereas their respective long term total streamflow are 8 and 387 m3 s the daily observed total streamflow for the two basins are shown in fig 1 to conduct model averaging in a bayesian framework there is need for both observed streamflow dataset and climate model streamflow dataset the daily observed streamflow dataset for the two basins was obtained from united states geological survey usgs for the 1968 1998 time period the regional climate model rcm streamflow dataset of ten climate models was obtained from north american regional climate change assessment program narccap mearns et al 2012 which consists of global climate model gcm coupled with rcm and is gridded with spatial and temporal resolution of 50 km and 3 h respectively the narccap project was set up and implemented in two phases mearns et al 2009 the ten narccap rcms used in this study were developed by different research groups around the world at different time periods for consistent comparison these rcms have historical simulations from a common time period of 1968 to 1998 in north america narccap 2007 for the purposes of model comparison the period from 1968 to 1998 period is also used for historical simulations in this study the ten rcms gcm combinations that are used in this study are shown in table 1 five rcms are used including the canadian regional climate model crcm caya laprise 1999 music caya 2007 the scripps experimental climate prediction center regional spectral model ecp2 juang et al 1997 the fifth generation pennsylvania state university ncar mesoscale model mm5i grell et al 1994 the regional climate model version 3 rcm3 pal et al 2007 and the weather research and forecasting grell wrfg skamarock et al 2005 model the gcms used to drive the above rcms include the community climate system model ccsm collins et al 2006 the third generation coupled global climate model cgcm3 flato et al 2000 the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl model gfdl delworth et al 2006 and the hadley climate model hadcm3 pope et al 2000 the narccap rcm gcm combinations used in this study are shown in table 1 2 2 rcm grid based area weighted basin streamflow since the two case study river basins cedar and rainy have irregular shapes only the portions of the grids that cover the basins are considered when computing the streamflow from the basins the number of grids considered in the streamflow calculation depends on the size of the basin and the type of the rcm since the rcms have different geographical projections and thus not all of them are aligned the number of grids used in grid area weighted streamflow calculation for cedar river basin ranges from 2 to 6 grids whereas rainy river basin requires 24 28 grids once the number of grids and the grid areas that cover the basin are determined rcm based grid area weighted streamflow is computed as shown in the equation below 1 q i 1 n a i q i i 1 n a i where q i is the areal streamflow from i th rcm grid cell i 1 2 n n is the total number of grid cells interpolated and a i is the area of the i th grid that covers the basin table a1 in the appendix shows a sample of the grids used in the calculation of streamflow for the cedar river basin the daily rcm streamflow dataset was bias corrected by standardizing the dataset using equation 1 and reverting the standardized dataset back to the unstandardized dataset using eqs 2 and 3 below 2 y i y i Œº y œÉ y 3 y i œÉ o y i Œº o where y i is the rcm streamflow for day i y i is the bias corrected rcm streamflow for day i Œº y is the rcm mean daily streamflow for 1968 1998 time period œÉ y is the rcm standard deviation of daily streamflow for 1968 1998 time period Œº o is the observed mean daily streamflow for 1968 1998 time period and œÉ o is the observed standard deviation of daily streamflow for 1968 1998 time period 2 3 extreme streamflow low flow and high flow categories besides the total streamflow two categories of low flow and high flow are separately considered the low flow is defined as the 5th or the 10th percentile of the full record of the daily streamflow data on the other hand the high flow is defined as the 90th or the 95th percentile of daily streamflow record these extreme streamflow definitions are consistent with those in other studies blum et al 2018 chiew et al 2018 kocis dahlke 2017 richards 1990 visser et al 2017 and by the united states geological survey usgs 2019 therefore a total of five categories of flow are investigated in this study total streamflow high flow 90 100 high flow 95 100 low flow 0 5 and low flow 0 10 2 4 statistical performance indices the statistical performance indices used in this study include root mean square error rmse percent bias error pbias and index of agreement the rmse is a measure of goodness of fit with the same unit of the data that describes the error bias and variance between observed and simulated data legates et al 1999 index of agreement d 1 willmott 1982 willmott et al 1985 is also a measure of how well simulated streamflow agrees with observed streamflow with d 1 0 1 where 1 signifies perfect fit agreement while 0 denotes no fit modified form of d 1 which uses absolute deviation instead of squared deviation willmott 1984 willmott et al 2012 is used to avoid sensitivity to extreme values the pbias represents the deviation of the modeled from the measured streamflow gupta et al 1998 which accounts for the degree with which the climate models overestimate or underestimate the streamflow the positive and negative pbias values represent overestimation and estimation respectively the mathematical representations of the aforementioned performance indices can be found in the appendix 2 5 bayesian formulation schemes and bayesian regression models to average the streamflow data from the rcms in a bayesian framework prior probabilities need to be assigned to the regression models and to the parameters of regression models i e the intercept mean regression coefficient s and the standard deviation of regression model prediction the number of regression models consists of all combinations of regressors since there are ten regressors rcms in this study the number of regression models is 1024 i e 2 10 1024 normal regression model mj of observed streamflow y o onto kj regressors 0 kj k and each regressor having n observations is expressed as 4 y o i n Œº z j Œ≤ j œÉ Œµ where Œº is the intercept i n is the n dimensional vector of 1 s œÉ is the residual standard deviation Œµ is the ratio of residual over error that results from fitting the all regressors to the independent variable and is assumed to be independent and normally distributed with mean of zero and a variance of œÉ Œ≤ j is the kj dimensional vector of relevant regression coefficients z j is an n kj matrix that consists of columns of kj regressors x 1 x 2 x k j with each regressor having n observations note that the residual standard deviation œÉ of data yo given regressors in matrix z does not take subscript j because it is always determined by conditioning model mj on the entire set of k regressors and therefore œÉ is considered as a common regression parameter fern√°ndez et al 2001 across all the regression models the mpriors used in this study include discrete uniform distribution ley steel 2012 liang et al 2008a fixed model prior and random model prior zeugner 2011 zeugner feldkircher 2015 the g priors include the uniform information prior uip kass wasserman 1995 the bayesian risk information criterion bric fernandez et al 2001 hyper uip liang et al 2008b and the empirical bayes g local ebl cui george 2004 george foster 2000 g priors more information about the mpriors and g priors can be found in the appendix in this study a combination of an mprior and a g prior makes a bayesian formulation schemes the twelve bayesian formulation schemes that are used in this study are shown in table 2 2 6 posterior model probability of regression models posterior inclusion probability pip of regressors bayes

multidimensional integral with the number of dimension being the same as the number of regressors in model j i e kj which can be very cumbersome to calculate its actual value can be approximated using

estimated in this study the mcmc sampler written in the bms library of r programming language zeugner 2011 is used to compute the pmp summing up the pmps of regression models that contain the regressor of interest gives us the posterior inclusion probability pip of the regressor rcm which is the probability that a regressor of interest is included in the regression model of observed

using the full regression equation that contains all the regressors 2 7 calibration and validation of the bayesian based models the bayesian based models are trained and calibrated before they are used in streamflow predictions the daily streamflow for 1968 1990 is used to train the bayesian based models which are then validated using the 1991 1998 daily streamflow dataset the training and validation are conducted for the total streamflow high flow and low flow 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation results fig 2 shows the index of agreement d1 for the cedar river basin and rainy river basin for both model calibration and validation of the bayesian based streamflow models on the other hand fig 3 shows rmse in model calibration and validation phases for both basins even though the validation results have relatively lower d1 values than the calibration results these d1 values which are greater than 0 5 suggest that reasonable agreement exists between the models with the measured streamflow in the validation phase the results of calibration of the bayesian based streamflow models show that the models fit the observed streamflow data with d1 of at least 0 85 as shown in fig 2 for both cedar and rainy basins the strong model agreement with observed streamflow in calibration phase is further confirmed by the relatively low rmse of less than 0 5 mm across the flow regimes and in both basins as shown in fig 3 the corresponding model validation performance while having relatively lower d1 but of d1 0 7 and relatively higher rmse of up to 1 5 mm compared to the calibration phase also showed a high model agreement with the observed streamflow for both basins 3 2 climate model streamflow predictions performance metrics outside bayesian framework performance of rcm based simulated streamflow outside the bayesian framework is evaluated using three indices discussed earlier rmse index of agreement d 1 and percent bias error pbias the slope values obtained from regressing the observed streamflow onto each of the rcms indicate underestimation of total low and high streamflow as shown in tables 3 and 4 the rcms predict total and high flow regimes with strong low rmse as shown in fig 4 a for cedar river basin and fig 4b for rainy river basin the rmse shown in fig 4a and b for total and high flows varies from 1 0 to 3 9 mm across the rcms in the small basin and 1 to 2 mm for the large basin rcms simulated low flows in both basins have the rmse of less than 0 5 mm however the low flows are poorly predicted by the rcms in both river basins but high flows are predicted moderately with the d1 value of 0 35 to satisfactory well with the d1 value of 0 9 as shown in fig 4c and d fig 5 a and b show that the rcms can fairly well simulate the total flows in both basins even though the simulation strength varies with pbias of 0 to 25 for the large basin and pbias of 0 to 42 for the small basin both high flow regimes in the large and small basin are simulated pbias of 20 to 15 as shown in fig 5a and b the relatively large pbias values in fig 5c and d show that all the rcms have difficulty in simulating low flows in the small basin 3 3 climate model streamflow predictions performance metrics individually inside bayesian framework inside the bayesian framework the performance of rcm simulations is evaluated either individually by the posterior inclusion probability or collectively by the bma forecasts individually the performance of bias corrected rcms inside the bayesian framework is evaluated using the pip in the small basin the bayesian formulation schemes give consistent pip across the rcms except the three ebl empirical bayes g local based formulations which tend to give relatively higher pips than the rest of the formulations as shown in fig 6 similar pip patterns are shown for the high flows in the small basin as shown in fig 6 but with relatively higher variability in 90 100 percentile high flow than the 95 100 percentile high flow counterpart the low flows for both percentiles 0 5 and 0 10 on the other hand have very similar pip values across formulation schemes in the small basin as shown in fig 6 for 0 5 low flows in the small basin the ecp2 gfdl ecp2 hadcm3 and rcm3 cgcm3 have the highest pip of 0 7 1 and rcm3 gfdl and wrfg cgcm3 have 0 1 0 5 pip across the twelve bayesian formulation schemes as shown in fig 6 notice that only five and seven rcms in the cedar and rainy basins respectively are included in the bma for low flow since the remaining rcms have poor simulations as previously shown in their very weak correlation with the observed low flow in both basins as shown in tables 3 and 4 in the large basin the total streamflow has relatively less variable pip across the various prior formulation schemes with crcm ccsm crcm cgcm3 ecp2 gfdl mm5i hadcm3 and rcm3 cgcm3 having the highest pip values 0 9 and mm5i ccsm wrfg ccsm and wrfg cgcm3 having the lowest pip values of 0 5 as shown in fig 7 the large basin low flows 0 5 and high flows 95 100 also show consistent pip values across the bayesian formulation schemes as shown in fig 7 however there is very high variation in rcms pip values in both large basin 90 100 high flow and 0 10 low flow with pip values ranging from 0 1 to 1 in both cases as shown in fig 7 inside the bayesian framework the pip values only give us the strength but not the direction of correlation between the rcms and observed streamflow the marginal posterior density of the respective rcms is used to characterize the direction of correlation since plotting marginal posterior density graphs of each of the ten regressors and for each of the twelve bayesian formulation schemes and for the two basins would result in a large number of figures the regressors provided here are those that have the strongest positive negative and neither positive negative correlation with the observed total streamflow for one formulation scheme and for the two basins integrating the marginal posterior density graph of any given regressor produces the pip of that regressor which is also plotted on top of the graphs shown in figs 8 and 9 fig 8 shows that for the small basin the ecp2 gfdl has the strongest positive correlation since the entire marginal posterior density graph is on the positive portion of the x axis the wrfg cgcm3 has the strongest negative correlation since the graph falls on the negative scale and the mean regression coefficient is also negative the rcm3 gfdl has neither a strong positive or negative correlation with the observed total streamflow since the graph is neither shifted to left or to the right both ecp2 gfdl and wrfg cgcm3 have pip value of 1 indicating that both of them are strongly correlated with the observed streamflow even though they have different directions of correlation the rcm3 gfdl has a pip of 0 2 indicating a weak correlation with the observed total streamflow and a neutral direction of correlation seen in fig 8c the marginal posterior density graphs on fig 9 are for the large basin and the covariates that have positive negative and neither positive nor negative correlation with the observed streamflow are ecp2 gfdl crcm ccsm and wrfg cgcm3 respectively with the corresponding pip values of 1 1 and 0 02 respectively therefore the covariate with neither positive nor negative correlation i e wrfg cgcm3 with the observed streamflow has the lowest pip 3 4 climate model streamflow predictions performance metrics collectively inside bayesian framework collectively the performance of bayesian averaged rcms streamflow simulation inside the bayesian formulation schemes is assessed using the pbias the total high and low flows from the bma have pbias 1 across all the twelve formulation schemes and for the two basins as shown in fig 10 this is an indication that combining the rcms in a bayesian framework produces good streamflow simulations than any of the ten individual climate models used in this study however the bayesian formulation that gives good results that follow the physical process of the observed streamflow depends on the basin size and nature of flow event as demonstrated in figs 4 and 5 and tables 3 and 4 the total streamflow performance indices for the small basin outside the bayesian framework for the worst and the best performing rcms are wrfg cgcm3 pbias 42 d 0 58 and rmse 3 47 mm and ecp2 gfdl pbias 19 d 0 89 and rmse 1 07 mm respectively for the large basin the worst and the best performing rcms are wrfg ccsm pbias 12 d 0 456 and rmse 0 98 mm and ecp2 gfdl pbias 7 d 0 60 and rmse 0 61 mm respectively based on figs 6 and 7 within the bayesian framework non ebl based mean pip values for the corresponding rcms are respectively 0 76 wrfg cgcm3 and 0 97 ecp2 gfdl for small basin and respectively 0 12 wrfg ccsm and 1 00 ecp2 gfdl for the large basin figs 6 and 7 therefore show that the bayesian averaged total streamflow is best simulated by non ebl based bayesian formulations for both small and large basins since the rcm pip values are consistent with the rcm performance indices outside the bayesian framework however for the large basin ebl based formulations also give reasonable forecast for total streamflow since the variability of pip values from the mean pip value is small for each of the rcms as shown in fig 7 high flow is best simulated by non ebl based bayesian formulations except m random g hyper uip formulation which tends to give a relatively lower pip for the same rcm than the rest of the formulations as shown in fig 6 b c and fig 7 b c in the large basin high flow 95 100 for example the low pip values observed in m random g hyper uip formulation range from 0 02 for mm5i ccsm to 0 56 for rcm3 gfdl while its counterpart non ebl based formulation gives the corresponding rcms relatively higher values that range from a mean of pip of 0 1 for mm5i ccsm to 0 77 for rcm3 gfdl the corresponding performance of rcms outside the bayesian framework for the large basin high flow 95 100 range from d 0 42 pbias 15 and rmse 0 95 mm for mm5i ccsm to d 0 44 pbias 19 and rmse 0 75 mm for rcm3 gfdl the bma low flow is best simulated by both ebl based and none ebl based bayesian formulation as shown in fig 6 d e and fig 7 d e the mean pip values of bayesian formulations for the small basin low flow 0 5 range from 0 10 rcm3 gfdl to 1 0 ecp2 gfdl these pip values are consistent with the rcm low flow simulation performance outside bayesian framework which range from d 0 03 pbias 240 and rmse 0 24 mm for rcm3 gfdl to d 0 07 pbias 106 and rmse 0 11 mm for ecp2 gfdl however for the large basin wide percentile based low flow i e 0 10 is best simulated by non ebl based bayesian formulation as shown in fig 7e since the ebl based formulation give relatively large pip values which are non consistent with the rcm low flow performance indices outside bayesian framework 4 discussion 4 1 rcm performance outside and inside bayesian framework the rcms underestimate total streamflow high and low flows the underestimation of flow varies across the rcms as depicted by the difference in values of the rcms performance indices on average the total and high flows in the small basin are simulated with relatively larger errors than in the large basin model structure model parameters and input data are the main sources of error observed across the rcms streamflow simulations model structure based errors culminate from the fact that physical processes are incorporated into the rcm land surface models lsms in a simplified form e g only vertical flow is considered in lsm since they are 1 d physical soil column models and the lsms apply different model physics the ten rcms use three different lsms i e bats biosphere atmosphere transfer scheme yang dickinson 1996 class canadian land surface scheme verseghy 1991 and noah ek et al 2003 class is used in crcm ccsm and crcm cgcm3 bats is used in rcm3 cgcm3 and rcm3 gfdl whereas noah lsm is used in six rcms ecp2 gfdl ecp2 hadcm3 mm5i ccsm mm5i hadcm3 wrfg ccsm and wrfg cgcm3 model parameter based errors culminate from the high spatio temporal variability of many rcms lsm parameters e g soil snow land cover and slope that are used to simulate streamflow forcing data based errors originate from the multiple gcms forcing mejia 2010 that are used as the rcms lsm input data and that as a result affect streamflow output of the rcms besides the potential sources of errors discussed above the spatial variability in rcms streamflow simulation can also be attributed to the basin size difference and hydrological difference with respect to rainfall amount and streamflow between the two basins rainy basin requires 26 28 different grid cells to obtain the flow from the basin while cedar basin only requires 2 6 grid cells inside the bayesian framework performance of individual rcms streamflow simulation is gauged using pip and marginal posterior density not all of the bma formulations would give the rcm pips that are consistent with rcms streamflow performance indices outside bayesian framework this is the reason why ebl based formulation schemes i e m uniform g ebl m fixed g ebl and m random g ebl tend to give high 0 9 1 pip values when the rest of the formulation schemes give relatively lower pip values as shown in figs 6 and 7 this can be attributed to the fact that ebl g prior estimates g parameter for every regression model in the 2k regression model space based on the ordinary least square f statistics which is calculated as a function of r squared value of the respective regression models while its counterpart formulations use a constant g value across all the regression models 4 2 impact of low performance rcms on the bma prediction there are some bma formulations that award higher pip values to the rcms with lower performance outside the bayesian framework as discussed earlier in this section an assessment is done to show the inconsistency of some rcms performance inside the bayesian framework with respect to their performance outside the bayesian framework specifically evaluation is done on how the rmse of the bma streamflow prediction changes when one of the rcms is removed from the full bayesian regression model with all the ten rcms poor streamflow prediction and correlation with observed streamflow occurs if the rmse increases when an rcm is left out in the full bayesian regression model for prediction of streamflow in most cases the rmse increases the most in ebl based formulations compared to the rest of the formulations in the small basin s 90 100 high flow for example when wrfg ccsm is left out in the bma the ebl based formulations overestimate streamflow and the rmse values are larger than the rest of the formulations as shown in fig a1 a and b in the appendix the ebl based formulations have a mean rsme of 2 25 mm while the rest of the formulations have a mean rmse of 1 mm as shown in fig a1 b in the supplementary when wrfg ccsm is left out the larger rmse in addition to the higher pip value to wrfg ccsm by the ebl based formulations than the rest of the formulations is an indication that the ebl based formulations overall perform worse than the non ebl based formulations which highlights the need for consistency of rcms pip inside bayesian framework with rcms performance outside bayesian framework similar results are shown in the small basin high flow events 90 100 with greater rmse changes observed in the ebl based formulations than the rest of the formulations being observed when mm5i hadcm3 and rcm3 gfdl are left out the rmse values change the most in large basin low flow 0 10 when epc2 gfdl is left out as shown in fig a2 with the ebl based formulations having greater rmse than the rest of formulations the prior distribution regression coefficient also known as the g prior is a multivariate normal prior distribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation that is dependent on the value of g parameter fernandez et al 2001 the g prior is formulated in eq a5 zellner 1986 unlike the rest of the g priors regression coefficient priors the ebl priors compute the g parameter of the g prior locally for every regression model in the regression model space a standard f statistics value is computed for every regression model in the model space as shown in equation a11 and the f statistics is then used to compute the g parameter as shown in equation a10 the g parameter is in turn used to compute the prior density of regression coefficient of the corresponding regression model as shown in eq a5 therefore the ebl based formulation peeks into the data to compute the prior distribution of regression coefficients which violates the definition of prior distribution and awards higher pip values to the low performing rcms conversely a single computed g parameter is for and all the regression models in the non ebl based formulations in the uniform information prior uip for example the value of g parameter is determined as the number of observations per regressor kass et al 1995 as shown in eq a6 while in the bric prior the g parameter is the maximum between the number of observations and the square of the number of regressors as shown in eq a9 large basin high flow 95 100 seems to have consistent changes in the streamflow prediction and rmse across both the ebl based and non ebl based formulations when any of the rcms is left out therefore leaving out any of the rcms in the bayesian regression model does not cause significant changes in both rmse and streamflow prediction therefore the large basin high flow 95 100 can be reasonably predicted with both the ebl based and non ebl based formulations 5 conclusions the model distribution parameter priors are used to determine the posterior distribution which is used to compute the bma formulations of the streamflow priors affect the results of bma streamflow simulations evaluating the performance of the climate models both inside and outside the bayesian framework and examining their consistency is important in this study several common statistical indices were used to evaluate the performance of rcms individually and used the posterior inclusion probability and marginal posterior density to evaluate performance of rcms in streamflow simulations inside the bayesian framework the conclusions from this study can be summarized as follows there exists variability in streamflow simulation among the individual rcms both inside and outside the bayesian framework and therefore the need to match rcms performance inside and outside the bayesian framework to select the appropriate bma formulation the bma streamflow simulations are obviously better and more desirable than any of the individual rcms but the formulation chosen needs to assign posterior pips to the rcms that are consistent with the rcms performance outside bayesian framework otherwise bma formulation is at best an empirical technique to averages climate models to produce more desirable simulations that may follow the physical processes of the observed streamflow the choice of a bayesian prior varies with the type of a given hydrological phenomenon e g low verses high flow therefore care should be taken when selecting a bayesian prior to be used for averaging multi model hydrological predictions the size of hydrological system may influence the type of prior implemented in a bayesian framework even with only two basin sizes in this study there is significant difference on the bayesian prior suitability for the small verses the large basin declaration of competing interest the

the most commonly used regression model prior distribution mprior is the discrete uniform distribution ley steel 2012 liang et al 2008a that is formulated by assuming that all the regressors are independent the mprior for regression model mj is expressed as a1 p m j p j j 1 2 2 k such that p j 0 and j 1 2 k p j 1 since all the regressors are assumed to be independent the probability of including each of the regressor into regression model mj is p j 1 2 1 besides the uniform distribution two other mpriors are used in this study fixed model prior and random model prior fixed model

6490,bayesian averaging of climate models is an important tool in streamflow predictions climate models have parametric and structural differences and thus have variable hydrological output performance of the individual climate models before they are averaged in a bayesian framework should be consistent with their respective performance indices in a bayesian framework to ensure that bayesian averaging follows the physical process priors are required to compute posterior probability distributions in the bayesian predictions robustness of bayesian predictions therefore depends on use of a suitable prior in this study combinations of bayesian regression model priors and regression parameter priors for streamflow prediction have been evaluated to investigate consistency of streamflow simulation performance of rcms individually outside the bayesian framework individually inside the bayesian framework and collectively inside the bayesian framework using twelve widely used bayesian formulations the performance of rcm streamflow simulations outside the bayesian framework is evaluated using widely used statistical indices the willmott s index of agreement d1 root mean square error rmse and percent bias error pbias the performance inside the bayesian framework is evaluated using posterior inclusion probability pip results suggest that performance of climate models inside bayesian framework may not be the same as that outside bayesian framework therefore there is need for climate model performance evaluation both inside and outside bayesian framework as a precursor to bayesian prior selection for example the non empirical bayes g local non ebl based bayesian priors give consistent climate model performance inside and outside bayesian framework and therefore is the best prior for simulating high flows based on the participating climate models in low flow modelling the results suggest that both ebl and non ebl priors can be used in averaging low flow in the bayesian framework keywords bayesian formulation schemes streamflow low flow high flow regional climate models rcms posterior inclusion probability pip 1 introduction the number of climate models used to estimate the current and future hydrological conditions continues to increase bukovsky et al 2013 eslamian et al 2011 farzaneh et al 2012 mearns et al 2009 however due to structural and parametric differences the climate models produce different results baumberger et al 2017 jackson et al 2008 knutti et al 2010 wallach et al 2016 in order to reduce uncertainty in the hydrological simulation results of the climate models bayesian model averaging is widely used to combine different climate models in order to produce reasonable results since different climate models best simulate different aspects of hydrologic conditions chen et al 2015 many previous climate change impact studies typically assumed an equally probable prior model probability in the bayesian framework such as in the study conducted on irish river catchments bastola et al 2011 the streamflow study in mississippi s leaf river basin ajami et al 2007 the study to analyze model parameter uncertainty of streamflow prediction models vrugt et al 2008 streamflow studies conducted in australia averaged climate models streamflow predictions in a bayesian framework using dirichlet prior distribution as the prior model probability pokhrel et al 2013 because high uncertainty associated with determining actual prior model distribution bayesian based combination of climate model forecasts of precipitation and sea surface temperature used a normal distribution to describe the prior distribution of model parameters luo et al 2007 assumption based prior model probability in rainfall runoff modeling problems e g uniform prior distribution has been found to have a potential of an ill posed posterior model parameter estimates because of the subjectiveness with which these assumptions are made kavetski et al 2006 most bayesian based hydrological studies khoshravesh et al 2017 tebaldi knutti 2007 wang et al 2012 weisheimer et al 2009 w√∂hling et al 2015 evaluated the performance of climate models and bayesian averaged climate models forecast but did not assess the performance of the individual climate models inside a bayesian framework making sure that the rcms performance indices observed outside the bayesian framework match those inside the bayesian framework allows us to select bayesian formulations that follow the physical process assessment of climate models capability to simulate hydrological processes involves statistically quantifying degree of fit or correlation with respect to the climate model bias and or variance between simulated data and observed ones evaluation of the climate models performance is necessary to assess the capability of the models to simulate historical current and or future hydrological conditions inform the climate models parameter tuning based on performance indices assess advancement of the climate models with respect to their corresponding previous versions and compare different climate models there are a number of widely used classical performance indices to assess climate models hydrological predictions including root mean square error rmse legates mccabe 1999 r squared dawson et al 2002 gupta et al 1998 pearson correlation coefficient r pearson 1948 percent bias error pbias gupta et al 1998 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 among others this study investigates the performance of rcms to simulate total low and high streamflow individually outside the bayesian framework and individually and collectively under different bayesian formulation schemes in a relatively small basin and a relatively large basin respectively bayesian model parameter e g mean variance and regression model coefficients priors are the fundamental requirement for computing the posterior distribution that is needed to compute the predictive probability for bayesian predictions the posterior distribution is directly proportional to the product of the prior and the likelihood function the bayesian model parameter priors are selected either based on expert elicitation hoeting et al 1999 zellner 1986 which consists of expert beliefs and opinions based on previous data or experiments or based on ignorance in which case no prior knowledge exists and therefore model parameters are assumed to be equally likely fernandez et al 2001 ley et al 2012 the selection of the priors is subjective either way however including existing prior knowledge about model parameters would enhance model performance therefore the priors need to be carefully included in bayesian model averaging in order to get robust and reliable results in the face the already existing climate models uncertainty many different priors have been used in several hydrological studies bennett et al 2013 coelho et al 2004 obeysekera et al 2011 sanderson knutti 2012 tebaldi et al 2007 tebaldi et al 2005 westerberg et al 2016 the impacts of these priors on predictions of physical hydrologic processes however have not been properly investigated therefore the current study proposes and investigates a holistic process of selecting bayesian formulations including twelve combinations of widely used model and parameter priors these combinations of priors broadly fall into the two main categories of subjective and objective based bayesian prior selections selecting a bayesian formulation whose priors result in posterior inclusion probabilities of climate models inside the bayesian framework that are consistent with the performance of the corresponding models outside of the bayesian framework is important in ensuring physical processes to be properly captured specifically the aim of this study is to investigate the performance of rcms to simulate total low and high streamflow with respect to performance of individual rcms outside a bayesian framework which is assessed using three widely used assessment indices rmse pbias and index of agreement performance of individual rcms inside a bayesian framework which is assessed using marginal posterior density and posterior inclusion probability pip computed using bayesian formulation schemes the pip is a measure of the probability of a given rcm to reproduce the observed streamflow performance of bayesian averaged rcms under the bayesian formulation schemes which is assessed using pbias 2 methods 2 1 study area and source of streamflow data the two basins used in this study in a same region are cedar river basin near austin and rainy river at manitou rapids which are located in minnesota and have an area of 1500 km2 for the relatively small basin and 30 000 km2 for the relatively large basin respectively cedar and rainy river basins gauging stations are located at 92 97 43 64 and 95 54 44 72 respectively the long term 1968 1998 annual average rainfall for cedar and rainy basins are 834 and 671 mm whereas their respective long term total streamflow are 8 and 387 m3 s the daily observed total streamflow for the two basins are shown in fig 1 to conduct model averaging in a bayesian framework there is need for both observed streamflow dataset and climate model streamflow dataset the daily observed streamflow dataset for the two basins was obtained from united states geological survey usgs for the 1968 1998 time period the regional climate model rcm streamflow dataset of ten climate models was obtained from north american regional climate change assessment program narccap mearns et al 2012 which consists of global climate model gcm coupled with rcm and is gridded with spatial and temporal resolution of 50 km and 3 h respectively the narccap project was set up and implemented in two phases mearns et al 2009 the ten narccap rcms used in this study were developed by different research groups around the world at different time periods for consistent comparison these rcms have historical simulations from a common time period of 1968 to 1998 in north america narccap 2007 for the purposes of model comparison the period from 1968 to 1998 period is also used for historical simulations in this study the ten rcms gcm combinations that are used in this study are shown in table 1 five rcms are used including the canadian regional climate model crcm caya laprise 1999 music caya 2007 the scripps experimental climate prediction center regional spectral model ecp2 juang et al 1997 the fifth generation pennsylvania state university ncar mesoscale model mm5i grell et al 1994 the regional climate model version 3 rcm3 pal et al 2007 and the weather research and forecasting grell wrfg skamarock et al 2005 model the gcms used to drive the above rcms include the community climate system model ccsm collins et al 2006 the third generation coupled global climate model cgcm3 flato et al 2000 the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl model gfdl delworth et al 2006 and the hadley climate model hadcm3 pope et al 2000 the narccap rcm gcm combinations used in this study are shown in table 1 2 2 rcm grid based area weighted basin streamflow since the two case study river basins cedar and rainy have irregular shapes only the portions of the grids that cover the basins are considered when computing the streamflow from the basins the number of grids considered in the streamflow calculation depends on the size of the basin and the type of the rcm since the rcms have different geographical projections and thus not all of them are aligned the number of grids used in grid area weighted streamflow calculation for cedar river basin ranges from 2 to 6 grids whereas rainy river basin requires 24 28 grids once the number of grids and the grid areas that cover the basin are determined rcm based grid area weighted streamflow is computed as shown in the equation below 1 q i 1 n a i q i i 1 n a i where q i is the areal streamflow from i th rcm grid cell i 1 2 n n is the total number of grid cells interpolated and a i is the area of the i th grid that covers the basin table a1 in the appendix shows a sample of the grids used in the calculation of streamflow for the cedar river basin the daily rcm streamflow dataset was bias corrected by standardizing the dataset using equation 1 and reverting the standardized dataset back to the unstandardized dataset using eqs 2 and 3 below 2 y i y i Œº y œÉ y 3 y i œÉ o y i Œº o where y i is the rcm streamflow for day i y i is the bias corrected rcm streamflow for day i Œº y is the rcm mean daily streamflow for 1968 1998 time period œÉ y is the rcm standard deviation of daily streamflow for 1968 1998 time period Œº o is the observed mean daily streamflow for 1968 1998 time period and œÉ o is the observed standard deviation of daily streamflow for 1968 1998 time period 2 3 extreme streamflow low flow and high flow categories besides the total streamflow two categories of low flow and high flow are separately considered the low flow is defined as the 5th or the 10th percentile of the full record of the daily streamflow data on the other hand the high flow is defined as the 90th or the 95th percentile of daily streamflow record these extreme streamflow definitions are consistent with those in other studies blum et al 2018 chiew et al 2018 kocis dahlke 2017 richards 1990 visser et al 2017 and by the united states geological survey usgs 2019 therefore a total of five categories of flow are investigated in this study total streamflow high flow 90 100 high flow 95 100 low flow 0 5 and low flow 0 10 2 4 statistical performance indices the statistical performance indices used in this study include root mean square error rmse percent bias error pbias and index of agreement the rmse is a measure of goodness of fit with the same unit of the data that describes the error bias and variance between observed and simulated data legates et al 1999 index of agreement d 1 willmott 1982 willmott et al 1985 is also a measure of how well simulated streamflow agrees with observed streamflow with d 1 0 1 where 1 signifies perfect fit agreement while 0 denotes no fit modified form of d 1 which uses absolute deviation instead of squared deviation willmott 1984 willmott et al 2012 is used to avoid sensitivity to extreme values the pbias represents the deviation of the modeled from the measured streamflow gupta et al 1998 which accounts for the degree with which the climate models overestimate or underestimate the streamflow the positive and negative pbias values represent overestimation and estimation respectively the mathematical representations of the aforementioned performance indices can be found in the appendix 2 5 bayesian formulation schemes and bayesian regression models to average the streamflow data from the rcms in a bayesian framework prior probabilities need to be assigned to the regression models and to the parameters of regression models i e the intercept mean regression coefficient s and the standard deviation of regression model

regression model mj of observed streamflow y o onto kj regressors 0 kj k and each regressor having n observations is expressed as 4 y o i n Œº z j Œ≤ j œÉ Œµ where Œº is the intercept i n is the n dimensional vector of 1 s œÉ is the residual standard deviation Œµ is the ratio of residual over error that results from fitting the all regressors to the independent variable and is assumed to be independent and normally distributed with mean of zero and a variance of œÉ Œ≤ j is the kj dimensional vector of relevant regression coefficients z j is an n kj matrix that consists of columns of kj regressors x 1 x 2 x k j with each regressor having n observations note that the residual standard deviation œÉ of data yo given regressors in matrix z does not take subscript j because it is always determined by conditioning model mj on the entire set of k regressors and therefore œÉ is considered as a common regression parameter fern√°ndez et al 2001 across all the regression models the mpriors used in this study include discrete uniform distribution ley steel 2012 liang et al 2008a fixed model prior and random model prior zeugner 2011 zeugner feldkircher 2015 the g priors include the uniform information prior uip kass wasserman 1995 the bayesian risk information criterion bric fernandez et al 2001 hyper uip liang et al 2008b and the empirical bayes g local ebl cui george 2004 george foster 2000 g priors more information about the mpriors and g priors can be found in the appendix in this study a combination of an mprior and a g prior makes a bayesian formulation schemes the twelve bayesian formulation schemes that are used in this study are shown in table 2 2 6 posterior model probability of regression models posterior inclusion probability pip of regressors bayes

using the full regression equation that contains all the regressors 2 7 calibration and validation of the bayesian based models the bayesian based models are trained and calibrated before they are used in streamflow predictions the daily streamflow for 1968 1990 is used to train the bayesian based models which are then validated using the 1991 1998 daily streamflow dataset the training and validation are conducted for the total streamflow high flow and low flow 3 results 3 1 model calibration and validation results fig 2 shows the index of agreement d1 for the cedar river basin and rainy river basin for both model calibration and validation of the bayesian based streamflow models on the other hand fig 3 shows rmse in model calibration and validation phases for both basins even though the validation results have relatively lower d1 values than the calibration results these d1 values which are greater than 0 5 suggest that reasonable agreement exists between the models with the measured streamflow in the validation phase the results of calibration of the bayesian based streamflow models show that the models fit the observed streamflow data with d1 of at least 0 85 as shown in fig 2 for both cedar and rainy basins the strong model agreement with observed streamflow in calibration phase is further confirmed by the relatively low rmse of less than 0 5 mm across the flow regimes and in both basins as shown in fig 3 the corresponding model validation performance while having relatively lower d1 but of d1 0 7 and relatively higher rmse of up to 1 5 mm compared to the calibration phase also showed a high model agreement with the observed streamflow for both basins 3 2 climate model streamflow predictions performance metrics outside bayesian framework performance of rcm based simulated streamflow outside the bayesian framework is evaluated using three indices discussed earlier rmse index of agreement d 1 and percent bias error pbias the slope values obtained from regressing the observed streamflow onto each of the rcms indicate underestimation of total low and high streamflow as shown in tables 3 and 4 the rcms predict total and high flow regimes with strong low rmse as shown in fig 4 a for cedar river basin and fig 4b for rainy river basin the rmse shown in fig 4a and b for total and high flows varies from 1 0 to 3 9 mm across the rcms in the small basin and 1 to 2 mm for the large basin rcms simulated low flows in both basins have the rmse of less than 0 5 mm however the low flows are poorly predicted by the rcms in both river basins but high flows are predicted moderately with the d1 value of 0 35 to satisfactory well with the d1 value of 0 9 as shown in fig 4c and d fig 5 a and b show that the rcms can fairly well simulate the total flows in both basins even though the simulation strength varies with pbias of 0 to 25 for the large basin and pbias of 0 to 42 for the small basin both high flow regimes in the large and small basin are simulated pbias of 20 to 15 as shown in fig 5a and b the relatively large pbias values in fig 5c and d show that all the rcms have difficulty in simulating low flows in the small basin 3 3 climate model streamflow predictions performance metrics individually inside bayesian framework inside the bayesian framework the performance of rcm simulations is evaluated either individually by the posterior inclusion probability or collectively by the bma forecasts individually the performance of bias corrected rcms inside the bayesian framework is evaluated using the pip in the small basin the bayesian formulation schemes give consistent pip across the rcms except the three ebl empirical bayes g local based formulations which tend to give relatively higher pips than the rest of the formulations as shown in fig 6 similar pip patterns are shown for the high flows in the small basin as shown in fig 6 but with relatively higher variability in 90 100 percentile high flow than the 95 100 percentile high flow counterpart the low flows for both percentiles 0 5 and 0 10 on the other hand have very similar pip values across formulation schemes in the small basin as shown in fig 6 for 0 5 low flows in the small basin the ecp2 gfdl ecp2 hadcm3 and rcm3 cgcm3 have the highest pip of 0 7 1 and rcm3 gfdl and wrfg cgcm3 have 0 1 0 5 pip across the twelve bayesian formulation schemes as shown in fig 6 notice that only five and seven rcms in the cedar and rainy basins respectively are included in the bma for low flow since the remaining rcms have poor simulations as previously shown in their very weak correlation with the observed low flow in both basins as shown in tables 3 and 4 in the large basin the total streamflow has relatively less variable pip across the various prior formulation schemes with crcm ccsm crcm cgcm3 ecp2 gfdl mm5i hadcm3 and rcm3 cgcm3 having the highest pip values 0 9 and mm5i ccsm wrfg ccsm and wrfg cgcm3 having the lowest pip values of 0 5 as shown in fig 7 the large basin low flows 0 5 and high flows 95 100 also show consistent pip values across the bayesian formulation schemes as shown in fig 7 however there is very high variation in rcms pip values in both large basin 90 100 high flow and 0 10 low flow with pip values ranging from 0 1 to 1 in both cases as shown in fig 7 inside the bayesian framework the pip values only give us the strength but not the direction of correlation between the rcms and observed streamflow the marginal posterior density of the respective rcms is used to characterize the direction of correlation since plotting marginal posterior density graphs of each of the ten regressors and for each of the twelve bayesian formulation schemes and for the two basins would result in a large number of figures the regressors provided here are those that have the strongest positive negative and neither positive negative correlation with the observed total streamflow for one formulation scheme and for the two basins integrating the marginal posterior density graph of any given regressor produces the pip of that regressor which is also plotted on top of the graphs shown in figs 8 and 9 fig 8 shows that for the small basin the ecp2 gfdl has the strongest positive correlation since the entire marginal posterior density graph is on the positive portion of the x axis the wrfg cgcm3 has the strongest negative correlation since the graph falls on the negative scale and the mean regression coefficient is also negative the rcm3 gfdl has neither a strong positive or negative correlation with the observed total streamflow since the graph is neither shifted to left or to the right both ecp2 gfdl and wrfg cgcm3 have pip value of 1 indicating that both of them are strongly correlated with the observed streamflow even though they have different directions of correlation the rcm3 gfdl has a pip of 0 2 indicating a weak correlation with the observed total streamflow and a neutral direction of correlation seen in fig 8c the marginal posterior density graphs on fig 9 are for the large basin and the covariates that have positive negative and neither positive nor negative correlation with the observed streamflow are ecp2 gfdl crcm ccsm and wrfg cgcm3 respectively with the corresponding pip values of 1 1 and 0 02 respectively therefore the covariate with neither positive nor negative correlation i e wrfg cgcm3 with the observed streamflow has the lowest pip 3 4 climate model streamflow predictions performance metrics collectively inside bayesian framework collectively the performance of bayesian averaged rcms streamflow simulation inside the bayesian formulation schemes is assessed using the pbias the total high and low flows from the bma have pbias 1 across all the twelve formulation schemes and for the two basins as shown in fig 10 this is an indication that combining the rcms in a bayesian framework produces good streamflow simulations than any of the ten individual climate models used in this study however the bayesian formulation that gives good results that follow the physical process of the observed streamflow depends on the basin size and nature of flow event as demonstrated in figs 4 and 5 and tables 3 and 4 the total streamflow performance indices for the small basin outside the bayesian framework for the worst and the best performing rcms are wrfg cgcm3 pbias 42 d 0 58 and rmse 3 47 mm and ecp2 gfdl pbias 19 d 0 89 and rmse 1 07 mm respectively for the large basin the worst and the best performing rcms are wrfg ccsm pbias 12 d 0 456 and rmse 0 98 mm and ecp2 gfdl pbias 7 d 0 60 and rmse 0 61 mm respectively based on figs 6 and 7 within the bayesian framework non ebl based mean pip values for the corresponding rcms are respectively 0 76 wrfg cgcm3 and 0 97 ecp2 gfdl for small basin and respectively 0 12 wrfg ccsm and 1 00 ecp2 gfdl for the large basin figs 6 and 7 therefore show that the bayesian averaged total streamflow is best simulated by non ebl based bayesian formulations for both small and large basins since the rcm pip values are consistent with the rcm performance indices outside the bayesian framework however for the large basin ebl based formulations also give reasonable forecast for total streamflow since the variability of pip values from the mean pip value is small for each of the rcms as shown in fig 7 high flow is best simulated by non ebl based bayesian formulations except m random g hyper uip formulation which tends to give a relatively lower pip for the same rcm than the rest of the formulations as shown in fig 6 b c and fig 7 b c in the large basin high flow 95 100 for example the low pip values observed in m random g hyper uip formulation range from 0 02 for mm5i ccsm to 0 56 for rcm3 gfdl while its counterpart non ebl based formulation gives the corresponding rcms relatively higher values that range from a mean of pip of 0 1 for mm5i ccsm to 0 77 for rcm3 gfdl the corresponding performance of rcms outside the bayesian framework for the large basin high flow 95 100 range from d 0 42 pbias 15 and rmse 0 95 mm for mm5i ccsm to d 0 44 pbias 19 and rmse 0 75 mm for rcm3 gfdl the bma low flow is best simulated by both ebl based and none ebl based bayesian formulation as shown in fig 6 d e and fig 7 d e the mean pip values of bayesian formulations for the small basin low flow 0 5 range from 0 10 rcm3 gfdl to 1 0 ecp2 gfdl these pip values are consistent with the rcm low flow simulation performance outside bayesian framework which range from d 0 03 pbias 240 and rmse 0 24 mm for rcm3 gfdl to d 0 07 pbias 106 and rmse 0 11 mm for ecp2 gfdl however for the large basin wide percentile based low flow i e 0 10 is best simulated by non ebl based bayesian formulation as shown in fig 7e since the ebl based formulation give relatively large pip values which are non consistent with the rcm low flow performance indices outside bayesian framework 4 discussion 4 1 rcm performance outside and inside bayesian framework the rcms underestimate total streamflow high and low flows the underestimation of flow varies across the rcms as depicted by the difference in values of the rcms performance indices on average the total and high flows in the small basin are simulated with relatively larger errors than in the large basin model structure model parameters and input data are the main sources of error observed across the rcms streamflow simulations model structure based errors culminate from the fact that physical processes are incorporated into the rcm land surface models lsms in a simplified form e g only vertical flow is considered in lsm since they are 1 d physical soil column models and the lsms apply different model physics the ten rcms use three different lsms i e bats biosphere atmosphere transfer scheme yang dickinson 1996 class canadian land surface scheme verseghy 1991 and noah ek et al 2003 class is used in crcm ccsm and crcm cgcm3 bats is used in rcm3 cgcm3 and rcm3 gfdl whereas noah lsm is used in six rcms ecp2 gfdl ecp2 hadcm3 mm5i ccsm mm5i hadcm3 wrfg ccsm and wrfg cgcm3 model parameter based errors culminate from the high spatio temporal variability of many rcms lsm parameters e g soil snow land cover and slope that are used to simulate streamflow forcing data based errors originate from the multiple gcms forcing mejia 2010 that are used as the rcms lsm input data and that as a result affect streamflow output of the rcms besides the potential sources of errors discussed above the spatial variability in rcms streamflow simulation can also be attributed to the basin size difference and hydrological difference with respect to rainfall amount and streamflow between the two basins rainy basin requires 26 28 different grid cells to obtain the flow from the basin while cedar basin only requires 2 6 grid cells inside the bayesian framework performance of individual rcms streamflow simulation is gauged using pip and marginal posterior density not all of the bma formulations would give the rcm pips that are consistent with rcms streamflow performance indices outside bayesian framework this is the reason why ebl based formulation schemes i e m uniform g ebl m fixed g ebl and m random g ebl tend to give high 0 9 1 pip values when the rest of the formulation schemes give relatively lower pip values as shown in figs 6 and 7 this can be attributed to the fact that ebl g prior estimates g parameter for every regression model in the 2k regression model space based on the ordinary least square f statistics which is calculated as a function of r squared value of the respective regression models while its counterpart formulations use a constant g value across all the regression models 4 2 impact of low performance rcms on the bma prediction there are some bma formulations that award higher pip values to the rcms with lower performance outside the bayesian framework as discussed earlier in this section an assessment is done to show the inconsistency of some rcms performance inside the bayesian framework with respect to their performance outside the bayesian framework specifically evaluation is done on how the rmse of the bma streamflow prediction changes when one of the rcms is removed from the full bayesian regression model with all the ten rcms poor streamflow prediction and correlation with observed streamflow occurs if the rmse increases when an rcm is left out in the full bayesian regression model for prediction of streamflow in most cases the rmse increases the most in ebl based formulations compared to the rest of the formulations in the small basin s 90 100 high flow for example when wrfg ccsm is left out in the bma the ebl based formulations overestimate streamflow and the rmse values are larger than the rest of the formulations as shown in fig a1 a and b in the appendix the ebl based formulations have a mean rsme of 2 25 mm while the rest of the formulations have a mean rmse of 1 mm as shown in fig a1 b in the supplementary when wrfg ccsm is left out the larger rmse in addition to the higher pip value to wrfg ccsm by the ebl based formulations than the rest of the formulations is an indication that the ebl based formulations overall perform worse than the non ebl based formulations which highlights the need for consistency of rcms pip inside bayesian framework with rcms performance outside bayesian framework similar results are shown in the small basin high flow events 90 100 with greater rmse changes observed in the ebl based formulations than the rest of the formulations being observed when mm5i hadcm3 and rcm3 gfdl are left out the rmse values change the most in large basin low flow 0 10 when epc2 gfdl is left out as shown in fig a2 with the ebl based formulations having greater rmse than the rest of formulations the prior distribution regression coefficient also known as the g prior is a multivariate normal prior distribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation that is dependent on the value of g parameter fernandez et al 2001 the g prior is formulated in eq a5 zellner 1986 unlike the rest of the g priors regression coefficient priors the ebl priors compute the g parameter of the g prior locally for every regression model in the regression model space a standard f statistics value is computed for every regression model in the model space as shown in equation a11 and the f statistics is then used to compute the g parameter as shown in equation a10 the g parameter is in turn used to compute the prior density of regression coefficient of the corresponding regression model as shown in eq a5 therefore the ebl based formulation peeks into the data to compute the prior distribution of regression coefficients which violates the definition of prior distribution and awards higher pip values to the low performing rcms conversely a single computed g parameter is for and all the regression models in the non ebl based formulations in the uniform information prior uip for example the value of g parameter is determined as the number of observations per regressor kass et al 1995 as shown in eq a6 while in the bric prior the g parameter is the maximum between the number of observations and the square of the number of regressors as shown in eq a9 large basin high flow 95 100 seems to have consistent changes in the streamflow prediction and rmse across both the ebl based and non ebl based formulations when any of the rcms is left out therefore leaving out any of the rcms in the bayesian regression model does not cause significant changes in both rmse and streamflow prediction therefore the large basin high flow 95 100 can be reasonably predicted with both the ebl based and non ebl based formulations 5 conclusions the model distribution parameter priors are used to determine the posterior distribution which is used to compute the bma formulations of the streamflow priors affect the results of bma streamflow simulations evaluating the performance of the climate models both inside and outside the bayesian framework and examining their consistency is important in this study several common statistical indices were used to evaluate the performance of rcms individually and used the posterior inclusion probability and marginal posterior density to evaluate performance of rcms in streamflow simulations inside the bayesian framework the conclusions from this study can be summarized as follows there exists variability in streamflow simulation among the individual rcms both inside and outside the bayesian framework and therefore the need to match rcms performance inside and outside the bayesian framework to select the appropriate bma formulation the bma streamflow simulations are obviously better and more desirable than any of the individual rcms but the formulation chosen needs to assign posterior pips to the rcms that are consistent with the rcms performance outside bayesian framework otherwise bma formulation is at best an empirical technique to averages climate models to produce more desirable simulations that may follow the physical processes of the observed streamflow the choice of a bayesian prior varies with the type of a given hydrological phenomenon e g low verses high flow therefore care should be taken when selecting a bayesian prior to be used for averaging multi model hydrological predictions the size of hydrological system may influence the type of prior implemented in a bayesian framework even with only two basin sizes in this study there is significant difference on the bayesian prior suitability for the small verses the large basin declaration of competing interest the

6491,the sediment graph models are useful for computation of sediment yield as well as total sediment out flow from watershed in this study the analytical development of proposed sediment graph models is based on soil moisture accounting sma procedure coupled soil conservation service curve number scs cn method nash s instantaneous unit sediment graph iusg model and power law this coupling has led to the development of four sediment graph models sgms i e sma sgm1 sma sgm2 sma sgm 3 and sma sgm4 depending on the four different hydrologic conditions as i initial soil moisture v 0 0 and initial

validated sediment graphs further the performance of these models is also compared with the sediment graph model of bhunya et al 2010 bsgm on all the six study watersheds it is found that the proposed models perform very well in simulating sediment yield generation process for all the watersheds and show significant improvement over the bsgm model keywords soil moisture accounting sma scs cn method iusg nash model sediment graph 1 introduction time distributed sediment yield modeling has paramount importance in hydrology water resources and environmental engineering it has been recognized to be fundamental to a range of applications such as river morphology natural resource conservation planning land management soil and water conservation and agricultural and water resource planning the process of sediment yield generation is extremely complex and mainly consists of detachment and transport of sediment particles by raindrop and runoff tyagi et al 2008 the sediment yield modeling is more complex as compared to other types of watershed modeling as it arises from a complex interaction of several hydro geological processes and the knowledge of the actual process and extent of suspended materials is far less detailed bennett 1974 the sediment flow rate plotted as a function of time during a storm at a given location is known as sediment graph without a sediment graph only the average sediment rate for the storm can be computed the average sediment yield is not adequate for computing dynamic suspended sediment load and pollutants load during the storm raghuwansh et al 1994 rendon herrero 1978 developed a sediment graph model based on unit sediment graphs usg approach defined as the unit sediment graph generated from one unit of sediment for a given duration distributed uniformly over a watershed the sediment yield models can be classified into three groups 1 lumped 2 quasi lumped and 3 distributed singh et al 2015a 2015b probably the most widely used lumped model for estimating sediment yield from small agricultural watersheds agricultural forest and urban is the universal soil loss equation usle developed by wischmeier and smith 1978 to apply usle to large watersheds the concept of sediment delivery ratio ratio of sediment generated to the amount of erosion has been incorporated another lumped sediment yield model was developed by mishra et al 2006a 2006b by coupling the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method scs 1956 and usle later on a sediment yield was developed by tyagi et al 2008 by utilizing the scs cn based infiltration model for computation of rainfall excess rate and the scs cn inspired proportionality concept for computation of sediment excess singh et al 2008 and bhunya et al 2010 developed conceptual sediment graph models based on scs cn method nash s iusg and power law from an agricultural watershed the development of storm wise sediment graph model is a reasonable solution to understanding the complexities and to reducing the uncertainties however these models ignore the concept of soil moisture accounting sma in their formulation notably a sound sma has to incorporate all soil moisture conditions mishra and singh 2004 michel et al 2005 and kannan et al 2008 the sma procedure is based on the notion that higher the moisture store level higher is the fraction of rainfall that is converted into runoff michel et al 2005 camici et al 2011 termed it as design soil moisture and argued that it is the most important factor to determine the predictive outcome of an event de michele and salvadori 2002 brocca et al 2009 on the contrary however other investigations have inferred that it might be not so critical particularly in the case of large events bronstert and b√°rdossy 1999 castillo et al 2003 therefore looking into the importance of sediment graph based studies and sma concept in event based rainfall runoff sediment yield modeling this study aimed at 1 to develop improved sediment graph models sgms based on coupling of soil moisture accounting sma procedure in the scs cn method nash s iusg model and power law 2 to test the applicability of the proposed model by using data of six small watersheds and finally 3 to compare the performance of the proposed model with the existing bhunya et al 2010 sediment graph model bsgm 2 existing soil conservation service curve number scs cn method the scs cn method for computing storm runoff from event rainfall was developed by the soil conservation service scs of united states department of agriculture usda 1972 for the storm as a whole the depth of excess rainfall realizable as direct runoff q is always less than or equal to the depth of rainfall p likewise once runoff begins the additional depth of water retained in the watershed f is less than or equal to some potential maximum retention s there is some amount of rainfall ia initial abstraction before ponding for which no runoff will occur so the potential runoff is p ia the hypothesis underlying this method is that the ratio between the two corresponding actual quantities is the same as between the two corresponding potential quantities analytically the equations can be written as 1 p i a f q 2 q p i a f s 3 i a Œª s in which p is the rainfall mm q is the direct surface runoff mm f is the cumulative infiltration mm excluding ia the initial abstraction mm s is the potential maximum retention mm and Œª is the initial abstraction coefficient coupling eq 1 and eq 2 leads to the existing scs cn method as 4 q p i a 2 p i a s eq 4 is valid for p i a q 0 otherwise coupling of eq 4 with eq 3 for Œª 0 2 enables determination of s from the rainfall runoff data in practice s is derived from a mapping equation expressed in terms of

written as 6 q p 2 p s assume v0 represents the soil moisture storage level at the beginning of the storm event and v is the soil moisture storage at any time t if p and q are the accumulated rainfall

yields 9 v v 0 p s p s p s now the simplified form of the gr4j runoff model perrin et al 2003 can be expressed in cumulative form as 10 q p p e v s s a 2 p p e where pe is the potential evapotranspiration and is assumed negligible because the runoff from rainfall usually lasts for an event of sufficiently limited duration hence simplification of eq 10 yield 11 q p v s s a 2 eq 11 yields q p for v s s a as a maximum capacity of v where s a is an intrinsic parameter equal to s a v 0 i a threshold soil moisture substituting the expression for v from eq 9 into eq 11 and

depend on land use land cover soil characteristics individual storm events and climatic conditions were estimated for all the six watersheds it can be observed from table 5 the parameter Œ± varies from 0 377 to 0 917 from 0 006 to 0 823 from 0 003 to 0 849 and from 0 005 to 0 98 for sma sgm1 to sma sgm4 respectively accordingly Œ≤ varies from 0 019 to 0 995 from 0 013 to 0 989 from 0 039 to 0 808 and from 0 05 to 0 724 for sma sgm1 to sma sgm4 similarly k varies from 0 01e to 04 to 0 07 from 0 00 to 0 079 from 4e to 07 to 0 079 and from 0 00 to 0 80 for sma sgm1 to sma sgm4 respective models parameter Œ∏ varies from 0 004 to 0 05 and from 0 004 to 0 070 for sma sgm2 to sma sgm4 each of the models the computed parameters values are good agreement with mishra et al 2006a 2006b singh et al 2008 and bsgm models the parameter Œª varies from 0 009 to 0 133 and from 0 03 to 0 3 for sma sgm3 to sma sgm4 respective models a value of Œª 0 05 has also been supported for field use hawkins et al 2001 which can however vary from 0 to mishra and singh 1999 2003 2004 the optimized value of parameter s vary from 10 001 to 75 4 mm from 5 189 to 75 199 mm and from 11 942 to 85 099 mm respectively for sma sgm2 to sma sgm4 models as shown in table 5 during validation of the proposed models the nse varies from 67 89 to 99 56 67 11 to 99 56 67 57 to 99 52 and 66 81 to 99 53 for sma sgm1 to sma sgm4 respectively as shown in table 6 the validation of the models re of total sediment outflow kn it varies from 0 75 to 24 11 for sma sgm1 from 0 89 to 27 19 for sma sgm2 from 2 82 to 23 81 for sma sgm3 from 0 93 to 26 34 for sma sgm4 respectively therefore the re of peak sediment outflow rate kn h it varies from 0 29 to 32 93 for sma sgm1 from 0 57 to 31 56 for sma sgm2 from 1 72 to 39 08 for sma sgm3 from 0 0 to 33 93 for sma sgm4 respectively similarly the re of time to peak sediment outflow h it varies from 33 33 to 0 0 for sma sgm1 to sma sgm4 respectively the re of the proposed model and bsgm model it varies from similar to calibration events from all application of the watersheds it can be observed that a graphical representation of the observed sediment graph and computed sediment graphs also indicated a good agreement between the proposed model and observed sediment graph for the validation events fig 3 form the computed and observed sediment graphs results are discussed above it is evident that the proposed sediment graph models for all the events the resulting nse in both model calibration and validation were reasonably high to indicate the satisfactorily model performance to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model to the ungauged watershed sediment graph were computed for the nineteen storm events with all model parameters are predicted it is seen in table 6 the total computed sediment flow rate and observed sediment flow rate computed peak sediment flow rate and observed sediment flow rate computed time to peak and observed time to peak are more accurate results of the observed and computed of the proposed sma sgms therefore both calibration and validation events are plotted between line of perfect fit lpf of computed sediment yield and observed sediment yield the closeness of data point in calibration and validation of the model it indicate the good agreement of all applications of the models performance as shown in fig 4 appendix b fig 4b the sediment producing characteristics of the watersheds have been subjected to change by the land use treatments and soil conservation measures taken in the watershed in sequence to estimate the effect of soil conservation measures on sediment flow the proposed sma sgms shows in calibration and validation of the models in definite trend in attenuation of crest segments and peak ordinates during the nineteen storm events for successive years in the present study several types of sma sgms were developed for the india watershed and usda ars watershed and their efficacies were evaluated using various statistical indices and the corresponding results were then interpreted the proposed sma sgms have substantial potential for computing sediment graphs temporal sediment flow rate distribution as well as total sediment yield from the both gauged and ungauged watersheds furthermore these models will be very useful in those cases where the larger part of the sediment is generated by few high storm events which are difficult to measure in field conditions in case of un gauged watersheds these models require only the salient points of the sediment graph in terms of qps and tps which can be derived using the shape factor Œ≤s ns and ks singh et al 2013 5 4 comparative analysis between proposed sma sgm and bsgm models the comparative analysis between sma sgm and bsgm models the calibration and validation of the models of observed and computed total sediment outflow kn observed and computed peak sediment flow rate kn h and observed and computed time to peak sediment outflow h is shown in appendix a table 7 it is seen from the computation results of both calibration and validation event appendix a table 7 the bsgm overestimate the total sediment flow rate and peak sediment flow rate for the karso banha and mansara watersheds and rest of underestimate for all applications of the watersheds therefore visual representation between computed sediment flow rate kn h and observed sediment flow rate from nineteen storm events are plotted as shown in figs 5 and 6 appendix b figs 5b and 6b it can be observed that the proposed sma sgms in calibration events fig 2 it compute higher sediment flow rate kn h as compared to calibration events fig 5 of bsgm the results obtained from the proposed sma sgms show that these models are more efficient as compared to bsgm the model performance of calibration and validation events of proposed sma sgms and bsgm are presented in appendix a tables 7a and 8a therefore it observed that from appendix a table 7a the proposed sma sgm performs consistently better than bsgm for all applications of the storm events on the basis of statistical indices the nse of bsgm is lower than proposed sma sgm similarly the re of bsgm is higher than proposed sma sgms as shown in appendix a table 8a further as can be observed that from appendix a table 8a the average nse of proposed sma sgms of karso banha and mansara watersheds are 83 57 86 17 and 85 05 comprising land uses such as forest agriculture waste land grass pasture and open scrub similarly the average nse of proposed sma sgms of w6 w7 and w14 goodwin creek watersheds are 82 16 91 42 and 80 33 comprising forest agriculture grass pasture and fallow hence it can be observed that in w7 goodwin creek watershed the model performance is higher as compared to other watersheds it is reason that the w7 goodwin creek watershed have maximum grass pasture land use cover as compared to other watersheds the sediment flow rate is varying according to several types of slopes soil types landuse landcover and hydrological condition of the watershed the proposed sma sgms produce the higher sediment graphs as well as sediment yield as compare to bsgm clay soil have higher resistance to the sediment yield that covers maximum area than the other types of the soil therefore the clay soil have the more porosity the above discussion of the soil and land use and hydrological condition of the watershed it evidence of the proposed sma sgms is higher sediment flow rate predict or sediment yield from watersheds as compare to bsgm it can be observed that from table 3 appendix a table 3a table 4 appendix a table 4a and fig 2 appendix b fig 2b that the initial soil moisture v0 has major impact and the initial abstraction ia has the lowest impact on computation of sediment graph as compared to the other parameters of all the four sma sgm1 to sma sgm4 models 6 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn from the proposed sma sgms as given below 1 the analytical development of the sediment graph models is proposed by incorporating simple and highly used models such as sma scs cn nash s iusg and power law for computation of sediment graphs 2 the proposed model is conceptually and hydrologically sound for computation of sediment graphs as well as the total sediment yield from the small watershed 3 in validation of the model the resulting nse of improved sediment graph models it varies from 67 89 to 99 56 67 11 to 99 56 67 57 to 99 52 and 66 81 to 99 53 for sgm1 to sma sgm4respective models and therefore calibration of the model the resulting nse it varies from 65 67 to 99 56 73 19 to 99 81 57 73 to 99 75 and 66 39 to 99 86 for sma sgm1 to sma sgm4 4 the proposed model performs consistently

validated sediment graphs further the performance of these models is also compared with the sediment graph model of bhunya et al 2010 bsgm on all the six study watersheds it is found that the proposed models perform very well in simulating sediment yield generation process for all the watersheds and show significant improvement over the bsgm model keywords soil moisture accounting sma scs cn method iusg nash model sediment graph 1 introduction time distributed sediment yield modeling has paramount importance in hydrology water resources and environmental engineering it has been recognized to be fundamental to a range of applications such as river morphology natural resource conservation planning land management soil and water conservation and agricultural and water resource planning the process of sediment yield generation is extremely complex and mainly consists of detachment and transport of sediment particles by raindrop and runoff tyagi et al 2008 the sediment yield modeling is more complex as compared to other types of watershed modeling as it arises from a complex interaction of several hydro geological processes and the knowledge of the actual process and extent of suspended materials is far less detailed bennett 1974 the sediment flow rate plotted as a function of time during a storm at a given location is known as sediment graph without a sediment graph only the average sediment rate for the storm can be computed the average sediment yield is not adequate for computing dynamic suspended sediment load and pollutants load during the storm raghuwansh et al 1994 rendon herrero 1978 developed a sediment graph model based on unit sediment graphs usg approach defined as the unit sediment graph generated from one unit of sediment for a given duration distributed uniformly over a watershed the sediment yield models can be classified into three groups 1 lumped 2 quasi lumped and 3 distributed singh et al 2015a 2015b probably the most widely used lumped model for estimating sediment yield from small agricultural watersheds agricultural forest and urban is the universal soil loss equation usle developed by wischmeier and smith 1978 to apply usle to large watersheds the concept of sediment delivery ratio ratio of sediment generated to the amount of erosion has been incorporated another lumped sediment yield model was developed by mishra et al 2006a 2006b by coupling the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method scs 1956 and usle later on a sediment yield was developed by tyagi et al 2008 by utilizing the scs cn based infiltration model for computation of rainfall excess rate and the scs cn inspired proportionality concept for computation of sediment excess singh et al 2008 and bhunya et al 2010 developed conceptual sediment graph models based on scs cn method nash s iusg and power law from an agricultural watershed the development of storm wise sediment graph model is a reasonable solution to understanding the complexities and to reducing the uncertainties however these models ignore the concept of soil moisture accounting sma in their formulation notably a sound sma has to incorporate all soil moisture conditions mishra and singh 2004 michel et al 2005 and kannan et al 2008 the sma procedure is based on the notion that higher the moisture store level higher is the fraction of rainfall that is converted into runoff michel et al 2005 camici et al 2011 termed it as design soil moisture and argued that it is the most important factor to determine the predictive outcome of an event de michele and salvadori 2002 brocca et al 2009 on the contrary however other investigations have inferred that it might be not so critical particularly in the case of large events bronstert and b√°rdossy 1999 castillo et al 2003 therefore looking into the importance of sediment graph based studies and sma concept in event based rainfall runoff sediment yield modeling this study aimed at 1 to develop improved sediment graph models sgms based on coupling of soil moisture accounting sma procedure in the scs cn method nash s iusg model and power law 2 to test the applicability of the proposed model by using data of six small watersheds and finally 3 to compare the performance of the proposed model with the existing bhunya et al 2010 sediment graph model bsgm 2 existing soil conservation service curve number scs cn method the scs cn method for computing storm runoff from event rainfall was developed by the soil conservation service scs of united states department of agriculture usda 1972 for the storm as a whole the depth of excess rainfall realizable as direct runoff q is always less than or equal to the depth of rainfall p likewise once runoff begins the additional depth of water retained in the watershed f is less than or equal to some potential maximum retention s there is some amount of rainfall ia initial abstraction before ponding for which no runoff will occur so the potential runoff is p ia the hypothesis underlying this method is that the ratio between the two corresponding actual quantities is the same as between the two corresponding potential quantities analytically the equations can be written as 1 p i a f q 2 q p i a f s 3 i a Œª s in which p is the rainfall mm q is the direct surface runoff mm f is the cumulative infiltration mm excluding ia the initial abstraction mm s is the potential maximum retention mm and Œª is the initial abstraction coefficient coupling eq 1 and eq 2 leads to the existing scs cn method as 4 q p i a 2 p i a s eq 4 is valid for p i a q 0 otherwise coupling of eq 4 with eq 3 for Œª 0 2 enables determination of s from the rainfall runoff data in practice s is derived from a mapping equation expressed in terms of curve number cn 5 s 25400 c n 254 the non dimensional cn is derived from the tables given in the national engineering handbook section 4 neh 4 scs 1956 for catchment characteristics such as land use types of soil antecedent moisture condition amc the cn values vary from 0 to 100 the higher the cn value the greater the runoff factor c or runoff potential of the watersheds and vice versa sahu et al

written as 6 q p 2 p s assume v0 represents the soil moisture storage level at the beginning of the storm event and v is the soil moisture storage at any time t if p and q are the accumulated rainfall and corresponding runoff then the following expressions can be easily obtained as michel et al 2005 7 v v 0 p q coupling of eq 6 and eq 7 yields 8 v v 0 p p 2 p s a further simplification of eq 8 yields 9 v v 0 p s p s p s now the simplified form of the gr4j runoff model perrin et al 2003 can be expressed in cumulative form as 10 q p p e v s s a 2 p p e where pe is the potential evapotranspiration and is assumed negligible because the runoff from rainfall usually lasts for an event of sufficiently limited duration hence simplification of eq 10 yield 11 q p v s s a 2 eq 11 yields q p for v s s a as a maximum capacity of v where s a is an intrinsic parameter equal to s a v 0 i a threshold soil moisture substituting the expression for v from eq 9 into eq 11 and simplifying yields 12 q p v 0 p s p s p s s s a 2 threshold soil moisture s a is defined as growing linearly with initial soil moisture and initial abstraction it is mathematically expressed as michel

depend on land use land cover soil characteristics individual storm events and climatic conditions were estimated for all the six watersheds it can be observed from table 5 the parameter Œ± varies from 0 377 to 0 917 from 0 006 to 0 823 from 0 003 to 0 849 and from 0 005 to 0 98 for sma sgm1 to sma sgm4 respectively accordingly Œ≤ varies from 0 019 to 0 995 from 0 013 to 0 989 from 0 039 to 0 808 and from 0 05 to 0 724 for sma sgm1 to sma sgm4 similarly k varies from 0 01e to 04 to 0 07 from 0 00 to 0 079 from 4e to 07 to 0 079 and from 0 00 to 0 80 for sma sgm1 to sma sgm4 respective models parameter Œ∏ varies from 0 004 to 0 05 and from 0 004 to 0 070 for sma sgm2 to sma sgm4 each of the models the computed parameters values are good agreement with mishra et al 2006a 2006b singh et al 2008 and bsgm models the parameter Œª varies from 0 009 to 0 133 and from 0 03 to 0 3 for sma sgm3 to sma sgm4 respective models a value of Œª 0 05 has also been supported for field use hawkins et al 2001 which can however vary from 0 to mishra and singh 1999 2003 2004 the optimized value of parameter s vary from 10 001 to 75 4 mm from 5 189 to 75 199 mm and from 11 942 to 85 099 mm respectively for sma sgm2 to sma sgm4 models as shown in table 5 during validation of the proposed models the nse varies from 67 89 to 99 56 67 11 to 99 56 67 57 to 99 52 and 66 81 to 99 53 for sma sgm1 to sma sgm4 respectively as shown in table 6 the validation of the models re of total sediment outflow kn it varies from 0 75 to 24 11 for sma sgm1 from 0 89 to 27 19 for sma sgm2 from 2 82 to 23 81 for sma sgm3 from 0 93 to 26 34 for sma sgm4 respectively therefore the re of peak sediment outflow rate kn h it varies from 0 29 to 32 93 for sma sgm1 from 0 57 to 31 56 for sma sgm2 from 1 72 to 39 08 for sma sgm3 from 0 0 to 33 93 for sma sgm4 respectively similarly the re of time to peak sediment outflow h it varies from 33 33 to 0 0 for sma sgm1 to sma sgm4 respectively the re of the proposed model and bsgm model it varies from similar to calibration events from all application of the watersheds it can be observed that a graphical representation of the observed sediment graph and computed sediment graphs also indicated a good agreement between the proposed model and observed sediment graph for the validation events fig 3 form the computed and observed sediment graphs results are discussed above it is evident that the proposed sediment graph models for all the events the resulting nse in both model calibration and validation were reasonably high to indicate the satisfactorily model performance to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model to the ungauged watershed sediment graph were computed for the nineteen storm events with all model parameters are predicted it is seen in table 6 the total computed sediment flow rate and observed sediment flow rate computed peak sediment flow rate and observed sediment flow rate computed time to peak and observed time to peak are more accurate results of the observed and computed of the proposed sma sgms therefore both calibration and validation events are plotted between line of perfect fit lpf of computed sediment yield and observed sediment yield the closeness of data point in calibration and validation of the model it indicate the good agreement of all applications of the models performance as shown in fig 4 appendix b fig 4b the sediment producing characteristics of the watersheds have been subjected to change by the land use treatments and soil conservation measures taken in the watershed in sequence to estimate the effect of soil conservation measures on sediment flow the proposed sma sgms shows in calibration and validation of the models in definite trend in attenuation of crest segments and peak ordinates during the nineteen storm events for successive years in the present study several types of sma sgms were developed for the india watershed and usda ars watershed and their efficacies were evaluated using various statistical indices and the corresponding results were then interpreted the proposed sma sgms have substantial potential for computing sediment graphs temporal sediment flow rate distribution as well as total sediment yield from the both gauged and ungauged watersheds furthermore these models will be very useful in those cases where the larger part of the sediment is generated by few high storm events which are difficult to measure in field conditions in case of un gauged watersheds these models require only the salient points of the sediment graph in terms of qps and tps which can be derived using the shape factor Œ≤s ns and ks singh et al 2013 5 4 comparative analysis between proposed sma sgm and bsgm models the comparative analysis between sma sgm and bsgm models the calibration and validation of the models of observed and computed total sediment outflow kn observed and computed peak sediment flow rate kn h and observed and computed time to peak sediment outflow h is shown in appendix a table 7 it is seen from the computation results of both calibration and validation event appendix a table 7 the bsgm overestimate the total sediment flow rate and peak sediment flow rate for the karso banha and mansara watersheds and rest of underestimate for all applications of the watersheds therefore visual representation between computed sediment flow rate kn h and observed sediment flow rate from nineteen storm events are plotted as shown in figs 5 and 6 appendix b figs 5b and 6b it can be observed that the proposed sma sgms in calibration events fig 2 it compute higher sediment flow rate kn h as compared to calibration events fig 5 of bsgm the results obtained from the proposed sma sgms show that these models are more efficient as compared to bsgm the model performance of calibration and validation events of proposed sma sgms and bsgm are presented in appendix a tables 7a and 8a therefore it observed that from appendix a table 7a the proposed sma sgm performs consistently better than bsgm for all applications of the storm events on the basis of statistical indices the nse of bsgm is lower than proposed sma sgm similarly the re of bsgm is higher than proposed sma sgms as shown in appendix a table 8a further as can be observed that from appendix a table 8a the average nse of proposed sma sgms of karso banha and mansara watersheds are 83 57 86 17 and 85 05 comprising land uses such as forest agriculture waste land grass pasture and open scrub similarly the average nse of proposed sma sgms of w6 w7 and w14 goodwin creek watersheds are 82 16 91 42 and 80 33 comprising forest agriculture grass pasture and fallow hence it can be observed that in w7 goodwin creek watershed the model performance is higher as compared to other watersheds it is reason that the w7 goodwin creek watershed have maximum grass pasture land use cover as compared to other watersheds the sediment flow rate is varying according to several types of slopes soil types landuse landcover and hydrological condition of the watershed the proposed sma sgms produce the higher sediment graphs as well as sediment yield as compare to bsgm clay soil have higher resistance to the sediment yield that covers maximum area than the other types of the soil therefore the clay soil have the more porosity the above discussion of the soil and land use and hydrological condition of the watershed it evidence of the proposed sma sgms is higher sediment flow rate predict or sediment yield from watersheds as compare to bsgm it can be observed that from table 3 appendix a table 3a table 4 appendix a table 4a and fig 2 appendix b fig 2b that the initial soil moisture v0 has major impact and the initial abstraction ia has the lowest impact on computation of sediment graph as compared to the other parameters of all the four sma sgm1 to sma sgm4 models 6 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn from the proposed sma sgms as given below 1 the analytical development of the sediment graph models is proposed by incorporating simple and highly used models such as sma scs cn nash s iusg and power law for computation of sediment graphs 2 the proposed model is conceptually and hydrologically sound for computation of sediment graphs as well as the total sediment yield from the small watershed 3 in validation of the model the resulting nse of improved sediment graph models it varies from 67 89 to 99 56 67 11 to 99 56 67 57 to 99 52 and 66 81 to 99 53 for sgm1 to sma sgm4respective models and therefore calibration of the model the resulting nse it varies from 65 67 to 99 56 73 19 to 99 81 57 73 to 99 75 and 66 39 to 99 86 for sma sgm1 to sma sgm4 4 the proposed model performs consistently better than bsgm from all twenty events the basis of statistical indices the nse of bsgm is lower than proposed models and similarly the re of bsgm is higher than proposed models conflict of interest

6492,the intensification of flooding in urban areas and the management of susceptibility areas has become a global issue and has been the subject of several studies in recent decades the integration of alternative approaches such as socio hydrological and socio technological sciences has gained prominence in urban space planning and development the mapping of environmental susceptibility represents a promising alternative for the integrated management of natural disasters however for this to be used as a socio technological tool transiting to a participative management of urban environment it is necessary to simplify and reduce the associated costs in this sense the objective of this study was to propose a socio technological tool for the punctual and spatial mapping of the susceptibility to the occurrence of flooding in urban regions the method is designed to combine ease and low cost of application with a simplified but physically sensitive socio hydrological assessment of eight factors of influence the methodological tool was tested in a brazilian district where entire socio hydrological scenario of urban flooding in developing countries is observed the results show that the method can provide a simple and consistent view reaching an overall accuracy of 73 67 of the flooding points in general the method provides information that can support decision making by government agencies in developed and developing countries as well as civil society in relation to participatory urban zoning drainage management and water conservation keywords flooding mapping social hydrological tool socio technological tool urban drainage flooding susceptibility 1 introduction the number of occurrences and people affected by flooding events has gained notoriety in recent years due to unplanned urbanization anthropogenic changes in the environment and consequent regional climate changes extreme precipitation events have been intensifying the occurrence of flooding around the world duan et al 2016 yannopoulos et al 2013 united nations office for disaster risk reduction unisdr reported more than 100 flooding events worldwide between 1980 and 2008 resulting in approximately 6700 deaths duan et al 2016 estimates suggest that about 40 of flooding and associated economic losses are attributable to urban floods defra 2015 although there are many different concepts of flooding most authors agree that urban flooding is due to extrapolation of capacity of drainage systems and watercourses thereby accumulating water in backyards streets sidewalks or other urban infrastructure in the urban flooding case impacts go far beyond watersheds and territorial administrative units changes in land use affect the whole process of infiltration and storage of cities transferring the problem to stormwater drainage system cnt 2014 most of the time precipitated water does not impact the place of origin affecting areas downstream of cities where the drainage system is deficient or is non existent the planning and management of infrastructure and their respective impacts in terms of understanding and quantifying flooding risks in urban areas is still incipient pant et al 2018 these problems become more critical in developing countries where flooding disaster management is mainly reactive and flooding planning receives more attention from local authorities only after extreme events fadel et al 2018 lack of planning and investment in protection and defence against flooding compromises stormwater management bringing significant economic and social consequences in these countries management activities are managed only by the government which due to lack of financial resources and low prioritization of stormwater issue makes sanitation management deficient limiting the maintenance and expansion of services howard and bartram 2005 tingsanchali 2012 in brazil the fifth largest country in the world in territorial extension and population considered an emerging power with the eighth largest economy in the world this situation is no different sanitation management in brazil is still in process of treating sewage leaving aside the stormwater issue tasca et al 2018 which is treated with a hygienist perspective this is based on assumption that drainage is necessary leading to flow through pipe as quickly as possible increasing the magnitude and frequency of flooding in downstream urban areas souza et al 2013 garcia and paiva 2006 mention that a large number of brazilian municipalities face problems of urban flooding due to lack of planning and investment in stormwater drainage sector in the last decade approximately 1 300 people lost their lives as a result of urban flooding with economic losses reaching almost u 2 8 billion for the same period emergency expenditures were significantly higher than the resource invested in preventive measures by the various federal budget rubrics sprissler 2011 among the reasons for this bad scenario we highlight the predominance of emergency relief actions rather than prevention measures thus preventive adaptation measures e g resilient drainage projects urban planning for floodplains preservation early warning systems and awareness campaigns are not widely recognized in brazil as well as in other developing countries for example senegal lebanon mauritius

susceptible to urban flooding is presented and analysed 2 1 imaai method the imaai method consists of analysis tabulation and weighting of eight factors that condition flooding process in urban regions reproducing the occurrence susceptibility with different intensities in punctual and or spatial form the method was developed based in the following basic requirements low cost and easy application not require personnel highly specialized in computational systems and gis but of minimum knowledge of the conditioners of urban flooding process be credible ensuring answers close to those obtained by already established techniques suitable for use on an urban scale including micro drainage network and the presence of compensatory techniques or best management practice structures imaai method is composed for 5 steps where all the spatial complexity of factors is simplified into a susceptibility scale schematic layout of imaai method steps is shown in fig 2 step 1 choice of study area imaai method does not present restrictions being applicable anywhere step 2 identification of influence factors focus of method is mapping flooding associated mainly with drainage network to achieve this goal we adopted 8 influence factors altimetry land use hydrography annual mean precipitation soil type slope drainage network and compensatory structures factors adopted were selected from a literature review of similar studies by caprario et al 2017 encompassing period from 2006 to 2015 in general 34 factors that influence the flooding susceptibility mapping were found varying as study objective method adopted and application focus fig 3 due to the great number of factors found a relevance line was drawn defining as factors of influence for this study those that present 15 or more repetitions this line was drawn conform to focus of application of study aiming at mapping areas susceptible to flooding occurrence in urban regions associated mainly to drainage network in addition to the factors with more of 15 repetitions the drainage network factors and compensatory techniques were also adopted covering the study focus it should be noted that there is not a specific factor that characterizes accurately urban flooding areas although the combination of several environmental and anthropogenic factors is more suitable each influence factor was sub classified according to the different types and characteristics of the site for example the land use factor is represented by different coverings within a region and can be sub classified as forest cover water body urbanization undergrowth or other step 3 construction of classes weighting table factors and their respective classes are inserted into a simple table composed of three columns e g table 1 the weights of each class are established based on brazilian classes weighting table appendix b weights established in this table vary between 0 and 10 representing the degree of influence that each class within its respective factor exerts on occurrence or not of flooding for example weight 0 refers to the class that has minimum or no influence on flooding occurrence for application of imaai method in other countries it is necessary to adapt the classes weighting table associating existing classes by similarity or defining new classes and weights by literature review focused in the description of local environmental attributes step 4 sum of weights sum of all the minimum and maximum factor weights establishes limits of local susceptibility scale step 5 construction of the local scale local susceptibility scale is fragmented into four ranges of susceptibility with distinct intervals intervals correspond to 50 10 15 and 25 of values representing low moderate high and extremely high susceptibility respectively fig 4 this classification allows a better distribution of results avoiding overestimation of areas with extremely high susceptibility and underestimation of areas with low susceptibility the suggested scale initially had 4 equivalent intervals i e intervals with the same size in visual presentation of results it was verified that areas classified as low susceptibility were underestimated necessitating an adjustment in intervals tests of classification were performed adjusting intervals based on locations of known susceptibility areas the intervals tested in the susceptibility classification for ideal setting are shown in table 2 2 2 application scenarios 2 2 1 specific point scenarios major application of imaai method is to consider flooding at a point scenario for example a street intersection where the storm drains is damaged or poorly dimensioned in this case each influence factor has only one reference class used to determine a local susceptibility index this index is compared to local scale constructed in step 5 defining the range of susceptibility to occurrence of flooding over interest point 2 2 2 map scenarios the secondary approach to using the imaai method is to consider flooding susceptibility in a map scenario for example a district or city with physical features that increase naturally the susceptibility to the occurrence of flooding in this case instead of a point susceptibility index as described in the specific point scenarios this application can provide a spatial distribution of all areas potentially susceptible to flooding based on the overlap of the eight layers of influence factors this allows the effective quantification of the susceptibility to the occurrence of flooding in a city favouring a complete analysis of possible actions to be adopted although the main idea behind the development of the imaai method is not the application in mapping scenarios since a relatively similar procedure can be performed using already established techniques of geoprocessing e g the ahp gis composition its applicability to complex scenarios proves to be extremely efficient in terms of computational effort and realistic representation of the areas of susceptibility in very large regions and in a short time 3 application the proposed method was applied in three points of test located in campeche district in the southern region of florian√≥polis city sc brazil all points are constantly affected by urban flooding caused by non existent or poorly sized drainage networks a system characterized as absolute separator the location of the three points of test is shown in fig 5 a 3 1 points of test 3 1 1 point 1 the first point of test is located in the northern portion of the campeche district fig 5b the constant events occurring at this point is directly related to the absence of a stormwater collection system along with waterproofing and the presence of the tavares river this region is still strongly influenced by environmental characteristics mainly in relation to the presence of hydrographic basins mangrove vegetation and direct influence of tidal elevation 3 1 2 point 2 the second point of test is located in the central portion of the campeche district fig 5c the constant events occurring at this point is directly related to the absence of a stormwater collection system since these streets are partially paved 3 1 3 point 3 the third point of test is located in the southern portion of the campeche district fig 5d the main access route in the region has partial coverage of the drainage network basically composed of infiltration wells that overflowing with intense rains flooding transversal streets with smaller slope in addition at the point of test there are not compensatory structures and there is also no drainage system because it is not paved for all points information of the eight influence factors was identified through a spatial database constructed for the campeche district in addition the same information was investigated in loco standard procedure for application of the imaai method the information that composes the database referring to the eight influence factors was collected from previous studies as shown in table 3 3 2 benchmarking performance one of the most important steps in the mapping process is performance assessment of the method used the objective of this step is to quantitatively assess the efficiency of the representation of the method besides pegging and quantify mapping errors karan and samadder 2016 performance of imaai method is evaluated using a confusion or error matrix in this method a simple cross tabulation of the labels of the susceptibility classes mapped predicted data rows against that observed in reference data true data columns is employed a map of susceptibility to the urban flooding for the campeche district proposed by caprario et al 2019 was used as reference data to classify the points created and to evaluate the similarity with the map produced by the imaai method the reference data was adopted because the map was generated by a state of the art method ahp gis that uses urban drainage network and compensatory techniques associated as influence factors besides those traditionally used land use altimetry slope and soil type for the extraction of the pixel data from each map and subsequent similarity comparison a total of 37 470 points one point for each pixel were created arcgis 10 1 was used for benchmarking performance moreover this study considered other metric derived from the error matrix including errors of commission type i error errors of omission type ii error accuracy of the user false positive accuracy of the producer false negative and a kappa coefficient the kappa coefficient analysis is a discrete multivariate technique used to indicate the measure of agreement between data which considers beyond the simple proportion observed the proportion of agreement expected by chance baeza et al 2016 the kappa coefficient Œ∫ was calculated using eq 1 1 Œ∫ n i 1 r x ii i 1 r x i x i n 2 i 1 r x i x i where r is the number of row in confusion matrix xii is the number of row i and column i xi and x i are the total of row i and column i and n is the number of observations kappa coefficient has a range from 1 to 1 with larger values indicating almost perfect concordance in order to maintain consistent nomenclature of the kappa statistics the categorization of the labels assigned to the coefficient ranges will follow those introduced by landis and koch 1977 and reproduced in table 4 4 results and discussions 4 1 susceptibility in specific point scenarios the classes and weights for each influence factor identified in campeche district table 5 scenario of the three test points is the result of steps 2 and 3 the susceptibility scale of the campeche district constructed is shown in fig 6 and is the results of steps 4 and 5 classes and weights that represent eight influence factors for each test point are shown in table 6 it is possible to observe that identification of the eight factors classes can be used in a simple and quick way to characterize the susceptibility of flooding occurrences in each test point allowing analysis of influence between the factors for example point 2 shows a strongly undulating terrain slope ranging from 20 to 45 reducing the range of susceptibility classified as extremely high to only high furthermore the classification determined by the comparison between the index and local susceptibility scale 53 points equal to high susceptibility and 59 points equal to extremely high susceptibility confirms the constant flooding events observed at the points of test it is interesting to note how the susceptibility index remained the same for point 1 and point 3 although the average precipitation at point 3 was higher this fact may be related to land use which is characterized by intense urbanization in point 1 and bare land in point 3 4 2 susceptibility in map scenarios to visually represent the susceptibility to flooding occurrence in all areas of the campeche district the imaai method was applied considering a map scenario composed of multiple points of test shown in fig 7 and table 7 before discussing the results it is important to remember that the susceptibility determined by the imaai method in map scenarios is affected by the spatial representation quality of eight influence factors as mentioned in applications a spatial database was built for the campeche district however these spatial data are not always updated and can generate divergence with the real situation therefore the presented results should be analysed conceptually before drawing conclusions about the real conditions of susceptibility in the area several interesting considerations can be drawn from results first susceptibility map shows that high and extremely high susceptibility ranges are evidenced basically in all flat land area this fact can be justified by presence of low slopes existence of a free surface aquifer and rapid elevation of the water table by soil saturation during periods of higher rainfall cunha et al 2012 in addition the map provides information that cannot be extracted by visual observation alone as can be seen in table 7 areas with low and moderate susceptibility together represent approximately 49 of the total area of the district due to the number of factors of influence considered it is not possible to identify a direct relationship only tendencies that justify this classification for example susceptibility to flooding reduces in areas where there is a drainage network associated with compensatory structures the same is true for high slope areas such as at the top of hills where susceptibility is classified as low it is important to note that a point to point analysis of susceptibility in map scenarios would require the treatment of a large amount of information with probability of errors related to outdated information however the application of tools in the updated database provides quick and accurate information as well as facilitating the extraction of reports potentially aiding in urban planning and management 4 3 benchmarking performance the imaai method was validated through the pixel to pixel comparison of the susceptibility map generated with the reference data for the representation of the real susceptibility conditions of the campeche proposed by caprario et al 2019 the degree of accuracy of each class of susceptibility mapped as well as the overall accuracy of the imaai method was determined by the confusion matrix and kappa coefficient shown in the table 8 the results from accuracy assessment showed an overall accuracy of the imaai method of 73 67 whereas the kappa coefficient was 0 619 substantial robustness of agreement the accuracy coefficient suffers from the disadvantage that it overestimates the degree of agreement whereas the kappa coefficient takes into account not only the efficiency but also the proportion of the incorrectly classified observations baeza et al 2010 user accuracy ranged from 56 88 to 85 12 while producer accuracy ranged from 42 86 to 89 40 the commission type i i e the percentage of pixels that are included in a category while they really do not belong to that category false positive ranged from 10 60 to 57 14 enough the error of omission type ii i e the percentage of pixels that are not included in the category while they really belong to the category false negative ranged from 14 88 to 43 12 the errors of omission are the more relevant measure to be considered for mapping of the susceptibility to flooding occurrence in urban regions since failure of a drainage system is more expensive than its over dimensioning the susceptibility maps generated by the imaai method and the ahp gis method reference data were also compared pixel by pixel by difference image analysis thus the final image can display the spatial distribution of the maximum difference between maps fig 8 imaai performance could probably be improved by defining smaller ranges for altimetry factor and including other categorical levels to soil type factor however this has not been done to avoid complexing the method 4 4 additional discussions further considerations can be made about the influence factors considered by imaai method since the method is developed to provide a simplified representation of susceptibility it is important to keep in mind the shortcomings adopted for the simplification first the drainage system design is not accounted for as in practice the method represents only the existence or not of drainage network this implies that drainage capacity is not estimated this factor can be adapted considering the drainage capacity of each section of the network but this will increase the complexity of the method in addition the recurrence times of precipitation are not considered adopting only the most updated annual means of meteorological stations near the study area better performances could be obtained by attribution of different weights to the classes of altimetry factor constructing intervals with smaller variations for example a class with a range of 50 or 100 m could provide a better estimate of the real terrain elevation than a range of 250 m 5 conclusions the results of the applications described in this manuscript highlight the potential of the proposed method to provide susceptibility information to occurrence of urban flooding in a simple fast and low cost way in addition simplification of method has demonstrated capacity for use by any civil society member with a socio hydrological simple assessment of factors influencing the urban flooding occurrence although it is necessary to adapt the brazilian class weighting table for application in other regions of the world the first results are very promising and show that the imaai method can be an effective and easy application tool to map and analyse the susceptibility to occurrence of flooding in urban areas as expected the results showed limitations for analysis the influence factors in maps scenarios not being possible to identify direct relations only some tendencies however the method has been shown able to represent reasonably well the spatial susceptibility distribution in addition to primary function of method valuable information can also be obtained by analysing the influence factors susceptibility indexes derived from imaai method application in specific point scenarios allow easy comparison between different regions benchmarking performance demonstrated an overall accuracy of the imaai method of 73 67 whereas the kappa coefficient was 0 619 although the imaai method shows substantial robustness of agreement between the predicted and the reference data the degree of accuracy is still considered very representative because the method is simplified and low in cost of application requiring no specialized knowledge or advanced technological conditions the method was able to reach the proposed objectives presenting simplicity security and low application cost proving to be a potential socio technological tool for planning development and participatory management of urban environment in other words this method can be adopted by the public managers as well as by civil society as a way of supporting participatory management and decision making offering alternative solutions to integrated management of urban zoning drainage network water resources preservation and natural disaster prevention for future studies and to take further advantage of versatility of imaai method the research efforts could be focused on adjustments of drainage network annual mean precipitation and altimetry classes in addition adaptation of factors classes of brazilian classes weighting table should be constantly investigated in order for application to have a global reach finally the importance of the development of simplified and low cost methods that allow public managers to plan and manage the city development is outlined elaborating strategies that take into account the financial environmental and social sustainability in the short medium and

6492,the intensification of flooding in urban areas and the management of susceptibility areas has become a global issue and has been the subject of several studies in recent decades the integration of alternative approaches such as socio hydrological and socio technological sciences has gained prominence in urban space planning and development the mapping of environmental susceptibility represents a promising alternative for the integrated management of natural disasters however for this to be used as a socio technological tool transiting to a participative management of urban environment it is necessary to simplify and reduce the associated costs in this sense the objective of this study was to propose a socio technological tool for the punctual and spatial mapping of the susceptibility to the occurrence of flooding in urban regions the method is designed to combine ease and low cost of application with a simplified but physically sensitive socio hydrological assessment of eight factors of influence the methodological tool was tested in a brazilian district where entire socio hydrological scenario of urban flooding in developing countries is observed the results show that the method can provide a simple and consistent view reaching an overall accuracy of 73 67 of the flooding points in general the method provides information that can support decision making by government agencies in developed and developing countries as well as civil society in relation to participatory urban zoning drainage management and water conservation keywords flooding mapping social hydrological tool socio technological tool urban drainage flooding susceptibility 1 introduction the number of occurrences and people affected by flooding events has gained notoriety in recent years due to unplanned urbanization anthropogenic changes in the environment and consequent regional climate changes extreme precipitation events have been intensifying the occurrence of flooding around the world duan et al 2016 yannopoulos et al 2013 united nations office for disaster risk reduction unisdr reported more than 100 flooding events worldwide between 1980 and 2008 resulting in approximately 6700 deaths duan et al 2016 estimates suggest that about 40 of flooding and associated economic losses are attributable to urban floods defra 2015 although there are many different concepts of flooding most authors agree that urban flooding is due to extrapolation of capacity of drainage systems and watercourses thereby accumulating water in backyards streets sidewalks or other urban infrastructure in the urban flooding case impacts go far beyond watersheds and territorial administrative units changes in land use affect the whole process of infiltration and storage of cities transferring the problem to stormwater drainage system cnt 2014 most of the time precipitated water does not impact the place of origin affecting areas downstream of cities where the drainage system is deficient or is non existent the planning and management of infrastructure and their respective impacts in terms of understanding and quantifying flooding risks in urban areas is still incipient pant et al 2018 these problems become more critical in developing countries where flooding disaster management is mainly reactive and flooding planning receives more attention from local authorities only after extreme events fadel et al 2018 lack of planning and investment in protection and defence against flooding compromises stormwater management bringing significant economic and social consequences in these countries management activities are managed only by the government which due to lack of financial resources and low prioritization of stormwater issue makes sanitation management deficient limiting the maintenance and expansion of services howard and bartram 2005 tingsanchali 2012 in brazil the fifth largest country in the world in territorial extension and population considered an emerging power with the eighth largest economy in the world this situation is no different sanitation management in brazil is still in process of treating sewage leaving aside the stormwater issue tasca et al 2018 which is treated with a hygienist perspective this is based on assumption that drainage is necessary leading to flow through pipe as quickly as possible increasing the magnitude and frequency of flooding in downstream urban areas souza et al 2013 garcia and paiva 2006 mention that a large number of brazilian municipalities face problems of urban flooding due to lack of planning and investment in stormwater drainage sector in the last decade approximately 1 300 people lost their lives as a result of urban flooding with economic losses reaching almost u 2 8 billion for the same period emergency expenditures were significantly higher than the resource invested in preventive measures by the various federal budget rubrics sprissler 2011 among the reasons for this bad scenario we highlight the predominance of emergency relief actions rather than prevention measures thus preventive adaptation measures e g resilient drainage projects urban planning for floodplains preservation early warning systems and awareness campaigns are not widely recognized in brazil as well as in other developing countries for example senegal lebanon mauritius

susceptibility respectively fig 4 this classification allows a better distribution of results avoiding overestimation of areas with extremely high susceptibility and underestimation of areas with low susceptibility the suggested scale initially had 4 equivalent intervals i e intervals with the same size in visual presentation of results it was verified that areas classified as low susceptibility were underestimated necessitating an adjustment in intervals tests of classification were performed adjusting intervals based on locations of known susceptibility areas the intervals tested in the susceptibility classification for ideal setting are shown in table 2 2 2 application scenarios 2 2 1 specific point scenarios major application of imaai method is to consider flooding at a point scenario for example a street intersection where the storm drains is damaged or poorly dimensioned in this case each influence factor has only one reference class used to determine a local susceptibility index this index is compared to local scale constructed in step 5 defining the range of susceptibility to occurrence of flooding over interest point 2 2 2 map scenarios the secondary approach to using the imaai method is to consider flooding susceptibility in a map scenario for example a district or city with physical features that increase naturally the susceptibility to the occurrence of flooding in this case instead of a point susceptibility index as described in the specific point scenarios this application can provide a spatial distribution of all areas potentially susceptible to flooding based on the overlap of the eight layers of influence factors this allows the effective quantification of the susceptibility to the occurrence of flooding in a city favouring a complete analysis of possible actions to be adopted although the main idea behind the development of the imaai method is not the application in mapping scenarios since a relatively similar procedure can be performed using already established techniques of geoprocessing e g the ahp gis composition its applicability to complex scenarios proves to be extremely efficient in terms of computational effort and realistic representation of the areas of susceptibility in very large regions and in a short time 3 application the proposed method was applied in three points of test located in campeche district in the southern region of florian√≥polis city sc brazil all points are constantly affected by urban flooding caused by non existent or poorly sized drainage networks a system characterized as absolute separator the location of the three points of test is shown in fig 5 a 3 1 points of test 3 1 1 point 1 the first point of test is located in the northern portion of the campeche district fig 5b the constant events occurring at this point is directly related to the absence of a stormwater collection system along with waterproofing and the presence of the tavares river this region is still strongly influenced by environmental characteristics mainly in relation to the presence of hydrographic basins mangrove vegetation and direct influence of tidal elevation 3 1 2 point 2 the second point of test is located in the central portion of the campeche district fig 5c the constant events occurring at this point is directly related to the absence of a stormwater collection system since these streets are partially paved 3 1 3 point 3 the third point of test is located in the southern portion of the campeche district fig 5d the main access route in the region has partial coverage of the drainage network basically composed of infiltration wells that overflowing with intense rains flooding transversal streets with smaller slope in addition at the point of test there are not compensatory structures and there is also no drainage system because it is not paved for all points information of the eight influence factors was identified through a spatial database constructed for the campeche district in addition the same information was investigated in loco standard procedure for application of the imaai method the information that composes the database referring to the eight influence factors was collected from previous studies as shown in table 3 3 2 benchmarking performance one of the most important steps in the mapping process is performance assessment of the method used the objective of this step is to quantitatively assess the efficiency of the representation of the method besides pegging and quantify mapping errors karan and samadder 2016 performance of imaai method is evaluated using a confusion or error matrix in this method a simple cross tabulation of the labels of the susceptibility classes mapped predicted data rows against that observed in reference data true data columns is employed a map of susceptibility to the urban flooding for the campeche district proposed by caprario et al 2019 was used as reference data to classify the points created and to evaluate the similarity with the map produced by the imaai method the reference data was adopted because the map was generated by a state of the art method ahp gis that uses urban drainage network and compensatory techniques associated as influence factors besides those traditionally used land use altimetry slope and soil type for the extraction of the pixel data from each map and subsequent similarity comparison a total of 37 470 points one point for each pixel were created arcgis 10 1 was used for benchmarking performance moreover this study considered other metric derived from the error matrix including errors of commission type i error errors of omission type ii error accuracy of the user false positive accuracy of the producer false negative and a kappa coefficient the kappa coefficient analysis is a discrete multivariate technique used to indicate the measure of agreement between data which considers beyond the simple proportion observed the proportion of agreement expected by chance baeza et al 2016 the kappa coefficient Œ∫ was calculated using eq 1 1 Œ∫ n i 1 r x ii i 1 r x i x i n 2 i 1 r x i x i where r is the number of row in confusion matrix xii is the number of row i and column i xi and x i are the total of row i and column i and n is the number of observations kappa coefficient has a range from 1 to 1 with larger values indicating almost perfect concordance in order to maintain consistent nomenclature of the kappa statistics the categorization of the labels assigned to the coefficient ranges will follow those introduced by landis and koch 1977 and reproduced in table 4 4 results and discussions 4 1 susceptibility in specific point scenarios the classes and weights for each influence factor identified in campeche district table 5 scenario of the three test points is the result of steps 2 and 3 the susceptibility scale of the campeche district constructed is shown in fig 6 and is the results of steps 4 and 5 classes and weights that represent eight influence factors for each test point are shown in table 6 it is possible to observe that identification of the eight factors classes can be used in a simple and quick way to characterize the susceptibility of flooding occurrences in each test point allowing analysis of influence between the factors for example point 2 shows a strongly undulating terrain slope ranging from 20 to 45 reducing the range of susceptibility classified as extremely high to only high furthermore the classification determined by the comparison between the index and local susceptibility scale 53 points equal to high susceptibility and 59 points equal to extremely high susceptibility confirms the constant flooding events observed at the points of test it is interesting to note how the susceptibility index remained the same for point 1 and point 3 although the average precipitation at point 3 was higher this fact may be related to land use which is characterized by intense urbanization in point 1 and bare land in point 3 4 2 susceptibility in map scenarios to visually represent the susceptibility to flooding occurrence in all areas of the campeche district the imaai method was applied considering a map scenario composed of multiple points of test shown in fig 7 and table 7 before discussing the results it is important to remember that the susceptibility determined by the imaai method in map scenarios is affected by the spatial representation quality of eight influence factors as mentioned in applications a spatial database was built for the campeche district however these spatial data are not always updated and can generate divergence with the real situation therefore the presented results should be analysed conceptually before drawing conclusions about the real conditions of susceptibility in the area several interesting considerations can be drawn from results first susceptibility map shows that high and extremely high susceptibility ranges are evidenced basically in all flat land area this fact can be justified by presence of low slopes existence of a free surface aquifer and rapid elevation of the water table by soil saturation during periods of higher rainfall cunha et al 2012 in addition the map provides information that cannot be extracted by visual observation alone as can be seen in table 7 areas with low and moderate susceptibility together represent approximately 49 of the total area of the district due to the number of factors of influence considered it is not possible to identify a direct relationship only tendencies that justify this classification for example susceptibility to flooding reduces in areas where there is a drainage network associated with compensatory structures the same is true for high slope areas such as at the top of hills where susceptibility is classified as low it is important to note that a point to point analysis of susceptibility in map scenarios would require the treatment of a large amount of information with probability of errors related to outdated information however the application of tools in the updated database provides quick and accurate information as well as facilitating the extraction of reports potentially aiding in urban planning and management 4 3 benchmarking performance the imaai method was validated through the pixel to pixel comparison of the susceptibility map generated with the reference data for the representation of the real susceptibility conditions of the campeche proposed by caprario et al 2019 the degree of accuracy of each class of susceptibility mapped as well as the overall accuracy of the imaai method was determined by the confusion matrix and kappa coefficient shown in the table 8 the results from accuracy assessment showed an overall accuracy of the imaai method of 73 67 whereas the kappa coefficient was 0 619 substantial robustness of agreement the accuracy coefficient suffers from the disadvantage that it overestimates the degree of agreement whereas the kappa coefficient takes into account not only the efficiency but also the proportion of the incorrectly classified observations baeza et al 2010 user accuracy ranged from 56 88 to 85 12 while producer accuracy ranged from 42 86 to 89 40 the commission type i i e the percentage of pixels that are included in a category while they really do not belong to that category false positive ranged from 10 60 to 57 14 enough the error of omission type ii i e the percentage of pixels that are not included in the category while they really belong to the category false negative ranged from 14 88 to 43 12 the errors of omission are the more relevant measure to be considered for mapping of the susceptibility to flooding occurrence in urban regions since failure of a drainage system is more expensive than its over dimensioning the susceptibility maps generated by the imaai method and the ahp gis method reference data were also compared pixel by pixel by difference image analysis thus the final image can display the spatial distribution of the maximum difference between maps fig 8 imaai performance could probably be improved by defining smaller ranges for altimetry factor and including other categorical levels to soil type factor however this has not been done to avoid complexing the method 4 4 additional discussions further considerations can be made about the influence factors considered by imaai method since the method is developed to provide a simplified representation of susceptibility it is important to keep in mind the shortcomings adopted for the simplification first the drainage system design is not accounted for as in practice the method represents only the existence or not of drainage network this implies that drainage capacity is not estimated this factor can be adapted considering the drainage capacity of each section of the network but this will increase the complexity of the method in addition the recurrence times of precipitation are not considered adopting only the most updated annual means of meteorological stations near the study area better performances could be obtained by attribution of different weights to the classes of altimetry factor constructing intervals with smaller variations for example a class with a range of 50 or 100 m could provide a better estimate of the real terrain elevation than a range of 250 m 5 conclusions the results of the applications described in this manuscript highlight the potential of the proposed method to provide susceptibility information to occurrence of urban flooding in a simple fast and low cost way in addition simplification of method has demonstrated capacity for use by any civil society member with a socio hydrological simple assessment of factors influencing the urban flooding occurrence although it is necessary to adapt the brazilian class weighting table for application in other regions of the world the first results are very promising and show that the imaai method can be an effective and easy application tool to map and analyse the susceptibility to occurrence of flooding in urban areas as expected the results showed limitations for analysis the influence factors in maps scenarios not being possible to identify direct relations only some tendencies however the method has been shown able to represent reasonably well the spatial susceptibility distribution in addition to primary function of method valuable information can also be obtained by analysing the influence factors susceptibility indexes derived from imaai method application in specific point scenarios allow easy comparison between different regions benchmarking performance demonstrated an overall accuracy of the imaai method of 73 67 whereas the kappa coefficient was 0 619 although the imaai method shows substantial robustness of agreement between the predicted and the reference data the degree of accuracy is still considered very representative because the method is simplified and low in cost of application requiring no specialized knowledge or advanced technological conditions the method was able to reach the proposed objectives presenting simplicity security and low application cost proving to be a potential socio technological tool for planning development and participatory management of urban environment in other words this method can be adopted by the public managers as well as by civil society as a way of supporting participatory management and decision making offering alternative solutions to integrated management of urban zoning drainage network water resources preservation and natural disaster prevention for future studies and to take further advantage of versatility of imaai method the research efforts could be focused on adjustments of drainage network annual mean precipitation and altimetry classes in addition adaptation of factors classes of brazilian classes weighting table should be constantly investigated in order for application to have a global reach finally the importance of the development of simplified and low cost methods that allow public managers to plan and manage the city development is outlined elaborating strategies that take into account the financial environmental and social sustainability in the short medium and

6493,low impact development lid practices can mitigate adverse impacts of urbanization on hydrology and water quality by using decentralized designs to control stormwater runoff at the source most previous research has focused on lid impacts on stormwater runoff with little consideration given to baseflow or road salt pollution this study describes a modeling approach to assess how effectively retrofitted lid technologies can reduce salt contamination the model coupled the curve number approach with completely mixed reservoirs to simulate watershed hydrology and solute transport the model was tested in boone creek watershed bcw an urban headwater watershed in the southern appalachians the model proves able to capture daily stream discharge and stream chloride cl concentrations satisfactorily the model simulation with and without lid showed lid can decrease surface runoff and increase recharge baseflow and interflow furthermore lid led to increased cl load in baseflow interflow and recharge cl load in runoff and maximum stream cl concentration decreased when lid is implemented the model was run with retrofitting scenarios of various lid practices including pervious pavement swales rain gardens cisterns bioretention systems green roofs disconnecting conveyances from impervious surfaces and all lid practices combined in bcw implementing lid reduced storm runoff by 0 21 27 8 and increased groundwater recharge by 0 05 6 26 mean stream cl concentrations stayed unchanged while the maximum stream cl concentration decreased by 0 03 4 78 after lid practices were implemented the results also suggest that pervious pavement might be the best retrofitting option particularly in commercial and high density residential areas in bcw and other similar urban watersheds overall our study suggests that lid practices could mitigate stream salt contamination by dilution from enhanced groundwater recharge our study further suggests this model could be used as a quick screening tool to determine an effective strategy for implementing lid practices in urban areas keywords low impact development baseflow road salt runoff curve number stormwater management 1 introduction increasing salt concentration in surface runoff and groundwater poses a growing threat to urban environments in cold regions kaushal et al 2005 perera et al 2013 salt sources include water softening septic field discharges wastewater treatment plants and natural rock weathering the dominant salt source in urban environments however is from road salt applied to melt snow and ice jin et al 2011 kelly et al 2008 in the u s annual road salt application increased from an average of 9 6 million tons per year in the 1980s to averaging 19 5 million tons per year by 2011 kelly and matos 2013 a regional investigation at the baltimore long term ecological research lter site showed that road salt application increases with impervious surface area which results in increased mean annual chloride cl concentration in surface waters from 25 mg l 1 in rural areas to 340 mg l 1 in urban areas kaushal et al 2005 using deicing salts to clear roadways negatively impacts both infrastructure and ecosystems especially in urban areas with high road densities corsi et al 2010 findlay and kelly 2011 there is mounting evidence that road salt can negatively affect water quality aquatic species concrete materials and human health cooper et al 2014 corsi et al 2010 kaushal et al 2005 meriano et al 2009 wang et al 2006 many factors complicate the loading amount and dynamics to local water bodies from deicing salts used on roadways sidewalks parking lots and driveways including roadway length and type application amount topography extent of urban development and the intensity of precipitation and snowfall scott 1981 the drainage of these salt covered areas further complicates how the salt laden waters follow various flow paths overland flow shallow subsurface flow and or groundwater flow as road salt is applied melting and mixing lead to the dissolution of ions which drain via these complex flow paths these salt concentrated plumes have been shown to elevate the salinity level of streams lakes and groundwaters cockerill et al 2017 corsi et al 2015 perera et al 2013 current best management practices of salt pollution control primarily focus on minimizing salt input using alternative de icing agents or properly calibrated salt spreaders there is potential to develop innovative management practices from a hydrological perspective that mitigates salt contamination in water bodies infiltration of salt laden runoff allows road salt to be temporarily stored in groundwater where it can be diluted from groundwater recharge over time impervious surfaces and storm drains in urban areas on the other hand minimize this process by enhancing quick routing of salt laden water into streams if installed and maintained properly low impact development lid might have positive impacts on salt contamination in urban watersheds lid technologies have been recommended to mitigate negative urban impacts on hydrological and water quality usepa 2007 ahiablame et al 2012 lid practices are decentralized practices used to control stormwater sources by intercepting runoff from impervious surfaces fletcher et al 2013 lid practices are intended to slow stormwater flow and hold it at least temporarily before it enters a waterway these practices include rain barrels cisterns green roofs permeable pavement infiltration swales bioretention systems disconnecting water conveyances e g gutters pipes from impervious surfaces among other techniques previous studies comparing watersheds with and without lid implemented found that lid lowered peak discharges runoff coefficients runoff volumes and increased time of concentration dietz and clausen 2008 holman dodds et al 2003 hood et al 2007 lid can reduce stormwater runoff and yields significant stormwater control for small events and less control for flood events brander et al 2004 damodaram et al 2010 gilroy and mccuen 2009 sample and heaney 2006 williams and wise 2006 there is also evidence that lid can improve water quality gregoire and clausen 2011 myers et al 2011 bedan and clausen 2009 for example bedan and clausen 2009 found decreased exports of ammonium total kjeldahl nitrogen lead and zinc and increased exports of total suspended solids and total phosphorous from a lid watershed compared to an lid free watershed highlighting the complex reality of stormwater management however there is also evidence that green roofs might increase nutrient levels in runoff ahiablame et al 2012 previous lid studies have mostly focused on traditional pollutants such as nutrients and heavy metals with little attention to road salt pollution khan et al 2012 found that salt cannot be remediated in bioretention due to its chemically inert nature in addition the performance of bioretention systems is jeopardized by salt that mobilizes heavy metals soberg et al 2014 given rapidly increasing road salt application and the important controls of watershed hydrology on road salt transport and retention the impacts of lid on salt pollution at the watershed scale need to be thoroughly studied to better handle this nonpoint source loading into watersheds understanding road salt transport processes is critical to assess the effectiveness of lid on mitigating contamination groundwater is an important pool that stores leached salt and subsequently releases salt gradually in baseflow causing chronic impacts on aquatic ecosystem cockerill et al 2017 most previous lid research studied the lid impacts on stormwater runoff with little consideration given to baseflow hamel et al 2013 ahiablame et al 2013 yet baseflow is critical to controlling non point source pollution e g salt pollution at the watershed scale groundwater is also a key resource for drinking water supply and groundwater dependent ecosystems the objective of the current study was to provide a more robust understanding of the potential to effectively manage stormwater runoff in cold regions to mitigate road salt contamination we developed a simple watershed model that simulates chloride transport through the groundwater reservoir and surface runoff this model simulates runoff generation using the curve number approach usda 1986 which allows using composite curve numbers estimated from online software l thia lid to assess the effects of various lid practices on chloride transport at a watershed scale the model was tested at a headwater urban watershed in the southern appalachians to simulate alteration of hydrology and salt pollution in response to each lid technology our study aims to assess the effectiveness of specific lid practices at the watershed scale by simulating impacts on runoff baseflow and chloride concentrations under various flow conditions from implementing rain barrels cisterns pervious pavement swales green roofs bioretention systems and disconnecting drainage from impervious surfaces this modeling approach can be used as a quick screening tool to evaluate lid implementation to maximize salt contamination mitigation in urban watersheds 2 methods and materials 2 1 site description boone creek a tributary of the south fork new river is a mountainous headwater stream flowing through the urban mountain town of boone north carolina the local geology composing the upstream reach of boone creek is biotite gneiss surrounded by the cranberry gneiss basement rock which primarily composes the downstream reach of boone creek horton 1991 boone creek is a second order 1 8 km headwater stream that channels runoff from a 3 9 km2 watershed with an average impervious surface area of 21 5 gu et al 2015 boone creek fig 1 was classified as a class c waterway in 1993 meaning the aquatic life specifically trout reproduction is protected north carolina department of environmental quality the surrounding population of 17 122 census 2010 experiences on average 89 cm of snow annually requiring about 6 105 kg of deicing salt to be applied to the 57 6 lane kilometers of roadway parking lots and sidewalks that straddle boone creek 2 2 water quality monitoring since 2014 measurements of electrical conductivity and stream stage have been collected every 15 min at the watershed outlet by submerged hobo u2001 conductivity data logger and hobo pressure data logger a stage discharge rating curve was constructed by measuring stream discharge during various levels of flow conditions using combined area velocity and dilution gauging methods electrical conductivity measurements were then corrected to specific conductivity at 25 c and further correlated to stream chloride cl concentration hand measurements of electrical conductivity were collected in boone creek during baseflow with a calibrated ysi 556 mms probe the ysi 556 mms probe was calibrated every three months this probe served to calibrate the data collected from the dataloggers to account for drift in the field measurements 2 3 model description we conceptualized the bcw as a two layer system characterized by a shallow soil and deep aquifer component fig 2 the major hydrologic fluxes included in the model are precipitation p evapotranspiration et runoff q interflow qs baseflow qg streamflow qt as well as hydrologic exchanges between soil and aquifer re evapotranspiration wrevap and recharge r the soil conservation service curve number cn method was used to estimate direct runoff the cn method is widely used to model watershed hydrology arnold et al 1998 the use of the cn method is a simple alternative to more complicated hydrological models that require extensive data inputs that are often not readily available deb et al 2018 furthermore the cn method allows the user to evaluate the effects of lid practices on hydrology and water quality thanks to the lately developed cn numbers for various lid practices usace 2012 the model estimates direct runoff q m for a given precipitation depth p m as 1 q p i a 2 p i a s f o r p i a 2 q 0 for p i a where s is the potential maximum retention l ia is the initial abstraction l before runoff including evapotranspiration interception infiltration etc and is subject to calibration we adopted an initial ia of 0 05 because hawkins et al 2002 found that 5 better represents initial abstraction ratio than traditionally used 20 based on hundreds of rainfall runoff data from numerous u s watersheds the model estimates direct runoff if the precipitation is greater than 5 of the potential maximum retention usda 1986 the initial s can be calculated by 3 s 25 4 cn 0 254 to account for

calculate direct runoff without a baseflow component at the watershed scale we simulate groundwater as a single unconfined aquifer that receives water via groundwater recharge r and loses water via upward water movement into the soil zone in response to water deficiency re evapotranspiration wrevap and baseflow qg the derivation of the water balance equation for groundwater is as follows 7 ds g dt r w revap q g where sg is amount of water stored in groundwater qg is baseflow r is recharge and sg is related to discharge qg through residence time tg qg sg tg we used this linear storage

final streamflow qt is the sum of baseflow qg shallow subsurface flow qs and direct runoff q 8 q t q q s q g we used a continuously stirred tank reactor to simulate transport of chloride assuming a complete mixing scheme the complete mixing is also called random sampling in which the age distribution of the output fluxes is fully representative of the age distribution in the control volume benettin et al 2013b the assumption of random sampling was proved to be robust in systems with high degrees of heterogeneity or enhanced dispersion benettin et al 2013a chloride cl is a highly soluble substance that is not easily removed by chemical or biological processes cl is therefore treated as a conservative substance this model does not consider other sources septic systems rock weathering

the national climatic data center and the state climate office of north carolina hydrologic soil group information was extracted from the soil survey geographic ssurgo database of the usda nrs the 2011 national land cover dataset nlcd was used to calculate proportions of land use and land cover fig 1 2014 aerial photography was clipped to watershed area using the clip tool in the data management toolbox in arcmap polygon files were created manually by tracing different feature classes of impervious surfaces area of each class of impervious surface calculated with an algorithm in arcmap that uses vertices of traces to get the area of an odd shape using multiple integrals the online l thia model was used to derive cn from each lid practice for targeted land use types however the land use classifications in 2011 nlcd and l thia are different the 2011 nlcd data were therefore reclassified from the original land use classes into l thia equivalent land use categories that are relevant to lid techniques table 1 for example developed open space low intensity residential ldr medium intensity residential mdr and high intensity residential hdr in 2011 nlcd were treated as residential 1 2 acre residential 1 4 acre residential 1 8 acre and commercial and industrial in l thia respectively in which a certain proportion of each type of impervious surface i e driveway road rooftop sidewalk were assumed in l thia usace 2012 to check reclassification validity the percentages of each impervious surface type calculated by l thia were compared to those estimated from 2014 aerial photography table 2 the comparison suggested the reclassification is accurate overall except the l thia approach overestimated the percentage of road street from aerial photography the bcw receives deicing applications from appalachian state university physical plant app the town of boone public works tob north carolina department of transportation ncdot and citizens the annual road salt input is based on the application rates collected from ncdot tob and app and road pavement sidewalk mileage estimated in arcgis 10 2 for non road impervious surfaces we multiplied the area of parking lots driveways and sidewalks by the same salt application rate used by the ncdot tob applies salts to the roads at the same rate as ncdot the estimated total salt input for bcw on average 3 8 5 105 kg annually which is consistent with the road salt purchase invoice from app the app applies on average 4 5 105 kg of deicing salt annually to the appalachian state university campus roadways and parking lots which accounts for around 80 of the total roadways and parking lots of the bcw to estimate daily salt application based on snowfall variability we assumed the rate is proportional to snow depth and used a regression between yearly total snow depth at bcw and total road salt applied based on road salt purchase invoice data from 2004 to 2013 from app n 10 years r2 0 65 although we acknowledge the fact that much salt is applied for ice or as a preventative measure even without any snow or ice accumulation this approach yields a constant salt concentration in snow melt csnow which is 800 mg l 1 the cl concentration in runoff was assumed to be equal to rainfall cl concentration which was measured to be 20 mg l 1 on average 2 5 model calibration and validation the model tested in this paper requires the determination of the related parameters some of these parameters were determined according to previous work or from field direct measurement in table 3 initial cl concentration in soil and groundwater was derived from model spin up for approximately 10 years before the start of the measurements the composite cn of 48 36 was estimated through l thia this value is an area weighted average of all the cn values in the individual land use the remaining free parameters have been derived through calibration table 4 the parameters subject to calibration were

coefficient b in order to rank model performances the residual sum of squares rss i 1 n c i m e a s c i c a l c 2 was used for the log transformed data of stream discharge n 334 and cl concentration in discharge n 366 in addition observed flows were separated into surface flow and baseflow using hysep sloto and crouse 1996 this baseflow was then compared to the simulated baseflow n 334 weights were assigned to each objective function to ensure that the contributions of each to the multiple objective functions were almost equal the model was automatically calibrated using the parameter estimation pest software for daily streamflow baseflow and stream cl concentration in 2015 shepherd 2016 pest implements a particularly robust variant of the gauss marquardt levenberg method of non linear parameter estimation the calibrated model was then validated with the observed streamflow and stream cl concentration data in 2016 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was not used directly in the automatic calibration process rather was used to measure model performance after calibration 2 6 simulation of lid scenario the calibrated and validated model was used to evaluate multiple scenarios for implementing various lid technologies in various land uses table 5 the composite cns for the lid practices were calculated by l thia lid lid practices were examined individually with only one practice at a time applied to corresponding land uses for example pervious pavements were only applied to roadways and parking lots note that scenarios are used in a retrofitting manner in this study in other words conventional streets were converted into porous pavements conventional roofs were converted into green roofs a 50 lid application rate was assumed for each practice 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the calibrated tg of 300 days tt of 3 days l of 1 m ia of 0 05 Œ≤ of 0 1 kl of 0 4 Œ≤rev of 0 3 and b of 1 table 4 provided comparable streamflow and stream salt concentration to the observation in 2015 resulting in nse values of 0 67 and 0 61 for streamflow and stream cl concentration respectively the composite sensitivity results showed ia krev and kl were the most sensitive parameters while tg and tt were the least sensitive parameters table 4 the calibrated model was then validated against the observed streamflow and cl concentration in 2016 the simulated flow agreed reasonably with the observed streamflow nse 0 60 fig 3 a the gradually declining trend of streamflow during summer and fall was caused by water uptake via evapotranspiration and was also well captured by the model nevertheless some high flow events were sometimes overestimated or underestimated the baseflow estimate for the validation period is shown in fig 3b the hysep separated baseflow was captured reasonably by the model nse 0 59 the simulated daily stream cl concentration from jan 1st 2016 to jan 1st 2017 matched the observation reasonably well nse 0 53 the winter cl concentration spikes after snow falls were reasonably represented the dilution from low cl rainfall during the rest of the year was also captured by the model the baseflow cl concentration reached its nadir to 150 mg l 1 corresponding to the highest streamflow in march the stream baseflow cl then increased by over 1 7 fold afterwards the stream cl concentrations stayed high during snow free seasons indicating groundwater is a long term source of cl to surface water the incline trend in stream cl concentration over the summer and fall corresponded with a concentration effect from decreased baseflow fig 4 b the underestimation of stream cl over november and december might be caused by pre storm or freezing rain salt application which is not currently represented by the model the observed and simulated stream cl loads at the bcw outlet in 2016 were 5 5 105 kg and 5 2 105 kg nacl respectively 3 2 effects of lid on hydrology and salt concentration to investigate how lid changes the characteristics of hydrology and cl concentration we ran the calibrated model over three years with the composite curve numbers of 35 and 50 to simulate the scenarios with lid implementation and without lid implementation respectively in a hypothetical watershed the effects of lid on partitioning of annual water flux and cl flux at bcw is shown in table 6 the enhanced groundwater recharge by 25 7 through lid practices at bcw decreased flood peaks by 77 7 and increased baseflow by 18 7 consequently lid increased baseflow index by 24 7 and decreased runoff coefficient by 4 8 lid thus affects long term water supply for communities for example in the bcw baseflow sustains streamflow downstream where the town of boone drinking water intake is located the increased baseflow agreed with findings from previous studies where impervious surfaces reduced recharge to the groundwater causing a lowered water table and a decrease in baseflow rose and peters 2001 this decline results in an increased area of shallow water habitat with smaller thermal inertia which decreases the stream s ability to withstand a given heat load without substantial increase in water temperature poole and berman 2001 richards et al 1996 gu et al 2015 increased baseflow increased the hydrological connectivity of the landscape which leads to characteristically high biodiversity ward et al 1999 and pollutant removal aubert et al 2016 as far as cl flux is concerned cl load via baseflow dominated stream cl export accounting for 85 and 70 of annual stream cl load for with lid and without respectively the lid implementation increased interflow and baseflow cl load by 20 4 and 18 6 respectively the lid decreased runoff cl load by 80 2 and decreased maximum stream cl concentration by 25 1 the reduced stream cl spikes in winter can be especially beneficial to stream ecosystems because they represent an acute exposure of aquatic organisms to salt overall the lid slightly decreased stream cl load by 1 7 the total cl input was greater than the stream cl export suggesting salt was gradually accumulated in the system and the system had not reached equilibrium the lid implementation did not significantly change stream mean cl concentration p 0 5 the negligible change in stream mean cl concentration seems counterintuitive at first glance because enhanced groundwater recharge by lid practices should bring more salt into groundwater during the winter deicing season as suggested by the 20 4 increase in cl load through groundwater recharge however these salt pulses are greatly diluted by increased low cl rainfall infiltration and subsequent increased groundwater storage when road salt application is absent as a result lid decreased groundwater cl concentration fig 5 c these results are consistent with the recent findings by dietz et al 2017 that permeable asphalt decreased groundwater chloride concentration due to dilution from rainfall during snow free periods in a monitoring study kwiatkowski et al 2007 also found pervious concrete did not increase copper and chloride levels in the groundwater previous studies reported that salt cannot be effectively retained by bioretention due to its inert chemical nature khan et al 2012 however our results suggest lid can retain and dilute rather than remove the road salt through enhanced long term groundwater recharge therefore an integrated understanding of hydrological and solute transport processes at the watershed scale is warranted to evaluate effect of lid systems on salt in groundwater and stream water the simulated time series suggested that lid implementation decreased groundwater cl concentrations due to increased groundwater storage subsequently baseflow fig 5b c nevertheless during the snow season in the first year groundwater cl concentrations with lid were slightly higher than without which might be attributed to enhanced infiltration of salt laden water after salt application this concentration effect was followed by dilution over the rest of the year groundwater cl concentrations negatively correlated to baseflow it gradually increased into summer due to decreased baseflow and then decreased during the fall due to increased baseflow lid led to more dilution in groundwater cl over snow free seasons compared to without fig 5c similarly because lid retained salt laden water the stream cl concentration spikes were less pronounced with lid compared to without during the de icing season fig 5d in fall the stream cl concentrations under baseflow with lid were lower than without due to its lower groundwater cl concentrations note that the stream cl dilution dips during salt free runoff events were less pronounced with lid compared to without which was attributed to lid decreasing low cl runoff water the cumulative distribution function cdf of daily streamflow showed lower flows during storms i e in the 90 100 flow exceedance range with lid than without lid fig 6 a which indicated that lid effectively reduced storm runoff therefore reduced stream flashiness on the other hand there was little difference in cdf of streamflow during baseflow i e 0 90 flow exceedance range suggesting the effects of lid on streamflow are less pronounced during low flow conditions the cdf of daily stream cl concentrations showed slightly lower stream cl concentrations with lid than without in the 40 90 exceedance range indicating lid reduced stream cl concentrations during baseflow conditions fig 6b the reduction in stream cl concentrations during winter salt application events were even more pronounced as indicated by significantly lower stream cl concentrations over the 90 100 exceedance range with lid compared to without in contrast the lower stream cl concentration in the 0 10 exceedance range with lid compared to without indicated that lid decreased contribution of low cl storm runoff to streamflow and therefore led to less stream cl dilution during rainstorms our estimate of cl concentration reduction by lid in this study is conservative because we assumed that total salt application remained constant among the scenarios road salt application might decrease with lid practices such as pervious pavement roseen et al 2014 demonstrated that 64 77 less salt was needed for a porous asphalt lot compared to an impervious asphalt lot between snow storms the absence of standing water on porous asphalt greatly reduced the frequency and amount of salt application needed to control black ice we ran sensitivity analysis to investigate how the benefits of lid implementation vary with watershed and climate characteristics table 7 increasing groundwater storage as indicated by increasing groundwater residence time did not have any significant impact on reduction in stream maximum cl concentration and runoff except reduced baseflow increase larger watershed areas led to less stream maximum cl reduction and greater baseflow increase more precipitation caused less reduction in stream maximum cl and runoff but more baseflow increase less et corresponded to slightly greater reduction in stream maximum cl and runoff and less baseflow increase increasing unsaturated zone thickness weakened reduction in stream maximum cl but strengthened runoff reduction and baseflow increase overall small watersheds with thin soil and small aquifer in dry climate might lead to greatest reduction in stream cl by implementing lid on the other hand the greatest baseflow increase from lid is associated with large watersheds with thick soil and small aquifer in wet climate 3 3 effects of individual lid practice on hydrology and stream cl concentration explicit inclusion of a groundwater reservoir in the model allowed us to quantify changes in groundwater recharge groundwater storage and baseflow in response to lid practices in the analysis based on conditions in the bcw the increase in groundwater recharge after implementing individual lid technology ranged from 0 05 to 1 28 depending on the land use table 8 disconnecting conveyances from impervious surfaces for ldr is the most effective practice the next greatest increase is converting impervious parking lots driveway to pervious pavement in the commercial and hdr areas implementing rain barrels in mdr gives negligible increase in groundwater recharge groundwater recharge is a key protection target for stormwater management increasing groundwater recharge increased baseflow by 0 0 83 for individual lid practices applied for each land use type implementing individual lid practices in each land use type reduces storm runoff 0 21 5 7 table 8 due to the decrease in surface runoff total streamflow decreased slightly 0 02 0 59 in response to various lid practices these results align with previous work showing that lid practices decrease stormwater runoff in modeling studies ahiablame et al 2013 damodaram et al 2010 and experimental studies bedan and clausen 2009 the temporal dynamics of stream and groundwater cl simulated by the model allowed us to estimate stream mean chronic and maximum acute cl levels mean stream cl concentrations an indicator of long term chronic exposure and the maximum stream cl concentration an indicator of short term acute exposure decreased by 0 01 0 74 not significant p 0 05 and 0 03 4 78 respectively after lid practices were implemented this decline is attributed to more salt transport into groundwater through infiltration rather than runoff during snowmelt fig 5b a seemingly small reduction in streamflow and stream salt concentration achieved through lid practices in bcw were due to relatively small changes in the composite cn the smallest composite cn was 47 54 for disconnecting from impervious surface compared to the cn of 48 36 for without which represented a very small reduction this is because each impervious surface area available for lid implementation accounts for only small fraction of bcw e g 2 3 6 8 in table 2 the effects of lid practices could be more pronounced in more urbanized watersheds with greater percentage of impervious surface area several previous studies also found that basin wide effects of lid practices on a watershed scale are not as discernible as plot and field scales ahiablame et al 2013 santhi et al 2001 another reason for small impacts of lid practices is that each scenario represents only one lid applied in one type of urban land use when all lid practices were combined in all urban land uses much greater reduction for both runoff and cl concentrations were observed compared to individual practices table 8 the combined lid increased groundwater recharge and decreased runoff and maximum stream cl by 6 26 27 82 4 78 respectively p 0 05 and therefore would be recommended when retrofitting infrastructure finally as described previously our estimated cl concentration reduction was conservative because we did not account for salt input reduction caused by lid implementation such as porous pavements 3 4 optimum lid practices in bcw our analysis indicates that different implementation strategies may achieve different levels of reduction in runoff and salt contamination depending on the type of urban land use and the specific lid technique fig 7 overall the results indicate that replacing conventional asphalt and concrete with permeable materials such as porous pavement for streets parking lots and driveways performs better than swales rain barrels cisterns green roofs or bioretention in reducing runoff and stream salt contamination in bcw this is because roads and parking lots account for more than 50 of the total impervious surface in bcw these results are consistent with previous studies that credited pervious pavements as a major urban storm management practice for runoff and pollutant load reduction collins et al 2010 dietz 2007 liu et al 2015 disconnecting from impervious surfaces in ldr and installing swales showed moderate potential to reduce runoff and salt contamination disconnecting drainage systems disrupts routes of runoff to streams and thereby increases rainfall infiltration which is especially suited to ldr but not to commercial and hdr due to flooding risk on the other hand rain barrels cisterns green roofs and bioretention systems were least effective in reducing runoff and salt contamination despite large building rooftop areas collected water volumes for rain barrels especially in low density residential areas might be too small to effectively reduce runoff and salt contamination these results have important implications for stormwater management targeting the largest impervious areas with the most cn reducing lid practice for lid implementation may be the most effective way to retrofit lid into existing infrastructure for example porous pavement could be prioritized to reduce runoff and salt contamination in many urban watersheds this analysis clearly shows the important role of land use in determining effectiveness of lid techniques ldr and hdr show the most reduction in runoff and salt contamination because these two land uses are the most dominant urban land uses in bcw table 2 mdr showed moderate potential in reducing runoff and salt contamination while commercial area the smallest urban land use in bcw provided the least opportunity to reduce runoff and salt contamination table 2 these results indicate that lid efforts may be best invested in hdr and ldr areas rather than commercial and mdr areas in bcw implementing lid practice in different land use types is also constrained by their jurisdiction as public or private property urban water managers can make decisions to implement lid practices for public property and could use the model designed here to assess the most effective approach for their particular situation the model could also potentially be used to assess an effective approach for private property with the results then being used to promote positive lid practice among private property owners the results also indicate that different lid practices should be targeted for each land use category for example porous parking lots instead of porous streets should be targeted for commercial areas as it creates disproportionally large reduction in runoff and salt contamination this is because porous parking lots induce the greatest cn reduction among all lid practices converting large commercial parking lots to porous pavement is therefore particularly recommended for a large urban municipality eaton 2018 also found porous pavement provided the largest source of runoff reduction in commercial hdr and industrial urban land uses in an urban watershed in new york permeable pavement for streets and parking lots seemed to be the target lid for hdr and mdr while permeable pavement for streets and bioretention or disconnecting from impervious surfaces are most effective for ldr because ldr is mostly private property outreach efforts toward these owners should emphasize creating bioretention rain gardens or disconnecting drainage from impervious surfaces such as roof gutters driveways and street sidewalks although they are commonly promoted our results indicate that rain barrels are less effective than other lid practices 4 conclusion the process based model proposed here advances other simple cn based runoff models by accounting for the groundwater reservoir and its associated hydrological processes this inclusion allows modelers to explicitly capture baseflow and pollutant transport dynamics many cn based storm runoff models such as li thia do not account for dynamics of groundwater storage and mixing of various waters and therefore cannot simulate a continuous flow system event mean concentrations emcs of pollutants are a common protocol for many stormwater runoff models to simulate water quality however our model showed pollutant concentrations in water reservoirs varied over the seasons and even individual storm events due to human disturbance e g road salt application as well as change in groundwater storage which is subject to many hydrological processes such as et infiltration baseflow discharge etc as a result the model revealed that lid can mitigate salt contamination by allowing groundwater to temporarily store salt that enters in snow seasons followed by rainfall dilution in salt free seasons this model can be particularly useful for urban water managers to determine effective storm water management approaches that align with temporal variations in groundwater storage stream flow and pollutant concentration the cn based modeling approach used in this study allows assessing the effects of various lid practices on pollutant transport at watershed scale lowering the cn of existing impervious surfaces is a reasonable approach to simulate decreased runoff and increased infiltration by lid technologies the model was able to capture the observed stream discharge and stream cl concentration reasonably well at an urban headwater watershed the scenario analysis showed that lid practices including pervious pavement rain barrels cisterns bioretention systems swales green roofs and disconnecting conveyances from impervious surfaces can be effective as retrofits in reducing runoff and salt contamination at a watershed scale implementing lid resulted in reduced runoff and increased baseflow due to increased groundwater recharge stream mean cl concentration stayed unchanged while maximum stream cl concentration decreased after lid implementation our case study in bcw suggests that the effectiveness of lid in reducing runoff and salt pollution depends on both area coverage of impervious surfaces and the lid type permeable pavement especially in commercial and hdr might be the best retrofitting option for many urban watersheds if public acceptance by private property owners is not an issue and there is no flood risk disconnecting from impervious surfaces in ldr areas is also effective in reducing storm runoff and salt contamination in contrast rainfall collection system is not effective in reducing runoff and salt contamination this model can be particularly useful for decision makers as they consider how best to promote lid to protect water resources in their communities the proposed model was designed to strike a proper balance between complexity and practicality more accurate and likely more complex physically based models often require more extensive input data requirements and resources and this limits their wide application in contrast our model used readily accessible land use hydrological and meteorological data the results demonstrate that it is possible to produce a quick screen using more readily available data and a simple watershed model to help planners and decision makers determine if lid would be appropriate for them acknowledgments the authors thank the research institute for environment energy and economics at appalachian state university for supporting a portion of

6493,low impact development lid practices can mitigate adverse impacts of urbanization on hydrology and water quality by using decentralized designs to control stormwater runoff at the source most previous research has focused on lid impacts on stormwater runoff with little consideration given to baseflow or road salt pollution this study describes a modeling approach to assess how effectively retrofitted lid technologies can reduce salt contamination the model coupled the curve number approach with completely mixed reservoirs to simulate watershed hydrology and solute transport the model was tested in boone creek watershed bcw an urban headwater watershed in the southern appalachians the model proves able to capture daily stream discharge and stream chloride cl concentrations satisfactorily the model simulation with and without lid showed lid can decrease surface runoff and increase recharge baseflow and interflow furthermore lid led to increased cl load in baseflow interflow and recharge cl load in runoff and maximum stream cl concentration decreased when lid is implemented the model was run with retrofitting scenarios of various lid practices including pervious pavement swales rain gardens cisterns bioretention systems green roofs disconnecting conveyances from impervious surfaces and all lid practices combined in bcw implementing lid reduced storm runoff by 0 21 27 8 and increased groundwater recharge by 0 05 6 26 mean stream cl concentrations stayed unchanged while the maximum stream cl concentration decreased by 0 03 4 78 after lid practices were implemented the results also suggest that pervious pavement might be the best retrofitting option particularly in commercial and high density residential areas in bcw and other similar urban watersheds overall our study suggests that lid practices could mitigate stream salt contamination by dilution from enhanced groundwater recharge our study further suggests this model could be used as a quick screening tool to determine an effective strategy for implementing lid practices in urban areas keywords low impact development baseflow road salt runoff curve number stormwater management 1 introduction increasing salt concentration in surface runoff and groundwater poses a growing threat to urban environments in cold regions kaushal et al 2005 perera et al 2013 salt sources include water softening septic field discharges wastewater treatment plants and natural rock weathering the dominant salt source in urban environments however is from road salt applied to melt snow and ice jin et al 2011 kelly et al 2008 in the u s annual road salt application increased from an average of 9 6 million tons per year in the 1980s to averaging 19 5 million tons per year by 2011 kelly and matos 2013 a regional investigation at the baltimore long term ecological research lter site showed that road salt application increases with impervious surface area which results in increased mean annual chloride cl concentration in surface waters from 25 mg l 1 in rural areas to 340 mg l 1 in urban areas kaushal et al 2005 using deicing salts to clear roadways negatively impacts both infrastructure and ecosystems especially in urban areas with high road densities corsi et al 2010 findlay and kelly 2011 there is mounting evidence that road salt can negatively affect water quality aquatic species concrete materials and human health cooper et al 2014 corsi et al 2010 kaushal et al 2005 meriano et al 2009 wang et al 2006 many factors complicate the loading amount and dynamics to local water bodies from deicing salts used on roadways sidewalks parking lots and driveways including roadway length and type application amount topography extent of urban development and the intensity of precipitation and snowfall scott 1981 the drainage of these salt covered areas further complicates how the salt laden waters follow various flow paths overland flow shallow subsurface flow and or groundwater flow as road salt is applied melting and mixing lead to the dissolution of ions which drain via these complex flow paths these salt concentrated plumes have been shown to elevate the salinity level of streams lakes and groundwaters cockerill et al 2017 corsi et al 2015 perera et al 2013 current best management practices of salt pollution control primarily focus on minimizing salt input using alternative de icing agents or properly calibrated salt spreaders there is potential to develop innovative management practices from a hydrological perspective that mitigates salt contamination in water bodies infiltration of salt laden runoff allows road salt to be temporarily stored in groundwater where it can be diluted from groundwater recharge over time impervious surfaces and storm drains in urban areas on the other hand minimize this process by enhancing quick routing of salt laden water into streams if installed and maintained properly low impact development lid might have positive impacts on salt contamination in urban watersheds lid technologies have been recommended to mitigate negative urban impacts on hydrological and water quality usepa 2007 ahiablame et al 2012 lid practices are decentralized practices used to control stormwater sources by intercepting runoff from impervious surfaces fletcher et al 2013 lid practices are intended to slow stormwater flow and hold it at least temporarily before it enters a waterway these practices include rain barrels cisterns green roofs permeable pavement infiltration swales bioretention systems disconnecting water conveyances e g gutters pipes from impervious surfaces among other techniques previous studies comparing watersheds with and without lid implemented found that lid lowered peak discharges runoff coefficients runoff volumes and increased time of concentration dietz and clausen 2008 holman dodds et al 2003 hood et al 2007 lid can reduce stormwater runoff and yields significant stormwater control for small events and less control for flood events brander et al 2004 damodaram et al 2010 gilroy and mccuen 2009 sample and heaney 2006 williams and wise 2006 there is also evidence that lid can improve water quality gregoire and clausen 2011 myers et al 2011 bedan and clausen 2009 for example bedan and clausen 2009 found decreased exports of ammonium total kjeldahl nitrogen lead and zinc and increased exports of total suspended solids and total phosphorous from a lid watershed compared to an lid free watershed highlighting the complex reality of stormwater management however there is also evidence that green roofs might increase nutrient levels in runoff ahiablame et al 2012 previous lid studies have mostly focused on traditional pollutants such as nutrients and heavy metals with little attention to road salt pollution khan et al 2012 found that salt cannot be remediated in bioretention due to its chemically inert nature in addition the performance of bioretention systems is jeopardized by salt that mobilizes heavy metals soberg et al 2014 given rapidly increasing road salt application and the important controls of watershed hydrology on road salt transport and retention the impacts of lid on salt pollution at the watershed scale need to be thoroughly studied to better handle this nonpoint source loading into watersheds understanding road salt transport processes is critical to assess the effectiveness of lid on mitigating contamination groundwater is an important pool that stores leached salt and subsequently releases salt gradually in baseflow causing chronic impacts on aquatic ecosystem cockerill et al 2017 most previous lid research studied the lid impacts on stormwater runoff with little consideration given to baseflow hamel et al 2013 ahiablame et al 2013 yet baseflow is critical to controlling non point source pollution e g salt pollution at the watershed scale groundwater is also a key resource for drinking water supply and groundwater dependent ecosystems the objective of the current study was to provide a more robust understanding of the potential to effectively manage stormwater runoff in cold regions to mitigate road salt contamination we developed a simple watershed model that simulates chloride transport through the groundwater reservoir and surface runoff this model simulates runoff generation using the curve number approach usda 1986 which allows using composite curve numbers estimated from online software l thia lid to assess the effects of various lid practices on chloride transport at a watershed scale the model was tested at a headwater urban watershed in the southern appalachians to simulate alteration of hydrology and salt pollution in response to each lid technology our study aims to assess the effectiveness of specific lid practices at the watershed scale by simulating impacts on runoff baseflow and chloride concentrations under various flow conditions from implementing rain barrels cisterns pervious pavement swales green roofs bioretention systems and disconnecting drainage from impervious surfaces this modeling approach can be used as a quick screening tool to evaluate lid implementation to maximize salt contamination mitigation in urban watersheds 2 methods and materials 2 1 site description boone creek a tributary of the south fork new river is a mountainous headwater stream flowing through the urban mountain town of boone north carolina the local geology composing the upstream reach of boone creek is biotite gneiss surrounded by the cranberry gneiss basement rock which primarily composes the downstream reach of boone creek horton 1991 boone creek is a second order 1 8 km headwater stream that channels runoff from a 3 9 km2

be applied to the 57 6 lane kilometers of roadway parking lots and sidewalks that straddle boone creek 2 2 water quality monitoring since 2014 measurements of electrical conductivity and stream stage have been collected every 15 min at the watershed outlet by submerged hobo u2001 conductivity data logger and hobo pressure data logger a stage discharge rating curve was constructed by measuring stream discharge during various levels of flow conditions using combined area velocity and dilution gauging methods electrical conductivity measurements were then corrected to specific conductivity at 25 c and further correlated to stream chloride cl concentration hand measurements of electrical conductivity were collected in boone creek during baseflow with a calibrated ysi 556 mms probe the ysi 556 mms probe was calibrated every three months this probe served to calibrate the data collected from the dataloggers to account for drift in the field measurements 2 3 model description we conceptualized the bcw as a two layer system characterized by a shallow soil and deep aquifer component fig 2 the major hydrologic fluxes included in the model are precipitation p evapotranspiration

method was used to estimate direct runoff the cn method is widely used to model watershed hydrology arnold et al 1998 the use of the cn method is a simple alternative to more complicated hydrological models that require extensive data inputs that are often not readily available deb et al 2018 furthermore the cn method allows the user to evaluate the effects of lid practices on hydrology and water quality thanks to the lately developed cn numbers for various lid practices usace 2012 the model estimates direct runoff q m for a given precipitation depth p m as 1 q p i a 2 p i a s f o r p i a 2 q 0 for p i a where s is the potential maximum retention l ia is the initial abstraction l before runoff including evapotranspiration interception infiltration etc and is subject to calibration we adopted an initial ia of 0 05 because hawkins et al 2002 found that 5 better represents initial abstraction ratio than traditionally used 20 based on hundreds of rainfall runoff data from numerous u s watersheds the model estimates direct runoff if the precipitation is greater than 5 of the potential maximum retention usda 1986 the initial s can be calculated by 3 s 25 4 cn 0 254 to account for

calculate direct runoff without a baseflow component at the watershed scale we simulate groundwater as a single unconfined aquifer that receives water via groundwater recharge r and loses water via

benettin et al 2013b the assumption of random sampling was proved to be robust in systems with high degrees of heterogeneity or enhanced dispersion benettin et al 2013a chloride cl is a highly soluble substance that is not easily removed by chemical or biological processes cl is therefore treated as a conservative substance this model does not consider other sources septic systems rock weathering

the national climatic data center and the state climate office of north carolina hydrologic soil group information was extracted from the soil survey geographic ssurgo database of the usda nrs the 2011 national land cover dataset nlcd was used to calculate proportions of land use and land cover fig 1 2014 aerial photography was clipped to watershed area using the clip tool in the data management toolbox in arcmap polygon files were created manually by tracing different feature classes of impervious surfaces area of each class of impervious surface calculated with an algorithm in arcmap that uses vertices of traces to get the area of an odd shape using multiple integrals the online l thia model was used to derive cn from each lid practice for targeted land use types however the land use classifications in 2011 nlcd and l thia are different the 2011 nlcd data were therefore reclassified from the original land use classes into l thia equivalent land use categories that are relevant to lid techniques table 1 for example developed open space low intensity residential ldr medium intensity residential mdr and high intensity residential hdr in 2011 nlcd were treated as residential 1 2 acre residential 1 4 acre residential 1 8 acre and commercial and industrial in l thia respectively in which a certain proportion of each type of impervious surface i e driveway road rooftop sidewalk were assumed in l thia usace 2012 to check reclassification validity the percentages of each impervious surface type calculated by l thia were compared to those estimated from 2014 aerial photography table 2 the comparison suggested the reclassification is accurate overall except the l thia approach overestimated the percentage of road street from aerial photography the bcw receives deicing applications from appalachian state university physical plant app the town of boone public works tob north carolina department of transportation ncdot and citizens the annual road salt input is based on the application rates collected from ncdot tob and app and road pavement sidewalk mileage estimated in arcgis 10 2 for non road impervious surfaces we multiplied the area of parking lots driveways and sidewalks by the same salt application rate used by the ncdot tob applies salts to the roads at the same rate as ncdot the estimated total salt input for bcw on average 3 8 5 105 kg annually which is consistent with the road salt purchase invoice from app the app applies on average 4 5 105 kg of deicing salt annually to the appalachian state university campus roadways and parking lots which accounts for around 80 of the total roadways and parking lots of the bcw to estimate daily salt application based on snowfall variability we assumed the rate is proportional to snow depth and used a regression between yearly total snow depth at bcw and total road salt applied based on road salt purchase invoice data from 2004 to 2013 from app n 10 years r2 0 65 although we acknowledge the fact that much salt is applied for ice or as a preventative measure even without any snow or ice accumulation this approach yields a constant salt concentration in snow melt csnow which is 800 mg l 1 the cl concentration in runoff was assumed to be equal to rainfall cl concentration which was measured to be 20 mg l 1 on average 2 5 model calibration and validation the model tested in this paper requires the determination of the related parameters some of these parameters were determined according to previous work or from field direct measurement in table 3 initial cl concentration in soil and groundwater was derived from model spin up for approximately 10 years before the start of the measurements the composite cn of 48 36 was estimated through l thia this value is an area weighted average of all the cn values in the individual land use the remaining free parameters have been derived through calibration table 4 the parameters subject to calibration were

coefficient b in order to rank model performances the residual sum of squares rss i 1 n c i m e a s c i c a l c 2 was used for the log transformed data of stream discharge n 334 and cl concentration in discharge n 366 in addition observed flows were separated into surface flow and baseflow using hysep sloto and crouse 1996 this baseflow was then compared to the simulated baseflow n 334 weights were assigned to each objective function to ensure that the contributions of each to the multiple objective functions were almost equal the model was automatically calibrated using the parameter estimation pest software for daily streamflow baseflow and stream cl concentration in 2015 shepherd 2016 pest implements a particularly robust variant of the gauss marquardt levenberg method of non linear parameter estimation the calibrated model was then validated with the observed streamflow and stream cl concentration data in 2016 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was not used directly in the automatic calibration process rather was used to measure model performance after calibration 2 6 simulation of lid scenario the calibrated and validated model was used to evaluate multiple scenarios for implementing various lid technologies in various land uses table 5 the composite cns for the lid practices were calculated by l thia lid lid practices were examined individually with only one practice at a time applied to corresponding land uses for example pervious pavements were only applied to roadways and parking lots note that scenarios are used in a retrofitting manner in this study in other words conventional streets were converted into porous pavements conventional roofs were converted into green roofs a 50 lid application rate was assumed for each practice 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the calibrated tg of 300 days tt of 3 days l of 1 m ia of 0 05 Œ≤ of 0 1 kl of 0 4 Œ≤rev of 0 3 and b of 1 table 4 provided comparable streamflow and stream salt concentration to the observation in 2015 resulting in nse values of 0 67 and 0 61 for streamflow and stream cl concentration respectively the composite sensitivity results showed ia krev and kl were the most sensitive parameters while tg and tt were the least sensitive parameters table 4 the calibrated model was then validated against the observed streamflow and cl concentration in 2016 the simulated flow agreed reasonably with the observed streamflow nse 0 60 fig 3 a the gradually declining trend of streamflow during summer and fall was caused by water uptake via evapotranspiration and was also well captured by the model nevertheless some high flow events were sometimes overestimated or underestimated the baseflow estimate for the validation period is shown in fig 3b the hysep separated baseflow was captured reasonably by the model nse 0 59 the simulated daily stream cl concentration from jan 1st 2016 to jan 1st 2017 matched the observation reasonably well nse 0 53 the winter cl concentration spikes after snow falls were reasonably represented the dilution from low cl rainfall during the rest of the year was also captured by the model the baseflow cl concentration reached its nadir to 150 mg l 1 corresponding to the highest streamflow in march the stream baseflow cl then increased by over 1 7 fold afterwards the stream cl concentrations stayed high during snow free seasons indicating groundwater is a long term source of cl to surface water the incline trend in stream cl concentration over the summer and fall corresponded with a concentration effect from decreased baseflow fig 4 b the underestimation of stream cl over november and december might be caused by pre storm or freezing rain salt application which is not currently represented by the model the observed and simulated stream cl loads at the bcw outlet in 2016 were 5 5 105 kg and 5 2 105 kg nacl respectively 3 2 effects of lid on hydrology and salt concentration to investigate how lid changes the characteristics of hydrology and cl concentration we ran the calibrated model over three years with the composite curve numbers of 35 and 50 to simulate the scenarios with lid implementation and without lid implementation respectively in a hypothetical watershed the effects of lid on partitioning of annual water flux and cl flux at bcw is shown in table 6 the enhanced groundwater recharge by 25 7 through lid practices at bcw decreased flood peaks by 77 7 and increased baseflow by 18 7 consequently lid increased baseflow index by 24 7 and decreased runoff coefficient by 4 8 lid thus affects long term water supply for communities for example in the bcw baseflow sustains streamflow downstream where the town of boone drinking water intake is located the increased baseflow agreed with findings from previous studies where impervious surfaces reduced recharge to the groundwater causing a lowered water table and a decrease in baseflow rose and peters 2001 this decline results in an increased area of shallow water habitat with smaller thermal inertia which decreases the stream s ability to withstand a given heat load without substantial increase in water temperature poole and berman 2001 richards et al 1996 gu et al 2015 increased baseflow increased the hydrological connectivity of the landscape which leads to characteristically high biodiversity ward et al 1999 and pollutant removal aubert et al 2016 as far as cl flux is concerned cl load via baseflow dominated stream cl export accounting for 85 and 70 of annual stream cl load for with lid and without respectively the lid implementation increased interflow and baseflow cl load by 20 4 and 18 6 respectively the lid decreased runoff cl load by 80 2 and decreased maximum stream cl concentration by 25 1 the reduced stream cl spikes in winter can be especially beneficial to stream ecosystems because they represent an acute exposure of aquatic organisms to salt overall the lid slightly decreased stream cl load by 1 7 the total cl input was greater than the stream cl export suggesting salt was gradually accumulated in the system and the system had not reached equilibrium the lid implementation did not significantly change stream mean cl concentration p 0 5 the negligible change in stream mean cl concentration seems counterintuitive at first glance because enhanced groundwater recharge by lid practices should bring more salt into groundwater during the winter deicing season as suggested by the 20 4 increase in cl load through groundwater recharge however these salt pulses are greatly diluted by increased low cl rainfall infiltration and subsequent increased groundwater storage when road salt application is absent as a result lid decreased groundwater cl concentration fig 5 c these results are consistent with the recent findings by dietz et al 2017 that permeable asphalt decreased groundwater chloride concentration due to dilution from rainfall during snow free periods in a monitoring study kwiatkowski et al 2007 also found pervious concrete did not increase copper and chloride levels in the groundwater previous studies reported that salt cannot be effectively retained by bioretention due to its inert chemical nature khan et al 2012 however our results suggest lid can retain and dilute rather than remove the road salt through enhanced long term groundwater recharge therefore an integrated understanding of hydrological and solute transport processes at the watershed scale is warranted to evaluate effect of lid systems on salt in groundwater and stream water the simulated time series suggested that lid implementation decreased groundwater cl concentrations due to increased groundwater storage subsequently baseflow fig 5b c nevertheless during the snow season in the first year groundwater cl concentrations with lid were slightly higher than without which might be attributed to enhanced infiltration of salt laden water after salt application this concentration effect was followed by dilution over the rest of the year groundwater cl concentrations negatively correlated to baseflow it gradually increased into summer due to decreased baseflow and then decreased during the fall due to increased baseflow lid led to more dilution in groundwater cl over snow free seasons compared to without fig 5c similarly because lid retained salt laden water the stream cl concentration spikes were less pronounced with lid compared to without during the de icing season fig 5d in fall the stream cl concentrations under baseflow with lid were lower than without due to its lower groundwater cl concentrations note that the stream cl dilution dips during salt free runoff events were less pronounced with lid compared to without which was attributed to lid decreasing low cl runoff water the cumulative distribution function cdf of daily streamflow showed lower flows during storms i e in the 90 100 flow exceedance range with lid than without lid fig 6 a which indicated that lid effectively reduced storm runoff therefore reduced stream flashiness on the other hand there was little difference in cdf of streamflow during baseflow i e 0 90 flow exceedance range suggesting the effects of lid on streamflow are less pronounced during low flow conditions the cdf of daily stream cl concentrations showed slightly lower stream cl concentrations with lid than without in the 40 90 exceedance range indicating lid reduced stream cl concentrations during baseflow conditions fig 6b the reduction in stream cl concentrations during winter salt application events were even more pronounced as indicated by significantly lower stream cl concentrations over the 90 100 exceedance range with lid compared to without in contrast the lower stream cl concentration in the 0 10 exceedance range with lid compared to without indicated that lid decreased contribution of low cl storm runoff to streamflow and therefore led to less stream cl dilution during rainstorms our estimate of cl concentration reduction by lid in this study is conservative because we assumed that total salt application remained constant among the scenarios road salt application might decrease with lid practices such as pervious pavement roseen et al 2014 demonstrated that 64 77 less salt was needed for a porous asphalt lot compared to an impervious asphalt lot between snow storms the absence of standing water on porous asphalt greatly reduced the frequency and amount of salt application needed to control black ice we ran sensitivity analysis to investigate how the benefits of lid implementation vary with watershed and climate characteristics table 7 increasing groundwater storage as indicated by increasing groundwater residence time did not have any significant impact on reduction in stream maximum cl concentration and runoff except reduced baseflow increase larger watershed areas led to less stream maximum cl reduction and greater baseflow increase more precipitation caused less reduction in stream maximum cl and runoff but more baseflow increase less et corresponded to slightly greater reduction in stream maximum cl and runoff and less baseflow increase increasing unsaturated zone thickness weakened reduction in stream maximum cl but strengthened runoff reduction and baseflow increase overall small watersheds with thin soil and small aquifer in dry climate might lead to greatest reduction in stream cl by implementing lid on the other hand the greatest baseflow increase from lid is associated with large watersheds with thick soil and small aquifer in wet climate 3 3 effects of individual lid practice on hydrology and stream cl concentration explicit inclusion of a groundwater reservoir in the model allowed us to quantify changes in groundwater recharge groundwater storage and baseflow in response to lid practices in the analysis based on conditions in the bcw the increase in groundwater recharge after implementing individual lid technology ranged from 0 05 to 1 28 depending on the land use table 8 disconnecting conveyances from impervious surfaces for ldr is the most effective practice the next greatest increase is converting impervious parking lots driveway to pervious pavement in the commercial and hdr areas implementing rain barrels in mdr gives negligible increase in groundwater recharge groundwater recharge is a key protection target for stormwater management increasing groundwater recharge increased baseflow by 0 0 83 for individual lid practices applied for each land use type implementing individual lid practices in each land use type reduces storm runoff 0 21 5 7 table 8 due to the decrease in surface runoff total streamflow decreased slightly 0 02 0 59 in response to various lid practices these results align with previous work showing that lid practices decrease stormwater runoff in modeling studies ahiablame et al 2013 damodaram et al 2010 and experimental studies bedan and clausen 2009 the temporal dynamics of stream and groundwater cl simulated by the model allowed us to estimate stream mean chronic and maximum acute cl levels mean stream cl concentrations an indicator of long term chronic exposure and the maximum stream cl concentration an indicator of short term acute exposure decreased by 0 01 0 74 not significant p 0 05 and 0 03 4 78 respectively after lid practices were implemented this decline is attributed to more salt transport into groundwater through infiltration rather than runoff during snowmelt fig 5b a seemingly small reduction in streamflow and stream salt concentration achieved through lid practices in bcw were due to relatively small changes in the composite cn the smallest composite cn was 47 54 for disconnecting from impervious surface compared to the cn of 48 36 for without which represented a very small reduction this is because each impervious surface area available for lid implementation accounts for only small fraction of bcw e g 2 3 6 8 in table 2 the effects of lid practices could be more pronounced in more urbanized watersheds with greater percentage of impervious surface area several previous studies also found that basin wide effects of lid practices on a watershed scale are not as discernible as plot and field scales ahiablame et al 2013 santhi et al 2001 another reason for small impacts of lid practices is that each scenario represents only one lid applied in one type of urban land use when all lid practices were combined in all urban land uses much greater reduction for both runoff and cl concentrations were observed compared to individual practices table 8 the combined lid increased groundwater recharge and decreased runoff and maximum stream cl by 6 26 27 82 4 78 respectively p 0 05 and therefore would be recommended when retrofitting infrastructure finally as described previously our estimated cl concentration reduction was conservative because we did not account for salt input reduction caused by lid implementation such as porous pavements 3 4 optimum lid practices in bcw our analysis indicates that different implementation strategies may achieve different levels of reduction in runoff and salt contamination depending on the type of urban land use and the specific lid technique fig 7 overall the results indicate that replacing conventional asphalt and concrete with permeable materials such as porous pavement for streets parking lots and driveways performs better than swales rain barrels cisterns green roofs or bioretention in reducing runoff and stream salt contamination in bcw this is because roads and parking lots account for more than 50 of the total impervious surface in bcw these results are consistent with previous studies that credited pervious pavements as a major urban storm management practice for runoff and pollutant load reduction collins et al 2010 dietz 2007 liu et al 2015 disconnecting from impervious surfaces in ldr and installing swales showed moderate potential to reduce runoff and salt contamination disconnecting drainage systems disrupts routes of runoff to streams and thereby increases rainfall infiltration which is especially suited to ldr but not to commercial and hdr due to flooding risk on the other hand rain barrels cisterns green roofs and bioretention systems were least effective in reducing runoff and salt contamination despite large building rooftop areas collected water volumes for rain barrels especially in low density residential areas might be too small to effectively reduce runoff and salt contamination these results have important implications for stormwater management targeting the largest impervious areas with the most cn reducing lid practice for lid implementation may be the most effective way to retrofit lid into existing infrastructure for example porous pavement could be prioritized to reduce runoff and salt contamination in many urban watersheds this analysis clearly shows the important role of land use in determining effectiveness of lid techniques ldr and hdr show the most reduction in runoff and salt contamination because these two land uses are the most dominant urban land uses in bcw table 2 mdr showed moderate potential in reducing runoff and salt contamination while commercial area the smallest urban land use in bcw provided the least opportunity to reduce runoff and salt contamination table 2 these results indicate that lid efforts may be best invested in hdr and ldr areas rather than commercial and mdr areas in bcw implementing lid practice in different land use types is also constrained by their jurisdiction as public or private property urban water managers can make decisions to implement lid practices for public property and could use the model designed here to assess the most effective approach for their particular situation the model could also potentially be used to assess an effective approach for private property with the results then being used to promote positive lid practice among private property owners the results also indicate that different lid practices should be targeted for each land use category for example porous parking lots instead of porous streets should be targeted for commercial areas as it creates disproportionally large reduction in runoff and salt contamination this is because porous parking lots induce the greatest cn reduction among all lid practices converting large commercial parking lots to porous pavement is therefore particularly recommended for a large urban municipality eaton 2018 also found porous pavement provided the largest source of runoff reduction in commercial hdr and industrial urban land uses in an urban watershed in new york permeable pavement for streets and parking lots seemed to be the target lid for hdr and mdr while permeable pavement for streets and bioretention or disconnecting from impervious surfaces are most effective for ldr because ldr is mostly private property outreach efforts toward these owners should emphasize creating bioretention rain gardens or disconnecting drainage from impervious surfaces such as roof gutters driveways and street sidewalks although they are commonly promoted our results indicate that rain barrels are less effective than other lid practices 4 conclusion the process based model proposed here advances other simple cn based runoff models by accounting for the groundwater reservoir and its associated hydrological processes this inclusion allows modelers to explicitly capture baseflow and pollutant transport dynamics many cn based storm runoff models such as li thia do not account for dynamics of groundwater storage and mixing of various waters and therefore cannot simulate a continuous flow system event mean concentrations emcs of pollutants are a common protocol for many stormwater runoff models to simulate water quality however our model showed pollutant concentrations in water reservoirs varied over the seasons and even individual storm events due to human disturbance e g road salt application as well as change in groundwater storage which is subject to many hydrological processes such as et infiltration baseflow discharge etc as a result the model revealed that lid can mitigate salt contamination by allowing groundwater to temporarily store salt that enters in snow seasons followed by rainfall dilution in salt free seasons this model can be particularly useful for urban water managers to determine effective storm water management approaches that align with temporal variations in groundwater storage stream flow and pollutant concentration the cn based modeling approach used in this study allows assessing the effects of various lid practices on pollutant transport at watershed scale lowering the cn of existing impervious surfaces is a reasonable approach to simulate decreased runoff and increased infiltration by lid technologies the model was able to capture the observed stream discharge and stream cl concentration reasonably well at an urban headwater watershed the scenario analysis showed that lid practices including pervious pavement rain barrels cisterns bioretention systems swales green roofs and disconnecting conveyances from impervious surfaces can be effective as retrofits in reducing runoff and salt contamination at a watershed scale implementing lid resulted in reduced runoff and increased baseflow due to increased groundwater recharge stream mean cl concentration stayed unchanged while maximum stream cl concentration decreased after lid implementation our case study in bcw suggests that the effectiveness of lid in reducing runoff and salt pollution depends on both area coverage of impervious surfaces and the lid type permeable pavement especially in commercial and hdr might be the best retrofitting option for many urban watersheds if public acceptance by private property owners is not an issue and there is no flood risk disconnecting from impervious surfaces in ldr areas is also effective in reducing storm runoff and salt contamination in contrast rainfall collection system is not effective in reducing runoff and salt contamination this model can be particularly useful for decision makers as they consider how best to promote lid to protect water resources in their communities the proposed model was designed to strike a proper balance between complexity and practicality more accurate and likely more complex physically based models often require more extensive input data requirements and resources and this limits their wide application in contrast our model used readily accessible land use hydrological and meteorological data the results demonstrate that it is possible to produce a quick screen using more readily available data and a simple watershed model to help planners and decision makers determine if lid would be appropriate for them acknowledgments the authors thank the research institute for environment energy and economics at appalachian state university for supporting a portion of

6494,the rapid movement of water in a complex system of preferential pathways in soils is a common natural phenomenon however quantification of the properties of this phenomenon is not easy and such results are not often found in the literature the paper presents results of quantification of the number of macropores their relative volume and the ratio of water infiltrating through the macropores for five study sites with stony soils located in a mountain catchment of northern slovakia these characteristics were calculated from the saturated and unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivities under the assumptions of the poiseuille s law saturated hydraulic conductivities were estimated by single ring infiltrometer measurements in the field and by falling head method in the laboratory unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were estimated by tension infiltration measurements in the field using a minidisc infiltrometer decagon devices the largest amount of macropores defined as the pores with radius larger than 1 5 mm in the entire soil profile 7 5276 per 1 m2 was found at forest sites overgrown by spruce with high to extremely high stoniness the number of macropores decreased with depth of the soil profile at all study sites the contribution of macropore flow to water infiltration varied from approximately 63 to almost 100 although macropores can conduct a large proportion of water their relative volume is small 0 001 0 9 the relative volume of all macropores active and non active estimated from the soil porosity and the water retention function was in the range 2 23

stream sediments the current research of soil water flow is based on two approaches a macroscopic and a microscopic approach the macroscopic approach assumes that the real soil system can be approximated by a system of capillary tubes of different conductivities and tortuosities childs and collis george 1950 were the first who suggested the relationship between the pore size distribution function and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of a soil they assumed that the soil water retention function reflects the pore size distribution function which is in turn related to the soil hydraulic conductivity their approach was further developed and modified by e g kunze et al 1968 mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 fredlund and xing 1994 and zhai and rahardjo 2015 among many others this approach is frequently used in most soil water flow models vereecken et al 2016 on the other hand the microscopic approach to the soil water flow research which has been quickly developed in the last decade describes water flow in individual pores and pore network systems using the percolation theory hunt et al 2013 miao et al 2017 jarvis et al 2017 this approach rejects the assumption of the macroscopic approach of approximating the real soil by a system of capillary tubes it also questions the validity of the relationship between the soil water retention curve the pore size distribution and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity hunt et al 2013 although the approach represents a promising theoretical direction in soil physics and water flow modelling it currently lacks relevant measurable pore network characteristics for highly heterogeneous soils and at larger scales the objective of our work was to obtain the characteristics of macropore flow in stony soils covered by forest and grass in two different parts of asmall mountain catchment we have quantified the number of macropores their relative volume and the ratio of water flow through the macropores at different soil depths these characteristics were obtained by comparing the saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities using the assumptions of the classical macroscopic approach supplementary information was obtained about the soil matrix porosity and retention unlike previous studies our research provides information about the macropore flow characteristics of stony soils at several depths of the soil profile 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the measurements were carried out in the mountain catchment of jaloveck√Ω creek slovakia fig 1 the catchment consists of two different

further sub layers when the stoniness rapidly changed and more samples were needed to be collected stoniness distribution of the four soil pits and variability of stoniness as indicated by measurement of induced polarization along the 20 m long hillslope are shown in figs 1 2 of supplementary material the sites located in the forest sites 2 3 and 4 have cambisol soils with a sandy loam texture formed on the crystalline bedrock with moderate 10 25 and high about 25 50 stoniness and psephitic soils with an extremely high stoniness 50 70 the forest at the sites is about 130 years old and dominated by norway spruce the low undergrowth forest vegetation is usually represented by blueberry and raspberry the stoniness was classified according to the morphogenetic classification system of slovak soils societas pedologica slovaca 2014 the soils were classified according to the iuss working group wrb 2015 the fine earth texture was classified according to the usda classification table 1 the number of measurements at different sites and soil depths are given in table 2 shown later in results table 1 provides textural information of genetic soil horizons as well as information about characteristics of rock fragments i e their relative volumes and geological origin 2 2 characteristics of macropore flow characteristics of macropore flow number of macropores their relative volume and the contribution of macropore flow to water infiltration were evaluated using the approach of watson and luxmoore 1986 that is based on the comparison of saturated and unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivities an alternative evaluation of the volume of all macropores i e both active and non active was based on the porosity of the fine soil fraction i e soil matrix and the soil water retention curve similarly as done by laine kaulio et al 2015 soil stoniness was taken into account during evaluation of the results soil stoniness was estimated at each study site from the archimedes law by water displacement after pouring stones into the bucket with known volume of water hlav√°ƒçikov√° et al 2015 for the estimation of the characteristics of macropore flow watson and luxmoore 1986 assumed that the infiltration rate during steady state infiltration equals the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity then poiseuille s law can be used to interpret the data obtained using infiltration measurements assuming that during laminar flow water flows through pores that resemble parallel straight tubes of the same circular cross section if water flows through an entire pore the flux q i m3 s 1 through thepore can be expressed as 1 q i œÄ œÅ w g r p 4 8 Œ∑ Œ¥ h l where œÅw is the water density kgm 3 g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s 2 Œ∑ is the dynamic viscosity of water 1 002 10 3 kgm 1 s 1 at temperature t 20 c r p is the macropore radius m and Œ¥h l is the hydraulic gradient a change of the hydraulic head h over a distance l assuming steady flow at the unit hydraulic

infiltration water infiltrates into the soil through all active non closed pores of different radii while during tension infiltration it infiltrates only through pores with radii smaller than the threshold radius the difference between suctions applied during the infiltration experiments and the threshold radius of the effective pores r p cm is expressed using the capillary head equation assuming a zero wetting angle between water and pore walls and a water density of 1000 kg m 3 equation 1 can be reorganized and rewritten in asimplified form as 4 r p 0 15 h where r p is the radius of pores cm and h cm is the suction head of the infiltrometer watson andluxmoore 1986 made their measurements at the same location first with a double ring ponding infiltrometer followed by a tension infiltrometer at different tensions they assumed that steady state infiltration rates corresponded directly to saturated or unsaturated hydraulic conductivities our measurements were carried out at the same site within approximately 10x10 meters but not exactly at the same location and the same time acknowledging the high variability of soil hydraulic characteristics at small spatial scales such approach could provide a more realistic assessment of the range of infiltration rates with a smaller number of experiments which is important in a roadless mountain terrain the difference between the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s obtained using either ponded infiltration or laboratory measurements on undisturbed soil samples by the falling head method and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity obtained using the minidisc infiltrometer at suctions of 2 cm or 1 cm k h 2 cm or k h 1 cm corresponds to the contribution of macropores with a radius r 0 75 mm or r 1 5 mm respectively different suction heads were used to see the contribution of different smaller or larger macropores to infiltration macropore flow characteristics were calculated from the mean saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities shown in table 2 if two mean k s values were available either from laboratory measurements or a single ring infiltrometer macropore characteristics were calculated for each k s separately and final values were averaged table 3 2 3 soil hydraulic conductivities 2 3 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was estimated on the basis of field and laboratory measurements single ring infiltrometer measurements were performed in the field a total number of measurements was 16 an infiltrometer with a diameter of 28 cm was carefully inserted to adepth of 10 cm the water depth inside the ring was within the range of 4 cm 1 6 cm when refilling with a constant amount of water the saturated hydraulic conductivity in this case the field saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated from the cumulative infiltration curve versus time discrete points were fitted with the analytical cumulative infiltration function of philip 1957 cited by kut√≠lek and nielsen 1994 because the 1d vertical flow has been assumed to be dominant several infiltration measurements were performed at the soil surface and if possible at different soil depths depending on the amount of stones and tree roots which complicated the measurements the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured in the field is usually smaller than the saturated hydraulic conductivity estimated using laboratory measurements because of the presence of entrapped air in closed pores the k s values estimated in the laboratory were obtained using the falling head method at undisturbed soil samples with a volume of 100 cm3 taken from the field reynolds and elrick 2002 a total number of soil samples was 106 these samples were taken from various depths from areas with a small rock fragment content the number of collected samples depended highly on the ease of taking undisturbed samples from different soil horizons details are specified later in the results section after conductivity measurements were concluded the volume of rock fragments from each sample was carefully measured the samples were oven dried at 60 c till the constant weight the rock fragments were separated by dry sieving through a 2 mm mesh the volume of stones was obtained by water displacement using the law of archimedes and graduated cylinder with known volume of water the saturated hydraulic conductivities estimated both in the field and in the laboratory are below denoted as k s 2 3 2 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k was measured in the field using the minidisc infiltrometer decagon devices under tension which corresponded to a negative pressure head of h 1 cm or 2 cm i e with a suction of 0 1 or 0 2 kpa the total number of measurements was 100 the zhang s 1997 method cited by decagon 2006 of transient infiltration was used to estimate k the method is based on known cumulative transient flow data and the soil texture or retention curve parameters the calculation procedure is given in the manual of the minidisc infiltrometer decagon 2006 several measurements were carried out at different soil depths at each site the number of measurements depended on the specific situation in the soil profile and on the possibility to conduct the measurements the minidisc infiltrometer is a practical easily transportable device suitable for measurements in a hardly accessible terrain however because of a small contact area with the soil it is recommended to perform multiple measurements at one site 2 4 volume of all macropores the porosity of the fine soil fraction i e the soil matrix was obtained from calculated bulk density and measured particle density casagrande method of the fine soil fraction hartge and horn 2016 the retention curves of undisturbed soil samples were measured in the pressure chamber soil moisture equipment santa barbara results not shown in this paper the water content of the soil matrix was calculated from the bulk soil water content and the known volume of stones in the soil sample the volume of all macropores i e both active and non active with a radius of 0 75 mm and larger was then estimated as a difference between the fine soil fraction porosity and the soil water content measured at the soil moisture potential of 2 cm a measured point on the retention curve this point of the retention curve was measured using the tension method i e the water level was decreased by 2 cm after previous saturation 3 results we present first the results of the hydraulic conductivity measurements because they formed the base for the estimation of macropore flow characteristics 3 1 saturated hydraulic conductivities the largest saturated hydraulic conductivities k s were measured at all sites in the upper organic soil horizon their values decreased with soil depth figs 2 and 3 the k s values at the forested sites at the soil depth of 0 10 cm were clearly larger by one order of magnitude than at the grassland sites the k s values of 1152 cm h 1 ƒçervenec forest 1072 and 2922 cm h 1 jaloveck√° valley and 2880 cm h 1 pod lyscom reveal an extremely high infiltration capacity of the upper forest floor organic soil horizon at the soil depth of 10 50 cm k s varied in the range of 10 100 cm h 1 ƒçervenec forest 14 245 cm h 1 pod lyscom and 14 466 cm h 1 jaloveck√° valley at the soil depth of 50 cm and deeper k s varied in the range of 20 152 cm h 1 at all three locations in the forest at the sites with the grass cover the largest k s values in the upper soil organic horizon were 116 and 154 cm h 1 at soil depths deeper than 10 cm 10 60 cm at ƒçervenec an open area and 10 30 cm at ondra≈°ov√° the k s values varied in the range of 0 9 65 cm h 1 with a mean value of 15 3 cm h 1 at ƒçervenec open area and in the range of 4 23 cm h 1 with a mean value of 8 9 cm h 1 at the ondra≈°ov√° site 3 2 unsaturated hydraulic conductivities unsaturated hydraulic conductivities k were at all sites one or more orders of magnitude smaller than saturated hydraulic conductivities and their values varied between 0 04 and 9 9 cm h 1 figs 2 and 3 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity did not show any clear relationship with the soil depth as expected hydraulic conductivities measured at higher suction 2 cm were smaller than those measured at lower suctions 1 cm the magnitude of the difference is well documented at study site pod lyscom fig 2 mean values of saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities measured at study sites and at different soil depths together with a number of measurements the type of measurements and genetic horizons are summarised in table 2 the information about genetic soil horizons primarily about their depths is important because it determines the properties of particular soil layers 3 3 fine soil porosity the porosity of the soil matrix fine soil decreased with the soil depth at all study sites the sites located in the forest ƒçervenec forest pod lyscom the jaloveck√° valley showed higher porosities of the fine soil fraction that varied from 0 65 to 0 85 cm3 cm 3 than the grassland sites on the carbonate bedrock ƒçervenec open area and in fluvisol in the jaloveck√Ω creek valley ondra≈°ov√° where porosities varied in the range of 0 51 cm3 cm 3 0 67 cm3 cm 3 fig 4 3 4 macropore flow characteristics macropore characteristics assessed via poiseuille s equation and the stoniness measured in the soil pits are given in table 3 the highest number of macropores with a radius larger than 0 75 mm or 1 5 mm occurred in the soil depth 0 10 cm table 3 they varied between 3345 and 5276 per 1 m2 the jaloveck√° valley andpod lyscom sites respectively we assume that the variability among sites is related to site conditions lithology slope inclination position in the catchment vegetation and stoniness the number of macropores as well as their effective volumes decreased with soil depth the number of macropores with a radius exceeding 1 5 mm at the forested site ƒçervenec forest was higher than at the nearby grassland site ƒçervenec open area but smaller than at the jaloveck√° valley and pod lyscom sites one of the reasons is the smaller suction 1 cm applied during tension infiltration measurements at the ƒçervenec forest site and the ondra≈°ov√° site and thus a smaller number of pores excluded from infiltration the numbers of macropores at two other forested sites jaloveck√° valley andpod lyscom were comparable and the ratio of water flowing through the macropores at these two sites was extremely high 98 3 99 8 this could explain an extremely high soil infiltration capacity at the latter site when 15 l of water applied to the soil surface area of approximately 25 25 cm in 1 min did not result in any overland flow or visible outflow on the hillslope a high number of macropores in the soil surface layer of 0 10 cm was also documented at the ondra≈°ov√° site where the contribution of macropore flow to the soil water flux was 98 9 the macropore flow contribution at the site decreased with the soil depth down to 90 84 the characteristics of macropore flow at the site pod lyscom can be compared for two different threshold values of the macropore radius because they were estimated on the basis of two tension infiltration measurements at suctions of 1 cm and 2 cm the difference between the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measured at a higher tension 2 cm is larger than at alower tension 1 cm and therefore the number of macropores with a radius larger than 0 75 mm is larger than that estimated for a radius of 1 5 mm and larger table 3 also reveals high contribution of macropore flow to overall infiltration in the stony soil with a large and extremely large stoniness according to morphogenetic classification system of slovak soils societas pedologica slovaca 2014 at the jalovecka valley site the volume of macropores estimated in our study using the porosity and the soil water retention curves was larger than that estimated by the watson and luxmoore method results are available in table 3 column 7 for example the relative volume of macropores at the jaloveck√° valley site was 23 13 8 and 4 at soil depths of 5 10 cm 10 25 cm 30 45 cm and 70 75 cm respectively however it should be kept in mind that this volume represents the volume of all macropores with a radius exceeding 0 75 mm also the hydrologically inactive ones comparison of the relationships between stoniness and macropore flow characteristics number of macropores or relative volume of macropores providedinteresting results fig 5 illustrates the relationship between the stoniness and therelative volume of macropores or the contribution of macropore flow to water infiltration the results indicate positive correlation between the stoniness and relative volume of macropores for pores with radius between 0 75 and 1 5 mm in the range of stoniness 30 60 4 discussion the study presents results of measurements in stony soils saturated hydraulic conductivities ks were by one or more orders of magnitude larger than the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities k and also showed larger variability the reason is that the ks depends on the presence or absence of large pores and is determined mainly by the soil structure which is very variable in time and space in the case of stony soils this variability may be even larger contrary to k s the k characterizes the soil matrix and depends primarily on more stable soil characteristics i e the soil texture beven and german 2013 extremely large saturated hydraulic conductivities in the spruce forest floor horizon and correspondingly larger differences between k s and k resulted in an extremely large estimated number of macropores in the forest floor large saturated hydraulic conductivities of the forest floor horizon were also documented by wessolek et al 2008 with a value of k s 1090 cm day 1 in a partially decomposed of horizon the decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivities with the soil depth at all sites can be caused besides other factors also by the presence of rock fragments which usually increase with the soil depth hlav√°ƒçikov√° et al 2016 the k s values obtained in the field by a single ring infiltrometer denoted in figs 2 and 3 by an asterisk have ahigher weight and are more representative because they were measured for larger soil representative elementary volumes revs than the undisturbed soil samples with a volume of 100 cm3 figs 2 and 3 show that except for the forest floor the field k s values were always within the range obtained in the laboratory using small soil samples since the k s values at all study sites were relatively large several cm per hour we assumed that vertical water flow dominated soil water movement and that horizontal flow was negligible soils have usually higher porosities in their surface layers where hydrological chemical and biological processes are more intensive this was proven also in our study all three sites located in the forest at cambisols with high or extremely high stoniness 25 70 ƒçervenec forest pod lyscom jaloveck√° valley featured higher porosities of the fine soil fractions than the soil covered with grass ƒçervenec open area and the soil in alluvium ondra≈°ov√° there are more reasons for that the first one is the different vegetation cover the forest topsoil layers can show larger porosities than grasslands bachmair et al 2010 the second reason is the presence of rock fragments in soil poesen and lavee 1994 showed that fine soil fraction of a stony soil can have larger porosities than that of a non stony soil the reason is that processes in the stony soils e g the decay of organic matter occur mainly in the fine soil fraction also rock fragments can create a kind of skeleton preventing voids from being filled with a finer material fi√®s et al 2002 contrary to forested sites soil porosities under the grassland on the carbonate bedrock ƒçervenec open area and in fluvisol in the jaloveck√Ω creek valley ondra≈°ov√° were smaller the leptosol present on the carbonate bedrock at the ƒçervenec open area site has a specific soil texture the ratio of silt to sand particles is approximately 1 1 there and these two fractions represent 92 of the entire soil texture table 1 in effect the smaller silt particles can fill larger pores or voids in the soil and decrease soil porosity the evidences of intensive chemical weathering of the low permeable bedrock were observed at the site ephemeral presence of water table and leached oxides in the soil rock fragments are of smaller dimensions they are easily weatherable compared to fragments of crystalline rocks gneiss granodiorite occurring at the forest sites as a result the soil at the ƒçervenec open area site is less permeable compared to other sites comparison of soils at ƒçervenec open area with other sites presented above indicates that the soil structure and texture properties of bedrock and rock fragments and particular ongoing pedogenetic processes can affect soil characteristics e g soil porosity hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention a decrease in the number of macropores with the soil depth is a common phenomenon and was found also by bachmair et al 2010 ameli et al 2016 and di prima et al 2018 watson and luxmoore 1986 estimated approximately 96 contribution of macropore flow through pores with a diameter larger than 0 1 mm to water infiltration in the forest soil they also noted that macropores can transport a large percentage of infiltrating water but their relative amount in the soil can be very small similar conclusions have been reported by other researchers alaoui and hebling 2006 showed that only 0 23 2 of the relative volume of macropores in the soil with grass cover transported 74 100 of infiltrated water they examined the portion of macropores participating in preferential flow by dye infiltration experiments and the image analysis lin et al 1996 documented a relative volume of macropores at 10 while the contribution of macropores to infiltration was 89 the quantification of macropore flow the number of macropores and their portion on infiltration in stony soils is not common in the literature we have found only one article in which the number of macropores was related to the stoniness of the soil baetens et al 2009 quantified the number of macropores in the topsoil layer of the stony soils in arid areas of chile using the methodology of watson and luxmoore 1986 they found that the coarse fragment content was positively related to the estimated number of pores with diameters between 1 and 0 25 mm our results show fig 5 that while the relative volume of pores with a radius greater than 0 75 mm tends to increase with the stoniness up to the threshold of about 60 no relationship was indicated for pores greater than 1 5 mm fig 5 also indicates that the contribution of macropore flow to water infiltration is slightly greater for pores with a radius above 0 75 mm than for pores greater than 1 5 mm and it tends to rise with the stoniness on the other hand the macropore flow contribution for pores greater than 1 5 mm is not related to the stoniness slightly greater contribution of macropore flow in pores with radius above 0 75 mm could be related to their higher and less variable relative volume compare the upper right panels of fig 5 however the number of measurements for these pores radius 0 75 mm is not very high more measurements would be needed to validate the finding the macroscopic approach used in our study indirectly determines the characteristics of the macropores the radius and the number of macropores that contribute to pf watson and luxmoore 1986 used the results of infiltration measurements by ponded and tension infiltration at different tensions this concept of water flow was also used for the quantification of macropore flow in the unsaturated zone in some models e g in the rzwqm ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2003 the concept also corresponds to one of the possible methods for the macropore flow quantification recommended by angulo jaramillo et al 2016 the disadvantage of the approach is that it assumes a simplified geometry of the macropores and water flow in them through the entire cross section the results thus overestimate the macropore flow capacity jarvis et al 2016 while we are aware of the limitations of the methodology it was chosen because of the difficulties related with the application of other approaches in stony soils that do not contain only small rock fragments but also big boulders it is questionable if the microscopic approach based on the percolation theory is applicable in stony soils furthermore there is a number of studies measured both saturated and unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivities without attempting to estimate the macropore flow characteristics a review of collected data from other studies which were focused on other objectives could provide valuable information on some hydrological processes such as catchment or hillslope runoff formation the number of soil samples and measurements in our study was limited by the field conditions since except for one site all sites were located in a roadless mountain terrain however since it is still true that mountains represent some of the blackest black boxes in the hydrological cycle assessment despite of their importance for the distribution of water over the continents kleme≈° 1990 our study was aimed specifically at this environment the number of soil samples or measurements required to provide representative conclusions depends on statistical characteristics of measured variables the mean value the coefficient of variation the level of confidence and the acceptable error as an illustration the international co operative programme on assessment and monitoring of air pollution effects on forests icp forests revealed enormous variability of forest soil≈õ characteristics even within asingle monitoring plot for example the number of subsamples for two intensive study plots in belgium varied from 7 for the analysis of soil nitrogen c v was 13 to 83 for the analysis of organic carbon c v was 45 cools and de vos 2013 as the hydraulic conductivity belongs to properties with a large variability e g c v was in the range of 100 185 according to jaƒçka et al 2016 it can be assumed that an even larger number of samples would be needed to obtain representative results from the point of view mathematical statistics however this is hardly possible in larger mountain catchments the number of saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements in our study varied from 2 to 11 and for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity from 1 to 10 per a soil layer over approximately 1 m2 since in many cases several soil layers belong to the same soil genetic horizon the measurements can represent properties of a particular soil horizon the team of authors who recently collected and prepared the soil water infiltration global database rahmati et al 2018 noted that hydraulic conductivities obtained on the base of pedotransfer functions ptfs that are widely used in hydrological modelling can provide the results that are far from the reality and stated that information on infiltration in clayey sandy textured and stony soils is still lacking our study attempts to contribute to filling this gap by presenting the information on hydraulic conductivities and macropore characteristics of stony soils from locations with different elevation geology and vegetation cover 5 conclusions the characteristics of macropore flow were estimated for stony soils at three mountain sites with coniferous forest and one mountain and one foothill site with grassland by comparing saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities the largest saturated hydraulic conductivities k s were measured in the spruce forest organic floor horizon the k s values decreased with soil depth at all sites unsaturated hydraulic conductivities measured at tension 0 1 or 0 2 kpa were at all sites one or two order of magnitude smaller than the k s values the largest number of macropores was estimated in the soil organic horizon at the soil depth of 0 10 cm at all sites the number of macropores decreased with soil depth the number of macropores at sites with spruce forest and the high to extremely high soil stoniness was larger in the entire soil profile than at the grassland sites while the number of macropores for pores with a radius greater than 0 75 mm tends to increase with the stoniness up to the threshold of about 60 no relationship was indicated for pores with a radius greater than 1 5 mm although the proportion of macropores in the total soil volume is very small macropores can transfer most water infiltrating into the soil the results of our measurements show that water infiltration in mountain forest stony soils is dominated by macropores declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

6494,the rapid movement of water in a complex system of preferential pathways in soils is a common natural phenomenon however quantification of the properties of this phenomenon is not easy and such results are not often found in the literature the paper presents results of quantification of the number of macropores their relative volume and the ratio of water infiltrating through the macropores for five study sites with stony soils located in a mountain catchment of northern slovakia these characteristics were calculated from the saturated and unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivities under the assumptions of the poiseuille s law saturated hydraulic conductivities were estimated by single ring infiltrometer measurements in the field and by falling head method in the laboratory unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were estimated by tension infiltration measurements in the field using a minidisc infiltrometer decagon devices the largest amount of macropores defined as the pores with radius larger than 1 5 mm in the entire soil profile 7 5276 per 1 m2 was found at forest sites overgrown by spruce with high to extremely high stoniness the number of macropores decreased with depth of the soil profile at all study sites the contribution of macropore flow to water infiltration varied from approximately 63 to almost 100 although macropores can conduct a large proportion of water their relative volume is small 0 001 0 9 the relative volume of all macropores active and non active estimated from the soil porosity and the water retention function was in the range 2 23 keywords macropores hydraulic conductivity ponding infiltration tension infiltration canopy 1 introduction the movement of water in a soil is determined by soil properties which are the result of several mutually interconnected processes lin et al 2015 vereecken et al 2016 van der meij et al 2018 preferential flow pf of water through the soil represents a phenomenon in which water percolating faster through the preferential pathways does not have enough time to equilibrate with water that moves more slowly through the soil matrix ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2003 gerke 2006 as a result flow fields with

et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 reported that the number of scientific papers devoted to stony soils since 2003 has been rapidly increasing yet the information on the relationships of the rock fragments and hydrological processes is limited the quantification of hydraulic properties and processes in stony soils is complicated because of large heterogeneity of soils containing the fine soil fraction soil mineral particles smaller than 2 mm as well as several times larger rock fragments gravel stones even boulders many studies investigated the effect of rock fragments in the topsoil layer e g cerd√† 2001 chen et al 2012 verbist et al 2013 and were focused on the soil erosion verbist et al 2009 jim√©nez et al 2016 gong et al 2018 rodrigo comino 2018 poesen 2018 or on the carbon distribution on the top soil rom√°n s√°nchez et al 2018 fewer studies analysed the plant available water content cousin et al 2003 water content measurements coppola et al 2013 and sampling techniques ilek and kucza 2014 or attempted to visualize preferential flow at different depths of stony soils sohrt et al 2014 jaƒçka et al 2018 methodologies provided by studies of surface deposits in urbanized areas goutaland et al 2013 ben slimene et al 2017 can be promising also for the characterization of stony soils which often comprise deluvial or glacio fluvial deposits mixed with the fine earth component overlaying the bedrock interface it is expected that rock fragments their size shape position and spatial distribution in the soil can strongly influence the stony soils properties and affect the soil water movement infiltration chen et al 2012 the occurrence of runoff hlav√°ƒçikov√° et al 2016 and sediment properties sklar et al 2017 rock fragments together with fine earth component make the soil an effective medium for water flow with very different properties sklar et al 2017 found out systematic variations of rock fragment≈õ size at hillslopes determined by specific lithology climate conditions erosion rate and topography these variations together with ongoing weathering determine the specific movement of rock fragments into the streams ultimately they influence the properties of stream sediments the current research of soil water flow is based on two approaches a macroscopic and a microscopic approach the macroscopic approach assumes that the real soil system can be approximated by a system of capillary tubes of different conductivities and tortuosities childs and collis george 1950 were the first who suggested the relationship between the pore size distribution function and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of a soil they assumed that the soil water retention function reflects the pore size distribution function which is in turn related to the soil hydraulic conductivity their approach was further developed and modified by e g kunze et al 1968 mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 fredlund and xing 1994 and zhai and rahardjo 2015 among many others this approach is frequently used in most soil water flow models vereecken et al 2016 on the other hand the microscopic approach to the soil water flow research which has been quickly developed in the last decade describes water flow in individual pores and pore network systems using the percolation theory hunt et al 2013 miao et al 2017 jarvis et al 2017 this approach rejects the assumption of the macroscopic approach of approximating the real soil by a system of capillary tubes it also questions the validity of the relationship between the soil water retention curve the pore size distribution and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity hunt et al 2013 although the approach represents a promising theoretical direction in soil physics and water flow modelling it currently lacks relevant measurable pore network characteristics for highly heterogeneous soils and at larger scales the objective of our work was to obtain the characteristics of macropore flow in stony soils covered by forest and grass in two different parts of asmall mountain catchment we have quantified the number of macropores their relative volume and the ratio of water flow through the macropores at different soil depths these characteristics were obtained by comparing the saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities using the assumptions of the classical macroscopic approach supplementary information was obtained about the soil matrix porosity and retention unlike previous studies our research provides information about the macropore flow characteristics of stony soils at several depths of the soil profile 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the measurements were carried out in the mountain catchment of jaloveck√Ω creek slovakia fig 1 the catchment consists of two different parts the mountain part an area of 22 2 km2 an elevation range of 820 2178 m a s l is formed mainly by crystalline rocks covered by fluvioglacial sediments and slope debris the land use is represented by coniferous forest dwarf pine alpine meadows and bare rock the foothill part of the catchment an area of 23 km2 an elevation range of 560 820 m a s l is predominantly of sedimentary rocks of paleogene flysh covered by alluvium the land use is represented by the agricultural land meadows fields and three small urbanized areas soil hydraulic characteristics were measured at five sites 1

an area of 1 m2 dug to the depth of approximately 70 95 cm to the soil bedrock at four study sites in the mountain part of the catchment sites 1 4 in fig 1 and table 1 the volume of stones and boulders was measured directly in the field disturbed soil samples of volume 2000 3000 cm3 were collected for each characteristic soil layer to evaluate the fine soil fraction and the volume of the gravel part of stoniness in the laboratory hlav√°ƒçikov√° et al 2015 at the ondra≈°ov√° study site the soil pit was dug only to the soil depth of approximately 35 cm soil horizons were divided into further sub layers when the stoniness rapidly changed and more samples were needed to be collected stoniness distribution of the four soil pits and variability of stoniness as indicated by measurement of induced polarization along the 20 m long hillslope are shown in figs 1 2 of supplementary material the sites located in the forest sites 2 3 and 4 have cambisol soils with a sandy loam texture formed on the crystalline bedrock with moderate 10 25 and high about 25 50 stoniness and psephitic soils with an extremely high stoniness 50 70 the forest at the sites is about 130 years old and dominated by norway spruce the low undergrowth forest vegetation is usually represented by blueberry and raspberry the stoniness was classified according to the morphogenetic classification system of slovak soils societas pedologica slovaca 2014 the soils were classified according to the iuss working group wrb 2015 the fine earth texture was classified according to the usda classification table 1 the number of measurements at different sites and soil depths are given in table 2 shown later in results table 1 provides textural information of genetic soil horizons as well as information about characteristics of rock fragments i e their relative volumes and geological origin 2 2 characteristics of macropore flow characteristics of macropore flow number of macropores their relative volume and the contribution of macropore flow to water infiltration were evaluated using the approach of watson and luxmoore 1986 that is based on the comparison of saturated and unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivities an alternative evaluation of the volume of all macropores i e both active and non active was based on the porosity of the fine soil fraction i e soil matrix and the soil water retention curve similarly as done by laine kaulio et al 2015 soil stoniness was taken into account during evaluation of the results soil stoniness was estimated at each study site from the archimedes law by water displacement after pouring stones into the bucket with known volume of water hlav√°ƒçikov√° et al 2015 for the estimation of the characteristics of macropore flow watson and luxmoore 1986 assumed that the infiltration rate during steady state infiltration equals the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity then poiseuille s law can be used to interpret the data obtained using infiltration measurements assuming that during laminar flow water flows through pores that resemble parallel straight tubes of the same circular cross section if water flows through an entire pore the flux q i m3 s 1 through thepore can be expressed as 1 q i œÄ œÅ w g r p 4 8 Œ∑ Œ¥ h l where œÅw is the water density kgm 3 g is the gravitational acceleration 9 81 m s 2 Œ∑ is the dynamic viscosity of water 1 002 10 3 kgm 1 s 1 at temperature t 20 c r p is the macropore radius m and Œ¥h l is the hydraulic gradient a change of the hydraulic head h over a distance l assuming steady flow at the unit hydraulic gradient the number of macropores per unit area n p can be calculated as watson and luxmoore 1986 2 n p 8 Œ∑ Œ¥ k p œÄ œÅ w g r p 4 where Œ¥k p is the difference between hydraulic conductivities measured at different pressure heads e g k s measured by ponded infiltration at the atmospheric pressure head and k i measured by tension infiltration at the suction head h i and r p is the maximum radius of pores through which the water can infiltrate at the suction head h i the effective volume of macropores Œ∏ p i e of active macropores is given as 3 Œ∏ p n p œÄ r p 2 during ponded infiltration water infiltrates into the soil through all active non closed pores of different radii while during tension infiltration it infiltrates only through pores with radii smaller than the threshold radius the difference between suctions applied during the infiltration experiments and the threshold radius of the effective pores r p cm is expressed using the capillary head equation assuming a zero wetting angle between water and pore walls and a water density of 1000 kg m 3 equation 1 can be reorganized and rewritten in asimplified form as 4 r p 0 15 h where r p is the radius of pores cm and h cm is the suction head of the infiltrometer watson andluxmoore 1986 made their measurements at the same location first with a double ring ponding infiltrometer followed by a tension infiltrometer at different tensions they assumed that steady state infiltration rates corresponded directly to saturated or unsaturated hydraulic conductivities our measurements were carried out at the same site within approximately 10x10 meters but not exactly at the same location and the same time acknowledging the high variability of soil hydraulic characteristics at small spatial scales such approach could provide a more realistic assessment of the range of infiltration rates with a smaller number of experiments which is important in a roadless mountain terrain the difference between the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s obtained using either ponded infiltration or laboratory measurements on undisturbed soil samples by the falling head method and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity obtained using the minidisc infiltrometer at suctions of 2 cm or 1 cm k h 2 cm or k h 1 cm corresponds to the contribution of macropores with a radius r 0 75 mm or r 1 5 mm respectively different suction heads were used to see the contribution of different smaller or larger macropores to infiltration macropore flow characteristics were calculated from the mean saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities shown in table 2 if two mean k s values were available either from laboratory measurements or a single ring infiltrometer macropore characteristics were calculated for each k s separately and final values were averaged table 3 2 3 soil hydraulic conductivities 2 3 1 saturated hydraulic conductivity the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was estimated on the basis of field and laboratory measurements single ring infiltrometer measurements were performed in the field a total number of measurements was 16 an infiltrometer with a diameter of 28 cm was carefully inserted to adepth of 10 cm the water depth inside the ring was within the range of 4 cm 1 6 cm when refilling with a constant amount of water the saturated hydraulic conductivity in this case the field saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated from the cumulative infiltration curve versus time discrete points were fitted with the analytical cumulative infiltration function of philip 1957 cited by kut√≠lek and nielsen 1994 because the 1d vertical flow has been assumed to be dominant several infiltration measurements were performed at the soil surface and if possible at different soil depths depending on the amount of stones and tree roots which complicated the measurements the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured in the field is usually smaller than the saturated hydraulic conductivity estimated using laboratory measurements because of the presence of entrapped air in closed pores the k s values estimated in the laboratory were obtained using the falling head method at undisturbed soil samples with a volume of 100 cm3 taken from the field reynolds and elrick 2002 a total number of soil samples was 106 these samples were taken from various depths from areas with a small rock fragment content the number of collected samples depended highly on the ease of taking undisturbed samples from different soil horizons details are specified later in the results section after conductivity measurements were concluded the volume of rock fragments from each sample was carefully measured the samples were oven dried at 60 c till the constant weight the rock fragments were separated by dry sieving through a 2 mm mesh the volume of stones was obtained by water displacement using the law of archimedes and graduated cylinder with known volume of water the saturated hydraulic conductivities estimated both in the field and in the laboratory are below denoted as k s 2 3 2 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k was measured in the field using the minidisc infiltrometer decagon devices under tension which corresponded to a negative pressure head of h 1 cm or 2 cm i e with a suction of 0 1 or 0 2 kpa the total number of measurements was 100 the zhang s 1997 method cited by decagon 2006 of transient infiltration was used to estimate k the method is based on known cumulative transient flow data and the soil texture or retention curve parameters the calculation procedure is given in the manual of the minidisc infiltrometer decagon 2006 several measurements were carried out at different soil depths at each site the number of measurements depended on the specific situation in the soil profile and on the possibility to conduct the measurements the minidisc infiltrometer is a practical easily transportable device suitable for measurements in a hardly accessible terrain however because of a small contact area with the soil it is recommended to perform multiple measurements at one site 2 4 volume of all macropores the porosity of the fine soil fraction i e the soil matrix was obtained from calculated bulk density and measured particle density casagrande method of the fine soil fraction hartge and horn 2016 the retention curves of undisturbed soil samples were measured in the pressure chamber soil moisture equipment santa barbara results not shown in this paper the water content of the soil matrix was calculated from the bulk soil water content and the known volume of stones in the soil sample the volume of all macropores i e both active and non active with a radius of 0 75 mm and larger was then estimated as a difference between the fine soil fraction porosity and the soil water content measured at the soil moisture potential of 2 cm a measured point on the retention curve this point of the retention curve was measured using the tension method i e the water level was decreased by 2 cm after previous saturation 3 results we present first the results of the hydraulic conductivity measurements because they formed the base for the estimation of macropore flow characteristics 3 1 saturated hydraulic conductivities the largest saturated hydraulic conductivities k s were measured at all sites in the upper organic soil horizon their values decreased with soil depth figs 2 and 3 the k s values at the forested sites at the soil depth of 0 10 cm were clearly larger by one order of magnitude than at the grassland sites the k s values of 1152 cm h 1 ƒçervenec forest 1072 and 2922 cm h 1 jaloveck√° valley and 2880 cm h 1 pod lyscom reveal an extremely high infiltration capacity of the upper forest floor organic soil horizon at the soil depth of 10 50 cm k s varied in the range of 10 100 cm h 1 ƒçervenec forest 14 245 cm h 1 pod lyscom and 14 466 cm h 1 jaloveck√° valley at the soil depth of 50 cm and deeper k s varied in the range of 20 152 cm h 1 at all three locations in the forest at the sites with the grass cover the largest k s values in the upper soil organic horizon were 116 and 154 cm h 1 at soil depths deeper than 10 cm 10 60 cm at ƒçervenec an open area and 10 30 cm at ondra≈°ov√° the k s values varied in the range of 0 9 65 cm h 1 with a mean value of 15 3 cm h 1 at ƒçervenec open area and in the range of 4 23 cm h 1 with a mean value of 8 9 cm h 1 at the ondra≈°ov√° site 3 2 unsaturated hydraulic conductivities unsaturated hydraulic conductivities k were at all sites one or more orders of magnitude smaller than saturated hydraulic conductivities and their values varied between 0 04 and 9 9 cm h 1 figs 2 and 3 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity did not show any clear relationship with the soil depth as expected hydraulic conductivities measured at higher suction 2 cm were smaller than those measured at lower suctions 1 cm the magnitude of the difference is well documented at study site pod lyscom fig 2 mean values of saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities measured at study sites and at different soil depths together with a number of measurements the type of measurements and genetic horizons are summarised in table 2 the information about genetic soil horizons primarily about their depths is important because it determines the properties of particular soil layers 3 3 fine soil porosity the porosity of the soil matrix fine soil decreased with the soil depth at all study sites the sites located in the forest ƒçervenec forest pod lyscom the jaloveck√° valley showed higher porosities of the fine soil fraction that varied from 0 65 to 0 85 cm3 cm 3 than the grassland sites on the carbonate bedrock ƒçervenec open area and in fluvisol in the jaloveck√Ω creek valley ondra≈°ov√° where porosities varied in the range of 0 51 cm3 cm 3 0 67 cm3 cm 3 fig 4 3 4 macropore flow characteristics macropore characteristics assessed via poiseuille s equation and the stoniness measured in the soil pits are given in table 3 the highest number of macropores with a radius larger than 0 75 mm or 1 5 mm occurred in the soil depth 0 10 cm table 3 they varied between 3345 and 5276 per 1 m2 the jaloveck√° valley andpod lyscom sites respectively we assume that the variability among sites is related to site conditions lithology slope inclination position in the catchment vegetation and stoniness the number of macropores as well as their effective volumes decreased with soil depth the number of macropores with a radius exceeding 1 5 mm at the forested site ƒçervenec forest was higher than at the nearby grassland site ƒçervenec open area but smaller than at the jaloveck√° valley and pod lyscom sites one of the reasons is the smaller suction 1 cm applied during tension infiltration measurements at the ƒçervenec forest site and the ondra≈°ov√° site and thus a smaller number of pores excluded from infiltration the numbers of macropores at two other forested sites jaloveck√° valley andpod lyscom were comparable and the ratio of water flowing through the macropores at these two sites was extremely high 98 3 99 8 this could explain an extremely high soil infiltration capacity at the latter site when 15 l of water applied to the soil surface area of approximately 25 25 cm in 1 min did not result in any overland flow or visible outflow on the hillslope a high number of macropores in the soil surface layer of 0 10 cm was also documented at the ondra≈°ov√° site where the contribution of macropore flow to the soil water flux was 98 9 the macropore flow contribution at the site decreased with the soil depth down to 90 84 the characteristics of macropore flow at the site pod lyscom can be compared for two different threshold values of the macropore radius because they were estimated on the basis of two tension infiltration measurements at suctions of 1 cm and 2 cm the difference between the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measured at a higher tension 2 cm is larger than at alower tension 1 cm and therefore the number of macropores with a radius larger than 0 75 mm is larger than that estimated for a radius of 1 5 mm and larger table 3 also reveals high contribution of macropore flow to overall infiltration in the stony soil with a large and extremely large stoniness according to morphogenetic classification system of slovak soils societas pedologica slovaca 2014 at the jalovecka valley site the volume of macropores estimated in our study using the porosity and the soil water retention curves was larger than that estimated by the watson and luxmoore method results are available in table 3 column 7 for example the relative volume of macropores at the jaloveck√° valley site was 23 13 8 and 4 at soil depths of 5 10 cm 10 25 cm 30 45 cm and 70 75 cm respectively however it should be kept in mind that this volume represents the volume of all macropores with a radius exceeding 0 75 mm also the hydrologically inactive ones comparison of the relationships between stoniness and macropore flow characteristics number of macropores or relative volume of macropores providedinteresting results fig 5 illustrates the relationship between the stoniness and therelative volume of macropores or the contribution of macropore flow to water infiltration the results indicate positive correlation between the stoniness and relative volume of macropores for pores with radius between 0 75 and 1 5 mm in the range of stoniness 30 60 4 discussion the study presents results of measurements in stony soils saturated hydraulic conductivities ks were by one or more orders of magnitude larger than the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities k and also showed larger variability the reason is that the ks depends on the presence or absence of large pores and is determined mainly by the soil structure which is very variable in time and space in the case of stony soils this variability may be even larger contrary to k s the k characterizes the soil matrix and depends primarily on more stable soil characteristics i e the soil texture beven and german 2013 extremely large saturated hydraulic conductivities in the spruce forest floor horizon and correspondingly larger differences between k s and k resulted in an extremely large estimated number of macropores in the forest floor large saturated hydraulic conductivities of the forest floor horizon were also documented by wessolek et al 2008 with a value of k s 1090 cm day 1 in a partially decomposed of horizon the decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivities with the soil depth at all sites can be caused besides other factors also by the presence of rock fragments which usually increase with the soil depth hlav√°ƒçikov√° et al 2016 the k s values obtained in the field by a single ring infiltrometer denoted in figs 2 and 3 by an asterisk have ahigher weight and are more representative because they were measured for larger soil representative elementary volumes revs than the undisturbed soil samples with a volume of 100 cm3 figs 2 and 3 show that except for the forest floor the field k s values were always within the range obtained in the laboratory using small soil samples since the k s values at all study sites were relatively large several cm per hour we assumed that vertical water flow dominated soil water movement and that horizontal flow was negligible soils have usually higher porosities in their surface layers where hydrological chemical and biological processes are more intensive this was proven also in our study all three sites located in the forest at cambisols with high or extremely high stoniness 25 70 ƒçervenec forest pod lyscom jaloveck√° valley featured higher porosities of the fine soil fractions than the soil covered with grass ƒçervenec open area and the soil in alluvium ondra≈°ov√° there are more reasons for that the first one is the different vegetation cover the forest topsoil layers can show larger porosities than grasslands bachmair et al 2010 the second reason is the presence of rock fragments in soil poesen and lavee 1994 showed that fine soil fraction of a stony soil can have larger porosities than that of a non stony soil the reason is that processes in the stony soils e g the decay of organic matter occur mainly in the fine soil fraction also rock fragments can create a kind of skeleton preventing voids from being filled with a finer material fi√®s et al 2002 contrary to forested sites soil porosities under the grassland on the carbonate bedrock ƒçervenec open area and in fluvisol in the jaloveck√Ω creek valley ondra≈°ov√° were smaller the leptosol present on the carbonate bedrock at the ƒçervenec open area site has a specific soil texture the ratio of silt to sand particles is approximately 1 1 there and these two fractions represent 92 of the entire soil texture table 1 in effect the smaller silt particles can fill larger pores or voids in the soil and decrease soil porosity the evidences of intensive chemical weathering of the low permeable bedrock were observed at the site ephemeral presence of water table and leached oxides in the soil rock fragments are of smaller dimensions they are easily weatherable compared to fragments of crystalline rocks gneiss granodiorite occurring at the forest sites as a result the soil at the ƒçervenec open area site is less permeable compared to other sites comparison of soils at ƒçervenec open area with other sites presented above indicates that the soil structure and texture properties of bedrock and rock fragments and particular ongoing pedogenetic processes can affect soil characteristics e g soil porosity hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention a decrease in the number of macropores with the soil depth is a common phenomenon and was found also by bachmair et al 2010 ameli et al 2016 and di prima et al 2018 watson and luxmoore 1986 estimated approximately 96 contribution of macropore flow through pores with a diameter larger than 0 1 mm to water infiltration in the forest soil they also noted that macropores can transport a large percentage of infiltrating water but their relative amount in the soil can be very small similar conclusions have been reported by other researchers alaoui and hebling 2006 showed that only 0 23 2 of the relative volume of macropores in the soil with grass cover transported 74 100 of infiltrated water they examined the portion of macropores participating in preferential flow by dye infiltration experiments and the image analysis lin et al 1996 documented a relative volume of macropores at 10 while the contribution of macropores to infiltration was 89 the quantification of macropore flow the number of macropores and their portion on infiltration in stony soils is not common in the literature we have found only one article in which the number of macropores was related to the stoniness of the soil baetens et al 2009 quantified the number of macropores in the topsoil layer of the stony soils in arid areas of chile using the methodology of watson and luxmoore 1986 they found that the coarse fragment content was positively related to the estimated number of pores with diameters between 1 and 0 25 mm our results show fig 5 that while the relative volume of pores with a radius greater than 0 75 mm tends to increase with the stoniness up to the threshold of about 60 no relationship was indicated for pores greater than 1 5 mm fig 5 also indicates that the contribution of macropore flow to water infiltration is slightly greater for pores with a radius above 0 75 mm than for pores greater than 1 5 mm and it tends to rise with the stoniness on the other hand the macropore flow contribution for pores greater than 1 5 mm is not related to the stoniness slightly greater contribution of macropore flow in pores with radius above 0 75 mm could be related to their higher and less variable relative volume compare the upper right panels of fig 5 however the number of measurements for these pores radius 0 75 mm is not very high more measurements would be needed to validate the finding the macroscopic approach used in our study indirectly determines the characteristics of the macropores the radius and the number of macropores that contribute to pf watson and luxmoore 1986 used the results of infiltration measurements by ponded and tension infiltration at different tensions this concept of water flow was also used for the quantification of macropore flow in the unsaturated zone in some models e g in the rzwqm ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2003 the concept also corresponds to one of the possible methods for the macropore flow quantification recommended by angulo jaramillo et al 2016 the disadvantage of the approach is that it assumes a simplified geometry of the macropores and water flow in them through the entire cross section the results thus overestimate the macropore flow capacity jarvis et al 2016 while we are aware of the limitations of the methodology it was chosen because of the difficulties related with the application of other approaches in stony soils that do not contain only small rock fragments but also big boulders it is questionable if the microscopic approach based on the percolation theory is applicable in stony soils furthermore there is a number of studies measured both saturated and unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivities without attempting to estimate the macropore flow characteristics a review of collected data from other studies which were focused on other objectives could provide valuable information on some hydrological processes such as catchment or hillslope runoff formation the number of soil samples and measurements in our study was limited by the field conditions since except for one site all sites were located in a roadless mountain terrain however since it is still true that mountains represent some of the blackest black boxes in the hydrological cycle assessment despite of their importance for the distribution of water over the continents kleme≈° 1990 our study was aimed specifically at this environment the number of soil samples or measurements required to provide representative conclusions depends on statistical characteristics of measured variables the mean value the coefficient of variation the level of confidence and the acceptable error as an illustration the international co operative programme on assessment and monitoring of air pollution effects on forests icp forests revealed enormous variability of forest soil≈õ characteristics even within asingle monitoring plot for example the number of subsamples for two intensive study plots in belgium varied from 7 for the analysis of soil nitrogen c v was 13 to 83 for the analysis of organic carbon c v was 45 cools and de vos 2013 as the hydraulic conductivity belongs to properties with a large variability e g c v was in the range of 100 185 according to jaƒçka et al 2016 it can be assumed that an even larger number of samples would be needed to obtain representative results from the point of view mathematical statistics however this is hardly possible in larger mountain catchments the number of saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements in our study varied from 2 to 11 and for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity from 1 to 10 per a soil layer over approximately 1 m2 since in many cases several soil layers belong to the same soil genetic horizon the measurements can represent properties of a particular soil horizon the team of authors who recently collected and prepared the soil water infiltration global database rahmati et al 2018 noted that hydraulic conductivities obtained on the base of pedotransfer functions ptfs that are widely used in hydrological modelling can provide the results that are far from the reality and stated that information on infiltration in clayey sandy textured and stony soils is still lacking our study attempts to contribute to filling this gap by presenting the information on hydraulic conductivities and macropore characteristics of stony soils from locations with different elevation geology and vegetation cover 5 conclusions the characteristics of macropore flow were estimated for stony soils at three mountain sites with coniferous forest and one mountain and one foothill site with grassland by comparing saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities the largest saturated hydraulic conductivities k s were measured in the spruce forest organic floor horizon the k s values decreased with soil depth at all sites unsaturated hydraulic conductivities measured at tension 0 1 or 0 2 kpa were at all sites one or two order of magnitude smaller than the k s values the largest number of macropores was estimated in the soil organic horizon at the soil depth of 0 10 cm at all sites the number of macropores decreased with soil depth the number of macropores at sites with spruce forest and the high to extremely high soil stoniness was larger in the entire soil profile than at the grassland sites while the number of macropores for pores with a radius greater than 0 75 mm tends to increase with the stoniness up to the threshold of about 60 no relationship was indicated for pores with a radius greater than 1 5 mm although the proportion of macropores in the total soil volume is very small macropores can transfer most water infiltrating into the soil the results of our measurements show that water infiltration in mountain forest stony soils is dominated by macropores declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this contribution was supported by the grant agency
