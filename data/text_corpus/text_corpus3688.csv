18440,biofiltration has been observed to increase or decrease the concentrations of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma precursors in the effluents of full scale drinking water facilities but these changes have been inconsistent over time bench scale tests comparing biofiltration columns side by side exposed to different conditions were employed to characterize factors associated with changes in ndma precursor concentrations as measured by application of chloramines under uniform formation conditions ufc side by side comparisons of biofiltration media from different facilities fed with water from each of these facilities demonstrated that differences in source water quality were far more important than any original differences in the microbial communities on the biofiltration media for determining whether ndma precursor concentrations increased decreased or remained constant across biofilters additional tests involving spiking of specific constituents hypothesized to promote increases in ndma precursor concentrations demonstrated that inorganic nitrogen species associated with nitrification including ammonia hydroxylamine and chloramines and biotransformation of known precursors i e municipal wastewater and the cationic polymer polydadmac to more potent forms were not important biotransformation of uncharacterized components of source waters determined whether ndma precursor concentrations increased or decreased across biofilters these uncharacterized source water component concentrations varied temporally and across locations where biotransformation of source water precursors increased ndma precursor concentrations 30 60 of the levels observed in column effluents fed with biofiltration influent water remained associated with the media and could be rinsed therefrom in either the dissolved or particulate form ozone pre treatment significantly reduced ndma precursor concentrations at one facility suggesting that pre oxidation could be an effective technique to mitigate the increase in ndma precursor concentrations during biofiltration biofiltration decreased the concentrations of halogenated disinfection byproduct precursors graphical abstract

with drinking water concentrations as low as 0 7 ng l associated with a 10 6 lifetime excess cancer risk us epa 2019 although there are currently no federal regulations on ndma concentrations in drinking water in the u s california has implemented a statewide drinking water notification level of 10 ng l california department of public health 2013 as ndma is under consideration for future federal regulation us epa 2014 facilities are seeking strategies to reduce ndma concentrations ndma primarily forms as a byproduct of chloramine disinfection in drinking water according to a national survey on the occurrence of ndma across the united states ndma was detected in 34 of chloraminated and 3 of chlorinated drinking water samples russell et al 2012 woods and dickenson 2015 research with model compounds has demonstrated that ndma forms from the reaction of inorganic dichloramine with dimethylamine schreiber and mitch 2006a and tertiary mitch and schreiber 2008 or to a lesser degree quaternary amines kemper et al 2010 containing dimethylamine functional groups precursors for ndma in drinking water include cationic coagulation and flocculation polymers e g polydadmac applied during treatment shah and mitch 2012 krasner et al 2013 zeng et al 2016a wastewater impacted water supplies also form ndma during chloramination by up to an order of magnitude more than pristine waters or algal impacted waters schreiber and mitch 2006b dai and mitch 2013 zeng et al 2016b research has demonstrated significant yields of ndma during chloramination of certain tertiary amine containing pharmaceuticals featuring dimethylamine functional groups e g ranitidine le roux et al 2012 shen and andrews 2013 while other research has indicated that laundry discharges dominate the loading of ndma precursors to domestic sewage zeng and mitch 2015 the importance of specific precursors in wastewater impacted water supplies has not been demonstrated the use of biologically active filters biofiltration during drinking water treatment is increasing as utilities attempt to control both particles and dissolved organic matter bablon et al 1988 urfer et al 1997 huck et al 2013 basu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 while biofiltration has been reported to remove a fraction of the precursors of halogenated dbps liu et al 2017 research at full scale drinking water facilities has indicated that biofiltration can increase ndma formation when followed by chloramination at some facilities krasner et al 2018a higher concentrations of ndma were formed after chloramination of the effluent compared to the influent of a nitrifying biofilter at a demonstration scale facility when the chloramination was conducted at ph 9 and 5 c krasner et al 2018a shedding of soluble microbial products smps from the nitrifying biofilm was suggested to account for the enhanced ndma formation since laboratory tests indicated formation of 26 36 ng of ndma per mg of total organic carbon toc when smps from cultures of nitrifying bacteria or heterotrophic plate count bacteria were subjected to high chloramine doses another study demonstrated an increase in ndma formation during chloramination when a sample collected from a non nitrifying section of a chloraminated distribution system was spiked with exudates from a nitrifying biofilm obtained from a storage reservoir zeng and mitch 2016 chloramination of phosphatidylcholine a fatty acid containing a quaternary amine with a dimethylamine functional group produced moderate levels of ndma mitch and sedlak 2004 these results suggested that microbial smps particularly those associated with nitrifying biofilms could serve as ndma precursors however chloramination of albumin a model protein n acetylglucosamine a component of bacterial cell walls pure cultures of gram positive gordona amarae or gram negative escherichia coli bacterial cultures or a lysed culture of e coli did not produce significant levels of ndma mitch and sedlak 2004 another study encompassing 5 full scale drinking water facilities using either polydadmac or polyacrylamide and incorporating ozonation followed by biofiltration found that biofiltration increased ndma formation after chloramination by 6 ng l on a median basis but the importance of polymers or ozonation was unclear krasner et al 2018b this magnitude of increase was comparable to that associated with the use of polydadmac or wastewater impacted source waters demonstrating the potential importance of biofiltration as a source of ndma precursors krasner et al 2018b only one of the facilities featured a nitrifying biofilter driven by the application of chloramines upstream the increase in ndma formation after biofiltration at some of the other facilities suggested that ndma precursors could be shed from non nitrifying biofilters moreover no significant increase in ndma precursor formation was observed when the biofilter effluent samples were filtered before chloramination suggesting that any precursors shed from the biofilter were particle associated i e were not smps although biofiltration increased ndma precursor formation for unfiltered effluent samples on a median basis the results varied across the facilities with biofiltration reducing ndma precursor formation at some facilities while a pilot scale study observed that biofiltration of wastewater effluent increased ndma precursors li et al 2017 other research has observed that biofiltration removes certain specific ndma precursors in laboratory studies marti et al 2017 and reduced ndma formation during subsequent chloramination in full scale drinking water facilities pramanik et al 2015 liao et al 2014 2015 and wastewater reuse facilities farre et al 2012 zeng et al 2016c chuang et al 2019a 2019b characterizing factors that contribute to increases in ndma precursor concentrations during biofiltration by comparing different full scale facilities is difficult because many of the factors that may contribute e g polymer usage source water characteristics biofilm community composition simultaneously vary across full scale facilities the overall objective of this study was to use bench scale biofiltration columns to isolate the importance of different factors hypothesized to contribute to the release of ndma precursors by biofilters the hypothesized factors could be grouped into three categories first biomolecules released by specific species of microorganisms within the biofilm may serve as ndma precursors in this case differences in the microbial community could at least partially explain observed differences between full scale biofilters with respect to ndma precursor release independent of differences in source water quality second the biofilms could transform chemicals applied during treatment into ndma precursors for example by removing a methyl group biofilms could transform the quaternary amine functional groups in polydadmac to tertiary amines that are more potent ndma precursors mitch and schreiber 2008 kemper et al 2010 zeng et al 2016a alternatively previous evidence had suggested an association with nitrifying biofilms when chloramines are applied upstream of biofilters krasner et al 2018a this association might be explained if consumption of the residual ammonia formed hydroxylamine a known ndma precursor padhye et al 2011 or shifted the equilibrium between chloramine species towards dichloramine equation 1 mccurry et al 2017 the primary inorganic chloramine ndma precursor third biofilms could transform unidentified organic components in source waters potentially including components of upstream wastewater discharges into more potent ndma precursors we compared the release of ndma precursors across bench scale columns containing fresh samples of biofiltration media retrieved from full scale biofilters after spiking source waters with different components hypothesized to contribute to ndma precursor release to compare the importance of source waters versus the microbial community within the biofilters bench scale biofiltration columns containing media retrieved from different full scale biofilters were compared side by side while receiving a common source water at 3 different facilities in more limited testing the effect of biofiltration on halogenated dbp formation was also characterized 1 2 nh2cl h nhcl2 nh4 2 materials and methods text s1 provides sources for materials 2 1 biofiltration media selection and sampling three bench scale column experiments were performed to investigate factors contributing to the increase of ndma precursors across biofiltration using biofiltration media collected from four full scale drinking water treatment plants these facilities were selected from among 16 facilities containing biofilters sampled during a full scale survey the results of this full scale survey will be discussed in a future publication basic water quality parameters measured during full scale sampling and operational parameters e g media types and polymer usage for these four facilities are provided in table 1 these four facilities featured a range of basic water quality parameters and operating conditions for example facilities a and d applied ozone upstream of biofiltration while facilities a c and d employed quaternary amine based cationic polymers moreover the level of ndma precursors assessed by measuring ndma after the application of the chloramine ufc protocol ufc see section 2 5 did not increase across the full scale biofilters during the only sample event at facilities a and d however the level of ndma precursors did increase across the full scale biofilters at facilities b and c but only during one of two sampling events table 1 media were collected from several inches below the top of biofilter beds at the four full scale facilities with sterile scoops and distributed into sterile 1 l polypropylene bottles for transfer to the bench scale columns when shipped to one of the other full scale facilities for bench scale column testing the media were shipped overnight on ice 2 2 bench scale column test configuration each bench test included operation of four to eight columns 5 1 cm diameter x 30 cm long each packed with 25 4 cm of homogenized media figs s1 3 the biofiltration influent water from the full scale plant at each testing site was fed by peristaltic pumps to the columns in parallel at 1 3 m h to provide an empty bed contact time ebct of 12 min except for facility a where columns were fed by gravity with a constant head and flows were adjusted every day to maintain an ebct of 12 min one pair of columns served as duplicate control columns receiving only the biofiltration influent water the feed water to additional pairs of columns was supplemented with different ingredients hypothesized to contribute to the release of ndma precursors by the biofilters for comparison against the control columns 2 3 effect of influent water constituents the first experiment involved three tests to evaluate the contributions of specific influent water constituents to the increase in n nitrosamine precursors during biofiltration for the first two tests biofiltration media from facilities a and c were tested at facility b in separate eight day column tests in full scale sampling biofiltration increased the levels of ndma precursors in one of two sampling events at facilities b and c but not during the only sampling event at facility a table 1 each test employed eight columns divided into four sets of duplicate columns the columns were fed with biofiltration influent water from facility b after adjustment to ph 8 from 8 6 to 8 9 table 1 using hydrochloric acid one set of duplicate columns was fed only with ph adjusted influent water to serve as controls table 2 the influent to the other three sets of duplicate columns was spiked with constituents hypothesized to result in an increase in n nitrosamine precursors during biofiltration in a separate eight day column test biofiltration media retrieved from the full scale biofilters at facility a was tested in four columns at facility a the biofiltration influent water was adjusted to ph 8 from 7 7 to 8 1 table 1 one set of duplicate columns served as controls while the ph adjusted influent to another set of duplicate columns was spiked with constituents hypothesized to result in an increase in n nitrosamine precursors during biofiltration table 2 this test also was conducted as a first step to assess whether different source waters e g facility a vs facility b biofilter influent applied to the same media i e from facility a resulted in different trends in ndma formation across the control biofilters for all three column tests each set of duplicate columns was exposed to a test condition for two days and up to four conditions were tested per set of columns for a total of eight days grab samples of the common influent to each pair of columns and the individual effluents of each column were collected after two days of exposure to each test condition the objective was to achieve a balance between stable operation at each condition while minimizing the timescale of each column test to reduce the potential for significant evolution of the microbial community within the biofilms resulting from exposure to a different influent water thus the effect of influent water constituents could be isolated from changes in the microbial community to evaluate whether the microbial community had changed during the tests samples of filter media from each column were collected at the beginning and end of the testing period and were frozen for subsequent dna extraction and microbial community analysis text s2 2 3 1 effect of ammonia hydroxylamine and chloramines previous research had indicated an increase in ndma precursor concentrations across some but not all nitrifying biofilters at full scale treatment plants krasner et al 2018a 2018b but the importance of nitrification at these facilities was unclear the first set of tests involved spiking the biofiltration influent water adjusted to ph 8 with ammonia 0 1 1 0 mg n l at facilities a and b hydroxylamine nh2oh 0 1 mg n l at facility b or preformed monochloramine nh2cl 0 5 2 0 mg l as cl2 at facility b table 2 spiking of ammonia to certain columns served to promote nitrifying conditions for comparison to the non nitrifying control columns while hydroxylamine is one potential intermediate formed during nitrification lee 1952 that has been associated with ndma formation padhye et al 2011 chloraminated water can be used to backwash filters and nitrifying biofilms in chloraminated drinking water distribution systems have been associated with the release of ndma precursors in other research zeng and mitch 2016 stock monochloramine solutions 73 291 mg l as cl2 were prepared fresh daily by titrating sodium hypochlorite into ammonium chloride at a 1 1 2 molar ratio in 250 mm borate buffer adjusted to ph 9 with sodium hydroxide 2 3 2 effect of wastewater associated precursors or polydadmac polymer usage previous research has demonstrated that use of wastewater impacted source waters schreiber and mitch 2006b dai and mitch 2013 zeng et al 2016b or polydadmac polymer shah and mitch 2012 krasner et al 2013 zeng et al 2016a is associated with an increase in ndma formation during chloramination biofiltration influent water adjusted to ph 8 was spiked with 2 5 or 7 5 by volume of a secondary wastewater effluent or 0 2 mg l or 0 6 mg l of polydadmac at facility b table 2 at facility a the biofiltration influent water adjusted to ph 8 was spiked with 0 6 mg l polydadmac the levels of ndma precursors measured before and after biofiltration in columns receiving spiked influent water were compared to those associated with parallel unspiked control columns the wastewater was a secondary municipal wastewater effluent sample collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant upstream of disinfection polydadmac aqua hawk 6527 hawkins inc roseville mn usa was obtained from the stock tank at facility c containing a 20 polydadmac solution the concentrations are indicated in mg l as polydadmac rather than as polydadmac solution 2 4 effect of influent ph the second bench scale experiment evaluated the effect of biofiltration influent water ph on the change in n nitrosamine precursors during biofiltration biofiltration media samples collected from facilities b and d were used for bench scale testing at facility b four of the eight columns were loaded with media from facility b and the other four were loaded with media from facility d for each media one pair of columns was fed with the full scale biofiltration influent water at facility b at its ambient ph 8 6 the other pair of columns with each media was fed with facility b s biofiltration influent water adjusted to ph 7 8 or 9 with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide each ph was tested for two days table 2 after which grab samples were collected from the combined biofiltration influent to each pair of columns and each individual column effluent media samples were collected before and after the bench test to evaluate the potential for changes to the microbial community during the test text s2 2 5 importance of influent water vs microbial community the third bench scale column experiment compared the importance of influent water versus the microbial community within the biofilters for the change in n nitrosamine precursors during biofiltration at each of the facilities a b and c i e three separate tests duplicate pairs of columns were filled with biofiltration media from facilities a b and c for a side by side comparison of the different biofiltration media exposed to each of the three biofiltration influent waters the biofiltration influent water was adjusted to ph 8 prior to application to the columns at facility b but was maintained at the ambient ph at facility a 7 7 8 0 and facility c 6 7 7 0 facility a applies ozone upstream of biofiltration table 1 accordingly the ozone treated water served as the influent to the bench scale columns at facility a however another pair of columns at facility a containing biofiltration media from this facility was also fed with water obtained upstream of ozonation to evaluate the impact of ozonation fig s3 this experiment was conducted over 6 weeks with samples collected after 1 day 1 week 2 weeks 4 weeks and 6 weeks backwashing was conducted to maintain the 12 min ebct after 6 weeks 4 bed volumes of buffered deionized water 5 mm phosphate buffer at ph 7 2 were fed through the columns at facilities a and b to evaluate the importance of precursors shedding from the biofilters because this experiment was conducted at the end of the study samples of biofiltration media were not analyzed to characterize the microbial communities however samples collected from these media during experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated significant differences in the microbial communities between the different facilities 2 6 sampling and analytical methods water samples from the influents and effluents of the bench scale biofiltration columns were collected in fluorinated lined bottles shipped overnight on ice to stanford university and stored at 4 c one set of sample bottles contained 33 mg l l ascorbic acid to quench any residual oxidants upon sample collection in order to measure the background level of n nitrosamines another set of samples was treated with preformed monochloramine under ufc conditions in the lab to evaluate the level of disinfection byproduct precursors shah et al 2012 briefly water samples were adjusted to ph 8 0 with 4 mm borate buffer and then treated with 5 mg l as cl2 preformed monochloramine chloraminated samples were held at room temperature 20 c in the dark for 3 days and then the chloramine residual was quenched by 33 mg l l ascorbic acid the samples were stored at 4 c and extracted within 24 h for analysis of n nitrosamines or for a limited subset of samples for halogenated dbps a subset of samples were also filtered through 0 7 μm glass fiber filters prior to chloramine ufc treatment to distinguish between soluble and particle associated n nitrosamine precursors ammonia nitrite nitrate and monochloramine were measured on site by hach 10205 10207 10206 and indophenol methods respectively doc was measured using a shimadzu toc l analyzer eight n nitrosamines including ndma n nitrosomethylethylamine n nitrosodiethylamine n nitrosodipropylamine n nitrosodibutylamine n nitrosopyrrolidine n nitrosopiperidine and n nitrosomorpholine nmor were measured using a modified version of us epa method 521 with 2 ng l method reporting limits modified versions of us epa methods 551 1 and 552 3 were used to measure thirty five halogenated dbps in eight dbp classes with 0 2 μg l method report limits including the four regulated trihalomethanes thm4 six iodinated trihalomethanes i thms ten haloacetic acids haas including iodoacetic acid iaa four haloacetonitriles hans four haloacetaldehydes hals four haloacetamides hams two haloketones hks and one halonitromethane hnm trichloronitromethane chloropicrin tcnm text s1 summarizes additional analytical details as discussed in chuang and mitch 2017 and zeng and mitch 2016 3 results and discussion none of the eight n nitrosamines were detected 2 ng l in samples prior to chloramine ufc treatment after ufc treatment ndma was the only n nitrosamine detected and is referred to as ndma ufc in the following discussion 3 1 ndma formation from hypothesized precursors in the influent water biofiltration media from facilities a and c were fed the biofiltration influent water from facility b adjusted to ph 8 and spiked with different constituents hypothesized to contribute to the increase in ndma ufc across the biofilters for comparison against control columns receiving unspiked water a similar test was conducted using biofiltration media from facility a fed with biofiltration influent water from facility a after adjustment to ph 8 this was the only experiment where the influent water was transported to a different location stored in a holding tank and pumped to the biofiltration columns the spiked constituents included ammonia nh2oh nh2cl wastewater effluent and polydadmac 3 1 1 microbial community analyses the total timescale of the tests was limited to 8 days to minimize the potential for changes in the microbial communities and thereby isolate the importance of influent water constituents microbial community analyses conducted on media samples before and after the tests demonstrated that the microbial communities did not change significantly during the tests the microbial community on media from facility a significantly differed from that from facility c p 0 01 table s2 for example media from facility a featured a higher abundance of sequences from the family sphingomonodaceae and blastocatellaceae but less nitrosomonadacea and bradyrhizobiaceae fig s4 however while a principal coordinate analysis provides a visualization of the differences between the microbial communities from media from facilities a and c it also shows that each community was relatively stable throughout the tests text s3 and fig s5 furthermore the microbial community on the media from facility a after the test at facility a was similar p 0 07 table s2 to the same media following the test conducted at facility b fig s5 while the community diversity increased somewhat in media from both facilities during the tests as indicated by the increase in the proportion of minor populations lumped into other the relative abundances of the dominant populations in columns receiving spiked influent waters remained similar to those receiving unspiked water 3 1 2 control column results during the test involving media from facility a fed with water from facility b the ndma ufc concentrations in the unspiked influent water ranged from 10 ng l to 21 ng l over the course of the 8 day test fig 1 a the ndma ufc concentrations in the control column effluents also varied over the 8 day test but there was always an increase in ndma ufc concentrations across the control columns range 11 41 ng l for the test involving media from facility c fed with facility b water the ndma ufc concentrations in the unspiked influent water were relatively consistent i e 18 21 ng l over the 8 day test fig 1b the ndma ufc concentrations in the control column effluents were similarly less variable exhibiting an increase in ndma ufc concentrations across the biofilters ranging from 16 to 21 ng l in contrast the test involving media from facility a fed with facility a water exhibited 8 9 ng l ndma ufc in the unspiked influent and only 9 10 ng l in the control column effluents fig 2 for tests involving media from facility a the significant increase in ndma ufc concentrations across biofilters when fed unspiked water from facility b but lack of an increase when fed water from facility a suggested the importance of source water constituents given that the microbial community was similar between the two tests fig s4 3 1 3 effects of ammonia hydroxylamine and chloramines since previous research had provided conflicting suggestions regarding a link between nitrifying biofilms and the release of ndma precursors section 1 0 the effect of spiking the influent water with ammonia or hydroxylamine a potential intermediate during nitrification was tested ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa were identified in media from facilities a and c fig s6 for testing at facility b nitrification was not observed in control columns due to the low ammonia concentrations in the influent water at that facility 0 02 mg n l table 1 however when the influent was spiked with 0 1 1 0 mg n l ammonia 38 72 of the ammonia was consumed with media from facility a while nearly all of the ammonia was consumed with media from facility c the ammonia was converted primarily to nitrate table s3 for the test involving media from facility a at facility a ammonia consumption ranged from 23 to 50 in all cases involving spiking of ammonia or hydroxylamine there was no evidence that the spiking promoted an increase in ndma ufc concentrations across the biofilters figs 1 and 2 for the 1 mg n l ammonia spike test involving media from facility c at facility b the level of ndma ufc measured in the biofilter influent declined relative to the control columns fig 1 likely because the additional ammonia shifted the chloramine speciation towards monochloramine from dichloramine equation 1 the predominant inorganic chloramine precursor to ndma schreiber and mitch 2006a mccurry et al 2017 furst et al 2018 the molar ratio of chlorine to ammonia 1 1 2 employed to generate chloramine stocks for the ufc protocol was not adjusted for the ammonia concentrations in the samples spiking with 1 mg n l ammonia reduced the ndma ufc concentrations in the effluents of columns containing media from both facilities a and c fig 1 the reason for these declines is unclear but should not have involved a change in chloramine speciation because the effluents of the columns containing media c were fully nitrified table s3 for the test involving media from facility a at facility a the ammonia spiking actually resulted in a mild decrease in ndma ufc concentrations across the biofilters fig 2 these results suggested that ammonia and the associated induction of nitrification were not significant drivers for the increase in ndma ufc concentrations during biofiltration facility b employs chloraminated water for backwashing the full scale biofilters table 1 for tests at facility b 0 5 2 0 mg l as cl2 of nh2cl was spiked into the influent water to evaluate the impact of chloramines on the increase in ndma ufc concentrations across biofilters the nh2cl stock solution contained a 20 molar excess of ammonia similar to the ammonia spiking tests the biofilters consumed the ammonia and chloramines to produce nitrate with media from facility c exhibiting nearly complete conversion table s4 while increasing the nh2cl spiking concentration increased the ndma ufc concentrations in the column influents the ndma concentrations in the column effluents declined fig 1 for the 2 0 mg l as cl2 spiking concentration the effluent ndma ufc concentrations reached levels measured in the unspiked influent water these results suggest that exposure to chloramines inhibited microbial transformation of ndma precursors by the biofilters 3 1 4 effects of wastewater and polydadmac wastewater effluent 2 5 and 7 5 by volume and 0 2 mg l and 0 6 mg l polydadmac were spiked into the influent at facility b and 0 6 mg l polydadmac was spiked into the influent at facility a these tests evaluated whether the microbial community biotransformed these known ndma precursors into more potent forms except for the 2 5 wastewater spike for media from facility c at facility b and the 0 6 mg l polydadmac spike for media from facility a at facility a these spikes resulted in an increase in ndma ufc concentrations in the column influents figs 1 and 2 however no measurable increases in ndma ufc concentrations were observed across the biofilters relative to the unspiked controls suggesting that biotransformation of wastewater associated precursors or polydadmac by the biofilters did not drive an increase in ndma ufc concentrations across biofilters indeed 0 6 mg l polydadmac eliminated any increase in ndma ufc across the biofilters likely due to inhibition associated with the toxicity of their organic quaternary amine functional groups towards microbes siedenbiedel and tiller 2012 3 2 effect of influent water ph in full scale sampling biofiltration increased ndma ufc concentrations during one sample event at facility b but not at facility d table 1 the biofiltration influent water at facility b featured a higher ph 8 6 8 9 due to upstream lime softening compared to facility d ph 6 2 experiment 2 evaluated the hypothesis that higher biofiltration influent ph promoted an increase in ndma ufc concentrations by comparing column influent and effluent ndma ufc concentrations with media from facilities b or d fed with biofiltration influent water from facility b the biofiltration influent water was adjusted to ph 7 8 or 9 for comparison to control columns fed with influent water at the ambient ph 8 6 analysis of the microbial community indicated no significant changes for media from either facility over the 8 day test figs s5 and s7 the ph did not impact the ndma ufc concentrations in the column influent waters range 21 25 ng l fig 3 suggesting that hydrolysis of precursors to more reactive forms e g dimethylformamide hydrolysis to dimethylamine mitch and sedlak 2004 was not significant for media from facility d ndma ufc concentrations in column effluents increased with the influent ph note that the ufc procedure involved adjustment of the ph to 8 prior to chloramine application such that the ph affected the level of ndma precursors not the chloramine speciation however ph did not affect the ndma ufc concentrations in the effluents of columns containing media from facility b considering that the normal ph 6 2 of the influent water at facility d was much lower than those evaluated in this test table 1 it is possible that the change in ph triggered a stress response in the microbial community leading to the release of microbial products sutherland 2001 serving as ndma precursors in an additional test at facility b water obtained from facility b either upstream or downstream of softening was fed side by side to columns containing media from each of facilities a b and c and samples were collected after each of two days of testing softening substantially increased the ndma ufc concentrations in the column influents from 10 12 ng l to 27 30 ng l fig 4 suggesting that hydrolysis at high ph converted ndma precursors into more potent forms for each of the three media biofiltration increased the ndma ufc concentrations to 16 23 ng l when fed water upstream of softening but decreased the ndma ufc concentrations to 18 22 ng l when fed softened water these results suggest that biofiltration could remove a fraction of the precursors produced during softening note that the full scale biofilters at facility b are fed with softened water and while an increase in ndma ufc during biofiltration has been observed during some sampling events table 1 and fig 1 in others the level has remained the same table 1 or in additional sampling conducted by the facility has declined 3 3 the importance of influent water versus the microbial community the results from experiments wherein well characterized precursors were spiked into the influent water indicated that these precursors were not responsible for the increase in ndma ufc concentrations across biofilters figs 1 and 2 however the results indicating an increase in ndma ufc concentrations across the biofilters when media from facility a was exposed to water from facility b but not water from facility a figs 1 and 2 suggested that uncharacterized precursors in the influent water were more significant than differences in the microbial community for driving the increase in ndma ufc concentrations during biofiltration to further evaluate this question biofiltration media from facilities a b and c were compared side by side when fed with influent water from facilities a b or c although changes in the microbial community were not quantified these tests were conducted for 6 weeks such that the microbial community could have evolved the ndma ufc concentrations in the influent water were highest at facility b range 20 44 ng l with lower values at facilities a range 8 8 14 ng l and c range 9 3 12 ng l on the first day of testing an increase in ndma ufc concentrations was observed across columns containing all three media when fed with water from facility b but ndma ufc concentrations in column effluents remained comparable to those in the influents when columns containing the three media were fed water from facilities a and c fig 5 the results were somewhat similar for later sampling times although the increase observed across columns fed with water from facility b declined over time and was not observable after 42 days typically the greatest increases in ndma ufc concentrations were observed for media from facilities a and c when fed with water from facility b suggesting the potential for exposure to the new water to trigger the release of ndma precursors note that the increases in ndma ufc concentrations during biofiltration observed in full scale sampling at facilities b and c were observed in one sampling event but not in another at each facility table 1 suggesting that whether an increase in ndma ufc concentration occurs during biofiltration varies over time likely due to changes in influent water quality overall these results suggest that uncharacterized influent water constituents were more important than differences in the microbial community for determining changes in ndma ufc concentrations resulting from biotransformation within biofilters after the 6 week test buffered deionized water was passed through columns containing each of the three media at facilities a and b to evaluate the potential for precursors to shed from biofilms at facility a the ndma ufc rinsed from each media was 4 ng l concurring with the lack of significant increase in ndma ufc concentrations across the biofilters during the test table s5 at facility b 13 5 ng l 8 4 ng l and 5 7 ng l ndma ufc were detected in the deionized water rinsed from media associated with facilities a b and c respectively these levels of ndma precursors shed from the media could account for a significant fraction of the 21 ng l ndma ufc concentration measured in the biofilter effluents at the end of the 6 week test fig 5 filtration of these deionized water rinses from media associated with facilities a and c prior to chloramine ufc treatment reduced ndma ufc concentrations by 20 suggesting that these precursors were primarily dissolved however filtration reduced the ndma ufc in the water rinsed from the media associated with facility b to 2 ng l suggesting that the precursors were particle associated overall these results suggest that a portion of the source water constituents biotransformed during biofiltration can remain associated with the media rinsing can release these precursors in either a dissolved form wherein they could appear as smps or a particulate form since facility a employs ozone upstream of biofiltration table 1 ozonated water was fed to the columns containing all three media at this facility no increase in ndma ufc concentrations was observed during biofiltration at this facility fig 5 during the same test at facility a a separate set of columns containing media from facility a was fed with non ozonated influent water to evaluate the effect of ozone pre treatment ozonation substantially reduced the ndma ufc concentrations in the column influents from 49 69 ng l down to 8 14 ng l fig 6 although several studies have demonstrated that ndma can form during ozonation of wastewater sgroi et al 2014 zeng et al 2016c chuang and mitch 2017 chuang et al 2019a 2019c ozonation typically reduces the concentrations of ndma precursors in conventional drinking waters lee et al 2007 shah et al 2012 mccurry et al 2015 while ndma ufc concentrations were similar before and after biofiltration when biofilters were fed ozonated water decreases in ndma ufc concentrations of up to 29 ng l were observed across biofilters fed non ozonated influent water fig 6 regardless the ndma ufc concentrations remained higher in the effluents of columns receiving non ozonated water suggesting that ozone was more efficient than biofiltration for deactivating the ndma precursors in the influent water from facility a in this case changing the biofiltration influent water to a non ozonated water which could potentially stress the biofilm resulted in a decrease in ndma precursor concentrations across the biofilters 3 4 halogenated dbps halogenated dbps were also measured after chloramine ufc treatment during the first two sampling events of the tests described in section 3 3 haloacetic acids and to a lesser degree haloacetamides trihalomethanes and haloketones were the dominant dbp classes detected fig 7 the total halogenated dbp ufc concentrations in the influent waters were higher at facility c 14 4 1 8 μg l average range from two sampling events than at facilities a 11 0 0 05 μg l and b 10 8 0 5 μg l total halogenated dbp ufc concentrations in the effluents from columns containing media from all three facilities were similar or lower than those in the influent waters for tests conducted at each of the three facilities while there were some differences between media fed with the same influent waters the greatest decreases in halogenated dbp ufc concentrations were observed for biofilters receiving water at facility c halogenated dbp ufc concentrations were also measured in the buffered deionized water passed through the columns at the end of the tests described in section 3 3 the total halogenated dbp ufc concentrations ranged from 2 7 to 6 6 μg l in these samples indicating that the biofilms could shed precursors for halogenated dbps these results suggested that halogenated dbp precursors in the influent water could be removed by biofilters but that such decreases could be partially offset by the release of precursors from the biofilters 4 conclusions full scale and bench scale testing demonstrated that biofiltration can increase ndma ufc concentrations in some but not all facilities even where observed increases were not consistently observed over different sampling events table 1 and fig 5 bench scale experiments comparing biofiltration columns operated side by side under different conditions were used to understand factors associated with changes in ndma ufc concentrations across biofiltration the results demonstrated that differences in influent water constituents were far more important than differences in the microbial communities on the biofiltration media for determining changes in ndma ufc concentrations across biofiltration there were some suggestions that stress conditions induced by changes in source water quality could promote increases in ndma precursor concentrations during biofiltration e g switching the ph of facility b influent water to facility d media fig 3 but this was not always observed e g switching from ozonated to non ozonated influent water at facility a fig 6 tests involving the addition of specific constituents hypothesized to be important based on previous poorly constrained full scale sampling data did not promote increases in ndma ufc concentrations across biofiltration these constituents included inorganic nitrogen constituents associated with nitrification ammonia hydroxylamine and chloramines and ndma precursors hypothesized to undergo biotransformation to more potent precursors including municipal wastewater effluent associated with upstream discharges and polydadmac a cationic polymer used as a coagulant and filter aid the results instead suggest that the biotransformation of source water constituents during biofiltration controls changes in ndma ufc concentrations but the identity of the specific source water constituents remains unclear this is not surprising given that the identity of specific precursors responsible for driving ndma formation in municipal wastewater has remained unclear despite nearly two decades of research li and mitch 2018 the liberation of ndma precursors in the biofiltration influent water fostered by softening at facility b suggests that source water precursors could include hydrolyzable precursors such as dimethylamides but subsequent biofiltration reduced ndma concentrations where source water constituents were biotransformed to ndma precursors a portion of these precursors remained associated with the media these media associated precursors were rinsed from media samples in the dissolved fraction for two of three media such they might appear to be smps for the third media the precursors rinsed from the media were in the particulate fraction such facilities should evaluate whether chloraminated backwashes should be routed to waste regarding treatment options to mitigate increases in ndma ufc concentrations during biofiltration pre oxidation of source water precursors may be effective at facility a where biofiltration reduced ndma ufc concentrations in the absence of ozone pre treatment ozone pre treatment reduced ndma ufc concentrations to a greater degree these results suggest that pre oxidation of precursors upstream of biofiltration could be an effective strategy to mitigate increases in ndma ufc concentrations during biofiltration but further testing with ozone and other pre oxidants e g free chlorine is needed at additional biofiltration facilities even when an increase in ndma ufc concentrations during biofiltration was observed at facility b biofiltration decreased the levels of total halogenated dbp ufc

18440,biofiltration has been observed to increase or decrease the concentrations of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma precursors in the effluents of full scale drinking water facilities but these changes have been inconsistent over time bench scale tests comparing biofiltration columns side by side exposed to different conditions were employed to characterize factors associated with changes in ndma precursor concentrations as measured by application of chloramines under uniform formation conditions ufc side by side comparisons of biofiltration media from different facilities fed with water from each of these facilities demonstrated that differences in source water quality were far more important than any original differences in the microbial communities on the biofiltration media for determining whether ndma precursor concentrations increased decreased or remained constant across biofilters additional tests involving spiking of specific constituents hypothesized to promote increases in ndma precursor concentrations demonstrated that inorganic nitrogen species associated with nitrification including ammonia hydroxylamine and chloramines and biotransformation of known precursors i e municipal wastewater and the cationic polymer polydadmac to more potent forms were not important biotransformation of uncharacterized components of source waters determined whether ndma precursor concentrations increased or decreased across biofilters these uncharacterized source water component concentrations varied temporally and across locations where biotransformation of source water precursors increased ndma precursor concentrations 30 60 of the levels observed in column effluents fed with biofiltration influent water remained associated with the media and could be rinsed therefrom in either the dissolved or particulate form ozone pre treatment significantly reduced ndma precursor concentrations at one facility suggesting that pre oxidation could be an effective

federal regulation us epa 2014 facilities are seeking strategies to reduce ndma concentrations ndma primarily forms as a byproduct of chloramine disinfection in drinking water according to a national survey on the occurrence of ndma across the united states ndma was detected in 34 of chloraminated and 3 of chlorinated drinking water samples russell et al 2012 woods and dickenson 2015 research with model compounds has demonstrated that ndma forms from the reaction of inorganic dichloramine with dimethylamine schreiber and mitch 2006a and tertiary mitch and schreiber 2008 or to a lesser degree quaternary amines kemper et al 2010 containing dimethylamine functional groups precursors for ndma in drinking water include cationic coagulation and flocculation polymers e g polydadmac applied during treatment shah and mitch 2012 krasner et al 2013 zeng et al 2016a wastewater impacted water supplies also form ndma during chloramination by up to an order of magnitude more than pristine waters or algal impacted waters schreiber and mitch 2006b dai and mitch 2013 zeng et al 2016b research has demonstrated significant yields of ndma during chloramination of certain tertiary amine containing pharmaceuticals featuring dimethylamine functional groups e g ranitidine le roux et al 2012 shen and andrews 2013 while other research has indicated that laundry discharges dominate the loading of ndma precursors to domestic sewage zeng and mitch 2015 the importance of specific precursors in wastewater impacted water supplies has not been demonstrated the use of biologically active filters biofiltration during drinking water treatment is increasing as utilities attempt to control both particles and dissolved organic matter bablon et al 1988 urfer et al 1997 huck et al 2013 basu et al 2016 liu et al 2017 while biofiltration has been reported to remove a fraction of the precursors of halogenated dbps liu et al 2017 research at full scale drinking water facilities has indicated that biofiltration can increase ndma formation when followed by chloramination at some facilities krasner et al 2018a higher concentrations of ndma were formed after chloramination of the effluent compared to the influent of a nitrifying biofilter at a demonstration scale facility when the chloramination was conducted at ph 9 and 5 c krasner et al 2018a shedding of soluble microbial products smps from the nitrifying biofilm was suggested to account for the enhanced ndma formation since laboratory tests indicated formation of 26 36 ng of ndma per mg of total organic carbon toc when smps from cultures of nitrifying bacteria or heterotrophic plate count bacteria were subjected to high chloramine doses another study demonstrated an increase in ndma formation during chloramination when a sample collected from a non nitrifying section of a chloraminated distribution system was spiked with exudates from a nitrifying biofilm obtained from a storage reservoir zeng and mitch 2016 chloramination of phosphatidylcholine a fatty acid containing a quaternary amine with a dimethylamine functional group produced moderate levels of ndma mitch and sedlak 2004 these results suggested that microbial smps particularly those associated with nitrifying biofilms could serve as ndma precursors however chloramination of albumin a model protein n acetylglucosamine a component of bacterial cell walls pure cultures of gram positive gordona amarae or gram negative escherichia coli bacterial cultures or a lysed culture of e coli did not produce significant levels of ndma mitch and sedlak 2004 another study encompassing 5 full scale drinking water facilities using either polydadmac or polyacrylamide and incorporating ozonation followed by biofiltration found that biofiltration increased ndma formation after chloramination by 6 ng l on a median basis but the importance of polymers or ozonation was unclear krasner et al 2018b this magnitude of increase was comparable to that associated with the use of polydadmac or wastewater impacted source waters demonstrating the potential importance of biofiltration as a source of ndma precursors krasner et al 2018b only one of the facilities featured a nitrifying biofilter driven by the application of chloramines upstream the increase in ndma formation after biofiltration at some of the other facilities suggested that ndma precursors could be shed from non nitrifying biofilters moreover no significant increase in ndma precursor formation was observed when the biofilter effluent samples were filtered before chloramination suggesting that any precursors shed from the biofilter were particle associated i e were not smps although biofiltration increased ndma precursor formation for unfiltered effluent samples on a median basis the results varied across the facilities with biofiltration reducing ndma precursor formation at some facilities while a pilot scale study observed that biofiltration of wastewater effluent increased ndma precursors li et al 2017 other research has observed that biofiltration removes certain specific ndma precursors in laboratory studies marti et al 2017 and reduced ndma formation during subsequent chloramination in full scale drinking water facilities pramanik et al 2015 liao et al 2014 2015 and wastewater reuse facilities farre et al 2012 zeng et al 2016c chuang et al 2019a 2019b characterizing factors that contribute to increases in ndma precursor concentrations during biofiltration by comparing different full scale facilities is difficult because many of the factors that may contribute e g polymer usage source water characteristics biofilm community composition simultaneously vary across full scale facilities the overall objective of this study was to use bench scale biofiltration columns to isolate the importance of different factors hypothesized to contribute to the release of ndma precursors by biofilters the hypothesized factors could be grouped into three categories first biomolecules released by specific species of microorganisms within the biofilm may serve as ndma precursors in this case differences in the microbial community could at least partially explain observed differences between full scale biofilters with respect to ndma precursor release independent of differences in source water quality second the biofilms could transform chemicals applied during treatment into ndma precursors for example by removing a methyl group biofilms could transform the quaternary amine functional groups in polydadmac to tertiary amines that are more potent ndma precursors mitch and schreiber 2008 kemper et al 2010 zeng et al 2016a alternatively previous evidence had suggested an association with nitrifying biofilms when chloramines are applied upstream of biofilters krasner et al 2018a this association might be explained if consumption of the residual ammonia formed hydroxylamine a known ndma precursor padhye et al 2011 or shifted the equilibrium between chloramine species towards dichloramine equation 1 mccurry et al 2017 the primary inorganic chloramine ndma precursor third biofilms could transform unidentified organic components in source waters potentially including components of upstream wastewater discharges into more potent ndma precursors we compared the release of ndma precursors across bench scale columns containing fresh samples of biofiltration media retrieved from full scale biofilters after spiking source waters with different components hypothesized to contribute to ndma precursor release to compare the importance of source waters versus the microbial community within the biofilters bench scale biofiltration columns containing media retrieved from different full scale biofilters were compared side by side while receiving a common source water at 3 different facilities in more limited testing the effect of biofiltration on halogenated dbp formation was also characterized 1 2 nh2cl h nhcl2 nh4 2 materials and methods text s1 provides sources for materials 2 1 biofiltration media selection and sampling three bench scale column experiments were performed to investigate factors contributing to the increase of ndma precursors across biofiltration using biofiltration media collected from four full scale drinking water treatment plants these facilities were selected from among 16 facilities containing biofilters sampled during a full scale survey the results of this full scale survey will be discussed in a future publication basic water quality parameters measured during full scale sampling and operational parameters e g media types and polymer usage for these four facilities are provided in table 1 these four facilities featured a range of basic water quality parameters and operating conditions for example facilities a and d applied ozone upstream of biofiltration while facilities a c and d employed quaternary amine based cationic polymers moreover the level of ndma precursors assessed by measuring ndma after the application of the chloramine ufc protocol ufc see section 2 5 did not increase across the full scale biofilters during the only sample event at facilities a and d however the level of ndma precursors did increase across the full scale biofilters at facilities b and c but only during one of two sampling events table 1 media were collected from several inches below the top of biofilter beds at the four full scale facilities with sterile scoops and distributed into sterile 1 l polypropylene bottles for transfer to the bench scale columns when shipped to one of the other full scale facilities for bench scale column testing the media were shipped overnight on ice 2 2 bench scale column test configuration each bench test included operation of four to eight columns 5 1 cm diameter x 30 cm long each packed with 25 4 cm of homogenized media figs s1 3 the biofiltration influent water from the full scale plant at each testing site was fed by peristaltic pumps to the columns in parallel at 1 3 m h to provide an empty bed contact time ebct of 12 min except for facility a where columns were fed by gravity with a constant head and flows were adjusted every day to maintain an ebct of 12 min one pair of columns served as duplicate control columns receiving only the biofiltration influent water the feed water to additional pairs of columns was supplemented with different ingredients hypothesized to contribute to the release of ndma precursors by the biofilters for comparison against the control columns 2 3 effect of influent water constituents the first experiment involved three tests to evaluate the contributions of specific influent water constituents to the increase in n nitrosamine precursors during biofiltration for the first two tests biofiltration media from facilities a and c were tested at facility b in separate eight day column tests in full scale sampling biofiltration increased the levels of ndma precursors in one of two sampling events at facilities b and c but not during the only sampling event at facility a table 1 each test employed eight columns divided into four sets of duplicate columns the columns were fed with biofiltration influent water from facility b after adjustment to ph 8 from 8 6 to 8 9 table 1 using hydrochloric acid one set of duplicate columns was fed only with ph adjusted influent water to serve as controls table 2 the influent to the other three sets of duplicate columns was spiked with constituents hypothesized to result in an increase in n nitrosamine precursors during biofiltration in a separate eight day column test biofiltration media retrieved from the full scale biofilters at facility a was tested in four columns at facility a the biofiltration influent water was adjusted to ph 8 from 7 7 to 8 1 table 1 one set of duplicate columns served as controls while the ph adjusted influent to another set of duplicate columns was spiked with constituents hypothesized to result in an increase in n nitrosamine precursors during biofiltration table 2 this test also was conducted as a first step to assess whether different source waters e g facility a vs facility b biofilter influent applied to the same media i e from facility a resulted in different trends in ndma formation across the control biofilters for all three column tests each set of duplicate columns was exposed to a test condition for two days and up to four conditions were tested per set of columns for a total of eight days grab samples of the common influent to each pair of columns and the individual effluents of each column were collected after two days of exposure to each test condition the objective was to achieve a balance between stable operation at each condition while minimizing the timescale of each column test to reduce the potential for significant evolution of the microbial community within the biofilms resulting from exposure to a different influent water thus the effect of influent water constituents could be isolated from changes in the microbial community to evaluate whether the microbial community had changed during the tests samples of filter media from each column were collected at the beginning and end of the testing period and were frozen for subsequent dna extraction and microbial community analysis text s2 2 3 1 effect of ammonia hydroxylamine and chloramines previous research had indicated an increase in ndma precursor concentrations across some but not all nitrifying biofilters at full scale treatment plants krasner et al 2018a 2018b but the importance of nitrification at these facilities was unclear the first set of tests involved spiking the biofiltration influent water adjusted to ph 8 with ammonia 0 1 1 0 mg n l at facilities a and b hydroxylamine nh2oh 0 1 mg n l at facility b or preformed monochloramine nh2cl 0 5 2 0 mg l as cl2 at facility b table 2 spiking of ammonia to certain columns served to promote nitrifying conditions for comparison to the non nitrifying control columns while hydroxylamine is one potential intermediate formed during nitrification lee 1952 that has been associated with ndma formation padhye et al 2011 chloraminated water can be used to backwash filters and nitrifying biofilms in chloraminated drinking water distribution systems have been associated with the release of ndma precursors in other research zeng and mitch 2016 stock monochloramine solutions 73 291 mg l as cl2 were prepared fresh daily by titrating sodium hypochlorite into ammonium chloride at a 1 1 2 molar ratio in 250 mm borate buffer adjusted to ph 9 with sodium hydroxide 2 3 2 effect of wastewater associated precursors or polydadmac polymer usage previous research has demonstrated that use of wastewater impacted source waters schreiber and mitch 2006b dai and mitch 2013 zeng et al 2016b or polydadmac polymer shah and mitch 2012 krasner et al 2013 zeng et al 2016a is associated with an increase in ndma formation during chloramination biofiltration influent water adjusted to ph 8 was spiked with 2 5 or 7 5 by volume of a secondary wastewater effluent or 0 2 mg l or 0 6 mg l of polydadmac at facility b table 2 at facility a the biofiltration influent water adjusted to ph 8 was spiked with 0 6 mg l polydadmac the levels of ndma precursors measured before and after biofiltration in columns receiving spiked influent water were compared to those associated with parallel unspiked control columns the wastewater was a secondary municipal wastewater effluent sample collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant upstream of disinfection polydadmac aqua hawk 6527 hawkins inc roseville mn usa was obtained from the stock tank at facility c containing a 20 polydadmac solution the concentrations are indicated in mg l as polydadmac rather than as polydadmac solution 2 4 effect of influent ph the second bench scale experiment evaluated the effect of biofiltration influent water ph on the change in n nitrosamine precursors during biofiltration biofiltration media samples collected from facilities b and d were used for bench scale testing at facility b four of the eight columns were loaded with media from facility b and the other four were loaded with media from facility d for each media one pair of columns was fed with the full scale biofiltration influent water at facility b at its ambient ph 8 6 the other pair of columns with each media was fed with facility b s biofiltration influent water adjusted to ph 7 8 or 9 with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide each ph was tested for two days table 2 after which grab samples were collected from the combined biofiltration influent to each pair of columns and each individual column effluent media samples were collected before and after the bench test to evaluate the potential for changes to the microbial community during the test text s2 2 5 importance of influent water vs microbial community the third bench scale column experiment compared the importance of influent water versus the microbial community within the biofilters for the change in n nitrosamine precursors during biofiltration at each of the facilities a b and c i e three separate tests duplicate pairs of columns were filled with biofiltration media from facilities a b and c for a side by side comparison of the different biofiltration media exposed to each of the three biofiltration influent waters the biofiltration influent water was adjusted to ph 8 prior to application to the columns at facility b but was maintained at the ambient ph at facility a 7 7 8 0 and facility c 6 7 7 0 facility a applies ozone upstream of biofiltration table 1 accordingly the ozone treated water served as the influent to the bench scale columns at facility a however another pair of columns at facility a containing biofiltration media from this facility was also fed with water obtained upstream of ozonation to evaluate the impact of ozonation fig s3 this experiment was conducted over 6 weeks with samples collected after 1 day 1 week 2 weeks 4 weeks and 6 weeks backwashing was conducted to maintain the 12 min ebct after 6 weeks 4 bed volumes of buffered deionized water 5 mm phosphate buffer at ph 7 2 were fed through the columns at facilities a and b to evaluate the importance of precursors shedding from the biofilters because this experiment was conducted at the end of the study samples of biofiltration media were not analyzed to characterize the microbial communities however samples collected from these media during experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated significant differences in the microbial communities between the different facilities 2 6 sampling and analytical methods water samples from the influents and effluents of the bench scale biofiltration columns were collected in fluorinated lined bottles shipped overnight on ice to stanford university and stored at 4 c one set of sample bottles contained 33 mg l l ascorbic acid to quench any residual oxidants upon sample collection in order to measure the background level of n nitrosamines another set of samples was treated with preformed monochloramine under ufc conditions in the lab to evaluate the level of disinfection byproduct precursors shah et al 2012 briefly water samples were adjusted to ph 8 0 with 4 mm borate buffer and then treated with 5 mg l as cl2 preformed monochloramine chloraminated samples were held at room temperature 20 c in the dark for 3 days and then the chloramine residual was quenched by 33 mg l l ascorbic acid the samples were stored at 4 c and extracted within 24 h for analysis of n nitrosamines or for a limited subset of samples for halogenated dbps a subset of samples were also filtered through 0 7 μm glass fiber filters prior to chloramine ufc treatment to distinguish between soluble and particle associated n nitrosamine precursors ammonia nitrite nitrate and monochloramine were measured on site by hach 10205 10207 10206 and indophenol methods respectively doc was measured using a shimadzu toc l analyzer eight n nitrosamines including ndma n nitrosomethylethylamine n nitrosodiethylamine n nitrosodipropylamine n nitrosodibutylamine n nitrosopyrrolidine n nitrosopiperidine and n nitrosomorpholine nmor were measured using a modified version of us epa method 521 with 2 ng l method reporting limits modified versions of us epa methods 551 1 and 552 3 were used to measure thirty five halogenated dbps in eight dbp classes with 0 2 μg l method report limits including the four regulated trihalomethanes thm4 six iodinated trihalomethanes i thms ten haloacetic acids haas including iodoacetic acid iaa four haloacetonitriles hans four haloacetaldehydes hals four haloacetamides hams two haloketones hks and one halonitromethane hnm trichloronitromethane chloropicrin tcnm text s1 summarizes additional analytical details as discussed in chuang and mitch 2017 and zeng and mitch 2016 3 results and discussion none of the eight n nitrosamines were detected 2 ng l in samples prior to chloramine ufc treatment after ufc treatment ndma was the only n nitrosamine detected and is referred to as ndma ufc in the following discussion 3 1 ndma formation from hypothesized precursors in the influent water biofiltration media from facilities a and c were fed the biofiltration influent water from facility b adjusted to ph 8 and spiked with different constituents hypothesized to contribute to the increase in ndma ufc across the biofilters for comparison against control columns receiving unspiked water a similar test was conducted using biofiltration media from facility a fed with biofiltration influent water from facility a after adjustment to ph 8 this was the only experiment where the influent water was transported to a different location stored in a holding tank and pumped to the biofiltration columns the spiked constituents included ammonia nh2oh nh2cl wastewater effluent and polydadmac 3 1 1 microbial community analyses the total timescale of the tests was limited to 8 days to minimize the potential for changes in the microbial communities and thereby isolate the importance of influent water constituents microbial community analyses conducted on media samples before and after the tests demonstrated that the microbial communities did not change significantly during the tests the microbial community on media from facility a significantly differed from that from facility c p 0 01 table s2 for example media from facility a featured a higher abundance of sequences from the family sphingomonodaceae and blastocatellaceae but less nitrosomonadacea and bradyrhizobiaceae fig s4 however while a principal coordinate analysis provides a visualization of the differences between the microbial communities from media from facilities a and c it also shows that each community was relatively stable throughout the tests text s3 and fig s5 furthermore the microbial community on the media from facility a after the test at facility a was similar p 0 07 table s2 to the same media following the test conducted at facility b fig s5 while the community diversity increased somewhat in media from both facilities during the tests as indicated by the increase in the proportion of minor populations lumped into other the relative abundances of the dominant populations in columns receiving spiked influent waters remained similar to those receiving unspiked water 3 1 2 control column results during the test involving media from facility a fed with water from facility b the ndma ufc concentrations in the unspiked influent water ranged from 10 ng l to 21 ng l over the course of the 8 day test fig 1 a the ndma ufc concentrations in the control column effluents also varied over the 8 day test but there was always an increase in ndma ufc concentrations across the control columns range 11 41 ng l for the test involving media from facility c fed with facility b water the ndma ufc concentrations in the unspiked influent water were relatively consistent i e 18 21 ng l over the 8 day test fig 1b the ndma ufc concentrations in the control column effluents were similarly less variable exhibiting an increase in ndma ufc concentrations across the biofilters ranging from 16 to 21 ng l in contrast the test involving media from facility a fed with facility a water exhibited 8 9 ng l ndma ufc in the unspiked influent and only 9 10 ng l in the control column effluents fig 2 for tests involving media from facility a the significant increase in ndma ufc concentrations across biofilters when fed unspiked water from facility b but lack of an increase when fed water from facility a suggested the importance of source water constituents given that the microbial community was similar between the two tests fig s4 3 1 3 effects of ammonia hydroxylamine and chloramines since previous research had provided conflicting suggestions regarding a link between nitrifying biofilms and the release of ndma precursors section 1 0 the effect of spiking the influent water with ammonia or hydroxylamine a potential intermediate during nitrification was tested ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa were identified in media from facilities a and c fig s6 for testing at facility b nitrification was not observed in control columns due to the low ammonia concentrations in the influent water at that facility 0 02 mg n l table 1 however when the influent was spiked with 0 1 1 0 mg n l ammonia 38 72 of the ammonia was consumed with media from facility a while nearly all of the ammonia was consumed with media from facility c the ammonia was converted primarily to nitrate table s3 for the test involving media from facility a at facility a ammonia consumption ranged from 23 to 50 in all cases involving spiking of ammonia or hydroxylamine there was no evidence that the spiking promoted an increase in ndma ufc concentrations across the biofilters figs 1 and 2 for the 1 mg n l ammonia spike test involving media from facility c at facility b the level of ndma ufc measured in the biofilter influent declined relative to the control columns fig 1 likely because the additional ammonia shifted the chloramine speciation towards monochloramine from dichloramine equation 1 the predominant inorganic chloramine precursor to ndma schreiber and mitch 2006a mccurry et al 2017 furst et al 2018 the molar ratio of chlorine to ammonia 1 1 2 employed to generate chloramine stocks for the ufc protocol was not adjusted for the ammonia concentrations in the samples spiking with 1 mg n l ammonia reduced the ndma ufc concentrations in the effluents of columns containing media from both facilities a and c fig 1 the reason for these declines is unclear but should not have involved a change in chloramine speciation because the effluents of the columns containing media c were fully nitrified table s3 for the test involving media from facility a at facility a the ammonia spiking actually resulted in a mild decrease in ndma ufc concentrations across the biofilters fig 2 these results suggested that ammonia and the associated induction of nitrification were not significant drivers for the increase in ndma ufc concentrations during biofiltration facility b employs chloraminated water for backwashing the full scale biofilters table 1 for tests at facility b 0 5 2 0 mg l as cl2 of nh2cl was spiked into the influent water to evaluate the impact of chloramines on the increase in ndma ufc concentrations across biofilters the nh2cl stock solution contained a 20 molar excess of ammonia similar to the ammonia spiking tests the biofilters consumed the ammonia and chloramines to produce nitrate with media from facility c exhibiting nearly complete conversion table s4 while increasing the nh2cl spiking concentration increased the ndma ufc concentrations in the column influents the ndma concentrations in the column effluents declined fig 1 for the 2 0 mg l as cl2 spiking concentration the effluent ndma ufc concentrations reached levels measured in the unspiked influent water these results suggest that exposure to chloramines inhibited microbial transformation of ndma precursors by the biofilters 3 1 4 effects of wastewater and polydadmac wastewater effluent 2 5 and 7 5 by volume and 0 2 mg l and 0 6 mg l polydadmac were spiked into the influent at facility b and 0 6 mg l polydadmac was spiked into the influent at facility a these tests evaluated whether the microbial community biotransformed these known ndma precursors into more potent forms except for the 2 5 wastewater spike for media from facility c at facility b and the 0 6 mg l polydadmac spike for media from facility a at facility a these spikes resulted in an increase in ndma ufc concentrations in the column influents figs 1 and 2 however no measurable increases in ndma ufc concentrations were observed across the biofilters relative to the unspiked controls suggesting that biotransformation of wastewater associated precursors or polydadmac by the biofilters did not drive an increase in ndma ufc concentrations across biofilters indeed 0 6 mg l polydadmac eliminated any increase in ndma ufc across the biofilters likely due to inhibition associated with the toxicity of their organic quaternary amine functional groups towards microbes siedenbiedel and tiller 2012 3 2 effect of influent water ph in full scale sampling biofiltration increased ndma ufc concentrations during one sample event at facility b but not at facility d table 1 the biofiltration influent water at facility b featured a higher ph 8 6 8 9 due to upstream lime softening compared to facility d ph 6 2 experiment 2 evaluated the hypothesis that higher biofiltration influent ph promoted an increase in ndma ufc concentrations by comparing column influent and effluent ndma ufc concentrations with media from facilities b or d fed with biofiltration influent water from facility b the biofiltration influent water was adjusted to ph 7 8 or 9 for comparison to control columns fed with influent water at the ambient ph 8 6 analysis of the microbial community indicated no significant changes for media from either facility over the 8 day test figs s5 and s7 the ph did not impact the ndma ufc concentrations in the column influent waters range 21 25 ng l fig 3 suggesting that hydrolysis of precursors to more reactive forms e g dimethylformamide hydrolysis to dimethylamine mitch and sedlak 2004 was not significant for media from facility d ndma ufc concentrations in column effluents increased with the influent ph note that the ufc procedure involved adjustment of the ph to 8 prior to chloramine application such that the ph affected the level of ndma precursors not the chloramine speciation however ph did not affect the ndma ufc concentrations in the effluents of columns containing media from facility b considering that the normal ph 6 2 of the influent water at facility d was much lower than those evaluated in this test table 1 it is possible that the change in ph triggered a stress response in the microbial community leading to the release of microbial products sutherland 2001 serving as ndma precursors in an additional test at facility b water obtained from facility b either upstream or downstream of softening was fed side by side to columns containing media from each of facilities a b and c and samples were collected after each of two days of testing softening substantially increased the ndma ufc concentrations in the column influents from 10 12 ng l to 27 30 ng l fig 4 suggesting that hydrolysis at high ph converted ndma precursors into more potent forms for each of the three media biofiltration increased the ndma ufc concentrations to 16 23 ng l when fed water upstream of softening but decreased the ndma ufc concentrations to 18 22 ng l when fed softened water these results suggest that biofiltration could remove a fraction of the precursors produced during softening note that the full scale biofilters at facility b are fed with softened water and while an increase in ndma ufc during biofiltration has been observed during some sampling events table 1 and fig 1 in others the level has remained the same table 1 or in additional sampling conducted by the facility has declined 3 3 the importance of influent water versus the microbial community the results from experiments wherein well characterized precursors were spiked into the influent water indicated that these precursors were not responsible for the increase in ndma ufc concentrations across biofilters figs 1 and 2 however the results indicating an increase in ndma ufc concentrations across the biofilters when media from facility a was exposed to water from facility b but not water from facility a figs 1 and 2 suggested that uncharacterized precursors in the influent water were more significant than differences in the microbial community for driving the increase in ndma ufc concentrations during biofiltration to further evaluate this question biofiltration media from facilities a b and c were compared side by side when fed with influent water from facilities a b or c although changes in the microbial community were not quantified these tests were conducted for 6 weeks such that the microbial community could have evolved the ndma ufc concentrations in the influent water were highest at facility b range 20 44 ng l with lower values at facilities a range 8 8 14 ng l and c range 9 3 12 ng l on the first day of testing an increase in ndma ufc concentrations was observed across columns containing all three media when fed with water from facility b but ndma ufc concentrations in column effluents remained comparable to those in the influents when columns containing the three media were fed water from facilities a and c fig 5 the results were somewhat similar for later sampling times although the increase observed across columns fed with water from facility b declined over time and was not observable after 42 days typically the greatest increases in ndma ufc concentrations were observed for media from facilities a and c when fed with water from facility b suggesting the potential for exposure to the new water to trigger the release of ndma precursors note that the increases in ndma ufc concentrations during biofiltration observed in full scale sampling at facilities b and c were observed in one sampling event but not in another at each facility table 1 suggesting that whether an increase in ndma ufc concentration occurs during biofiltration varies over time likely due to changes in influent water quality overall these results suggest that uncharacterized influent water constituents were more important than differences in the microbial community for determining changes in ndma ufc concentrations resulting from biotransformation within biofilters after the 6 week test buffered deionized water was passed through columns containing each of the three media at facilities a and b to evaluate the potential for precursors to shed from biofilms at facility a the ndma ufc rinsed from each media was 4 ng l concurring with the lack of significant increase in ndma ufc concentrations across the biofilters during the test table s5 at facility b 13 5 ng l 8 4 ng l and 5 7 ng l ndma ufc were detected in the deionized water rinsed from media associated with facilities a b and c respectively these levels of ndma precursors shed from the media could account for a significant fraction of the 21 ng l ndma ufc concentration measured in the biofilter effluents at the end of the 6 week test fig 5 filtration of these deionized water rinses from media associated with facilities a and c prior to chloramine ufc treatment reduced ndma ufc concentrations by 20 suggesting that these precursors were primarily dissolved however filtration reduced the ndma ufc in the water rinsed from the media associated with facility b to 2 ng l suggesting that the precursors were particle associated overall these results suggest that a portion of the source water constituents biotransformed during biofiltration can remain associated with the media rinsing can release these precursors in either a dissolved form wherein they could appear as smps or a particulate form since facility a employs ozone upstream of biofiltration table 1 ozonated water was fed to the columns containing all three media at this facility no increase in ndma ufc concentrations was observed during biofiltration at this facility fig 5 during the same test at facility a a separate set of columns containing media from facility a was fed with non ozonated influent water to evaluate the effect of ozone pre treatment ozonation substantially reduced the ndma ufc concentrations in the column influents from 49 69 ng l down to 8 14 ng l fig 6 although several studies have demonstrated that ndma can form during ozonation of wastewater sgroi et al 2014 zeng et al 2016c chuang and mitch 2017 chuang et al 2019a 2019c ozonation typically reduces the concentrations of ndma precursors in conventional drinking waters lee et al 2007 shah et al 2012 mccurry et al 2015 while ndma ufc concentrations were similar before and after biofiltration when biofilters were fed ozonated water decreases in ndma ufc concentrations of up to 29 ng l were observed across biofilters fed non ozonated influent water fig 6 regardless the ndma ufc concentrations remained higher in the effluents of columns receiving non ozonated water suggesting that ozone was more efficient than biofiltration for deactivating the ndma precursors in the influent water from facility a in this case changing the biofiltration influent water to a non ozonated water which could potentially stress the biofilm resulted in a decrease in ndma precursor concentrations across the biofilters 3 4 halogenated dbps halogenated dbps were also measured after chloramine ufc treatment during the first two sampling events of the tests described in section 3 3 haloacetic acids and to a lesser degree haloacetamides trihalomethanes and haloketones were the dominant dbp classes detected fig 7 the total halogenated dbp ufc concentrations in the influent waters were higher at facility c 14 4 1 8 μg l average range from two sampling events than at facilities a 11 0 0 05 μg l and b 10 8 0 5 μg l total halogenated dbp ufc concentrations in the effluents from columns containing media from all three facilities were similar or lower than those in the influent waters for tests conducted at each of the three facilities while there were some differences between media fed with the same influent waters the greatest decreases in halogenated dbp ufc concentrations were observed for biofilters receiving water at facility c halogenated dbp ufc concentrations were also measured in the buffered deionized water passed through the columns at the end of the tests described in section 3 3 the total halogenated dbp ufc concentrations ranged from 2 7 to 6 6 μg l in these samples indicating that the biofilms could shed precursors for halogenated dbps these results suggested that halogenated dbp precursors in the influent water could be removed by biofilters but that such decreases could be partially offset by the release of precursors from the biofilters 4 conclusions full scale and bench scale testing demonstrated that biofiltration can increase ndma ufc concentrations in some but not all facilities even where observed increases were not consistently observed over different sampling events table 1 and fig 5 bench scale experiments comparing biofiltration columns operated side by side under different conditions were used to understand factors associated with changes in ndma ufc concentrations across biofiltration the results demonstrated that differences in influent water constituents were far more important than differences in the microbial communities on the biofiltration media for determining changes in ndma ufc concentrations across biofiltration there were some suggestions that stress conditions induced by changes in source water quality could promote increases in ndma precursor concentrations during biofiltration e g switching the ph of facility b influent water to facility d media fig 3 but this was not always observed e g switching from ozonated to non ozonated influent water at facility a fig 6 tests involving the addition of specific constituents hypothesized to be important based on previous poorly constrained full scale sampling data did not promote increases in ndma ufc concentrations across biofiltration these constituents included inorganic nitrogen constituents associated with nitrification ammonia hydroxylamine and chloramines and ndma precursors hypothesized to undergo biotransformation to more potent precursors including municipal wastewater effluent associated with upstream discharges and polydadmac a cationic polymer used as a coagulant and filter aid the results instead suggest that the biotransformation of source water constituents during biofiltration controls changes in ndma ufc concentrations but the identity of the specific source water constituents remains unclear this is not surprising given that the identity of specific precursors responsible for driving ndma formation in municipal wastewater has remained unclear despite nearly two decades of research li and mitch 2018 the liberation of ndma precursors in the biofiltration influent water fostered by softening at facility b suggests that source water precursors could include hydrolyzable precursors such as dimethylamides but subsequent biofiltration reduced ndma concentrations where source water constituents were biotransformed to ndma precursors a portion of these precursors remained associated with the media these media associated precursors were rinsed from media samples in the dissolved fraction for two of three media such they might appear to be smps for the third media the precursors rinsed from the media were in the particulate fraction such facilities should evaluate whether chloraminated backwashes should be routed to waste regarding treatment options to mitigate increases in ndma ufc concentrations during biofiltration pre oxidation of source water precursors may be effective at facility a where biofiltration reduced ndma ufc concentrations in the absence of ozone pre treatment ozone pre treatment reduced ndma ufc concentrations to a greater degree these results suggest that pre oxidation of precursors upstream of biofiltration could be an effective strategy to mitigate increases in ndma ufc concentrations during biofiltration but further testing with ozone and other pre oxidants e g free chlorine is needed at additional biofiltration facilities even when an increase in ndma ufc concentrations during biofiltration was observed at facility b biofiltration decreased the levels of total halogenated dbp ufc

18441,the effects of uv h2o2 pre oxidation or disinfection methods on the formation of partial disinfection by products dbps have been studied previously this study assessed the effect of uv h2o2 pre oxidation combined with optimisation of the disinfection method on the formation of six classes of cx3r type dbps including trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetaldehydes hals haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms and haloacetamides hams experimental results showed that a simulated distribution system sds in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination effectively decreased total cx3r type dbp formation by 51 1 63 5 compared to sds chlorination but little reduction in dbp associated toxicity was observed the dominant contributors to the calculated toxicity were hans and hals uv h2o2 pre oxidation was able to destroy the aromatic and dissolved organic nitrogen components of natural organic matter as a consequence thm haa and hal formations increased by 49 5 55 0 47 8 61 9 and 42 0 67 1 respectively whereas han hnm and ham formations significantly decreased by 52 1 83 6 42 9 87 3 and 74 1 100 0 uv h2o2 pre oxidation increased total cx3r type dbp formation during sds chlorination whereas sds in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of uv h2o2 treated water produced lower total cx3r type dbps than water without uv h2o2 pre oxidation nevertheless the dbp associated toxicity of water with uv h2o2 pre oxidation was substantially lower than the toxicity for water without uv h2o2 pre oxidation decreased by 24 1 82 7 hals followed by hans contribute to major toxic potencies in uv h2o2 treated water the best dbp concentration and dbp associated toxicity abatement results were achieved for water treated by uv h2o2 coupled with in situ chloramination treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords cx3r type disinfection by products uv h2o2 disinfectant addition method predicted toxicity

it also may lead to an unintended consequence formation of drinking water disinfection by products dbps sedlak and von gunten 2011 as an example chlorine and chloramine two widely used low cost disinfectants can react with natural organic matter nom and or inorganic matter in source water to form a range of dbps richardson et al 2007 considerable attention has been given to identify emerging dbps produced by different disinfection scenarios in recent years yang and zhang 2014 gong and zhang 2015 and many studies examining the halogenated dbps formed from chlorinated or chloraminated drinking water also focused on trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetaldehydes hals haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms and haloacetamides hams due to their greater toxicity and or higher concentration levels richardson et al 2007 bond et al 2011 shah and mitch 2012 these six dbp types thms haas hals hans hnms and hams have a simple and similar cx3r molecular structure fig sm1 and so have been termed cx3r type dbps generally carbonaceous dbps c dbps such as thms and haas which are the first and second largest dbp class by weight have been well studied and are regulated in many countries with maximum concentration limits proscribed krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2007 however there is rising interest in a range of unregulated nitrogenous dbps n dbps including hans hnms and hams shah and mitch 2012 because they exhibit several orders of magnitude higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than the regulated thms and haas and have been frequently detected at the μg l level in many chlorinated chloraminated drinking waters which feature high dissolved organic nitrogen don bond et al 2011 plewa and wagner 2015 wagner and plewa 2017 hals as an important unregulated c dbp class as well are the third largest dbp class by weight krasner et al 2006 jeong et al 2015 a recent toxicity study found that hals exhibited higher cytotoxicity cytotoxicity index value 144 than either hans cytotoxicity index value 16 0 or hnms cytotoxicity index value 75 0 although lower than hams cytotoxicity index value 302 jeong et al 2015 removal of dbp precursors before disinfection is an effective strategy for dbp control our previous studies found that ultraviolet activated hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 pre oxidation effectively reduced formation of three chlorinated n dbps dichloroacetonitrile trichloronitromethane and dichloroacetamide during the subsequent chlorination of high don waters chu et al 2014 while still achieving simultaneous destruction of pharmaceuticals and personal care products yuan et al 2009 chu et al 2016b one previous study has confirmed that uv h2o2 treatment can substantially degrade chlorine reactive and chloramines reactive dissolved organic nitrogen matters which serve as dominant precursors of nas and decrease na formation by around 50 100 during subsequent chlorination or chloramination chuang et al 2019 moreover previous study indicated a lower contribution of nas to dbp associated toxicity from cx3r type dbps due to the lower lc50 values and concentration ng l level of nas chuang and mitch 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 furthermore previous study also demonstrated that mutagenic by product formation from low pressure uv irradiation with and without h2o2 can be neglected hofman caris et al 2015 however previous studies have also reported that uv h2o2 treatment increased formation of regulated c dbps thms and haas during subsequent chlorination dotson et al 2010 metz et al 2011 in particular non selectivity of the hydroxyl radicals produced in a uv h2o2 system enabled it to transform the dissolved organic matter dom structure from higher molecular weight mw to lower mw which increased the reactivity of dom with chlorine to form more thms and haas sarathy and mohseni 2007 bazri et al 2012 therefore it is quite difficult to simultaneously control cx3r type dbps using uv h2o2 pre oxidation treatment alone each class of cx3r type dbps with specific r functional groups exhibited different formation characteristics during chlorination chloramination the differences of dbp formation under different disinfection scenarios were ascribed to the reactivity of chlorine or chloramines toward nom and dbps joo and mitch 2007 deborde and von gunten 2008 yu and reckhow 2015 ding et al 2018c generally chlorination favoured c dbp thm and haa formation rather than n dbp han and ham formation while chloramination promoted the generation of n dbps hans and hams bond et al 2012 shah and mitch 2012 the former phenomenon was attributed to the higher reactivity of chlorine with nom than that of chloramines while the latter phenomenon was attributed to the degradation of n dbps by chlorine rather than chloramines glezer et al 1999 zhang and minear 2002 koudjonou and lebel 2006 yang et al 2007 chu et al 2012 ding et al 2018c moreover it has been shown that the disinfectant addition sequence i e the addition sequence of chlorine and ammonia during chloramination could also alter the fractions of cx3r type dbps produced hayes larson and mitch 2010 huang et al 2017 it has been reported that switching from chloramination to chlorination could decrease thm and haa formation richardson et al 2007 fang et al 2010 and this motivated us to attempt to comprehensively control the six named classes of cx3r type dbps by combining uv h2o2 pre oxidation with an optimised disinfection scenario the objective of this study was therefore to examine the potential of uv h2o2 pre oxidation treatment combined with an optimised disinfection treatment scenario to comprehensively control cx3r type dbps by studying formation of the six cx3r type dbp classes thms haas hals hans hnms and hams in two different types of filtered waters this study is an important contribution to the improved understanding of how cx3r type dbp formation can be more effectively controlled in drinking waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and samples filtered water samples that had not been exposed to any oxidant were collected from the zq and mh drinking water treatment plants which utilized taihu lake and yangtze river water china respectively the water quality characteristics of these filtered water samples are shown in table s1 and detailed information on dbp standards is listed table s2 sodium hypochlorite solution active cl2 5 sigma aldrich st louis usa was diluted to around 4 g l as cl2 and stored in an aluminium foil covered glass bottle at 4 c to prepare a free chlorine stock solution ultrapure water was produced with a millipore milli q gradient water purification system billerica usa all other materials were of at least analytical grade and were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china unless otherwise noted 2 2 experimental procedures batch uv h2o2 experiments were conducted using a collimated beam apparatus consisting of a low pressure mercury lamp above quiescently stirred crystallisation dishes 1 l details of the experimental set up were presented in our previous studies chu et al 2014 2015 based on our previous research results chu et al 2014 small volumes of 30 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were dosed into the water samples to achieve 5 mg l initial concentration and then the samples were immediately irradiated for 30 min to achieve incident irradiation intensities to 585 mj cm2 then the dbp formation potentials fp for the filtered waters without and with uv h2o2 treatment were examined under simulated distribution system sds conditions chuang and mitch 2017 specifically water samples were incubated in headspace free 250 ml brown glass bottles in the dark at 25 0 0 5 c with disinfectants and the total chlorine residuals in the water samples were 1 0 5 mg l as cl2 after 24 h reaction the details of disinfectant demands were added in table s3 after this period the disinfectant residuals were quenched with stoichiometric amounts of ascorbic acid and the water samples were analysed as soon as possible error bars in all the figures represent the relative standard deviation of two duplicates for the initial experiments a range of disinfectant concentrations 5 15 mg l as cl2 were dosed into the filtered and uv h2o2 treated water to investigate the disinfectant demands of 24 h reaction for chlorination experiments predetermined amounts of chlorine solution were added to the water samples for the ammonia then chlorine experiments nh4 cl2 predetermined amounts of ammonium chloride solution were firstly added and then free chlorine was added at the mass ratio of 4 mg l chlorine to 1 mg l ammonia after around 20 s for the chlorine then ammonia experiments cl2 nh4 predetermined amounts of free chlorine solution were added following by the addition of ammonium chloride at the mass ratio of 4 mg l chlorine residual to 1 mg l ammonia after 30 min pre chlorination reaction considering the addition methods of chloramines in drinking water treatment plants and the instability of monochloramine the preformed monochloramine experiment was not conducted in this study hayes larson and mitch 2010 huang et al 2017 2 3 analytical methods free chlorine and total chlorine were analysed using a hach pocket colorimetertmii photometer loveland usa with hach n n diethyl 1 4 phenylenediamine sulfate dpd free chlorine reagent and dpd total chlorine reagent loveland usa respectively the analytical results for dissolved organic carbon doc don inorganic nitrogen ammonia nitrate and nitrite bromide and bromate were based on those from our previous study ding et al 2018a thms hans and hnms were analysed using an oi analytical eclipse 4660 purge trap sample concentrator college station usa and a shimadzu qp2010plus gas chromatograph gc coupled with a qp2010 mass spectrometer kyoto japan hals and hams were analysed using a shimadzu qp2010plus gc coupled with an electron capture detector kyoto japan haas were derivatised to their corresponding esters using 10 sulfuric acid in methanol v v and then analysed using a shimadzu qp2010plus gc equipped with an electron capture detector kyoto japan analytical details of cx3r type dbps have been presented elsewhere and have been summarized in table s4 chu et al 2016a ding et al 2018c to investigate the role of bromide in the formation and speciation of dbps bromide substitution factor bsf for thms dihaloacetic acids dhaas dihaloacetaldehydes dhals dihaloacetonitriles dhans dihalonitromethanes dhnms and dihaloacetamides dhams were calculated based on eq 1 where n and m represent the number of halogens and bromines respectively ding et al 2019 1 b s f c x 3 r m 1 n m c h 3 n c l n m b r m r n m 0 n c h 3 n c l n m b r m r n 2 o r 3 2 4 determination of dbp associated toxicity the contribution of a dbp class to the dbp associated toxicity of disinfected water is a function of both its concentration and its potential toxicity a comprehensive applied approach in which the toxicity was assumed to be additive was employed to estimate the contribution of individual dbps to the dbp associated toxicity krasner et al 2016 chuang and mitch 2017 ding et al 2018b values for predicted cytotoxicity were calculated by dividing the measured concentrations by published lc50 values which were the doses required to induce 50 viability of the cells after 72 h exposure as compared to the concurrent negative control for chinese hamster ovary cells and these values have been presented in table s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of different disinfection scenarios on cx3r type dbp formation fig 1 presents the formation of cx3r type dbps under sds conditions with different disinfection scenarios when water samples were treated by sds chlorination 13 and 18 of the 24 halogenated dbps were detected in zq and mh water respectively the number of dbp species in the mh water was also higher than for zq water under the in situ chloramination or chlorination followed by chloramination processes these phenomena could be explained by the fact that zq water produced less brominated dbps due to its lower bromide concentration table s1 brominated hals hans hnms and hams were not detected in zq water the number of measured dbp species from chlorination in situ chloramination or chlorination followed by chloramination treatment were close four regulated thms 337 8 22 6 nm and 505 3 8 1 nm respectively and four regulated haas 202 8 15 4 nm and 239 6 5 8 nm respectively from the sds chlorination of zq and mh water accounted for the majority of cx3r type dbps by molar weight although the doc concentration for zq water was higher than it was for mh water the sums of the thm and haa concentrations from the chlorination of mh water were higher due to the higher suva254 table s1 a previous study has shown that compounds with higher absorbance at 254 nm formed thms and haas with higher yields gallard and von gunten 2002 the molar concentrations of hans 141 6 12 8 nm and 129 2 3 1 nm for zq and mh water respectively were relatively higher than the concentrations of hals 77 5 1 5 nm and 121 8 7 4 nm for zq and mh water respectively during sds chlorination chlorination of zq and mh water produced less hnms 20 6 1 4 nm and 14 7 1 1 nm respectively and hams 19 3 0 9 nm and 11 7 1 0 nm respectively when ammonia was added 20 s prior to free chlorine the concentrations of thms haas and hals significantly decreased the differences of dbp formation under different disinfection scenarios were ascribed to the reactivity of chlorine or chloramines toward nom and dbps compared to the chlorination process thm haa and hal concentrations from zq water decreased by 88 6 87 5 and 86 8 to 38 5 0 5 nm 25 4 2 3 nm and 10 2 0 6 nm respectively while the concentrations of thms haas and hals from mh water decreased by 87 8 84 3 and 87 5 to 61 5 3 5 nm 37 5 3 5 nm and 15 2 0 8 nm respectively the decreased c dbps were ascribed to the reaction of ammonia with free chlorine kapp 1 3 1 8 104 m 1s 1 competing with the reaction of chlorine with nom deborde and von gunten 2008 chloramines yielded from the reaction of chlorine with ammonia were the dominant reactive chlorine species due to the high ammonia concentration previous studies had indicated that the reactivity of chloramines with nom was much less than that of chlorine deborde and von gunten 2008 ding et al 2018b in contrast to c dbps hans and hams from the in situ chloramination of zq water increased by 64 1 and 252 3 to 232 4 16 8 nm and 68 0 2 0 nm respectively while the concentrations of hans and hams from mh water increased by 45 9 and 294 8 to 188 5 7 4 nm and 46 2 3 5 nm respectively the increased hans and hams were attributed to the high instability of hans and hams in the presence of chlorine yu and reckhow 2015 ding et al 2018c in the in situ chloramination process free chlorine was primarily converted into chloramines which cannot lead to degradation of hans and hams yu and reckhow 2015 ding et al 2018c compared to the discussion above variations of hnms from zq water and mh water were the opposite compared to chlorination the formation of hnms during the in situ chloramination of zq water decreased by 18 9 to 16 7 0 5 nm whereas the concentration of hnms from mh water increased by 62 6 to 23 9 2 0 nm this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that hnm concentration depends on the formation and degradation of hnms during reaction the hnm formation pathway mainly involved oxidation of nitrogen in amine precursors to form nitro groups followed by halogenation of α carbon shah and mitch 2012 therefore chlorine favours the formation of nitro groups and halogenation due to its higher oxidizing ability compared to chloramines however chlorine also leads to the faster degradation of hnms than chloramines do joo and mitch 2007 taken together the different hnm variation trends for zq water and mh water under chlorination and in situ chloramination may be attributed to different water characteristics when zq water and mh water were treated by pre chlorination followed by chloramination thm haa and hal concentrations were all slightly higher than with in situ chloramination but much less than those achieved by chlorination thm haa and hal concentrations from zq water were 72 7 5 7 nm 48 8 1 5 nm and 40 5 7 1 nm respectively while the figures for mh water were 146 3 3 6 nm 53 4 2 2 nm and 33 5 2 7 nm respectively and these increased c dbp concentrations were attributed to the 30 min pre chlorination abatement of hans and hams was observed during pre chlorination followed by chloramination compared to in situ chloramination this may be ascribed to the fact that chlorine reacts with nitrile and amide groups in precursors during pre chlorination which converts han and ham precursors into non precursors yu and reckhow 2015 ding et al 2018c even so han and ham concentrations generated from pre chlorination followed by chloramination were still higher than the concentrations achieved with the chlorination process this indicated that the degradation of hans and hams by chlorine was the primary reason for their decreases as discussed previously chlorination favours formation of nitro groups and halogenation of alkyl groups compared to chloramination shah and mitch 2012 when water samples were treated by pre chlorination 30 min the hnm concentrations from the zq and mh waters increased by 16 2 and 13 0 to 19 4 0 3 nm and 27 0 2 6 nm respectively compared with in situ chloramination the competitive reactions of chlorine with ammonia kapp 1 3 1 8 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 chlorine with bromide kapp 1 2 5 3 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7

bromamines and bromochloramine with nom and reactive halogen chlorine chloramines bromine and bromochloramine with cx3r type dbps will impact the bsf joo and mitch 2007 deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 ding et al 2018c fig sm2 shows the bsfs of cx3r type dbps under chlorination in situ chloramination and chlorination followed by chloramination bsfs for thms dhaas and dhals all increased in the following order nh4 cl2 process cl2 process cl2 nh4 process previous studies have reported that thms haas and hals were relatively less reactive with chlorine and chloramines than hans hnms or hams zhang and minear 2002 ma et al 2016 ding et al 2018c during in situ chloramination processes free chlorine preferably reacts with ammonia rather than bromide due to the higher reaction rates of free chlorine with ammonia and higher concentration of ammonia therefore monochloramine was the dominant chlorine species the slower oxidation rate of bromide by monochloramine resulted in lower reactive bromine concentrations which further lead to the lower bsfs of thms haas and hals than those achieved by chlorination fig sm2 however the bsfs of thms haas and hals achieved during pre chlorination followed by chloramination were relatively higher than those achieved by chlorination alone during the pre chlorination process bromide was converted into bromine within several minutes based on calculation of the kinetic constant and when ammonia was added residual bromine and chlorine reacted with it to generate bromamine and chloramine respectively the reactivity of bromine in bromamine is five to six orders of magnitude higher than chlorine in chloramine whereas bromine reactions are only up to three orders of magnitude higher than chlorine lei et al 2006 heeb et al 2014 therefore the bsfs of thms haas and hals from pre chlorination followed by chloramination were higher than those achieved by chlorination alone fig sm2 as for hans and hams the bsfs from the in situ chloramination process were higher than those from chlorination but lower than those from the pre chlorination followed by chloramination process the former phenomenon was primarily attributed to the degradation of hans and hams in the presence of chlorine yu and reckhow 2015 ding et al 2018c and the reason for the latter phenomenon was similar to that for c dbps brominated hals were not detected in any samples 3 2 effect of disinfection scenarios on aggregated cx3r type dbp formation and variations in dbp associated toxicity compared with the chlorination process the aggregated cx3r type dbps from in situ chloramination and from pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water decreased by 51 1 and 52 0 to 391 2 24 2 nm and 384 1 17 9 nm fig 2 a while the aggregated cx3r type dbps from mh water decreased by 63 5 and 55 5 to 372 8 20 8 nm and 455 2 19 6 nm respectively fig 2b these results showed that chlorination favoured formation of aggregated cx3r type dbps which was consistent with findings from previous studies bond et al 2014 ding et al 2018b although organic halogen in regulated thms and haas only accounted for 20 or even less of the total organic halogen they may serve as a surrogate for the formation potential of other unregulated dbps and total dbp associated toxicity krasner et al 2006 thms and haas constituted 42 2 and 25 3 respectively of the total cx3r type dbps derived from the chlorination of zq water while the percentages of thms and haas to the total cx3r type dbp concentration from the chlorination of mh water were 49 4 and 23 4 respectively hals and hans both accounted for 10 of the total cx3r type dbps produced by chlorination the ratios of hnms and hams to total cx3r type dbp concentrations were generally 3 when the chlorination process was substituted by either the in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination processes the percentage contributions from each cx3r type dbp class to the total cx3r type dbps by molar weight significantly varied the sum of the thms plus the haas constituted 40 of the cx3r type dbps in contrast to thms and haas the percentage of n dbps particularly for hans significantly increased hans accounted for 40 of the cx3r type dbps under the in situ chloramination and the pre chlorination followed by chloramination processes since the percentages of the individual dbp classes and the concentrations of aggregate cx3r type dbps were altered under the different disinfection process the percentage contributions of individual dbp classes to the total dbp associated toxicity and the dbp associated toxicity itself changed it should be acknowledged that the reduction of dbp associated toxicity is more important than the abatement of dbp concentration as shown in fig 2e and 2f the lowest calculated dbp associated toxicities from zq water and mh water 0 004 and 0 01 respectively were observed from application of the in situ chloramination process although the total cx3r type dbp concentration produced from the in situ chloramination and the pre chlorination followed by chloramination processes were substantially less than that produced by the chlorination process the differences of the calculated dbp associated toxicity were insignificant indicating that disinfection scenario does not play a conclusive role in the reduction of calculated dbp associated toxicity the main drivers of the dbp associated toxicity changed however although thms and haas dominated by molar weight during chlorination they accounted for 2 of the calculated dbp associated toxicity due to their lower toxic potency wagner and plewa 2017 in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination treatment further decreased the percentage contributions of thms and haas to the total dbp associated toxicity for the lower thm and haa concentrations hans and hals accounted 45 2 and 51 5 of the dbp associated toxicity in chlorinated zq water respectively fig 2g and 2h and 36 5 and 61 8 of the dbp associated toxicity of chlorinated mh water fig 2g and 2h similar to the variation of dbp concentration for individual dbp class hans constituted more than approximately 75 of the dbp associated toxicity during in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination followed by hals 5 6 23 1 fig 2g and 2h although hnms and hams were shown to have relatively high toxic potency the percentage contributions of hnms and hams to the total dbp associated toxicity 1 and 2 respectively were much lower than hans and hals for the lower concentrations wagner and plewa 2017 3 3 effect of uv h2o2 pre oxidation on cx3r type dbp formation table s3 shows the effect of uv h2o2 treatment on disinfectant demand in different disinfection scenarios disinfectant demands from uv h2o2 pre oxidation followed by the chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water increased by 52 3 32 0 and 38 0 to 4 51 mg l 2 02 mg l and 2 29 mg l respectively compared to control experiments without uv h2o2 treatment while uv h2o2 pre oxidation increased disinfectant demands by 59 7 18 2 and 19 8 to 6 61 mg l 2 92 mg l and 3 21 mg l respectively from the chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of mh water although uv h2o2 treatment slightly mineralize nom resulting in the decreases of doc hydroxyl radicals formed from the activation of h2o2 with uv irradiation convert larger mw hydrophobic nom into smaller mw hydrophilic nom dotson et al 2010 metz et al 2011 chu et al 2014 the increase of smaller mw nom fractions results in increased disinfectant demands moreover hydroxylation of nom with phenolic like structures also lead to the increases of disinfectant demands dotson et al 2010 furthermore the residual small amount of h2o2 in sample may also increase the disinfectant demands the results in this study are also consistent with previous researches by others dotson et al 2010 metz et al 2011 table s1 also shows that uv h2o2 advanced oxidation treatment improved the removal rate of uv absorbance at 254 nm and suva254 when water samples were treated by uv h2o2 zq water and mh water suva254 values decreased from 1 7 l mg m and 3 4 l mg m to 1 5 l mg m and 2 7 l mg m respectively indicating that there was clearer aromaticity reduction moreover the bromide concentration variation in uv h2o2 treated mh water could be neglected table s1 whereas the bromide concentration in uv h2o2 treated zq water decreased by 8 μg l to 13 μg l fig 3 and fig 4 show the effects of uv h2o2 pre oxidation on the formation of cx3r type dbps during chlorination in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq and mh water respectively uv h2o2 treatment increased thm and haa concentrations upon chlorination in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination in both zq water and mh water thms from uv h2o2 pre oxidation followed by the chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water increased by 55 0 47 8 and 67 1 to 523 6 47 4 nm 64 0 μg l 57 0 5 4 nm 6 8 μg l and 121 5 4 8 nm 14 5 μg l fig 3a respectively compared to control experiments without uv h2o2 treatment while uv h2o2 pre oxidation increased thm formation by 49 5 61 9 and 42 0 to 755 6 49 4 nm 104 8 μg l 99 5 0 7 nm 13 9 μg l and 207 7 6 2 nm 26 9 μg l fig 4a respectively from the chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of mh water haa concentrations from the chlorination in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water increased to 213 3 2 7 nm 27 5 μg l 40 3 0 3 nm 5 2 μg l and 61 3 2 4 nm 7 9 μg l fig 3b respectively while chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of uv h2o2 treated mh water produced 318 8 19 7 nm 46 7 μg l 46 6 1 9 nm 6 7 μg l and 72 1 3 9 nm 10 1 μg l haas fig 4b respectively this phenomenon is in accordance with previous studies and can be explained by the fact that hydroxyl radicals convert larger mw hydrophobic nom into smaller mw hydrophilic nom dotson et al 2010 metz et al 2011 chu et al 2014 the increase of smaller mw nom fractions resulted in increased disinfectant demands which favoured formation of thms and haas dotson et al 2010 metz et al 2011 as shown in figs 3c and 4c hal concentrations after uv h2o2 pre oxidation followed by the chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water increased to 129 7 9 3 nm 10 3 0 7 nm and 36 9 1 3 nm respectively while hal concentrations in mh water increased to 169 5 6 2 nm 30 1 1 7 nm and 63 7 4 1 nm respectively since previous studies had demonstrated that don was valid as a major indicator of n dbp formation the variation of don by uv h2o2 should concur with the n dbp variation bond et al 2012 srithep and phattarapattamawong 2017 table s1 presents that the don concentration in uv h2o2 treated zq and mh water decreased by 0 09 mg l and 0 05 mg l to 0 40 mg l and 0 19 mg l in comparison with the effect of uv h2o2 pre oxidation on the formation of c dbps reduced n dbp formation was also observed the han concentration decreases from uv h2o2 pre oxidation ranged from 102 9 to 185 1 nm figs 3d and 4d accounting for more than 70 of the han concentrations in the water sample without uv h2o2 pre oxidation srithep and phattarapattamawong 2017 also observed that uv h2o2 pre oxidation could effectively remove han precursors hnms from chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water decreased by 80 6 75 7 and 77 8 respectively to 4 0 0 2 nm 4 1 0 3 nm and 4 3 0 3 nm fig 3e while the concentrations of hnms from mh water decreased by 84 3 80 5 and 72 9 respectively to 2 3 0 1 nm 4 7 0 3 nm and 7 3 0 2 nm fig 4e uv h2o2 treatment effectively reduced ham formation after the subsequent chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water to values generally lower than 10 nm figs 3f and 4f water matrix factors including nom anthropogenic contaminants and inorganic ions can compete with bromide for the hydroxyl radicals generated from h2o2 activation with uv irradiation miklos et al 2018 the reaction of bromide with hydroxyl radicals kapp 1 6 3 5 109 m 1s 1 can form hypobromous acid hobr which can be furtherly oxidized to bromate miklos et al 2018 moreover h2o2 can also reduce hobr to bromide with a high second order rate constant of 7 6 108 m 1s 1 inhibiting bromate formation and the reaction of reactive bromine with organic compounds chu et al 2014 miklos et al 2018 owing to the low bromide concentration and the reduction of hobr by h2o2 bromate was not detected in uv h2o2 treated samples limit of detection 20 μg l this phenomenon was consistent with previous study indicating that bromate formation is negligible in most hydroxyl radical dominated systems von gunten and oliveras 1998 miklos et al 2018 it should also be noted that the undetected bromate may also be attributed to the higher limit of detection for bromate 20 μg l in this study than that of guidelines 10 μg l regulated by china us epa and etc uv h2o2 advanced oxidation treatment led to decreased bsfs of thms and dhaas for zq water fig s3 whereas the increased bsfs for thms and haas were observed in mh water fig s4 these opposing results in zq water and mh water were attributed to different water characteristics previous studies demonstrated that incorporation of bromine into the hydrophilic nom fraction was easier to achieve than it was for the hydrophobic nom fraction liang and singer 2003 molnar et al 2014 as a consequence mh water with uv h2o2 treatment presented higher bsfs of thms and dhaas fig s4 for zq water the loss of bromide resulted in decreased bsfs of thms and dhaas brominated hals were not observed in disinfected zq water with uv h2o2 pre oxidation for which the hal bsfs for zq water were zero fig s3 fig s4 illustrates that uv h2o2 pre oxidation decreased hal bsfs during the chlorination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination of mh water by 0 5 and 23 1 respectively owing to the removal of bromide by uv h2o2 from zq water brominated hnms and hams were not detected and the han bsfs decreased implying that bromine incorporation into their precursors was relatively difficult it was also found that the bsfs of hans hnms and hams for mh water all decreased even though bromide decrease by uv h2o2 can be neglected the bsf decreases for hans hnms and hams may be ascribed to the concept that bromine incorporation into thm and haa precursors dominated 3 4 effect of uv h2o2 pre oxidation on the formation of aggregated cx3r type dbps and the variation of dbp associated toxicities as shown in fig 5 uv h2o2 treatment increased c dbp formation whereas decreased n dbp formation uv h2o2 treatment increased aggregated dbp concentrations by 13 1 and 24 5 to 904 4 nm and 1272 6 nm during sds chlorination of zq water and mh water fig 5a and 5b whereas the abatement of aggregated dbp concentration were observed during both in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that thms and haas accounted for more than 65 of total cx3r type dbps and uv h2o2 treatment effectively increased thm and haa formation during chlorination comparing this with the effect of uv h2o2 treatment on the removal of the aggregated dbp by three disinfection schemes the highest removal of dbp concentration was observed from in situ chloramination of zq water and mh water 57 5 and 41 6 respectively moreover uv h2o2 pre oxidation coupled with in situ chloramination also produced the least aggregated cx3r type dbp concentrations 166 5 and 217 7 nm for zq water and mh water respectively fig 5c and 5d show that uv h2o2 pre oxidation significantly altered the cx3r type dbp fractions particularly in the in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination processes the proportions of c dbps i e thms haas and hals increased to 64 6 and 80 4 during in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water while they rose to 80 9 and 87 5 in mh water uv h2o2 treatment effectively reduced cx3r type dbp formation after in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination concurring with the removal of dbp associated calculated toxicity fig 5e and 5f these decreases were driven by decreases in han and hal formation as they were the dominant contributors to the calculated toxicity chuang and mitch 2017 the percentage contributions of thms haas hnms and hams to total dbp associated toxicity with uv h2o2 pre oxidation were much lower than for hans and hals fig 5g and 5h as was shown the reduction of han associated toxicity resulting from uv h2o2 treatment occurred in all samples similar to the removal of dbps the highest removal of calculated toxicity was observed by the in situ chloramination of zq water and mh water 72 4 and 82 7 respectively this was put down to the fact that han precursors were removed by uv h2o2 and the optimisation of disinfection scenario reduced hal formation overall both the aggregate cx3r type dbp concentration and dbp associated toxicity were effectively mitigated by uv h2o2 combined with in situ chloramination treatment 4 conclusions this study investigated the effects of uv h2o2 pre oxidation combined with the optimisation of disinfection scenario on the control of cx3r type dbps although in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination were able to effectively decrease cx3r type dbp formation by 51 1 63 5 compared with chlorination dbp associated toxicity decreased insignificantly due to the increases of n dbps the dominant contributors to calculated toxicity were hans and hals during chlorination while the percentage contributions of hans to total dbp associated toxicity were over approximately 75 during in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination uv h2o2 pre oxidation was able to destroy nom aromatic and don components concurring with the increased thms and haas and the decreased n dbps uv h2o2 pre oxidation decreased bsfs of hals and hans implying the reduction of brominated hal and han ratios chlorination of uv h2o2 treated water produced more aggregated cx3r type dbps than water without uv h2o2 treatment whereas uv h2o2 treatment decreased cx3r type dbp formation during both in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination uv h2o2 pre oxidation significantly decreased the dbp associated toxicity in all samples both the highest removal of dbp concentration and the highest abatement of dbp associated toxicity were achieved by uv h2o2 treatment combined with in situ chloramination this study showed that the combination of uv h2o2 treatment to degrade chlorine reactive and chloramines reactive precursors of n dbps with in situ chloramination to mitigate the formation of c dbps during disinfection could comprehensively control the six named classes of cx3r type dbps

18441,the effects of uv h2o2 pre oxidation or disinfection methods on the formation of partial disinfection by products dbps have been studied previously this study assessed the effect of uv h2o2 pre oxidation combined with optimisation of the disinfection method on the formation of six classes of cx3r type dbps including trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetaldehydes hals haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms and haloacetamides hams experimental results showed that a simulated distribution system sds in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination effectively decreased total cx3r type dbp formation by 51 1 63 5 compared to sds chlorination but little reduction in dbp associated toxicity was observed the dominant contributors to the calculated toxicity were hans and hals uv h2o2 pre oxidation was able to destroy the aromatic and dissolved organic nitrogen components of natural organic matter as a consequence thm haa and hal formations increased by 49 5 55 0 47 8 61 9 and 42 0 67 1 respectively whereas han hnm and ham formations significantly decreased by 52 1 83 6 42 9 87 3 and 74 1 100 0 uv h2o2 pre oxidation increased total cx3r type dbp formation during sds chlorination whereas sds in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of uv h2o2 treated water produced lower total cx3r type dbps than water without uv h2o2 pre oxidation nevertheless the dbp associated toxicity of water with uv h2o2 pre oxidation was substantially lower than the toxicity for water without uv h2o2 pre oxidation decreased by 24 1 82 7 hals followed by hans contribute to major toxic potencies in uv h2o2 treated water the best dbp concentration and dbp associated toxicity abatement results were achieved for water treated by uv h2o2 coupled with in situ chloramination treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords cx3r type disinfection by products uv h2o2 disinfectant addition method predicted toxicity

it also may lead to an unintended consequence formation of drinking water disinfection by products dbps sedlak and von gunten 2011 as an example chlorine and chloramine two widely used low cost disinfectants can react with natural organic matter nom and or inorganic matter in source water to form a range of dbps richardson et al 2007 considerable attention has been given to identify emerging dbps produced by different disinfection scenarios in recent years yang and zhang 2014 gong and zhang 2015 and many studies examining the halogenated dbps formed from chlorinated or chloraminated drinking water also focused on trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetaldehydes hals haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms and haloacetamides hams due to their greater toxicity and or higher concentration levels richardson et al 2007 bond et al 2011 shah and mitch 2012 these six dbp types thms haas hals hans hnms and hams have a simple and similar cx3r molecular structure fig sm1 and so have been termed cx3r type dbps generally carbonaceous dbps c dbps such as thms and haas which are the first and second largest dbp class by weight have been well studied and are regulated in many countries with maximum concentration limits proscribed krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2007 however there is rising interest in a range of unregulated nitrogenous dbps n dbps including hans hnms and hams shah and mitch 2012 because they exhibit several orders of magnitude higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than the regulated thms and haas and have been frequently detected at the μg l level in many chlorinated chloraminated drinking waters which feature high dissolved organic nitrogen don bond et al 2011 plewa and wagner 2015 wagner and plewa 2017 hals as an important unregulated c dbp class as well are the third largest dbp class by weight krasner et al 2006 jeong et al 2015 a recent toxicity study found that hals exhibited higher cytotoxicity cytotoxicity index value 144 than either hans cytotoxicity index value 16 0 or hnms cytotoxicity index value 75 0 although lower than hams cytotoxicity index value 302 jeong et al 2015 removal of dbp precursors before disinfection is an effective strategy for dbp control our previous studies found that ultraviolet activated hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 pre oxidation effectively reduced formation of three chlorinated n dbps dichloroacetonitrile trichloronitromethane and dichloroacetamide during the subsequent chlorination of high don waters chu et al 2014 while still achieving simultaneous destruction of pharmaceuticals and personal care products yuan et al 2009 chu et al 2016b one previous study has confirmed that uv h2o2 treatment can substantially degrade chlorine reactive and chloramines reactive dissolved organic nitrogen matters which serve as dominant precursors of nas and decrease na formation by around 50 100 during subsequent chlorination or chloramination chuang et al 2019 moreover previous study indicated a lower contribution of nas to dbp associated toxicity from cx3r type dbps due to the lower lc50 values and concentration ng l level of nas chuang and mitch 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 furthermore previous study also demonstrated that mutagenic by product formation from low pressure uv irradiation with and without h2o2 can be neglected hofman caris et al 2015 however previous studies have also reported that uv h2o2 treatment increased formation of regulated c dbps thms and haas during subsequent chlorination dotson et al 2010 metz et al 2011 in particular non selectivity of the hydroxyl radicals produced in a uv h2o2 system enabled it to transform the dissolved organic matter dom structure from higher molecular weight mw to lower mw which increased the reactivity of dom with chlorine to form more thms and haas sarathy and mohseni 2007 bazri et al 2012 therefore it is quite difficult to simultaneously control cx3r type dbps using uv h2o2 pre oxidation treatment alone each class of cx3r type dbps with specific r functional groups exhibited different formation characteristics during chlorination chloramination the differences of dbp formation under different disinfection scenarios were ascribed to the reactivity of chlorine or chloramines toward nom and dbps joo and mitch 2007 deborde and von gunten 2008 yu and reckhow 2015 ding et al 2018c generally chlorination favoured c dbp thm and haa formation rather than n dbp han and ham formation while chloramination promoted the generation of n dbps hans and hams bond et al 2012 shah and mitch 2012 the former phenomenon was attributed to the higher reactivity of chlorine with nom than that of chloramines while the latter phenomenon was attributed to the degradation of n dbps by chlorine rather than chloramines glezer et al 1999 zhang and minear 2002 koudjonou and lebel 2006 yang et al 2007 chu et al 2012 ding et al 2018c moreover it has been shown that the disinfectant addition sequence i e the addition sequence of chlorine and ammonia during chloramination could also alter the fractions of cx3r type dbps produced hayes larson and mitch 2010 huang et al 2017 it has been reported that switching from chloramination to chlorination could decrease thm and haa formation richardson et al 2007 fang et al 2010 and this motivated us to attempt to comprehensively control the six named classes of cx3r type dbps by combining uv h2o2 pre oxidation with an optimised disinfection scenario the objective of this study was therefore to examine the potential of uv h2o2 pre oxidation treatment combined with an optimised disinfection treatment scenario to comprehensively control cx3r type dbps by studying formation of the six cx3r type dbp classes thms haas hals hans hnms and hams in two different types of filtered waters this study is an important contribution to the improved understanding of how cx3r type dbp formation can be more effectively controlled in drinking waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and samples filtered water samples that had not been exposed to any oxidant were collected from the zq and mh drinking water treatment plants which utilized taihu lake and yangtze river water china respectively the water quality characteristics of these filtered water samples are shown in table s1 and detailed information on dbp standards is listed table s2 sodium hypochlorite solution active cl2 5 sigma aldrich st louis usa was diluted to around 4 g l as cl2 and stored in an aluminium foil covered glass bottle at 4 c to prepare a free chlorine stock solution ultrapure water was produced with a millipore milli q gradient water purification system billerica usa all other materials were of at least analytical grade and were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china unless otherwise noted 2 2 experimental procedures batch uv h2o2 experiments were conducted using a collimated beam apparatus consisting of a low pressure mercury lamp above quiescently stirred crystallisation dishes 1 l details of the experimental set up were presented in our previous studies chu et al 2014 2015 based on our previous research results chu et al 2014 small volumes of 30 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were dosed into the water samples to achieve 5 mg l initial concentration and then the samples were immediately irradiated for 30 min to achieve incident irradiation intensities to 585 mj cm2 then the dbp formation potentials fp for the filtered waters without and with uv h2o2 treatment were examined under simulated distribution system sds conditions chuang and mitch 2017 specifically water samples were incubated in headspace free 250 ml brown glass bottles in the dark at 25 0 0 5 c with disinfectants and the total chlorine residuals in the water samples were 1 0 5 mg l as cl2 after 24 h reaction the details of disinfectant demands were added in table s3 after this period the disinfectant residuals were quenched with stoichiometric amounts of ascorbic acid and the water samples were analysed as soon as possible error bars in all the figures represent the relative standard deviation of two duplicates for the initial experiments a range of disinfectant concentrations 5 15 mg l as cl2 were dosed into the filtered and uv h2o2 treated water to investigate the disinfectant demands of 24 h reaction for chlorination experiments predetermined amounts of chlorine solution were added to the water samples for the ammonia then chlorine experiments nh4 cl2 predetermined amounts of ammonium chloride solution were firstly added and then free chlorine was added at the mass ratio of 4 mg l chlorine to 1 mg l ammonia after around 20 s for the chlorine then ammonia experiments cl2 nh4 predetermined amounts of free chlorine solution were added following by the addition of ammonium chloride at the mass ratio of 4 mg l chlorine residual to 1 mg l ammonia after 30 min pre chlorination reaction considering the addition methods of chloramines in drinking water treatment plants and the instability of monochloramine the preformed monochloramine experiment was not conducted in this study hayes

and its potential toxicity a comprehensive applied approach in which the toxicity was assumed to be additive was employed to estimate the contribution of individual dbps to the dbp associated toxicity krasner et al 2016 chuang and mitch 2017 ding et al 2018b values for predicted cytotoxicity were calculated by dividing the measured concentrations by published lc50 values which were the doses required to induce 50 viability of the cells after 72 h exposure as compared to the concurrent negative control for chinese hamster ovary cells and these values have been presented in table s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of different disinfection scenarios on cx3r type dbp formation fig 1 presents the formation of cx3r type dbps under sds conditions with different disinfection scenarios when water samples were treated by sds chlorination 13 and 18 of the 24 halogenated dbps were detected in zq and mh water respectively the number of dbp species in the mh water was also higher than for zq water under the in situ chloramination or chlorination followed by chloramination processes these phenomena could be explained by the fact that zq water produced less brominated dbps due to its lower bromide concentration table s1 brominated hals hans hnms and hams were not detected in zq water the number of measured dbp species from chlorination in situ chloramination or chlorination followed by chloramination treatment were close four regulated thms 337 8 22 6 nm and 505 3 8 1 nm respectively and four regulated haas 202 8 15 4 nm and 239 6 5 8 nm respectively from the sds chlorination of zq and mh water accounted for the majority of cx3r type dbps by molar weight although the doc concentration for zq water was higher than it was for mh water the sums of the thm and haa concentrations from the chlorination of mh water were higher due to the higher suva254 table s1 a previous study has shown that compounds with higher absorbance at 254 nm formed thms and haas with higher yields gallard and von gunten 2002 the molar concentrations of hans 141 6 12 8 nm and 129 2 3 1 nm for zq and mh water respectively were relatively higher than the concentrations of hals 77 5 1 5 nm and 121 8 7 4 nm for zq and mh water respectively during sds chlorination chlorination of zq and mh water produced less hnms 20 6 1 4 nm and 14 7 1 1 nm respectively and hams 19 3 0 9 nm and 11 7 1 0 nm respectively when ammonia was added 20 s prior to free chlorine the concentrations of thms haas and hals significantly decreased the differences of dbp formation under different disinfection scenarios were ascribed to the reactivity of chlorine or chloramines toward nom and dbps compared to the chlorination process thm haa and hal concentrations from zq water decreased by 88 6 87 5 and 86 8 to 38 5 0 5 nm 25 4 2 3 nm and 10 2 0 6 nm respectively while the concentrations of thms haas and hals from mh water decreased by 87 8 84 3 and 87 5 to 61 5 3 5 nm 37 5 3 5 nm and 15 2 0 8 nm respectively the decreased c dbps were ascribed to the reaction of ammonia with free chlorine kapp 1 3 1 8 104 m 1s 1 competing with the reaction of chlorine with nom deborde and von gunten 2008 chloramines yielded from the reaction of chlorine with ammonia were the dominant reactive chlorine species due to the high ammonia concentration previous studies had indicated that the reactivity of chloramines with nom was much less than that of chlorine deborde and von gunten 2008 ding et al 2018b in contrast to c dbps hans and hams from the in situ chloramination of zq water increased by 64 1 and 252 3 to 232 4 16 8 nm and 68 0 2 0 nm respectively while the concentrations of hans and hams from mh water increased by 45 9 and 294 8 to 188 5 7 4 nm and 46 2 3 5 nm respectively the increased hans and hams were attributed to the high instability of hans and hams in the presence of chlorine yu and reckhow 2015 ding et al 2018c in the in situ chloramination process free chlorine was primarily converted into chloramines which cannot lead to degradation of hans and hams yu and reckhow 2015 ding et al 2018c compared to the discussion above variations of hnms from zq water and mh water were the opposite compared to chlorination the formation of hnms during the in situ chloramination of zq water decreased by 18 9 to 16 7 0 5 nm whereas the concentration of hnms from mh water increased by 62 6 to 23 9 2 0 nm this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that hnm concentration depends on the formation and degradation of hnms during reaction the hnm formation pathway mainly involved oxidation of nitrogen in amine precursors to form nitro groups followed by halogenation of α carbon shah and mitch 2012 therefore chlorine favours the formation of nitro groups and halogenation due to its higher oxidizing ability compared to chloramines however chlorine also leads to the faster degradation of hnms than chloramines do joo and mitch 2007 taken together the different hnm variation trends for zq water and mh water under chlorination and in situ chloramination may be attributed to different water characteristics when zq water and mh water were treated by pre chlorination followed by chloramination thm haa and hal concentrations were all slightly higher than with in situ chloramination but much less than those achieved by chlorination thm haa and hal concentrations from zq water were 72 7 5 7 nm 48 8 1 5 nm and 40 5 7 1 nm respectively while the figures for mh water were 146 3 3 6 nm 53 4 2 2 nm and 33 5 2 7 nm respectively and these increased c dbp concentrations were attributed to the 30 min pre chlorination abatement of hans and hams was observed during pre chlorination followed by chloramination compared to in situ chloramination this may be ascribed to the fact that chlorine reacts with nitrile and amide groups in precursors during pre chlorination which converts han and ham precursors into non precursors yu and reckhow 2015 ding et al 2018c even so han and ham concentrations generated from pre chlorination followed by chloramination were still higher than the concentrations achieved with the chlorination process this indicated that the degradation of hans and hams by chlorine was the primary reason for their decreases as discussed previously chlorination favours formation of nitro groups and halogenation of alkyl groups compared to chloramination shah and mitch 2012 when water samples were treated by pre chlorination 30 min the hnm concentrations from the zq and mh waters increased by 16 2 and 13 0 to 19 4 0 3 nm and 27 0 2 6 nm respectively compared with in situ chloramination the competitive reactions of chlorine with ammonia kapp 1 3 1 8 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 chlorine with bromide kapp 1 2 5 3 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 bromine with ammonia kapp 4 1 105 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 monochloramine with bromide kapp 2 5 3 1 10 1 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 reactive chlorine chlorine and chloramines with nom reactive bromine bromine bromamines and bromochloramine with nom and reactive halogen chlorine chloramines bromine and bromochloramine with cx3r type dbps will impact the bsf joo and mitch 2007 deborde and von gunten 2008 heeb et al 2014 ding et al 2018c fig sm2 shows the bsfs of cx3r type dbps under chlorination in situ chloramination and chlorination followed by chloramination bsfs for thms dhaas and dhals all increased in the following order nh4 cl2 process cl2 process cl2 nh4 process previous studies have reported that thms haas and hals were relatively less reactive with chlorine and chloramines than hans hnms or hams zhang and minear 2002 ma et al 2016 ding et al 2018c during in situ chloramination processes free chlorine preferably reacts with ammonia rather than bromide due to the higher reaction rates of free chlorine with ammonia and higher concentration of ammonia therefore monochloramine was the dominant chlorine species the slower oxidation rate of bromide by monochloramine resulted in lower reactive bromine concentrations which further lead to the lower bsfs of thms haas and hals than those achieved by chlorination fig sm2 however the bsfs of thms haas and hals achieved during pre chlorination followed by chloramination were relatively higher than those achieved by chlorination alone during the pre chlorination process bromide was converted into bromine within several minutes based on calculation of the kinetic constant and when ammonia was added residual bromine and chlorine reacted with it to generate bromamine and chloramine respectively the reactivity of bromine in bromamine is five to six orders of magnitude higher than chlorine in chloramine whereas bromine reactions are only up to three orders of magnitude higher than chlorine lei et al 2006 heeb et al 2014 therefore the bsfs of thms haas and hals from pre chlorination followed by chloramination were higher than those achieved by chlorination alone fig sm2 as for hans and hams the bsfs from the in situ chloramination process were higher than those from chlorination but lower than those from the pre chlorination followed by chloramination process the former phenomenon was primarily attributed to the degradation of hans and hams in the presence of chlorine yu and reckhow 2015 ding et al 2018c and the reason for the latter phenomenon was similar to that for c dbps brominated hals were not detected in any samples 3 2 effect of disinfection scenarios on aggregated cx3r type dbp formation and variations in dbp associated toxicity compared with the chlorination process the aggregated cx3r type dbps from in situ chloramination and from pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water decreased by 51 1 and 52 0 to 391 2 24 2 nm and 384 1 17 9 nm fig 2 a while the aggregated cx3r type dbps from mh water decreased by 63 5 and 55 5 to 372 8 20 8 nm and 455 2 19 6 nm respectively fig 2b these results showed that chlorination favoured formation of aggregated cx3r type dbps which was consistent with findings from previous studies bond et al 2014 ding et al 2018b although organic halogen in regulated thms and haas only accounted for 20 or even less of the total organic halogen they may serve as a surrogate for the formation potential of other unregulated dbps and total dbp associated toxicity krasner et al 2006 thms and haas constituted 42 2 and 25 3 respectively of the total cx3r type dbps derived from the chlorination of zq water while the percentages of thms and haas to the total cx3r type dbp concentration from the chlorination of mh water were 49 4 and 23 4 respectively hals and hans both accounted for 10 of the total cx3r type dbps produced by chlorination the ratios of hnms and hams to total cx3r type dbp concentrations were generally 3 when the chlorination process was substituted by either the in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination processes the percentage contributions from each cx3r type dbp class to the total cx3r type dbps by molar weight significantly varied the sum of the thms plus the haas constituted 40 of the cx3r type dbps in contrast to thms and haas the percentage of n dbps particularly for hans significantly increased hans accounted for 40 of the cx3r type dbps under the in situ chloramination and the pre chlorination followed by chloramination processes since the percentages of the individual dbp classes and the concentrations of aggregate cx3r type dbps were altered under the different disinfection process the percentage contributions of individual dbp classes to the total dbp associated toxicity and the dbp associated toxicity itself changed it should be acknowledged that the reduction of dbp associated toxicity is more important than the abatement of dbp concentration as shown in fig 2e and 2f the lowest calculated dbp associated toxicities from zq water and mh water 0 004 and 0 01 respectively were observed from application of the in situ chloramination process although the total cx3r type dbp concentration produced from the in situ chloramination and the pre chlorination followed by chloramination processes were substantially less than that produced by the chlorination process the differences of the calculated dbp associated toxicity were insignificant indicating that disinfection scenario does not play a conclusive role in the reduction of calculated dbp associated toxicity the main drivers of the dbp associated toxicity changed however although thms and haas dominated by molar weight during chlorination they accounted for 2 of the calculated dbp associated toxicity due to their lower toxic potency wagner and plewa 2017 in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination treatment further decreased the percentage contributions of thms and haas to the total dbp associated toxicity for the lower thm and haa concentrations hans and hals accounted 45 2 and 51 5 of the dbp associated toxicity in chlorinated zq water respectively fig 2g and 2h and 36 5 and 61 8 of the dbp associated toxicity of chlorinated mh water fig 2g and 2h similar to the variation of dbp concentration for individual dbp class hans constituted more than approximately 75 of the dbp associated toxicity during in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination followed by hals 5 6 23 1 fig 2g and 2h although hnms and hams were shown to have relatively high toxic potency the percentage contributions of hnms and hams to the total dbp associated toxicity 1 and 2 respectively were much lower than hans and hals for the lower concentrations wagner and plewa 2017 3 3 effect of uv h2o2 pre oxidation on cx3r type dbp formation table s3 shows the effect of uv h2o2 treatment on disinfectant demand in different disinfection scenarios disinfectant demands from uv h2o2 pre oxidation followed by the chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water increased by 52 3 32 0 and 38 0 to 4 51 mg l 2 02 mg l and 2 29 mg l respectively compared to control experiments without uv h2o2 treatment while uv h2o2 pre oxidation increased disinfectant demands by 59 7 18 2 and 19 8 to 6 61 mg l 2 92 mg l and 3 21 mg l respectively from the chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of mh water although uv h2o2 treatment slightly mineralize nom resulting in the decreases of doc hydroxyl radicals formed from the activation of h2o2 with uv irradiation convert larger mw hydrophobic nom into smaller mw hydrophilic nom dotson et al 2010 metz et al 2011 chu et al 2014 the increase of smaller mw nom fractions results in increased disinfectant demands moreover hydroxylation of nom with phenolic like structures also lead to the increases of disinfectant demands dotson et al 2010 furthermore the residual small amount of h2o2 in sample may also increase the disinfectant demands the results in this study are also consistent with previous researches by others dotson et al 2010 metz et al 2011 table s1 also shows that uv h2o2 advanced oxidation treatment improved the removal rate of uv absorbance at 254 nm and suva254 when water samples were treated by uv h2o2 zq water and mh water suva254 values decreased from 1 7 l mg m and 3 4 l mg m to 1 5 l mg m and 2 7 l mg m respectively indicating that there was clearer aromaticity reduction moreover the bromide concentration variation in uv h2o2 treated mh water could be neglected table s1 whereas the bromide concentration in uv h2o2 treated zq water decreased by 8 μg l to 13 μg l fig 3 and fig 4 show the effects of uv h2o2 pre oxidation on the formation of cx3r type dbps during chlorination in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq and mh water respectively uv h2o2 treatment increased thm and haa concentrations upon chlorination in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination in both zq water and mh water thms from uv h2o2 pre oxidation followed by the chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water increased by 55 0 47 8 and 67 1 to 523 6 47 4 nm 64 0 μg l 57 0 5 4 nm 6 8 μg l and 121 5 4 8 nm 14 5 μg l fig 3a respectively compared to control experiments without uv h2o2 treatment while uv h2o2 pre oxidation increased thm formation by 49 5 61 9 and 42 0 to 755 6 49 4 nm 104 8 μg l 99 5 0 7 nm 13 9 μg l and 207 7 6 2 nm 26 9 μg l fig 4a respectively from the chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of mh water haa concentrations from the chlorination in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water increased to 213 3 2 7 nm 27 5 μg l 40 3 0 3 nm 5 2 μg l and 61 3 2 4 nm 7 9 μg l fig 3b respectively while chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of uv h2o2 treated mh water produced 318 8 19 7 nm 46 7 μg l 46 6 1 9 nm 6 7 μg l and 72 1 3 9 nm 10 1 μg l haas fig 4b respectively this phenomenon is in accordance with previous studies and can be explained by the fact that hydroxyl radicals convert larger mw hydrophobic nom into smaller mw hydrophilic nom dotson et al 2010 metz et al 2011 chu et al 2014 the increase of smaller mw nom fractions resulted in increased disinfectant demands which favoured formation of thms and haas dotson et al 2010 metz et al 2011 as shown in figs 3c and 4c hal concentrations after uv h2o2 pre oxidation followed by the chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water increased to 129 7 9 3 nm 10 3 0 7 nm and 36 9 1 3 nm respectively while hal concentrations in mh water increased to 169 5 6 2 nm 30 1 1 7 nm and 63 7 4 1 nm respectively since previous studies had demonstrated that don was valid as a major indicator of n dbp formation the variation of don by uv h2o2 should concur with the n dbp variation bond et al 2012 srithep and phattarapattamawong 2017 table s1 presents that the don concentration in uv h2o2 treated zq and mh water decreased by 0 09 mg l and 0 05 mg l to 0 40 mg l and 0 19 mg l in comparison with the effect of uv h2o2 pre oxidation on the formation of c dbps reduced n dbp formation was also observed the han concentration decreases from uv h2o2 pre oxidation ranged from 102 9 to 185 1 nm figs 3d and 4d accounting for more than 70 of the han concentrations in the water sample without uv h2o2 pre oxidation srithep and phattarapattamawong 2017 also observed that uv h2o2 pre oxidation could effectively remove han precursors hnms from chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water decreased by 80 6 75 7 and 77 8 respectively to 4 0 0 2 nm 4 1 0 3 nm and 4 3 0 3 nm fig 3e while the concentrations of hnms from mh water decreased by 84 3 80 5 and 72 9 respectively to 2 3 0 1 nm 4 7 0 3 nm and 7 3 0 2 nm fig 4e uv h2o2 treatment effectively reduced ham formation after the subsequent chlorination in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water to values generally lower than 10 nm figs 3f and 4f water matrix factors including nom anthropogenic contaminants and inorganic ions can compete with bromide for the hydroxyl radicals generated from h2o2 activation with uv irradiation miklos et al 2018 the reaction of bromide with hydroxyl radicals kapp 1 6 3 5 109 m 1s 1 can form hypobromous acid hobr which can be furtherly oxidized to bromate miklos et al 2018 moreover h2o2 can also reduce hobr to bromide with a high second order rate constant of 7 6 108 m 1s 1 inhibiting bromate formation and the reaction of reactive bromine with organic compounds chu et al 2014 miklos et al 2018 owing to the low bromide concentration and the reduction of hobr by h2o2 bromate was not detected in uv h2o2 treated samples limit of detection 20 μg l this phenomenon was consistent with previous study indicating that bromate formation is negligible in most hydroxyl radical dominated systems von gunten and oliveras 1998 miklos et al 2018 it should also be noted that the undetected bromate may also be attributed to the higher limit of detection for bromate 20 μg l in this study than that of guidelines 10 μg l regulated by china us epa and etc uv h2o2 advanced oxidation treatment led to decreased bsfs of thms and dhaas for zq water fig s3 whereas the increased bsfs for thms and haas were observed in mh water fig s4 these opposing results in zq water and mh water were attributed to different water characteristics previous studies demonstrated that incorporation of bromine into the hydrophilic nom fraction was easier to achieve than it was for the hydrophobic nom fraction liang and singer 2003 molnar et al 2014 as a consequence mh water with uv h2o2 treatment presented higher bsfs of thms and dhaas fig s4 for zq water the loss of bromide resulted in decreased bsfs of thms and dhaas brominated hals were not observed in disinfected zq water with uv h2o2 pre oxidation for which the hal bsfs for zq water were zero fig s3 fig s4 illustrates that uv h2o2 pre oxidation decreased hal bsfs during the chlorination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination of mh water by 0 5 and 23 1 respectively owing to the removal of bromide by uv h2o2 from zq water brominated hnms and hams were not detected and the han bsfs decreased implying that bromine incorporation into their precursors was relatively difficult it was also found that the bsfs of hans hnms and hams for mh water all decreased even though bromide decrease by uv h2o2 can be neglected the bsf decreases for hans hnms and hams may be ascribed to the concept that bromine incorporation into thm and haa precursors dominated 3 4 effect of uv h2o2 pre oxidation on the formation of aggregated cx3r type dbps and the variation of dbp associated toxicities as shown in fig 5 uv h2o2 treatment increased c dbp formation whereas decreased n dbp formation uv h2o2 treatment increased aggregated dbp concentrations by 13 1 and 24 5 to 904 4 nm and 1272 6 nm during sds chlorination of zq water and mh water fig 5a and 5b whereas the abatement of aggregated dbp concentration were observed during both in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination this phenomenon could be explained by the fact that thms and haas accounted for more than 65 of total cx3r type dbps and uv h2o2 treatment effectively increased thm and haa formation during chlorination comparing this with the effect of uv h2o2 treatment on the removal of the aggregated dbp by three disinfection schemes the highest removal of dbp concentration was observed from in situ chloramination of zq water and mh water 57 5 and 41 6 respectively moreover uv h2o2 pre oxidation coupled with in situ chloramination also produced the least aggregated cx3r type dbp concentrations 166 5 and 217 7 nm for zq water and mh water respectively fig 5c and 5d show that uv h2o2 pre oxidation significantly altered the cx3r type dbp fractions particularly in the in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination processes the proportions of c dbps i e thms haas and hals increased to 64 6 and 80 4 during in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination of zq water while they rose to 80 9 and 87 5 in mh water uv h2o2 treatment effectively reduced cx3r type dbp formation after in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination concurring with the removal of dbp associated calculated toxicity fig 5e and 5f these decreases were driven by decreases in han and hal formation as they were the dominant contributors to the calculated toxicity chuang and mitch 2017 the percentage contributions of thms haas hnms and hams to total dbp associated toxicity with uv h2o2 pre oxidation were much lower than for hans and hals fig 5g and 5h as was shown the reduction of han associated toxicity resulting from uv h2o2 treatment occurred in all samples similar to the removal of dbps the highest removal of calculated toxicity was observed by the in situ chloramination of zq water and mh water 72 4 and 82 7 respectively this was put down to the fact that han precursors were removed by uv h2o2 and the optimisation of disinfection scenario reduced hal formation overall both the aggregate cx3r type dbp concentration and dbp associated toxicity were effectively mitigated by uv h2o2 combined with in situ chloramination treatment 4 conclusions this study investigated the effects of uv h2o2 pre oxidation combined with the optimisation of disinfection scenario on the control of cx3r type dbps although in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination were able to effectively decrease cx3r type dbp formation by 51 1 63 5 compared with chlorination dbp associated toxicity decreased insignificantly due to the increases of n dbps the dominant contributors to calculated toxicity were hans and hals during chlorination while the percentage contributions of hans to total dbp associated toxicity were over approximately 75 during in situ chloramination or pre chlorination followed by chloramination uv h2o2 pre oxidation was able to destroy nom aromatic and don components concurring with the increased thms and haas and the decreased n dbps uv h2o2 pre oxidation decreased bsfs of hals and hans implying the reduction of brominated hal and han ratios chlorination of uv h2o2 treated water produced more aggregated cx3r type dbps than water without uv h2o2 treatment whereas uv h2o2 treatment decreased cx3r type dbp formation during both in situ chloramination and pre chlorination followed by chloramination uv h2o2 pre oxidation significantly decreased the dbp associated toxicity in all samples both the highest removal of dbp concentration and the highest abatement of dbp associated toxicity were achieved by uv h2o2 treatment combined with in situ chloramination this study showed that the combination of uv h2o2 treatment to degrade chlorine reactive and chloramines reactive precursors of n dbps with in situ chloramination to mitigate the formation of c dbps during disinfection could comprehensively control the six named classes of cx3r type dbps

18442,development of sustainable and resilient water infrastructure is an urgent challenge for urban areas to secure long term water availability and mitigate negative impacts of water consumption and urban development a hybrid system that combines centralized water infrastructure and household decentralized water facilities including rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling may be a solution to more sustainable and resilient water management in urban areas understanding household and community preferences for decentralized water facilities is important to inform the design and ultimately the promotion and adoption of such systems in this study we conducted a discrete choice experiment via amazon mechanical turk to collect data on household choices of different decentralized water facility designs in two u s cities atlanta georgia and boston massachusetts based on the responses to the choice experiment we then developed a latent class choice model to predict households preferences of decentralized system design features and examine the influence of socioeconomic and personal characteristics on heterogeneous class membership we identified six major classes of preferences in atlanta and boston respectively and evaluated how readily each class is likely to choose a decentralized water facility atlanta and boston have some classes sharing similar preferences for decentralized water systems but the socioeconomic and personal characteristics of these classes in the two cities are different we found that the early adoption of decentralized water facilities is positively related to neighbors adoptions and pressure of water scarcity increases households willingness to share a decentralized facility the visualization of spatial distribution of the classes highlighted early demand of decentralized water facilities is likely to emerge in low property value communities which creates a unique opportunity for introducing decentralized water facilities during water infrastructure renovations our study provides a framework through citizen engagement to understand social demand and to inform the promotion of decentralized water facilities graphical abstract image 1 keywords discrete choice experiment latent class choice modeling decentralization urban water infrastructure rainwater harvesting grey water recycling 1 introduction water is essential to human wellbeing and prosperity during the last decade water scarcity and water shortage has become more prominent especially in cities with rapid population growth and economic development which underscores the importance of sustainable water management hunt and watkiss 2011 centralized treatment systems are traditionally the dominant form of urban water infrastructure water is often withdrawn from remote areas treated and distributed to the end users through a vast pipeline network similarly domestic wastewater is collected through a sewer network and treated in a centralized facility before discharge while the centralized water and wastewater infrastructure systems are efficient in delivering clean drinking water and treating pollutants in wastewater they often require a large amount of energy for both construction and operation mcdonald et al 2011 minne et al 2012 muñoz et al 2010 srinivasan et al 2013 venkatesh and brattebo 2011 the dependence of water infrastructure on energy exacerbates the depletion of both resources and increases the vulnerability of water systems to energy system failures khalkhali et al 2018 mo et al 2014 stang et al 2018 furthermore much of the u s water infrastructure is aged and approaching the end of its useful life an estimated 240 000 water main breaks happen per year in the u s with an expected cascading replacement cost of more than 1 trillion over the coming decades awwa 2011 grigg 2015 similarly energy infrastructure is experiencing an increasing number of failures and power interruptions due to extreme weather events and limited maintenance miara et al 2017 centralized supply networks are especially vulnerable to these system failures and interruptions as they lack diversity in source of supply and system scale hence improving the resilience of water infrastructure while maintaining high level of water resource availability is a priority as cities plan to renovate aged water infrastructure integrated water management which includes efficiency improvement utilization of alternative water resources and development of hybrid infrastructure systems has been increasingly recognized as a key to water sustainability in cities brown et al 2009 it was found that residents are willing to pay more for decreased water supply interruptions and improved water quality wang et al 2018 rainwater harvesting rwh is one of the integrated water management approaches that has been promoted in many cities to not only address stormwater runoff issues but also to provide alternative water sources for domestic uses greywater recycling gwr is another solution to supplement water supply and reduce the treatment loading placed on wastewater treatment facilities by combining rwh and or gwr with centralized water infrastructure a hybrid system is created that can be more cost effective energy efficient and resilient than upgrading centralized water infrastructure to the same service level jeanne et al 2018 lu et al 2013 makropoulos and butler 2010 unlike centralized water infrastructure which is usually invested in by public sectors and operated by utility companies decentralized rwh and gwr systems are usually invested in by property owners either owned individually or shared with neighbors hence the emergence of hybrid systems relies on accelerated adoption of decentralized water facilities incentivizing adoption requires a better understanding of how citizens make choices among different types of water systems as well as the underlying drivers for such choices jacobs et al 2016 mo et al 2018 pearson et al 2010 such an understanding can inform where the demand of rwh and gwr systems is high and adoption is likely to occur early in cities lu et al 2017 current research on rwh mainly focuses on characterizing the way it influences hydrologic processes and the quality of collected rain sazakli et al 2007 gwr is less common than rwh in application and current research primarily focuses on the technological design of gwr systems li et al 2009 however the preference and demand for rwh and gwr is less understood to support the planning and promotion of hybrid infrastructure systems past analysis in the city of champaign urbana illinois indicates that citizens value the benefits of improved water quality and aquatic environment londoño cadavid and ando 2013 in this study we evaluated a set of design features table 1 to understand how they affect the decision of choosing rwh or gwr to support holistic planning decisions and policy development we chose the random utility theory as our theoretical basis to conduct a discrete choice experiment and develop a statistical model of people s choice of rwh or gwr the utility is a hypothetical value as a sum of observable features of the choices and an unobserved random component for comparison the mixed logit model is one common generalized approach to derive and estimate a choice model based on the random utility theory hoyos 2010 the latent class choice model is one particular form of the mixed logit model which divides respondents into latent classes and produces class specific choice models for measuring preference heterogeneity boxall and adamowicz 2002 many researches have suggested that people have distinctive flavors regarding services and products liao et al 2014 lu et al 2015 yao et al 2019 we hypothesize that preference heterogeneity exists among citizens for the choice of rwh or gwr so that the knowledge of early demand and the location of such demand is critical to initialize the promotion past studies often focused on one region and convergence studies are rare that can generalize the impacts of socioeconomic and personal characteristics on preference heterogeneity across cities and regions for the first time we compared the impact of socioeconomic and personal characteristics on preference heterogeneity in choosing decentralized water systems between two u s cities metro atlanta georgia and greater boston massachusetts we hypothesize that residents in the two cities may share similar preferences for decentralized water systems but they can have different socioeconomic and personal characteristics hence such preferences have to be studied on a case by case basis this hypothesis highlights the need for an integrated framework to understand local demand for decentralized rwh and gwr systems our study started with a discrete choice experiment that solicited citizens choices of decentralized water systems under different design scenarios amazon mechanical turk a widely used crowdsourcing platform was used as a venue to engage citizens buhrmester et al 2011 using responses from mechanical turk we developed a latent class choice model that quantifies the heterogeneity of preferences for decentralized water systems within and across two testbed areas we evaluated the usefulness of mechanical turk in citizen engagement we compared the identified latent classes in the two urban areas and discussed how early each class is likely to adopt decentralized water systems we further visualized and analyzed the spatial distributions of latent classes across the two areas which can inform the spatial characteristics of potential adoptions this study presents an integrated framework that utilizes citizen engagement to understand social demand and to inform the planning of more sustainable hybrid water infrastructure designs in cities 2 methods materials 2 1 discrete choice experiment design the discrete choice experiment design was developed in two stages in the first stage we collaboratively developed a choice experiment draft through literature review and conducted a test on mechanical turk which asked for responses to the choice experiment questions and feedback on the overall experimental design while this initial draft was generally considered to be easy to understand an outstanding recommendation was to keep the number of options small in each comparison thus we revised the draft to only include two options in each choice scenario to allow easy differentiation between the options que et al 2017 in the second stage we conducted a second round of data collection to check the statistical significance of different design features impact on people s choices in the final revision we included 6 features that are most influential on people s choices the qualitative definitions of each feature s levels are self evident and the ranges of system costs and savings were collected from decentralized water system vendors and are considered reasonable for both atlanta and boston the finalized discrete choice experiment includes a total of twelve choice scenarios each scenario contains two upgrade options to install a decentralized water supply system each upgrade option is described by six features at different levels features include system type ownership installation cost significance of environmental benefits neighbor s choice and annual net saving from the upgrade table 1 respondents were asked to choose either a preferred option out of the two or neither we used the choice design function in the jmp software sas institute inc 2012 to design the 12 sets of comparisons 24 options used in the discrete choice experiment the software uses d optimal design to minimize the covariance of features so that each feature can be evaluated independently this design allows one level of a feature to be paired with all levels of other features for comparison at least one time across the 24 options the twelve scenarios are available in the supporting information si 2 2 data collection and correction surveys were published on amazon mechanical turk the turk is a crowdsourcing platform that provides a time effective solution for citizen engagement crump et al 2013 we only allowed respondents from metro atlanta and greater boston to complete the surveys through the restriction of registered respondents outside georgia and massachusetts and the screening based on reported zip code and county incomplete responses were excluded for data quality control and each respondent who completed the survey was paid one dollar the surveys were available for four months on the turk and we collected 697 and 602 useful responses from metro atlanta and greater boston respectively our sample sizes exceed the minimum number that can enable a 95 confidence level with 5 margin of error to represent the choices of the five million residents in both cities bellera and hanley 2007 census data were compared with our sample statistics to examine the sample bias which was corrected by reweighting the responses in the analysis 2 3 latent class choice modeling we developed a latent class choice model to characterize heterogeneous preferences for decentralized water systems among different social groups we modeled each individual s choice as a result of system design features and socioeconomic personal variables individuals are classified using socioeconomic and personal variables and each individual has differential preferences on the six design features eq 1 table s1 in the si defines the variables for modeling class membership and choice we selected the latent gold choice 5 0 software that uses the expectation maximization algorithm to develop the latent class choice model vermunt and magidson 2005 the software cannot automatically determine an optimal class number we tested the model for a range of class numbers and each class number with 150 runs to avoid local optimal solutions we chose the run that yields the lowest bayesian information criterion bic to determine the optimal class number for interpretation in general bic performs better than other information criteria to determine the class number nylund et al 2007 1 p y i t m z i x 1 x p x z i p y i t m x where p y it m z i is the probability of an individual i giving response m to choice scenario t y it is the choice of the individual i in the choice scenario t m is the nominal dependent variable of the choice i e option 1 option 2 and neither of them p x z i is the probability of individual i belonging to a certain class x z i represents the socioeconomic and personal characteristics of individual i x is the latent class membership i e latent variable x is the number of classes and p y it m x is the class specific conditional probability of individual i giving response m to choice scenario t eq 2 2 p y i t m x exp u m x t m 1 m exp u m x t where u m x t denotes the utility associated with the alternative m in choice set t of individual i belonging to class x eq 3 3 u m x t β n o a d o p t x d n o a d o p t m j 1 d β j x d j m where d j m is the value of the j th design feature of alternative m in choice set t table 1 column 3 β j x is the class dependent coefficient associated with the j th design feature each level of a categorical feature has one coefficient and the sum of these coefficients is zero for this categorical feature we created a dummy variable d no adopt m to model the option of neither of them the value is zero for the two presented options and one for the neither of them option respectively the equations for the probability of individual i belonging to a certain class x have the same structure of eqs 2 and 3 similar to eq 3 a set of class dependent coefficients are estimated to sum up socioeconomic features and personal characteristics the class membership is further predicted using a similar equation of eq 2 the details of probability functions and the application of expectation maximization to run the estimate can be found in the latent gold choice manual lu et al 2015 vermunt and magidson 2005 2 4 spatial visualization we used a population synthesizer developed by arizona state university to create complete individual household samples that represent the households living in each census block group in the city of atlanta and boston choupani and mamdoohi 2016 the synthesizer uses census summary statistics of socioeconomic variables and public use microdata sample pums to reproduce a complete household sample the sample only contains the part of socioeconomic variables for each household that are available from pums i e age education gender housing type household size household income ownership and race we combined these socioeconomic variables and the average personal characteristic values from the survey to estimate the probability of synthetic households belonging to different classes we visualized class distribution at census block group levels in atlanta and boston 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary of respondents from mechanical turk we first evaluated the sample bias from mechanical turk by comparing the socioeconomic characteristics of our respondents with the averaged demographic data obtained from u s census for metro atlanta and greater boston table s2 most socioeconomic variables have similar distributions between our survey respondents and the census data except age education and household head in our survey responses the group that is older than 60 years old as well as the group that is high school graduate or less are underrepresented we have more respondents considering themselves as household heads than that are in u s census to reduce the sample bias we used the pums data and corrected the weights of individual responses before the latent class choice modeling 3 2 selection of an optimal class number and summary of the model statistics the summary of model statistics is available in table s3 s4 according to the r2 values the latent class choice model explains 48 1 and 45 3 of the variance in the choices of atlanta and boston respondents respectively both the impacts of design features on the choice and the difference of these impacts across classes are statistically significant which can be used to interpret preference heterogeneity in both cities the socioeconomic and personal variables we defined have significant influences on class memberships we consider that our latent class choice models can help examine our hypotheses of preference heterogeneity and differential socioeconomic features of people sharing a similar preference in two cities in atlanta the optimal class number was found to be 10 which has the lowest bic fig 1 however we excluded 4 of the 10 classes because the size of each of the four classes is only less than 3 of the sample size 10 20 responses while we have 12 class specific independent parameters eq 3 and table s3 4 to estimate the small sample size cannot produce reliable estimates for analysis nasserinejad et al 2017 accordingly we analyzed the largest 6 classes in atlanta the optimal class number was 6 in boston the optimal class number verifies our first hypothesis of preference heterogeneity 3 3 latent classes in atlanta we named the six classes based on their stated preferences for decentralized water facility design features in the discrete choice experiment fig 2 shows the levels of choice modeling variables and the conditional probability for each design feature level selection based on the assigned class the conditional probability explains the choice of each class facing different levels of one design feature while holding others the same the six class names are undiscerning adopter rational adopter rational late adopter cost sensitive late rwh adopter cost sensitive saving significant gwr to own and neighbor sharing rwh the undiscerning adopter does not show any significant difference among various levels of design features this class has a high probability to choose a decentralized water system without discriminating between system designs the rational adopter class shows minimal rejection to choosing a decentralized water system and the system can be either gwr or rwh members in this class prefer low cost significant environment benefits high annual saving and the system that most neighbors install the rational late adopter demonstrates a similar preference for system features except that this class has a higher likelihood of not adopting the decentralized water system the cost sensitive late rwh adopter is also likely to not adopt the decentralized water system this class prefers a low cost rwh system if he she considers a decentralized water system the cost sensitive saving significant gwr to own class prefers a low cost self owned gwr system with significant savings the neighbor sharing rwh class shows a strong preference to share rwh with the neighbors especially when most neighbors choose to have one decentralized water system the rational adopter class is the largest class and about 35 1 of the households belong to this class in metro atlanta the rational late adopter is the second largest class and about 20 9 of the households belong to this class in metro atlanta the cost sensitive late rwh adopter class favours a less expensive rwh system and about 15 2 of households belong to this class in metro atlanta the remaining 15 0 9 3 and 4 6 of total households belong to the undiscerning adopter cost sensitive saving significant gwr to own and neighbor sharing rwh classes respectively in general households in metro atlanta prefer a decentralized water system with a low cost a high saving and significant environmental benefits the system can be either rwh or gwr and it can be shared with the community or own privately neighbors installations of such systems will be a plus to encourage the adoption 3 4 latent classes in boston we similarly named the six classes in boston undiscerning adopter cost effective rational late adopter cost sensitive late rwh adopter benefit significant gwr and neighbor sharing cost sensitive and benefit significant gwr fig 3 boston shares some common classes with atlanta including undiscerning adopter rational late adopter and cost sensitive late rwh adopter the other three classes in boston behave differently than those in atlanta the cost effective class in boston prefers a decentralized water system with a lower cost and a higher annual saving while the similar class rational adopter in atlanta prefers more environmental benefits and neighbor s choice in addition to a low cost and a higher annual saving the benefit significant gwr to own in boston prefers a decentralized gwr that has significant environmental benefits and a high annual saving in atlanta the cost sensitive saving significant gwr to own class prefers a decentralized gwr that is cheap and saving significant regarding the sharing of a decentralized system the neighbor sharing class in atlanta prefers an rwh while the similar class in boston prefers a low cost gwr with significant environmental benefits and a high saving in boston the cost effective class is the largest class with 35 3 of the households belonging to this class the undiscerning adopter is the second largest class with about 25 9 of the households belonging to this class the rational late adopter is the third largest class with about 15 3 of the households belonging to this class the remaining 11 8 6 08 and 5 62 of total households are the cost sensitive late rwh adopter benefit significant gwr to own and neighbor sharing cost sensitive and benefit significant gwr classes respectively on the whole boston residents show the same preferred decentralized water system that has a low cost a high saving and significant environmental benefits as atlanta residents do the system can be either rwh or gwr and the neighbors installations of such systems will be an incentive this consistency of the preferred decentralized water system in atlanta and boston reveals a universal preference pattern for technology innovations 3 5 the impact of socioeconomic status on preferences cross city comparison table s3 4 summarize the impact of socioeconomic and personal characteristics on class membership we use time to complete the survey as a measure of personality regarding how fast a person can make decisions table s1 the time a respondent spends can reflect the certainty of his her decision and the inclusion of response time can improve the model performance uggeldahl et al 2016 in atlanta the undiscerning adopter class members answered surveys faster than other classes the average household income of this class ranks near the bottom among classes yet 76 of class members plan to purchase or upgrade properties moreover the undiscerning adopter class members report more neighbor s installations of rwh and gwr than other classes the demand of improved properties the fact that their neighbors have installed similar systems and the fast decision making skill can all contribute to the likelihood of a undiscerning adopter to install decentralized water facilities the rational adopter class members do not have any overwhelming socioeconomic or personal features that make this class unique the rational late adopter class members spent more time on surveys than other classes and about 72 of the class members indicate having no plan to change their current properties about 80 of the cost sensitive late rwh adopter class members live in single family houses and about 90 of the class members do not consider water scarcity to be an issue the average age of this class is the highest among all classes the average household income of the cost sensitive saving significant gwr to own class is the highest among all classes the majority of the neighbor sharing rwh class members live in multi family houses and 67 of the members think that water scarcity will probably be a problem on average this class knows more about decentralized water systems than others in boston the undiscerning adopter class members answered surveys faster than other classes except the benefit significant gwr to own class the undiscerning adopter class members in boston also report more neighbor s installations of rwh and gwr than other classes the cost effective class members do not have any overwhelming socioeconomic or personal features that make this class unique the rational late adopter in boston also spent more time on surveys than other classes the majority of rational late adopter and the cost sensitive late rwh classes indicated no plan to change their current properties the average age of the cost sensitive late rwh adopters is the highest among classes the benefit significant gwr to own class members are younger than 30 years old and unmarried however most class members have household sizes larger than three people it is likely that the benefit significant gwr to own class members room with others the majority of the neighbor sharing cost sensitive benefit significant gwr class members about 70 live in single family houses and the house size is larger than 1 500 ft2 about 95 of class members plan to purchase or upgrade properties on average the proportion of the neighbor sharing cost sensitive benefit significant gwr class members who consider that water scarcity will probably be an issue is the highest among all classes based on table s3 s4 the impacts of socioeconomic and personal characteristics on class membership are different between the two cities table s5 summarized the profiles of the socioeconomic and personal characteristics of undiscerning adopter rational late adopter and cost sensitive late rwh adopter in both cities while sharing similar preferences on decentralized water systems we found the socioeconomic and personal characteristics of the three latent classes across the two cities can be very different which supports our second hypothesis that people sharing a similar preference in two cities may have differential socioeconomic characteristics for instance the majority of the undiscerning adopters in boston live in multi family houses while a large proportion of the undiscerning adopters in atlanta live in single family houses this is reasonable because atlanta is more sprawled than boston the overall socioeconomic statistics are also different between atlanta and boston including property ownership house types household income among others table s2 the perception of water scarcity in atlanta is slightly stronger than that in boston fig s1 we hence conclude that socioeconomic composition and local development matter for preference heterogeneity analysis meanwhile we found that the impacts of neighbor s choice and water scarcity perception on class membership were consistent in both cities if the neighbors install one decentralized system the individual is more likely to be an undiscerning adopter in other words the choice of neighbors can accelerate an individual s decision of choosing a decentralized water system if an individual believes that water scarcity will probably be an issue he she tends to act as a neighbor sharing rwh in atlanta or a neighbor sharing cost sensitive benefit significant gwr in boston 3 6 diffusion of decentralized water facilities in atlanta and boston we developed an innovation diffusion curve that approximates how early different classes in metro atlanta are likely to choose a decentralized water system fig 4 franceschinis et al constructed a psychological factor that measures the degree of innovativeness to link classes to the diffusion of innovation curve franceschinis et al 2017 our diffusion curve is based on the relative timing when incentives can fulfill expectations of the six classes to install decentralized water facilities for instance environmental benefits such as flooding risk reduction and drought mitigation are only significant when the installations of decentralized water facilities reach a certain threshold the system cost may take a certain period of time to decline when the demand starts to increase we considered that the undiscerning adopter class is the earliest adopter because this class has a high probability to choose a decentralized water system and this class makes decisions much faster without discriminating between system designs the rational adopter follows the undiscerning adopter as the early majority but the rational adopter needs some environmental benefits economic savings and neighbors adoptions to support decisions the rational late adopter as the late majority will be more willing to adopt a decentralized water system as environmental benefits and annual savings become more significant we conjecture that the cost sensitive late rwh adopter and cost sensitive saving significant gwr to own are inactive groups since they are sensitive to the cost and they may consider a decentralized water system when the price goes down in the future the neighbor sharing rwh class is the latest adopter because the class depends on its neighbors to collectively share an rwh which may take a long time among neighbors to reach a consensus similarly we also developed an innovation diffusion curve that approximates how early the six classes in greater boston are likely to choose a decentralized water system fig 4 the undiscerning adopter class is considered as the earliest adopter followed by the early majority cost effective class who needs cost effective decentralized water systems the rational late adopter class will be the late majority who is more willing to choose decentralized water systems when environmental benefits become significant the cost sensitive late rwh adopter benefit significant gwr to own and neighbor sharing cost sensitive benefit significant gwr are the inactive groups because these classes need either a low cost choice or significant environmental benefits and economic savings according to our hypothetical diffusion curves of how early different classes are likely to choose decentralized water systems the diffusion of decentralized water systems in boston may be faster than in atlanta however the diffusion also depends on local contextual factors including system cost environmental benefits annual saving and neighbor s choice the modelling of diffusion will be investigated more thoroughly in a future study 3 7 spatial distribution of classes in atlanta and boston we analyzed the spatial distribution of the different classes of adopters in our two testbed areas in order to gain potential insights for planning purposes we created a set of synthetic households for each census block group in atlanta and boston and used synthetic households socioeconomic features and the average personal features to predict class memberships we visualized the percentages of different classes in atlanta and boston respectively figs 5 and 6 in atlanta a higher percentage of households belonging to the undiscerning adopter is found in the downtown indicating incentivizing initial adoptions of decentralized water systems in this area could potentially result in a rapid diffusion the majority of households residing in the southern part of atlanta are rational adopter while a high percentage of households is rational late adopter in the northern part of atlanta the diffusion of decentralized water systems is likely to start earlier in the southern part of atlanta than the northern part there are several census block groups across the city that have a higher percentage of households belonging to cost sensitive late rwh adopter and cost sensitive saving significant gwr to own the presence of neighbor sharing rwh is low in the downtown area in boston the undiscerning adopter class is more widely distributed than that in atlanta in general the undiscerning adopter cost effective and cost sensitive late rwh members are concentrated in relatively lower property value communities in the southeastern part of the city a high percentage of households belonging to the rational late adopter is located in the northwestern part of the city in boston the presence of the two classes benefit significant gwr to own and neighbor sharing cost sensitive benefit significant gwr is small our visualization included the socioeconomic features available from the census and the average personal characteristics from the survey and indicates significant spatial heterogeneity in decentralized water system demands in both atlanta and boston in atlanta an early adoption of decentralized water system can occur in the downtown in boston there are more districts and neighborhoods that can initialize the early adoption of decentralized water systems in atlanta the communities in the downtown and the southern part of the city are poorer than that in the northern part a higher percentage of households belonging to undiscerning adopter and rational adopter in the downtown and the southern part of atlanta indicates that relatively low property value communities have higher demands for decentralized water facilities as an acceptable alternative to improve community quality in boston we also found a higher percentage of households belonging to undiscerning adopter and cost effective in relatively low property value communities and neighborhoods especially in the southeastern part the rational later adopter are found in wealthier communities which have a low demand for decentralized water systems we conclude that policy incentives targeting the promotion of decentralized water systems in these high demanding communities could also create an opportunity for community renaissance through the improvement of community water service and management quality 3 8 some limitations of preference analysis sample size is one key aspect to develop a reliable preference analysis in our study we tested amazon mechanical turk as a platform for collecting responses although the cost is lower than traditional methods e g face to face mail and telephone the advantage of crowdsourcing was not shown in our study the number of workers on the amazon mechanical turk is large which is around 100 200 thousand globally however the cohort in the metro atlanta and greater boston is much smaller and we only received about 600 700 responses which represent around 0 12 of the population in both metro areas better participatory approaches that enable the engagement of a representative proportion of citizens to evaluate developing and or future technologies would benefit research like this and would better inform incentives and strategies for transitioning to more resilient water infrastructure participatory technologies will be particularly valuable for developing countries where the need for more sustainable and resilient water infrastructure is much more urgent our spatial visualization provides a reference for initializing the decentralization of water infrastructure for instance it can be a good start to promote water decentralization in the downtown of atlanta and the communities in the southeastern part of boston where there is a higher percentage of households belonging to the undiscerning adopter class however it is not sufficient for supporting policy and economic incentive development a diffusion of innovation model should be constructed that takes personal features into account including impact of neighbor behavior and environmental change to predict the adoption and diffusion of decentralized water systems the diffusion model will distinguish spatial distributions of rwh versus gwr and predict the ownerships of decentralized rwh and gwr facilities moreover such a model will enable the examination of the impacts from different policy and economic incentives to increase the adoption from a system perspective the results will be more informative for policy makers and city managers to initialize water decentralization programs 4 concluding remarks the promotion of decentralized water facilities and the emergence of a hybrid water system relies heavily on citizens preference and demand in this paper we developed a discrete choice experiment to elicit via amazon mechanical turk individual choices for designs of decentralized household and community water collection facilities in metro atlanta and greater boston mechanical turk is one of the commercial crowdsourcing platforms that enable convenient data collection given the relatively small cohort size at the target metro regions in mechanical turk we were only able to collect between 600 and 700 responses in metro atlanta and greater boston respectively in four months alternative survey technologies to enhance participation and to improve representation of the population is needed and will be investigated in the future using latent class choice modelling we found significant preference heterogeneity among residents in both metro atlanta and greater boston regarding the choice of a decentralized water facility we identified and discussed the six major classes in both cities some classes e g undiscerning adopter are likely to install a decentralized water facility earlier than others e g cost sensitive late rwh adopter our data analysis showed that comparing to atlanta boston had a larger proportion of households belonging to the undiscerning adopter class suggesting that boston would be expected to adopt decentralized water facilities at a faster rate once introduced the two cities share some common traits in classes that show similar preference patterns although the socioeconomic and personal factors that determined the groupings of households in the two cities were not identical we found consistent effects of neighbor s choice and perception of water scarcity on the class memberships households are more likely to adopt a decentralized water facility if their neighbors already install one and if households have the perception of water scarcity they are willing to share the investment of a decentralized water facility within the community our findings suggest support from the public sector to help initialize the adoption of decentralized water facilities will accelerate the diffusion the spatial visualization of the distribution of different classes in figs 5 and 6 highlights the areas of early demand for decentralized water facilities in atlanta and boston in particular downtown atlanta and the southeastern part of boston exhibit higher proportions of households belonging to the undiscerning adopter class indicating a higher chance of success if a government public utility or non governmental organization starts the

18442,development of sustainable and resilient water infrastructure is an urgent challenge for urban areas to secure long term water availability and mitigate negative impacts of water consumption and urban development a hybrid system that combines centralized water infrastructure and household decentralized water facilities including rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling may be a solution to more sustainable and resilient water management in urban areas understanding household and community preferences for decentralized water facilities is important to inform the design and ultimately the promotion and adoption of such systems in this study we conducted a discrete choice experiment via amazon mechanical turk to collect data on household choices of different decentralized water facility designs in two u s cities atlanta georgia and boston massachusetts based on the responses to the choice experiment we then developed a latent class choice model to predict households preferences of decentralized system design features and examine the influence of socioeconomic and personal characteristics on heterogeneous class membership we identified six major classes of preferences in atlanta and boston respectively and evaluated how readily each class is likely to choose a decentralized water facility atlanta and boston have some classes sharing similar preferences for decentralized water systems but the socioeconomic and personal characteristics of these classes in the two cities are different we found that the early adoption of decentralized water facilities is positively related to neighbors adoptions and pressure of water scarcity increases households willingness to share a decentralized facility the visualization of spatial distribution of the classes highlighted early demand of decentralized water facilities is likely to emerge in low property value communities which creates a unique opportunity for introducing decentralized water facilities during water infrastructure renovations our study provides a framework through citizen engagement to understand social demand and to inform the promotion of decentralized water facilities graphical abstract image 1 keywords discrete choice experiment latent class choice modeling decentralization urban water infrastructure rainwater harvesting grey water recycling 1 introduction water is essential to human wellbeing and prosperity during the last decade water scarcity and water shortage has become more prominent especially in cities with rapid population growth and economic development which underscores the importance of sustainable water management hunt and watkiss 2011 centralized treatment systems are traditionally the dominant form of urban water infrastructure water is often withdrawn from remote areas treated and distributed to the end users through a vast pipeline network similarly domestic wastewater is collected through a sewer network and treated in a centralized facility before discharge while the centralized water and wastewater infrastructure systems are efficient in delivering clean drinking water and treating pollutants in wastewater they often require a large amount of energy for both construction and operation mcdonald et al 2011 minne et al 2012 muñoz et al 2010 srinivasan et al 2013 venkatesh and brattebo 2011 the dependence of water infrastructure on energy exacerbates the depletion of both resources and increases the vulnerability of water systems to energy system failures khalkhali et al 2018 mo et al 2014 stang et al 2018 furthermore much of the u s water infrastructure is aged and approaching the end of its useful life an estimated 240 000 water main breaks happen per year in the u s with an expected cascading replacement cost of more than 1 trillion over the coming decades awwa 2011 grigg 2015 similarly energy infrastructure is experiencing an increasing number of failures and power interruptions due to extreme weather events and limited maintenance miara et al 2017 centralized supply networks are especially vulnerable to these system failures and interruptions as they lack diversity in source of supply and system scale hence improving the resilience of water infrastructure while maintaining high level of water resource availability is a priority as cities plan to renovate aged water infrastructure integrated water management which includes efficiency improvement utilization of alternative water resources and development of hybrid infrastructure systems has been increasingly recognized as a key to water sustainability in cities brown et al 2009 it was found that residents are willing to pay more for decreased water supply interruptions and improved water quality wang et al 2018 rainwater harvesting rwh is one of the integrated water management approaches that has been promoted in many cities to not only address stormwater runoff issues but also to provide alternative water sources for domestic uses greywater recycling gwr is another solution to supplement water supply and reduce the treatment loading placed on wastewater treatment facilities by combining rwh and or gwr with centralized water infrastructure a hybrid system is created that can be more cost effective energy efficient and resilient than upgrading centralized water infrastructure to the same service level jeanne et al 2018 lu et al 2013 makropoulos and butler 2010 unlike centralized water infrastructure which is usually invested in by public sectors and operated by utility companies decentralized rwh and gwr systems are usually invested in by property owners either owned individually or shared with neighbors hence the emergence of hybrid systems relies on accelerated adoption of decentralized water facilities incentivizing adoption requires a better understanding of how citizens make choices among different types of water systems as well as the underlying drivers for such choices jacobs et al 2016 mo et al 2018 pearson et al 2010 such an understanding can inform where the demand of rwh and gwr systems is high and adoption is likely to occur early in cities lu et al 2017 current research on rwh mainly focuses on characterizing the way it influences hydrologic processes and the quality of collected rain sazakli et al 2007 gwr is less common than rwh in application and current research primarily focuses on the technological design of gwr systems li et al 2009 however the preference and demand for rwh and gwr is less understood to support the planning and promotion of hybrid infrastructure systems past analysis in the city of champaign urbana illinois indicates that citizens value the benefits of improved water quality and aquatic environment londoño cadavid and ando 2013 in this study we evaluated a set of design features table 1 to understand how they affect the decision of choosing rwh or gwr to support holistic planning decisions and policy development we chose the random utility theory as our theoretical basis to conduct a discrete choice experiment and develop a statistical model of people s choice of rwh or gwr the utility is a hypothetical value as a sum of observable features of the choices and an unobserved random component for comparison the mixed logit model is one common generalized approach to derive and estimate a choice model based on the random utility theory hoyos 2010 the latent class choice model is one particular form of the mixed logit model which divides respondents into latent classes and produces class specific choice models for measuring preference heterogeneity boxall and adamowicz 2002 many researches have suggested that people have distinctive flavors regarding services and products liao et al 2014 lu et al 2015 yao et al 2019 we hypothesize that preference heterogeneity exists among citizens for the choice of rwh or gwr so that the knowledge of early demand and the location of such demand is critical to initialize the promotion past studies often focused on one region and convergence studies are rare that can generalize the impacts of socioeconomic and personal characteristics on preference heterogeneity across cities and regions for the first time we compared the impact of socioeconomic and personal characteristics on preference heterogeneity in choosing decentralized water systems between two u s cities metro atlanta georgia and greater boston massachusetts we hypothesize that residents in the two cities may share similar preferences for decentralized water systems but they can have different socioeconomic and personal characteristics hence such preferences have to be studied on a case by case basis this hypothesis highlights the need for an integrated framework to understand local demand for decentralized rwh and gwr systems our study started with a discrete choice experiment that solicited citizens choices of decentralized water systems under different design scenarios amazon mechanical turk a widely used crowdsourcing platform was used as a venue to engage citizens buhrmester et al 2011 using responses from mechanical turk we developed a latent class choice model that quantifies the heterogeneity of preferences for decentralized water systems within and across two testbed areas we evaluated the usefulness of mechanical turk in citizen engagement we compared the identified latent classes in the two urban areas and discussed how early each class is likely to adopt decentralized water systems we further visualized and analyzed the spatial distributions of latent classes across the two areas which can inform the spatial characteristics of potential adoptions this study presents an integrated framework that utilizes citizen engagement to understand social demand and to inform the planning of more sustainable hybrid water infrastructure designs in cities 2 methods materials 2 1 discrete choice experiment design the discrete choice experiment design was developed in two stages in the first stage we collaboratively developed a choice experiment draft through literature review and conducted a test on mechanical turk which asked for responses to the choice experiment questions and feedback on the overall experimental design while this initial draft was generally considered to be easy to understand an outstanding recommendation was to keep the number of options small in each comparison thus we revised the draft to only include two options in each choice scenario to allow easy differentiation between the options que et al 2017 in the second stage we conducted a second round of data collection to check the statistical significance of different design features impact on people s choices in the final revision we included 6 features that are most influential on people s choices the qualitative definitions of each feature s levels are self evident and the ranges of system costs and savings were collected from decentralized water system vendors and are considered reasonable for both atlanta and boston the finalized discrete choice experiment includes a total of twelve choice scenarios each scenario contains two upgrade options to install a decentralized water supply system each upgrade option is described by six features at different levels features include system type ownership installation cost significance of environmental benefits neighbor s choice and annual net saving from the upgrade table 1 respondents were asked to choose either a preferred option out of the two or neither we used the choice design function in the jmp software sas institute inc 2012 to design the 12 sets of comparisons 24 options used in the discrete choice experiment the software uses d optimal design to minimize the covariance of features so that each feature can be evaluated independently this design allows one level of a feature to be paired with all levels of other features for comparison at least one time across the 24 options the twelve scenarios are available in the supporting information si 2 2 data collection and correction surveys were published on amazon mechanical turk the turk is a crowdsourcing platform that provides a time effective solution for citizen engagement crump et al 2013 we only allowed respondents from metro atlanta and greater boston to complete the surveys through the restriction of registered respondents outside georgia and massachusetts and the screening based on reported zip code and county incomplete responses were excluded for data quality control and each respondent who completed the survey was paid one dollar the surveys were available for four months on the turk and we collected 697 and 602 useful responses from metro atlanta and greater boston respectively our sample sizes exceed the minimum number that can enable a 95 confidence level with 5 margin of error to represent the choices of the five million residents in both cities bellera and hanley 2007 census data were compared with our sample statistics to examine the sample bias which was corrected by reweighting the responses in the analysis 2 3 latent class choice modeling we developed a latent class choice model to characterize heterogeneous preferences for decentralized water systems among different social groups we modeled each individual s choice as a result of system design features and socioeconomic personal variables individuals are classified using socioeconomic and personal variables and each individual has differential preferences on the six design features eq 1 table s1 in the si defines the variables for modeling class membership and choice we selected the latent gold choice 5 0 software that uses the expectation maximization algorithm to develop the latent class choice model vermunt and magidson 2005 the software cannot automatically determine an optimal class number we tested the model for a range of class numbers and each class number with 150 runs to avoid local optimal solutions we chose the run that yields the lowest bayesian information criterion bic to determine the optimal class number for interpretation in general bic performs better than other information criteria to determine the class number nylund et al 2007 1 p y i t m z i x 1 x p x z i p y i t m x where p y it m z i is the probability of an individual i giving response m to choice scenario t y it is the choice of the individual i in the choice scenario t m is the nominal dependent variable of the choice i e option 1 option 2 and neither of them p x z i is the probability of individual i belonging to a certain class x z i represents the socioeconomic and personal characteristics of individual i x is the latent class membership i e latent variable x is the number of classes and p y it m x is the class specific conditional probability of individual i giving response m to choice scenario t eq 2 2 p y i t m x exp u m x t m 1 m exp u m x t where u m x t denotes the utility associated with the alternative m in choice set t of individual i belonging to class x eq 3 3 u m x t β n o a d o p t x d n o a d o p t m j 1 d β j x d j m where d j m is the value of the j th design feature of alternative m in choice set t table 1 column 3 β j x is the class dependent coefficient associated with the j th design feature each level of a categorical feature has one coefficient and the sum of these coefficients is zero for this categorical feature we created a dummy variable d no adopt m to model the option of neither of them the value is zero for the two presented options and one for the neither of them option respectively the equations for the probability of individual i belonging to a certain class x have the same structure of eqs 2 and 3 similar to eq 3 a set of class dependent coefficients are estimated to sum up socioeconomic features and personal characteristics the class membership is further predicted using a similar equation of eq 2 the details of probability functions and the application of expectation maximization to run the estimate can be found in the latent gold choice manual lu et al 2015 vermunt and magidson 2005 2 4 spatial visualization we used a population synthesizer developed by arizona state university to create complete individual household samples that represent the households living in each census block group in the city of atlanta and boston choupani and mamdoohi 2016 the synthesizer uses census summary statistics of socioeconomic variables and public use microdata sample pums to reproduce a complete household sample the sample only contains the part of socioeconomic variables for each household that are available from pums i e age education gender housing type household size household income ownership and race we combined these socioeconomic variables and the average personal characteristic values from the survey to estimate the probability of synthetic households belonging to different classes we visualized class distribution at census block group levels in atlanta and boston 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary of respondents from mechanical turk we first evaluated the sample bias from mechanical turk by comparing the socioeconomic characteristics of our respondents with the averaged demographic data obtained from u s census for metro atlanta and greater boston table s2 most socioeconomic variables have similar distributions between our survey respondents and the census data except age education and household head in our survey responses the group that is older than 60 years old as well as the group that is high school graduate or less are underrepresented we have more respondents considering themselves as household heads than that are in u s census to reduce the sample bias we used the pums data and corrected the weights of individual responses before the latent class choice modeling 3 2 selection of an optimal class number and summary of the model statistics the summary of model statistics is available in table s3 s4 according to the r2 values the latent class choice model explains 48 1 and 45 3 of the variance in the choices of atlanta and boston respondents respectively both the impacts of design features on the choice and the difference of these impacts across classes are statistically significant which can be used to interpret preference heterogeneity in both cities the socioeconomic and personal variables we defined have significant influences on class memberships we consider that our latent class choice models can help examine our hypotheses of preference heterogeneity and differential socioeconomic features of people sharing a similar preference in two cities in atlanta the optimal class number was found to be 10 which has the lowest bic fig 1 however we excluded 4 of the 10 classes because the size of each of the four classes is only less than 3 of the sample size 10 20 responses while we have 12 class specific independent parameters eq 3 and table s3 4 to estimate the small sample size cannot produce reliable estimates for analysis nasserinejad et al 2017 accordingly we analyzed the largest 6 classes in atlanta the optimal class number was 6 in boston the optimal class number verifies our first hypothesis of preference heterogeneity 3 3 latent classes in atlanta we named the six classes based on their stated preferences for decentralized water facility design features in the discrete choice experiment fig 2 shows the levels of choice modeling variables and the conditional probability for each design feature level selection based on the assigned class the conditional probability explains the choice of each class facing different levels of one design feature while holding others the same the six class names are undiscerning adopter rational adopter rational late adopter cost sensitive late rwh adopter cost sensitive saving significant gwr to own and neighbor sharing rwh the undiscerning adopter does not show any significant difference among various levels of design features this class has a high probability to choose a decentralized water system without discriminating between system designs the rational adopter class shows minimal rejection to choosing a decentralized water system and the system can be either gwr or rwh members in this class prefer low cost significant environment benefits high annual saving and the system that most neighbors install the rational late adopter demonstrates a similar preference for system features except that this class has a higher likelihood of not adopting the decentralized water system the cost sensitive late rwh adopter is also likely to not adopt the decentralized water system this class prefers a low cost rwh system if he she considers a decentralized water system the cost sensitive saving significant gwr to own class prefers a low cost self owned gwr system with significant savings the neighbor sharing rwh class shows a strong preference to share rwh with the neighbors especially when most neighbors choose to have one decentralized water system the rational adopter class is the largest class and about 35 1 of the households belong to this class in metro atlanta the rational late adopter is the second largest class and about 20 9 of the households belong to this class in metro atlanta the cost sensitive late rwh adopter class favours a less expensive rwh system and about 15 2 of households belong to this class in metro atlanta the remaining 15 0 9 3 and 4 6 of total households belong to the undiscerning adopter cost sensitive saving significant gwr to own and neighbor sharing rwh classes respectively in general households in metro atlanta prefer a decentralized water system with a low cost a high saving and significant environmental benefits the system can be either rwh or gwr and it can be shared with the community or own privately neighbors installations of such systems will be a plus to encourage the adoption 3 4 latent classes in boston we similarly named the six classes in boston undiscerning adopter cost effective rational late adopter cost sensitive late rwh adopter benefit significant gwr and neighbor sharing cost sensitive and benefit significant gwr fig 3 boston shares some common classes with atlanta including undiscerning adopter rational late adopter and cost sensitive late rwh adopter the other three classes in boston behave differently than those in atlanta the cost effective class in boston prefers a decentralized water system with a lower cost and a higher annual saving while the similar class rational adopter in atlanta prefers more environmental benefits and neighbor s choice in addition to a low cost and a higher annual saving the benefit significant gwr to own in boston prefers a decentralized gwr that has significant environmental benefits and a high annual saving in atlanta the cost sensitive saving significant gwr to own class prefers a decentralized gwr that is cheap and saving significant regarding the sharing of a decentralized system the neighbor sharing class in atlanta prefers an rwh while the similar class in boston prefers a low cost gwr with significant environmental benefits and a high saving in boston the cost effective class is the largest class with 35 3 of the households belonging to this class the undiscerning adopter is the second largest class with about 25 9 of the households belonging to this class the rational late adopter is the third largest class with about 15 3 of the households belonging to this class the remaining 11 8 6 08 and 5 62 of total households are the cost sensitive late rwh adopter benefit significant gwr to own and neighbor sharing cost sensitive and benefit significant gwr classes respectively on the whole boston residents show the same preferred decentralized water system that has a low cost a high saving and significant environmental benefits as atlanta residents do the system can be either rwh or gwr and the neighbors installations of such systems will be an incentive this consistency of the preferred decentralized water system in atlanta and boston reveals a universal preference pattern for technology innovations 3 5 the impact of socioeconomic status on preferences cross city comparison table s3 4 summarize the impact of socioeconomic and personal characteristics on class membership we use time to complete the survey as a measure of personality regarding how fast a person can make decisions table s1 the time a respondent spends can reflect the certainty of his her decision and the inclusion of response time can improve the model performance uggeldahl et al 2016 in atlanta the undiscerning adopter class members answered surveys faster than other classes the average household income of this class ranks near the bottom among classes yet 76 of class members plan to purchase or upgrade properties moreover the undiscerning adopter class members report more neighbor s installations of rwh and gwr than other classes the demand of improved properties the fact that their neighbors have installed similar systems and the fast decision making skill can all contribute to the likelihood of a undiscerning adopter to install decentralized water facilities the rational adopter class members do not have any overwhelming socioeconomic or personal features that make this class unique the rational late adopter class members spent more time on surveys than other classes and about 72 of the class members indicate having no plan to change their current properties about 80 of the cost sensitive late rwh adopter class members live in single family houses and about 90 of the class members do not consider water scarcity to be an issue the average age of this class is the highest among all classes the average household income of the cost sensitive saving significant gwr to own class is the highest among all classes the majority of the neighbor sharing rwh class members live in multi family houses and 67 of the members think that water scarcity will probably be a problem on average this class knows more about decentralized water systems than others in boston the undiscerning adopter class members answered surveys faster than other classes except the benefit significant gwr to own class the undiscerning adopter class members in boston also report more neighbor s installations of rwh and gwr than other classes the cost effective class members do not have any overwhelming socioeconomic or personal features that make this class unique the rational late adopter in boston also spent more time on surveys than other classes the majority of rational late adopter and the cost sensitive late rwh classes indicated no plan to change their current properties the average age of the cost sensitive late rwh adopters is the highest among classes the benefit significant gwr to own class members are younger than 30 years old and unmarried however most class members have household sizes larger than three people it is likely that the benefit significant gwr to own class members room with others the majority of the neighbor sharing cost sensitive benefit significant gwr class members about 70 live in single family houses and the house size is larger than 1 500 ft2 about 95 of class members plan to purchase or upgrade properties on average the proportion of the neighbor sharing cost sensitive benefit significant gwr class members who consider that water scarcity will probably be an issue is the highest among all classes based on table s3 s4 the impacts of socioeconomic and personal characteristics on class membership are different between the two cities table s5 summarized the profiles of the socioeconomic and personal characteristics of undiscerning adopter rational late adopter and cost sensitive late rwh adopter in both cities while sharing similar preferences on decentralized water systems we found the socioeconomic and personal characteristics of the three latent classes across the two cities can be very different which supports our second hypothesis that people sharing a similar preference in two cities may have differential socioeconomic characteristics for instance the majority of the undiscerning adopters in boston live in multi family houses while a large proportion of the undiscerning adopters in atlanta live in single family houses this is reasonable because atlanta is more sprawled than boston the overall socioeconomic statistics are also different between atlanta and boston including property ownership house types household income among others table s2 the perception of water scarcity in atlanta is slightly stronger than that in boston fig s1 we hence conclude that socioeconomic composition and local development matter for preference heterogeneity analysis meanwhile we found that the impacts of neighbor s choice and water scarcity perception on class membership were consistent in both cities if the neighbors install one decentralized system the individual is more likely to be an undiscerning adopter in other words the choice of neighbors can accelerate an individual s decision of choosing a decentralized water system if an individual believes that water scarcity will probably be an issue he she tends to act as a neighbor sharing rwh in atlanta or a neighbor sharing cost sensitive benefit significant gwr in boston 3 6 diffusion of decentralized water facilities in atlanta and boston we developed an innovation diffusion curve that approximates how early different classes in metro atlanta are likely to choose a decentralized water system fig 4 franceschinis et al constructed a psychological factor that measures the degree of innovativeness to link classes to the diffusion of innovation curve franceschinis et al 2017 our diffusion curve is based on the relative timing when incentives can fulfill expectations of the six classes to install decentralized water facilities for instance environmental benefits such as flooding risk reduction and drought mitigation are only significant when the installations of decentralized water facilities reach a certain threshold the system cost may take a certain period of time to decline when the demand starts to increase we considered that the undiscerning adopter class is the earliest adopter because this class has a high probability to choose a decentralized water system and this class makes decisions much faster without discriminating between system designs the rational adopter follows the undiscerning adopter as the early majority but the rational adopter needs some environmental benefits economic savings and neighbors adoptions to support decisions the rational late adopter as the late majority will be more willing to adopt a decentralized water system as environmental benefits and annual savings become more significant we conjecture that the cost sensitive late rwh adopter and cost sensitive saving significant gwr to own are inactive groups since they are sensitive to the cost and they may consider a decentralized water system when the price goes down in the future the neighbor sharing rwh class is the latest adopter because the class depends on its neighbors to collectively share an rwh which may take a long time among neighbors to reach a consensus similarly we also developed an innovation diffusion curve that approximates how early the six classes in greater boston are likely to choose a decentralized water system fig 4 the undiscerning adopter class is considered as the earliest adopter followed by the early majority cost effective class who needs cost effective decentralized water systems the rational late adopter class will be the late majority who is more willing to choose decentralized water systems when environmental benefits become significant the cost sensitive late rwh adopter benefit significant gwr to own and neighbor sharing cost sensitive benefit significant gwr are the inactive groups because these classes need either a low cost choice or significant environmental benefits and economic savings according to our hypothetical diffusion curves of how early different classes are likely to choose decentralized water systems the diffusion of decentralized water systems in boston may be faster than in atlanta however the diffusion also depends on local contextual factors including system cost environmental benefits annual saving and neighbor s choice the modelling of diffusion will be investigated more thoroughly in a future study 3 7 spatial distribution of classes in atlanta and boston we analyzed the spatial distribution of the different classes of adopters in our two testbed areas in order to gain potential insights for planning purposes we created a set of synthetic households for each census block group in atlanta and boston and used synthetic households socioeconomic features and the average personal features to predict class memberships we visualized the percentages of different classes in atlanta and boston respectively figs 5 and 6 in atlanta a higher percentage of households belonging to the undiscerning adopter is found in the downtown indicating incentivizing initial adoptions of decentralized water systems in this area could potentially result in a rapid diffusion the majority of households residing in the southern part of atlanta are rational adopter while a high percentage of households is rational late adopter in the northern part of atlanta the diffusion of decentralized water systems is likely to start earlier in the southern part of atlanta than the northern part there are several census block groups across the city that have a higher percentage of households belonging to cost sensitive late rwh adopter and cost sensitive saving significant gwr to own the presence of neighbor sharing rwh is low in the downtown area in boston the undiscerning adopter class is more widely distributed than that in atlanta in general the undiscerning adopter cost effective and cost sensitive late rwh members are concentrated in relatively lower property value communities in the southeastern part of the city a high percentage of households belonging to the rational late adopter is located in the northwestern part of the city in boston the presence of the two classes benefit significant gwr to own and neighbor sharing cost sensitive benefit significant gwr is small our visualization included the socioeconomic features available from the census and the average personal characteristics from the survey and indicates significant spatial heterogeneity in decentralized water system demands in both atlanta and boston in atlanta an early adoption of decentralized water system can occur in the downtown in boston there are more districts and neighborhoods that can initialize the early adoption of decentralized water systems in atlanta the communities in the downtown and the southern part of the city are poorer than that in the northern part a higher percentage of households belonging to undiscerning adopter and rational adopter in the downtown and the southern part of atlanta indicates that relatively low property value communities have higher demands for decentralized water facilities as an acceptable alternative to improve community quality in boston we also found a higher percentage of households belonging to undiscerning adopter and cost effective in relatively low property value communities and neighborhoods especially in the southeastern part the rational later adopter are found in wealthier communities which have a low demand for decentralized water systems we conclude that policy incentives targeting the promotion of decentralized water systems in these high demanding communities could also create an opportunity for community renaissance through the improvement of community water service and management quality 3 8 some limitations of preference analysis sample size is one key aspect to develop a reliable preference analysis in our study we tested amazon mechanical turk as a platform for collecting responses although the cost is lower than traditional methods e g face to face mail and telephone the advantage of crowdsourcing was not shown in our study the number of workers on the amazon mechanical turk is large which is around 100 200 thousand globally however the cohort in the metro atlanta and greater boston is much smaller and we only received about 600 700 responses which represent around 0 12 of the population in both metro areas better participatory approaches that enable the engagement of a representative proportion of citizens to evaluate developing and or future technologies would benefit research like this and would better inform incentives and strategies for transitioning to more resilient water infrastructure participatory technologies will be particularly valuable for developing countries where the need for more sustainable and resilient water infrastructure is much more urgent our spatial visualization provides a reference for initializing the decentralization of water infrastructure for instance it can be a good start to promote water decentralization in the downtown of atlanta and the communities in the southeastern part of boston where there is a higher percentage of households belonging to the undiscerning adopter class however it is not sufficient for supporting policy and economic incentive development a diffusion of innovation model should be constructed that takes personal features into account including impact of neighbor behavior and environmental change to predict the adoption and diffusion of decentralized water systems the diffusion model will distinguish spatial distributions of rwh versus gwr and predict the ownerships of decentralized rwh and gwr facilities moreover such a model will enable the examination of the impacts from different policy and economic incentives to increase the adoption from a system perspective the results will be more informative for policy makers and city managers to initialize water decentralization programs 4 concluding remarks the promotion of decentralized water facilities and the emergence of a hybrid water system relies heavily on citizens preference and demand in this paper we developed a discrete choice experiment to elicit via amazon mechanical turk individual choices for designs of decentralized household and community water collection facilities in metro atlanta and greater boston mechanical turk is one of the commercial crowdsourcing platforms that enable convenient data collection given the relatively small cohort size at the target metro regions in mechanical turk we were only able to collect between 600 and 700 responses in metro atlanta and greater boston respectively in four months alternative survey technologies to enhance participation and to improve representation of the population is needed and will be investigated in the future using latent class choice modelling we found significant preference heterogeneity among residents in both metro atlanta and greater boston regarding the choice of a decentralized water facility we identified and discussed the six major classes in both cities some classes e g undiscerning adopter are likely to install a decentralized water facility earlier than others e g cost sensitive late rwh adopter our data analysis showed that comparing to atlanta boston had a larger proportion of households belonging to the undiscerning adopter class suggesting that boston would be expected to adopt decentralized water facilities at a faster rate once introduced the two cities share some common traits in classes that show similar preference patterns although the socioeconomic and personal factors that determined the groupings of households in the two cities were not identical we found consistent effects of neighbor s choice and perception of water scarcity on the class memberships households are more likely to adopt a decentralized water facility if their neighbors already install one and if households have the perception of water scarcity they are willing to share the investment of a decentralized water facility within the community our findings suggest support from the public sector to help initialize the adoption of decentralized water facilities will accelerate the diffusion the spatial visualization of the distribution of different classes in figs 5 and 6 highlights the areas of early demand for decentralized water facilities in atlanta and boston in particular downtown atlanta and the southeastern part of boston exhibit higher proportions of households belonging to the undiscerning adopter class indicating a higher chance of success if a government public utility or non governmental organization starts the

18443,phototrophic biofilms are distributed widely at the sediment soil water interfaces swi in paddy fields where they immobilize phosphorus thereby reducing its runoff loss however how soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios drive the phototrophic biofilm community and its contribution to phosphorus cycling is largely unknown a large scale field investigation in chinese paddy fields reported here shows that soil organic carbon soc and soil total nitrogen stn contents rather than soil total phosphorus stp triggered phosphorus immobilization of paddy biofilms as they changed algal diversity and eps production high c p and n p ratios favored phosphorus immobilization in biofilm biomass via increasing the abundance of green algae the c n ratio on the other hand had only a weak effect on phosphorus immobilization being counteracted by soc or stn results from this study reveal how the in situ interception of phosphorus in paddy fields is driven by soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios and provide practical information on how to reduce runoff losses of phosphorus by regulating soc and stn contents graphical abstract image 1 keywords c p n p algal diversity eps p loss 1 introduction phosphorus loss from agricultural ecosystems occurs commonly and contributes greatly to surface water eutrophication especially in developing countries weng et al 2015 for instance china has 30 million ha of paddy fields however a survey by the ministry of agriculture china showed that the phosphorus utilization efficiency in rice culture was only 10 20 wu et al 2018 a national pollution census bulletin of china released in 2010 indicated that the total phosphorus tp emissions from agricultural ecosystems contributed 67 4 of tp input into surface water implying that reducing phosphorus driven eutrophication is challenging wu et al 2017 unlike nitrogen which migrates quickly within and between soil and water the vertical migration rate of phosphorus in either soil or water is extremely slow baker et al 2017 hence phosphorus is especially abundant in the topsoil e g 0 5 cm and easily lost through runoff unlike in dryland in paddy fields the soil water interface swi forms the boundary between soil and water and is the site where the geochemical processes involving nutrients are coupled voermans et al 2018 as a human made ecosystem paddy fields are frequently perturbed by human activities resulting in unique swi features frenzel 2012 the periodic wetting drying and fertilization initiate and drive the formation and withering of paddy phototrophic biofilms at the swi su et al 2016 mainly composed of algae bacteria eps and abiotic substances paddy phototrophic biofilms are essentially microbial aggregates formed at the swi that flourish during the seeding and tilling stages of rice cultivations su et al 2016 by performing phosphorus absorption and adsorption phototrophic biofilms temporarily immobilize phosphorus in biomass liu et al 2017 phototrophic biofilms can accumulate 2 25 mg phosphorus per gram of biomass depending on phosphorus availability releasing it back into the soil when the biomass decays crimp et al 2017 li et al 2017 liu et al 2016 reynaud and roger 1978 reported that in one growth season the algal biomass accumulated in one ha of paddy fields was several hundred kg to over one ton thereby the phototrophic biofilms from 1 ha paddy fields can accumulate 2 25 kg phosphorus while the phosphorus application rate in china is about 30 80 kg per ha paddy fields hua et al 2017 qiao et al 2012 consequently phosphorus is retained in paddy soil and runoff losses are greatly reduced however the role of phototrophic biofilms in the in situ interception of phosphorus in paddy fields has been largely overlooked in the past wu et al 2018 for any community its function highly depends on species composition and diversity peter et al 2010 smith and knapp 2010 with innate individual differences in phosphorus uptake capacity and subsistence quota species composition has a strong effect of on the phosphorus content immobilized in phototrophic biofilms ho et al 2003 liu et al 2015 diversity is another central parameter affecting ecological function decline in diversity is generally associated with loss of ecological functions cardinale 2011 loreau et al 2001 wagg et al 2014 given the continuously changing physiochemical conditions at swi the dominant algal species and diversity in paddy phototrophic biofilms may vary greatly resulting in changes in phosphorus content in biofilm biomass lu et al 2016 however studies on phototrophic biofilms and phosphorus transformation to date have focused mainly on their applications in wastewater treatment whereas studies on phototrophic biofilms growing on artificial substrates and their nutrient exchange with soil are absent bharti et al 2017 boelee et al 2011 liu et al 2016 2017 information on the effects of soil carbon and nutrient on phosphorus immobilization of phototrophic biofilm at swi in paddy fields is missing and this limits the application of phototrophic biofilms in regulating phosphorus biogeochemical cycles in paddy fields formation and metabolic activities of phototrophic biofilms are complex processes influenced by soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios chen et al 2016 su et al 2016 for instance nitrogen limiting conditions may result in the dominance of nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria and algal species with high affinity to nitrogen while nitrogen replete conditions favor the growth of species with high subsistence quota of nitrogen and production of extracellular proteins lee et al 2017 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2014 while sufficient soil organic carbon soc supply can increase the secretion of polysaccharides and adhesion of unicellular algal or bacterial cells to the biofilm matrix miqueleto et al 2010 roeselers et al 2007 in addition to carbon and nutrient availability the carbon and nutrient ratios are also fundamental in shaping the biofilm community and driving phosphorus cycling processes fanin et al 2015 lee et al 2017 for instance the mineralization rate of soc depends on the soil total nitrogen stn availability while mineralization of organic phosphorus is driven by the availability of soc to microbes henriksen and breland 1999 heuck et al 2015 furthermore the c n p ratio in the phototrophic biofilm biomass is not strictly homeostatic but changes depending on element availabilities heuck et al 2015 liu et al 2016 miqueleto et al 2010 at large geographical scale paddy soils can have contrasting soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios and while these are known as drivers of differentiation in community structure and

in paddy phototrophic biofilms and overlying water in the context of phosphorus in situ interception and discharge reduction from paddy fields the primary function of phototrophic biofilms at swi is to immobilize phosphorus in biomass in the field studies reported here the paddy phototrophic biofilms accumulated 1 1 0 2 9 7 0 8 mg tp g dry biomass fig 2 from south region i to northeast region iii the phosphorus content immobilized in paddy phototrophic biofilms showed an increasing trend while from west to east along the yangtze river region ii the phosphorus content of biofilm biomass decreased contrary to the changing trend of biomass phosphorus content from south to northeast or from west to east po4 3 p concentrations in the overlying water showed a decreasing trend from south to northeast 0 4 0 1 mg l 0 1 0 04 mg l and an increasing trend from west to east along the yangtze river 0 15 0 1 mg l 0 55 0 04 mg l fig 2 suggesting latent effects of phosphorus immobilization by paddy phototrophic biofilms on reducing the overlying water phosphorus concentration 3 2 biofilm community and phosphorus immobilization by paddy biofilms the functions of an ecosystem highly depend on its community structure and species composition here the correlations between algal diversity bacterial diversity dominant algal and bacterial groups algal and bacterial community presented in fig s1 and phosphorus content immobilized in paddy phototrophic biofilms and phosphorus in overlying water were explored as shown in table 1 the pearson correlations indicated that the biomass phosphorus content was positively correlated with algal diversity bacterial diversity and eps content all p 0 01 indicating the potential effects of algal and bacterial diversity and eps on phosphorus immobilization of paddy biofilms on the contrary the overlying water tp concentration was negatively correlated with algal diversity bacterial diversity and eps contents all p 0 001 table 1 suggesting their effects on reducing the overlying water tp concentration additionally the biomass phosphorus content and overlying water tp concentration had significant correlations with some of the dominant algal species table 1 for instance the biomass phosphorus content had positive correlations with the relative abundance of desmodesmus and spirogyra r 0 41 and 0 50 respectively all p 0 001 and the overlying water tp concentration was negatively correlated with the relative abundance of desmodesmus r 0 24 p 0 001 however the biomass phosphorus content had significant but negative correlations with the relative abundance of navicula r 0 32 p 0 001 table 1 unlike the bacterial diversity the relative abundance of cyanobacteria and proteobacteria had no significant correlations with the biomass phosphorus content r 0 02 p 0 01 table 1 overall considering the strong phosphorus uptake capacity of green algae results from this study suggest that in addition to diversity the compositional effects of individual algal groups especially the green algae on phosphorus immobilization should not be neglected 3 3 soil carbon nutrient stoichiometry and biofilm community because of the direct mass exchange with soil the community composition of paddy phototrophic biofilms is closely related to soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios the 20 selected sites 200 samples had large variations in soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios data presented in table 2 and there were significant and positive correlations between soc stn contents and algal diversity r 0 52 and 0 34 respectively all p 0 001 table 3 bacterial diversity r 0 40 and 0 20 respectively all p 0 01 and eps contents r 0 42 and 0 37 respectively all p 0 001 for stp it only had significant correlation with algal diversity r 0 23 p 0 001 for the carbon and nutrient ratios significant and positive correlations were observed between c p n p and algal diversity r 0 24 and 0 14 respectively all p 0 05 table 3 bacterial diversity r 0 41 and 0 25 respectively all p 0 001 and eps contents r 0 51 and 0 53 respectively all p 0 001 however c n ratio only had significant correlation with eps content r 0 24 p 0 001 instead of algal diversity or bacterial diversity all p 0 05 for algae the two green algae genera desmodesmus and spriogyra had significant correlations with soc r 0 21 and 0 19 respectively all p 0 01 table 3 stn r 0 19 and 0 16 respectively all p 0 01 c p ratio r 0 38 and 0 35 respectively all p 0 001 and n p ratio r 0 37 and 0 34 respectively all p 0 001 but had no significant correlation with c n ratio all p 0 05 while for cyanobacteria proteobacteria and navicula their correlations with carbon nutrient contents and ratios were different from desmodesmus and spriogyra table 3 specifically proteobacteria had significant but negative correlation with c n ratio r 0 46 p 0 001 cyanobacteria had significant and negative correlations with soc stn c p and n p ratios r 0 17 0 23 0 19 and 0 27 respectively all p 0 05 but a positive correlation with c n ratio r 0 32 p 0 001 similarly to cyanobacteria the diatom navicula was negatively correlated with soc stn c p n p ratios r 0 24 0 26 0 14 and 0 25 respectively p 0 001 but positively correlated with c n ratio r 0 24 p 0 001 overall considering the contrasting correlations between phosphorus content in biofilm biomass soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios and different algal bacterial groups results from this study suggest that the green algae are the key species for increasing phosphorus immobilization in paddy biofilm biomass while soc and stn are the main factors driving the biofilm community differentiation 3 4 carbon nutrient stoichiometry algae eps and phosphorus immobilization phosphorus immobilization by paddy phototrophic biofilms at swi is the result of comprehensive effects of species composition diversity eps content as well as soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios here the large variations in soc stn and c p and n p ratios shaped the paddy phototrophic biofilm community and influenced their functions with regard to phosphorus immobilization at swi thus further analysis is warranted to evaluate how the relationship between paddy biofilm community and phosphorus immobilization was influenced by soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios to this end the effects of soc stn c p and n p ratios on the relationships between biomass phosphorus content and algal diversity eps contents or the relative abundance of dominant green algae genera were investigated fig 3 the correlation between biomass phosphorus content and algal diversity or eps content became stronger with soc contents increasing from 20 mg g to 20 30 mg g and with stn increasing from 1 mg g to 1 2 mg g while the correlation became weaker when soc and stn increased further fig 3a b the correlations between biomass phosphorus content and algal diversity or eps content on the other hand did not show a clear changing trend with increasing c p and n p ratios however with increasing c p and n p ratios the correlations between biomass phosphorus content and the relative abundance of desmodesmus and spriogyra showed a clear increasing trend fig 3c d this indicated that soc and stn contents had stronger effects on the correlations between biomass phosphorus content and algal diversity or eps content while c p and n p ratios had stronger effects on the correlations between biomass phosphorus content and the relative abundance of desmodesmus or spriogyra to synthesize all the findings partial least squares path modeling pls pm was conducted to illustrate the effects of soil carbon and nutrient availability i e soc and stn contents and ratios i e c p and n p on algal diversity eps content relative abundance of dominant green algae and phosphorus content immobilized in phototrophic biofilms fig 4 in accordance with the pearson correlation analysis tables 1 and 3 fig 3 soc and stn contents had strong direct effects path coefficient 0 49 on algal diversity fig 4a while c p and n p ratios had strong direct effects path coefficient 0 46 on the dominant green algae species fig 4b consequently due to the effects of c p and n p ratios soc and stn contents had weak indirect effects on algal diversity but strong indirect effects on the dominant green algae species however carbon and nitrogen availability and c p and n p ratios had weak direct effects on phosphorus content immobilized in paddy biofilms but more pronounced indirect effects via influencing algal diversity and dominant green algae species with regard to phosphorus immobilization algal diversity dominant green algae species and eps content had strong direct effects with the strongest effects from the dominant green algae species fig 4b besides both algal diversity and the dominant green algae species had indirect effects via their effects on eps production this further suggests that algae especially green algae play key roles in phosphorus immobilization and that species composition is more important than diversity overall variations in soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios drive the differentiations in algal diversity dominant species composition and eps production associated with differences in phosphorus contents immobilized in the paddy phototrophic biofilms 4 discussion phosphorus immobilization by paddy phototrophic biofilms is a complex process driven by the biofilm community composition as well as the soil physiochemical composition gaiser et al 2004 sola et al 2018 in this study two objectives were addressed with regard to the driving effects of soil carbon and nutrient on the differentiations in community composition and phosphorus immobilization by the paddy phototrophic biofilms identifying the main factors and elucidating the driving process firstly the analyses of paddy phototrophic biofilms at a large spatial scale verified that soc stn and c p and n p ratios are central in shaping the phototrophic biofilm community composition changing the diversity and eps production soc provides essential mass and energy for the metabolism of bacteria and limits the organic mineralization flemming and wingender 2010 heuck et al 2015 although soc is not directly available to algae soc supply triggers the bioavailability of nitrogen phosphorus as well as minerals to algae flemming and wingender 2010 thereby strong and positive correlations were observed between soc and algal diversity and dominant green algae groups table 3 nitrogen is the nutrient in greatest demand by phototrophic biofilms and stn supply limits the mineralization of soc and hence a low c n ratio indicates high mineralization rates henriksen and breland 1999 however the pearson correlation indicated that c n ratio was only positively correlated with the relative abundance of cyanobacteria and navicula table 3 without significant correlations with algal diversity bacterial diversity and the key species in phosphorus immobilization one reason might be that both soc and stn play potent roles in shaping the paddy biofilm community composition table 3 fig 3 thereby a high c n ratio may induce nitrogen limitation but the excessive supply of soc will counteract the negative effects from nitrogen limitation and vice versa fanin et al 2015 considering the effects of soc and stn on paddy biofilm increase in soc and stn contents such as returning rice straw to the paddy field in practice will favor phosphorus immobilization by paddy biofilm compared to soc and stn the effects of stp on phototrophic biofilm community and phosphorus immobilization were much weaker and stp only had significant correlation with algal diversity table 3 this may be due to the low tp contents in paddy soil 0 5 1 2 mg g table 2 and part of it binds with ca fe and al oxides and is not directly available to bacteria and algae álvarez rogel et al 2007 xu et al 2014 furthermore in both phosphorus poor and phosphorus rich soils phosphorus utilization is driven by the microbial need for soc and the dependence on soc weakens the effects of stp heuck et al 2015 however the low stp content may limit the increase in algal diversity and abundance of green algae table 3 which may be caused by the higher subsistence quota of phosphorus of algae than bacteria liu et al 2016 smith and prairie 2004 additionally the weak effects of stp intensified the effects of c p and n p ratios on the phototrophic biofilm community composition and phosphorus immobilization table 3 fig 3 nevertheless the effects of c p and n p ratios were actually triggered by soc and stn fig 4 secondly results from this study suggested that high algal diversity relative abundance of green algae and eps contents were intertwined with high c p and n p ratios triggered by soc and stn green algae and bacteria had contrasting phosphorus immobilization capacity with stronger capacity of green algae than bacteria liu et al 2017 smith and prairie 2004 assimilation is the main phosphorus transformation pathway for green algae and the algal group with higher biomass amount and luxury phosphorus uptake capability have more advantages in assimilating phosphorus than bacteria crimp et al 2017 su et al 2012 studies also reported that high algae species richness can positively affect biomass production especially during the early stages of succession and thereafter increase phosphorus assimilation weis et al 2007 additionally adsorption is another way of phosphorus immobilization by phototrophic biofilms and high eps content favors the formation of binding sites on the surface of algal or bacterial cells and increase the possibility of phosphorus adsorption on the external surface of phototrophic biofilms liu et al 2018 lu et al 2014 thereby it explains the significant correlations between eps and biomass phosphorus content table 1 and the strong direct effects of eps on biomass phosphorus content fig 4 hence conditions suitable for eps production such as soc content of 20 30 mg g will help to increase the phosphorus immobilization by phototrophic biofilms at swi and reduce phosphorus runoff loss fig 3 runoff loss is one of the main phosphorus discharge pathways from paddy fields and phosphorus immobilization in phototrophic biofilm is effective for in situ phosphorus interception our observations during sample collection suggested that the phototrophic biofilm coverage on paddy soil varied between 20 to over 40 with a thickness of 0 5 1 0 cm and density of 30 mg dry weight per cm3 thus in a growth season the biomass of phototrophic biofilms in 1 ha paddy fields may vary between 300 and 1200 kg accordingly the paddy biofilm in 1 ha paddy fields may immobilize 1 to over 10 kg phosphorus therefore in china about 30 000 300 000 t phosphorus discharge from paddy fields can be reduced in each rice growing season in this study the results provide insights into how to regulate soil physiochemical conditions to make full use of the paddy phototrophic biofilms to immobilize phosphorus and retain phosphorus in paddy fields however to thoroughly elucidate the interactive effects of carbon and nutrient stoichiometry on the phosphorus transformation by phototrophic biofilms at swi in paddy fields more practical factors should be also taken into consideration bardgett and wh 2014 loreau et al 2001 wagg et al 2014 for instance the topdressing during the heading stage of rice may change the soil carbon nutrient availability and stoichiometry and consequently the paddy phototrophic biofilm community structure wu et al 2016 thus taking the rice growth stages into consideration in future studies will provide more quantitative insight when studying the functions of paddy phototrophic biofilms in phosphorus transformation at swi ye et al 2013 5 conclusions soil organic carbon soc and total nitrogen stn rather than total phosphorus stp are central in shaping the community composition and driving phosphorus immobilization by phototrophic biofilms at soil water interface swi in paddy fields high c p and n p ratios of soil favor the dominance of green algae in the paddy phototrophic biofilm and increase phosphorus immobilization at swi in paddy fields this offers management tools to improve phosphorus immobilization for example by returning rice straw to the paddy field high algal diversity dominance of green algae and eps production are vital in increasing phosphorus

18443,phototrophic biofilms are distributed widely at the sediment soil water interfaces swi in paddy fields where they immobilize phosphorus thereby reducing its runoff loss however how soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios drive the phototrophic biofilm community and its contribution to phosphorus cycling is largely unknown a large scale field investigation in chinese paddy fields reported here shows that soil organic carbon soc and soil total nitrogen stn contents rather than soil total phosphorus stp triggered phosphorus immobilization of paddy biofilms as they changed algal diversity and eps production high c p and n p ratios favored phosphorus immobilization in biofilm biomass via increasing the abundance of green algae the c n ratio on the other hand had only a weak effect on phosphorus immobilization being counteracted by soc or stn results from this study reveal how the in situ interception of phosphorus in paddy fields is driven by soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios and provide practical information on how to reduce runoff losses of phosphorus by regulating soc and stn contents graphical abstract image 1 keywords c p n p algal diversity eps p loss 1 introduction phosphorus loss from agricultural ecosystems occurs commonly and contributes greatly to surface water eutrophication especially in developing countries weng et al 2015 for instance china has 30 million ha of paddy fields however a survey by the ministry of agriculture china showed that the phosphorus utilization efficiency in rice culture was only 10 20 wu et al 2018 a national pollution census bulletin of china released in 2010 indicated that the total phosphorus tp emissions from agricultural ecosystems contributed 67 4 of tp input into surface water implying that reducing phosphorus driven eutrophication is challenging wu et al 2017 unlike nitrogen which migrates quickly within and between soil and water the vertical migration rate of phosphorus in either soil or water is extremely slow baker et al 2017 hence phosphorus is especially abundant in the topsoil e g 0 5 cm and easily lost through runoff unlike in dryland in paddy fields the soil water interface swi forms the boundary between soil and water and is the site where the geochemical processes involving nutrients are coupled voermans et al 2018 as a human made ecosystem paddy fields are frequently perturbed by human activities resulting in unique swi features frenzel 2012 the periodic wetting drying and fertilization initiate and drive the formation and withering of paddy phototrophic biofilms at the swi su et al 2016 mainly composed of algae bacteria eps and abiotic substances paddy phototrophic biofilms are essentially microbial aggregates formed at the swi that flourish during the seeding and tilling stages of rice cultivations su et al 2016 by performing phosphorus absorption and adsorption phototrophic biofilms temporarily immobilize phosphorus in biomass liu et al 2017 phototrophic biofilms can accumulate 2 25 mg phosphorus per gram of biomass depending on phosphorus availability releasing it back into the soil when the biomass decays crimp et al 2017 li et al 2017 liu et al 2016 reynaud and roger 1978 reported that in one growth season the algal biomass accumulated in one ha of paddy fields was several hundred kg to over one ton thereby the phototrophic biofilms from 1 ha paddy fields can accumulate 2 25 kg phosphorus while the phosphorus application rate in china is about 30 80 kg per ha paddy fields hua et al 2017 qiao et al 2012 consequently phosphorus is retained in paddy soil and runoff losses are greatly reduced however the role of phototrophic biofilms in the in situ interception of phosphorus in paddy fields has been largely overlooked in the past wu et al 2018 for any community its function highly depends on species composition and diversity peter et al 2010 smith and knapp 2010 with innate individual differences in phosphorus uptake capacity and subsistence quota species composition has a strong effect of on the phosphorus content immobilized in phototrophic biofilms ho et al 2003 liu et al 2015 diversity is another central parameter affecting ecological function decline in diversity is generally associated with loss of ecological functions cardinale 2011 loreau et al 2001 wagg et al 2014 given the continuously changing physiochemical conditions at swi the dominant algal species and diversity in paddy phototrophic biofilms may vary greatly resulting in changes in phosphorus content in biofilm biomass lu et al 2016 however studies on phototrophic biofilms and phosphorus transformation to date have focused mainly on their applications in wastewater treatment whereas studies on phototrophic biofilms growing on artificial substrates and their nutrient exchange with soil are absent bharti et al 2017 boelee et al 2011 liu et al 2016 2017 information on the effects of soil carbon and nutrient on phosphorus immobilization of phototrophic biofilm at swi in paddy fields is missing and this limits the application of phototrophic biofilms in regulating phosphorus biogeochemical cycles in paddy fields formation and metabolic activities of phototrophic biofilms are complex processes influenced by soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios chen et al 2016 su et al 2016 for instance nitrogen limiting conditions may result in the dominance of nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria and algal species with high affinity to nitrogen while nitrogen replete conditions favor the growth of species with high subsistence quota of nitrogen and production of extracellular proteins lee et al 2017 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2014 while sufficient soil organic carbon soc supply can increase the secretion of polysaccharides and adhesion of unicellular algal or bacterial cells to the biofilm matrix miqueleto et al 2010 roeselers et al 2007 in addition to carbon and nutrient availability the carbon and nutrient ratios are also fundamental in shaping the biofilm community and driving phosphorus cycling processes fanin et al 2015 lee et al 2017 for instance the mineralization rate of soc depends on the soil total nitrogen stn availability while mineralization of organic phosphorus is driven by the availability of soc to microbes henriksen and breland 1999 heuck et al 2015 furthermore the c n p ratio in the phototrophic biofilm biomass is not strictly homeostatic but changes depending on element availabilities heuck et al 2015 liu et al 2016 miqueleto et al 2010 at large geographical scale paddy soils can have contrasting soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios and while these are known as drivers of differentiation in community structure and phosphorus immobilization capacity of phototrophic biofilms their actual implications are still largely unexplored bharti et al 2017 spaak et al 2017 wagg et al 2014 this limits the exploration of effective measures of increasing the in situ interception of phosphorus via phototrophic biofilms in this study phototrophic biofilms were collected from paddy fields with various c n p ratios

the phosphorus content immobilized in paddy phototrophic biofilms showed an increasing trend while from west to east along the yangtze river region ii the phosphorus content of biofilm biomass decreased contrary to the changing trend of biomass phosphorus content from south to northeast or from west to east po4 3 p concentrations in the overlying water showed a decreasing trend from south to northeast 0 4 0 1 mg l 0 1 0 04 mg l and an increasing trend from west to east along the yangtze river 0 15 0 1 mg l 0 55 0 04 mg l fig 2 suggesting latent effects of phosphorus immobilization by paddy phototrophic biofilms on reducing the overlying water phosphorus concentration 3 2 biofilm community and phosphorus immobilization by paddy biofilms the functions of an ecosystem highly depend on its community structure and species composition here the correlations between algal diversity bacterial diversity dominant algal and bacterial groups algal and bacterial community presented in fig s1 and phosphorus content immobilized in paddy phototrophic biofilms and phosphorus in overlying water were explored as shown in table 1 the pearson correlations indicated that the biomass phosphorus content was positively correlated with algal diversity bacterial diversity and eps content all p 0 01 indicating the potential effects of algal and bacterial diversity and eps on phosphorus immobilization of paddy biofilms on the contrary the overlying water tp concentration was negatively correlated with algal diversity bacterial diversity and eps contents all p 0 001 table 1 suggesting their effects on reducing the overlying water tp concentration additionally the biomass phosphorus content and overlying water tp concentration had significant correlations with some of the dominant algal species table 1 for instance the biomass phosphorus content had positive correlations with the relative abundance of desmodesmus and spirogyra r 0 41 and 0 50 respectively all p 0 001 and the overlying water tp concentration was negatively correlated with the relative abundance of desmodesmus r 0 24 p 0 001 however the biomass phosphorus content had significant but negative correlations with the relative abundance of navicula r 0 32 p 0 001 table 1 unlike the bacterial diversity the relative abundance of cyanobacteria and proteobacteria had no significant correlations with the biomass phosphorus content r 0 02 p 0 01 table 1 overall considering the strong phosphorus uptake capacity of green algae results from this study suggest that in addition to diversity the compositional effects of individual algal groups especially the green algae on phosphorus immobilization should not be neglected 3 3 soil carbon nutrient stoichiometry and biofilm community because of the direct mass exchange with soil the community composition of paddy phototrophic biofilms is closely related to soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios the 20 selected sites 200 samples had large variations in soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios data presented in table 2 and there were significant and positive correlations between soc stn contents and algal diversity r 0 52 and 0 34 respectively all p 0 001 table 3 bacterial diversity r 0 40 and 0 20 respectively all p 0 01 and eps contents r 0 42 and 0 37 respectively all p 0 001 for stp it only had significant correlation with algal diversity r 0 23 p 0 001 for the carbon and nutrient ratios significant and positive correlations were observed between c p n p and algal diversity r 0 24 and 0 14 respectively all p 0 05 table 3 bacterial diversity r 0 41 and 0 25 respectively all p 0 001 and eps contents r 0 51 and 0 53 respectively all p 0 001 however c n ratio only had significant correlation with eps content r 0 24 p 0 001 instead of algal diversity or bacterial diversity all p 0 05 for algae the two green algae genera desmodesmus and spriogyra had significant correlations with soc r 0 21 and 0 19 respectively all p 0 01 table 3 stn r 0 19 and 0 16 respectively all p 0 01 c p ratio r 0 38 and 0 35 respectively all p 0 001 and n p ratio r 0 37 and 0 34 respectively all p 0 001 but had no significant correlation with c n ratio all p 0 05 while for cyanobacteria proteobacteria and navicula their correlations with carbon nutrient contents and ratios were different from desmodesmus and spriogyra table 3 specifically proteobacteria had significant but negative correlation with c n ratio r 0 46 p 0 001 cyanobacteria had significant and negative correlations with soc stn c p and n p ratios r 0 17 0 23 0 19 and 0 27 respectively all p 0 05 but a positive correlation with c n ratio r 0 32 p 0 001 similarly to cyanobacteria the diatom navicula was negatively correlated with soc stn c p n p ratios r 0 24 0 26 0 14 and 0 25 respectively p 0 001 but positively correlated with c n ratio r 0 24 p 0 001 overall considering the contrasting correlations between phosphorus content in biofilm biomass soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios and different algal bacterial groups results from this study suggest that the green algae are the key species for increasing phosphorus immobilization in paddy biofilm biomass while soc and stn are the main factors driving the biofilm community differentiation 3 4 carbon nutrient stoichiometry algae eps and phosphorus immobilization phosphorus immobilization by paddy phototrophic biofilms at swi is the result of comprehensive effects of species composition diversity eps content as well as soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios here the large variations in soc stn and c p and n p ratios shaped the paddy phototrophic biofilm community and influenced their functions with regard to phosphorus immobilization at swi thus further analysis is warranted to evaluate how the relationship between paddy biofilm community and phosphorus immobilization was influenced by soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios to this end the effects of soc stn c p and n p ratios on the relationships between biomass phosphorus content and algal diversity eps contents or the relative abundance of dominant green algae genera were investigated fig 3 the correlation between biomass phosphorus content and algal diversity or eps content became stronger with soc contents increasing from 20 mg g to 20 30 mg g and with stn increasing from 1 mg g to 1 2 mg g while the correlation became weaker when soc and stn increased further fig 3a b the correlations between biomass phosphorus content and algal diversity or eps content on the other hand did not show a clear changing trend with increasing c p and n p ratios however with increasing c p and n p ratios the correlations between biomass phosphorus content and the relative abundance of desmodesmus and spriogyra showed a clear increasing trend fig 3c d this indicated that soc and stn contents had stronger effects on the correlations between biomass phosphorus content and algal diversity or eps content while c p and n p ratios had stronger effects on the correlations between biomass phosphorus content and the relative abundance of desmodesmus or spriogyra to synthesize all the findings partial least squares path modeling pls pm was conducted to illustrate the effects of soil carbon and nutrient availability i e soc and stn contents and ratios i e c p and n p on algal diversity eps content relative abundance of dominant green algae and phosphorus content immobilized in phototrophic biofilms fig 4 in accordance with the pearson correlation analysis tables 1 and 3 fig 3 soc and stn contents had strong direct effects path coefficient 0 49 on algal diversity fig 4a while c p and n p ratios had strong direct effects path coefficient 0 46 on the dominant green algae species fig 4b consequently due to the effects of c p and n p ratios soc and stn contents had weak indirect effects on algal diversity but strong indirect effects on the dominant green algae species however carbon and nitrogen availability and c p and n p ratios had weak direct effects on phosphorus content immobilized in paddy biofilms but more pronounced indirect effects via influencing algal diversity and dominant green algae species with regard to phosphorus immobilization algal diversity dominant green algae species and eps content had strong direct effects with the strongest effects from the dominant green algae species fig 4b besides both algal diversity and the dominant green algae species had indirect effects via their effects on eps production this further suggests that algae especially green algae play key roles in phosphorus immobilization and that species composition is more important than diversity overall variations in soil carbon nutrient availability and nutrient ratios drive the differentiations in algal diversity dominant species composition and eps production associated with differences in phosphorus contents immobilized in the paddy phototrophic biofilms 4 discussion phosphorus immobilization by paddy phototrophic biofilms is a complex process driven by the biofilm community composition as well as the soil physiochemical composition gaiser et al 2004 sola et al 2018 in this study two objectives were addressed with regard to the driving effects of soil carbon and nutrient on the differentiations in community composition and phosphorus immobilization by the paddy phototrophic biofilms identifying the main factors and elucidating the driving process firstly the analyses of paddy phototrophic biofilms at a large spatial scale verified that soc stn and c p and n p ratios are central in shaping the phototrophic biofilm community composition changing the diversity and eps production soc provides essential mass and energy for the metabolism of bacteria and limits the organic mineralization flemming and wingender 2010 heuck et al 2015 although soc is not directly available to algae soc supply triggers the bioavailability of nitrogen phosphorus as well as minerals to algae flemming and wingender 2010 thereby strong and positive correlations were observed between soc and algal diversity and dominant green algae groups table 3 nitrogen is the nutrient in greatest demand by phototrophic biofilms and stn supply limits the mineralization of soc and hence a low c n ratio indicates high mineralization rates henriksen and breland 1999 however the pearson correlation indicated that c n ratio was only positively correlated with the relative abundance of cyanobacteria and navicula table 3 without significant correlations with algal diversity bacterial diversity and the key species in phosphorus immobilization one reason might be that both soc and stn play potent roles in shaping the paddy biofilm community composition table 3 fig 3 thereby a high c n ratio may induce nitrogen limitation but the excessive supply of soc will counteract the negative effects from nitrogen limitation and vice versa fanin et al 2015 considering the effects of soc and stn on paddy biofilm increase in soc and stn contents such as returning rice straw to the paddy field in practice will favor phosphorus immobilization by paddy biofilm compared to soc and stn the effects of stp on phototrophic biofilm community and phosphorus immobilization were much weaker and stp only had significant correlation with algal diversity table 3 this may be due to the low tp contents in paddy soil 0 5 1 2 mg g table 2 and part of it binds with ca fe and al oxides and is not directly available to bacteria and algae álvarez rogel et al 2007 xu et al 2014 furthermore in both phosphorus poor and phosphorus rich soils phosphorus utilization is driven by the microbial need for soc and the dependence on soc weakens the effects of stp heuck et al 2015 however the low stp content may limit the increase in algal diversity and abundance of green algae table 3 which may be caused by the higher subsistence quota of phosphorus of algae than bacteria liu et al 2016 smith and prairie 2004 additionally the weak effects of stp intensified the effects of c p and n p ratios on the phototrophic biofilm community composition and phosphorus immobilization table 3 fig 3 nevertheless the effects of c p and n p ratios were actually triggered by soc and stn fig 4 secondly results from this study suggested that high algal diversity relative abundance of green algae and eps contents were intertwined with high c p and n p ratios triggered by soc and stn green algae and bacteria had contrasting phosphorus immobilization capacity with stronger capacity of green algae than bacteria liu et al 2017 smith and prairie 2004 assimilation is the main phosphorus transformation pathway for green algae and the algal group with higher biomass amount and luxury phosphorus uptake capability have more advantages in assimilating phosphorus than bacteria crimp et al 2017 su et al 2012 studies also reported that high algae species richness can positively affect biomass production especially during the early stages of succession and thereafter increase phosphorus assimilation weis et al 2007 additionally adsorption is another way of phosphorus immobilization by phototrophic biofilms and high eps content favors the formation of binding sites on the surface of algal or bacterial cells and increase the possibility of phosphorus adsorption on the external surface of phototrophic biofilms liu et al 2018 lu et al 2014 thereby it explains the significant correlations between eps and biomass phosphorus content table 1 and the strong direct effects of eps on biomass phosphorus content fig 4 hence conditions suitable for eps production such as soc content of 20 30 mg g will help to increase the phosphorus immobilization by phototrophic biofilms at swi and reduce phosphorus runoff loss fig 3 runoff loss is one of the main phosphorus discharge pathways from paddy fields and phosphorus immobilization in phototrophic biofilm is effective for in situ phosphorus interception our observations during sample collection suggested that the phototrophic biofilm coverage on paddy soil varied between 20 to over 40 with a thickness of 0 5 1 0 cm and density of 30 mg dry weight per cm3 thus in a growth season the biomass of phototrophic biofilms in 1 ha paddy fields may vary between 300 and 1200 kg accordingly the paddy biofilm in 1 ha paddy fields may immobilize 1 to over 10 kg phosphorus therefore in china about 30 000 300 000 t phosphorus discharge from paddy fields can be reduced in each rice growing season in this study the results provide insights into how to regulate soil physiochemical conditions to make full use of the paddy phototrophic biofilms to immobilize phosphorus and retain phosphorus in paddy fields however to thoroughly elucidate the interactive effects of carbon and nutrient stoichiometry on the phosphorus transformation by phototrophic biofilms at swi in paddy fields more practical factors should be also taken into consideration bardgett and wh 2014 loreau et al 2001 wagg et al 2014 for instance the topdressing during the heading stage of rice may change the soil carbon nutrient availability and stoichiometry and consequently the paddy phototrophic biofilm community structure wu et al 2016 thus taking the rice growth stages into consideration in future studies will provide more quantitative insight when studying the functions of paddy phototrophic biofilms in phosphorus transformation at swi ye et al 2013 5 conclusions soil organic carbon soc and total nitrogen stn rather than total phosphorus stp are central in shaping the community composition and driving phosphorus immobilization by phototrophic biofilms at soil water interface swi in paddy fields high c p and n p ratios of soil favor the dominance of green algae in the paddy phototrophic biofilm and increase phosphorus immobilization at swi in paddy fields this offers management tools to improve phosphorus immobilization for example by returning rice straw to the paddy field high algal diversity dominance of green algae and eps production are vital in increasing phosphorus

18444,in this study a modeling framework was developed to simulate biologically active filtration baf headloss buildup in response to organic removal and nitrification this model considered not only the biofilm growth on the baf media but also the particle deposition in the baf bed in addition the model also took temperature effect into consideration it was calibrated and validated with data collected from a pilot scale study used for potable water reuse and a full scale facility used for potable water treatment the model prediction provided insights that biofilm growth rather than particle deposition primarily contributes to the headloss buildup therefore biofilm control is essential for managing headloss buildup and reducing the backwash frequency model simulation indicated that the baf performance in terms of pollutant removal per unit headloss is insensitive to the baf bed depth but can be effectively improved by increasing the media size the partial biofilm coverage of the media is confirmed in this study and was mathematically verified to be a prerequisite for the model fitness graphical abstract image 1 keywords baf granular activated carbon headloss backwash biofilm 1 introduction potable water production from water resource recovery facility effluent can employ two main approaches the first approach relies on membrane technologies namely microfiltration mf reverse osmosis ro ultraviolet uv and advanced oxidation process aop in sequence mf ro uv aop while the second approach minimizes the use of membranes and instead uses a combination of flocculation sedimentation ozonation biologically active filtration or biologically active filter baf granular activated carbon gac and ultraviolet irradiation uv o3 baf gac uv schimmoller and foundation 2014 the o3 baf gac uv approach has recently found significant interest with practitioners because it has the potential to generate high quality potable water at a reduced energy and chemical demand versus the mf ro uv aop approach further o3 baf gac uv configuration does not require management and disposal of brines with high total dissolved solids content schimmoller and foundation 2014 the bafs within the o3 baf gac uv configuration are important to overall treatment train performance as they utilize a combination of physical chemical and biological processes to remove particulate colloidal and soluble organic and nutrient materials bouwer et al 1995 evans et al 2016 ottengraf and van den oever 1983 simpson 2008 although baf is an emerging technique for potable water reuse applications it has been an integral part of potable water treatment processes for decades simpson 2008 in that it provides added benefits to polish residual organics and nutrients dussert and van stone 1994 zhang and huck 1996m reduce disinfectant demand dussert and van stone 1994 and in turn diminish the undesirable disinfection by products formation scholz and martin 1997 also potable water treatment baf might contribute to the elimination of some contaminants of emerging concern as well gerrity et al 2011 scholz and martin 1997 zhang et al 2017 for the bafs to function properly it is necessary for bacteria to colonize the filtration media often spent gac as biofilms sun et al 2018 takeuchi et al 1997 during a filter run growth of biofilm as well as removal of particulate material decrease the porosity of the bafs resulting in headloss buildup across the filters leverenz et al 2009 snowball 2006 headloss buildup in this manner decreases filter run time which can increase the number of filters required as well as backwashing frequency in order to meet production demands amburgey and amirtharajah 2005 moore et al 2001 slavik et al 2013 snowball 2006 increased backwash frequency increases energy consumption of baf adams and clark 1989 simpson 2008 and requires between 2 and 5 of finished water to be reused for backwashing therefore reducing the system productivity vigneswaran et al 1996 reduced porosity can also reduce hydraulic retention time within the filters which can increase the potential of contaminant breakthrough in the baf leverenz et al 2009 snowball 2006 optimization of baf therefore requires a comprehensive understanding of what impacts the physical chemical and biological processes as these processes are intrinsically linked to the overall treatment goals for the bafs significant work has been performed to characterize particulate material removal on abiotic and biotic filters bablon et al 1988 boller and kavanaugh 1995 davidson and friedlander 1978 o melia and ali 1979 payatakes et al 1974 similarly much work has been performed to investigate how to control the biofilm growth on baf media surfaces by manipulating water temperature dissolved oxygen do organic content nutrients and ph brown and lauderdale 2006 nishijima et al 1992 scholz and martin 1998 wang et al 1995 research has also been performed to investigate how chemical disinfectants e g chlorine can be used to manipulate biofilm growth with varying degrees of success simpson 2008 despite these works being performed and the fact that bafs are widely utilized in other aspects of the water industry e g wastewater denitrification odor control scrubbers sizing and optimization of bafs for potable water production currently still rely on industry rules of thumbs and site specific piloting technically mathematical model can be used as an effective tool for baf optimization however few mechanistic modeling studies exist that link physical chemical and biological processes in bafs for instance some previous modeling efforts focused on abiotic gac filters al naseri and abbas 2009 clark 1987 han et al 2008 sperlich et al 2005 other baf modeling work has utilized empirical models mann and stephenson 1997 wang et al 2006 or simplified monod model based on single type of biomass or substrate chang and rittmann 1987 liang and chiang 2007 shim et al 2004 although rittmann et al 2002 and sun et al 2017 included multiple species in their baf model the model did not consider headloss buildup during baf operation and ignored plug flow pattern in bulk liquid to the authors knowledge bi et al 2014 and bernier et al 2014 are the only modeling works known to correlate baf headloss to bacterial growth yet these studies had limited datasets for model verification and also ignored both mass diffusion in the biofilms and particle deposition in the baf bed consequently the suitability of these models for describing baf performance both water quality and hydraulics under dynamic operating conditions is unclear which limits their use as an optimization tool this study seeks to fill this gap by developing a model that accounts for mass diffusion governed biofilm growth kinetics temperature effects transformation of organics and inorganic nitrogen species as well as the particle deposition kinetics the model was calibrated and validated with long term seasonal experimental data from both pilot scale potable water reuse and full scale potable water treatment bafs it was demonstrated that the model could effectively predict water quality and hydraulic performance of bafs used to produce potable water the model was then used to develop some insight into how baf design and operating parameters can impact water quality and headloss development it is envisioned that the approach undertaken in this work can help inform future engineering and scientific endeavors related to improving the design and operation of bafs for maximizing performance and productivity within potable water reuse and potable water treatment bafs 2 materials and methods a combination of experimental and modeling work was performed to develop calibrate and validate the baf model data from a pilot scale baf employed in a potable water reuse application as well as from a full scale baf employed in potable water treatment were used in this work 2 1 model development as shown in fig 1 for mathematical modeling purposes the depth of the baf bed was divided into eight continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs in this study to simulate the plug flow nature of baf in each cstr three compartments were modeled namely bulk liquid biofilms and gac fig 1 the dissolved contaminants are assumed to transport from the bulk liquid compartment to the biofilm and gac compartments in each cstr via mass diffusion in the course of their porous flow deshusses et al 1995 the particulate contaminants can be removed through physical deposition in the course of porous flow through the baf bed height the adsorption of contaminants by baf is ignored from this model because the spent gac media used in baf has exhausted almost all adsorption capacity sun et al 2018 vaidya et al 2019 inside the biofilm compartment the dissolved contaminants are transformed along a diffusion gradient by attached microorganisms growing in the form of biofilms the biofilm model framework is adapted from the work by li et al 2019 which is divided into nine layers to simulate the profiles of biomass growth and substrate utilization along the mass diffusion direction the eight cstrs are connected via bulk liquid flowing through the baf bed between cstrs the biological kinetics model includes four types of substrates three functional bacterial groups as well as the production of extracellular polymeric substances epss the four types of substrates include ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 and biodegradable organic carbon expressed as chemical oxygen demand cod the three functional bacterial groups comprise aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob aerobic nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho the kinetic model was set up with monod type equations commonly used in activated sludge model no 1 henze et al 2000 the stoichiometric matrix expressions and parameter values used in the model are listed in tables s1 s2 and s3 respectively since the bulk liquid in the o3 baf gac uv treatment train is usually supersaturated with dissolved oxygen do 10 mg l 1 do concentration is not considered as a limiting factor for bacterial growth and was excluded from the model for simplification similarly the anoxic denitrification and deammonification were not considered under oxygen saturated conditions nitrification was modeled as a two step process as illustrated in fig s1 which are defined in eqs s15 and s16 presented in table s2 heterotrophic growth in this model is expressed as cod oxidation by oho which is defined in eq s 17 epss are formed during the growth of oho as defined in eq s 21 decay of functional bacterial groups will produce inert biomass xi as shown in table s1 the temperature effect on all rate coefficients used in this study was modeled using the van t hoff arrhenius relationship metcalf et al 1979 it should be noted that both attached growth and suspended growth bacteria were modeled using the same stoichmetric and kinetic coefficients for detailed model development in description of biofilm lifecycle and coverage on baf media surfaces particle deposition in baf bed as well as the headloss buildup as a result of biofilm growth and particle deposition please refer to appendix 2 2 experimental design and datasets 2 2 1 potable water reuse dataset bafs in two pilot scale treatment trains consisting of coagulation flocculation sedimentation o3 baf gac uv were operated at hampton roads sanitation district hrsd york river plant seaford va usa and were used to generate experimental data for model calibration and validation for this study the influent to the pilot system is tertiary treated tn 3 g n m 3 tp 0 3 g p m 3 effluent from an existing full scale biological nitrogen removal treatment plant the basic design and operation information of the two bafs such as dimension flow rates empty bed contact times ebcts and media sizes can be referred to table 1 the biologically activated carbon bac calgon f816 moon township pa usa used in the two bafs was pre exhausted using membrane bioreactor effluent offsite to the point of steady state total organic carbon toc removal 30 toc removal prior to pilot operation vaidya et al 2019 this helped exhausting the adsorptive capacity of the activated carbon media and ensured that toc removal was largely due to biological growth on the media the bafs are backwashed when either the turbidity is above 0 1 ntu or the headloss is above 0 3 m the effluent from gac filtration columns of the pilot is used as the backwash water for the bafs 2 2 2 potable water treatment dataset to verify the general predictability of the model developed in this study the experimental data from one of the bafs in a full scale potable water treatment plant newport news va usa were also used this study table 1 the source water of this potable water treatment plant is reservoir surface water and the upstream processes of baf include coagulation flocculation dissolved air floatation and ozonation the basic design and operational parameters of the full scale bafs such as dimension flow rates ebcts and the media sizes can be referred to table 1 bafs are backwashed when i the turbidity is above 0 1 ntu in two consecutive recorded values at 15 min intervals or ii the headloss is above 2 0 m or the filter run time has reached 120 h the finished water effluent of bafs is used as the backwash water for the bafs 2 3 analytical methods toc dissolved organic carbon doc nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were measured according to the standard methods apha 1998 pilot scale bafs were purchased from intuitech salt lake city ut usa headloss temperature and turbidity were real time monitored by using pressure transmitters ifm efector px3227 malvern pa usa thermometers thermo scientific ph21a1a2 waltham ma usa and turbidimeters hach loveland co usa every 5 min in the pilot scale study these parameters were also monitored in real time in the full scale study but recorded every 15 min the bac samples for fluorescent imaging were collected from the inlet and outlet of the pilot scale potable water reuse bafs and fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde solution immediately following the sample collection then the bac samples were stained with the cell permeable nucleic acid dye syto 9 grand island ny usa for visualizing the microbial distribution the fluorescent images were visualized by using a nikon eclipse e200 microscope melville ny usa 2 4 influent organic composition the model framework uses cod as the basis for tracking organic carbon behavior this approach is consistent with biological process modeling used within the activated sludge field in this work and at many facilities operating bafs toc but not cod is routinely measured to address permit requirements in this work the correlation between toc mg l 1 and cod mg l 1 was expressed by using eq 1 this linear correlation was developed from experimental data utilized in this work fig s2 1 cod 2 91 toc 0 2249 the cod in eq 1 includes both particulate and soluble cod based on the experimental data used for model calibration the differences between toc and doc are less than 5 hence the particulate cod can be approximately regarded as less than 5 of the total cod the removal of particulate cod was ascribed to the particle deposition in this study because the ebct and backwash interval used in this study are assumed to be too short for appreciable particulate cod hydrolysis by bacteria veeken and hamelers 1999 the soluble cod is further categorized into both biodegradable and non biodegradable fractions soluble cod transformation is assumed to be relevant to the biodegradable fraction only in this study because ultimate biodegradability tests were not performed it was necessary to make an assumption of the biodegradable fraction of the soluble cod in this study we assumed that the soluble cod present in the effluent of the baf operating at an ebct of 10 min under summer condition is not readily biodegradable further refinement of this assumption is necessary in future work through direct experimentation and measurement 2 5 model calibration and validation the model was framed with equations in appendix by using matlab 8 6 mathworks inc natick ma parameters without values were regressed by minimizing the sum of squares of the deviations between the measured and the simulated data the model was calibrated and validated by using separate datasets the design and operational parameters as well as the model calibration and validation strategies are summarized in table 1 as shown in table 1 the model calibration of potable water reuse data was performed by using the headloss data from the summer operation of the pilot baf operated at 5 min ebct out of over 250 000 total data points collected 8 314 data points of headloss and turbidity within 12 consecutive days during summer were used to regress seven unknown parameters listed in table s3 to calibrate the model in order to validate the accuracy of the calibrated model and determine its sensitivity to temperature and ebct effects model validation was performed using three separate datasets the first validation effort was performed by using headloss data from the summer operation of the potable water reuse pilot baf operated at 10 min ebct the second validation effort used headloss data from winter operation of a baf operated at 5 min ebct the third validation effort used water quality data from summer and winter operation and focused on matching toc removal and nitrogen turnover along the baf bed depth as well as in the effluent from the baf the model was also calibrated and validated by using data collected from the full scale baf treatment train from the potable water treatment plant a similar calibration and validation procedure was performed as described above and summarized in table 1 briefly data collected during 11 consecutive summer days were used for model calibration while 16 consecutive days of winter headloss profiles were utilized for model validation in the full scale facility only influent and effluent contaminant concentrations were available for use 3 results 3 1 model prediction of headloss is sensitive to the biofilm coverage of baf media calibration of the model required regression fitting of seven parameters linked to the biofilm component biofilm thickness after backwash biofilm detachment rate biofilm coverage factor particle deposition component initial filtration coefficient two empirical parameters and headloss component sphericity of baf media as shown in table s3 once these parameters were regressed the model predicted headloss profiles and turbidity removal very well for the 5 min ebct potable water reuse pilot data r2 0 96 fig 2 a and b when applied to the full scale potable water treatment baf the calibrated model also described summer headloss data similarly well r2 0 94 fig 2e it is noteworthy that out of the seven regressed parameters in table s3 four share exactly the same values between the potable water reuse pilot scale and the potable water treatment full scale model while the remaining three namely biofilm thickness after backwash biofilm coverage factor and biofilm detachment rate are slightly different table s3 which indicates there is no fundamental difference between the bafs used for potable water reuse and potable water treatment during calibration it was initially assumed that the biofilm coverage factor was equal to 100 this was consistent with prior work documented by shen et al 2012 however assuming 100 coverage resulted in the model overpredicting the rate of headloss development versus the experimental data profiles it was necessary to reduce the biofilm coverage factor to 30 and 45 for the potable water reuse pilot and the potable water treatment full scale calibration efforts respectively to confirm this hypothesis baf media from the inlet and outlet of the potable water reuse pilot baf was microscopically visualized the fluorescent images in fig 3 revealed that those baf media were indeed partially covered by biofilms which is in line with the model prediction in this works and supports a previous report by weber et al 1978 further it can be seen from fig 3 that biofilm coverage was higher at the bafs inlet than at the outlet this further supports the biofilm thickness profiles predicted by the model and illustrated in fig 4 3 2 model prediction of the ebct and temperature effects on headloss toc and nitrogen profiles to validate the model prediction the calibrated models were then used to predict headloss development and water quality for i winter operation of the pilot baf at 5 min ebct and ii summer operation of a baf operated at 10 min ebct fig 2c and d no further adjustments were made to regressed values from the calibration effort in table s3 results indicate that the model calibrated to the potable water reuse pilot readily predicts both headloss development in the baf r2 0 96 and 0 92 the model calibrated using the full scale baf was also validated by using the winter headloss data again very good agreement was reached between the model prediction and actual experimental data in fig 2f r2 0 95 the good fitness in fig 2c d and f confirms that the calibrated models are effective for predicting headloss development at different ebcts and temperatures the model outputs of organic and nutrient removal were also compared with the toc and nitrogen transformation profiles measured along the baf bed depth at different ebcts for the potable water reuse pilot in fig 4 it can be seen that the model predicted summer toc and nutrient profiles fit the experimental data very well in fig 4a and b e g r2 for toc nh4 and no3 are 0 83 0 85 and 0 81 when ebct 5 min and 0 96 0 91 and 0 89 when ebct 10 min respectively for winter data both predicted and measured toc and nh4 data matched well in fig 4c r2 for toc and nh4 are 0 70 and 0 99 respectively however predicted profiles of no2 and no3 did not match for the winter condition this is because no2 accumulation was observed in the potable water reuse pilot fig 4c however the current model did not adequately describe this transient nitrite accumulation despite this limitation it was determined that the current models were suitable for examining how design and operational parameters may impact baf performance as related to headloss development as well as toc and nh4 removal 4 discussion the calibrated and validated models were used to investigate how design and operational parameters can be optimized to enhance baf performance as related to headloss development organics cod or toc and nh4 removal for this investigation the model influent was set as following according to the average influent composition of the potable water reuse pilot bafs in hrsd total soluble organics 15 48 mg l 1 cod 5 24 mg l 1 toc biodegradable soluble organics 4 49 mg l 1 cod nh4 1 05 mg n l 1 no2 0 01 mg n l 1 no3 1 56 mg n l 1 turbidity 0 5 ntu except section 4 1 a baf surface loading rate of 220 m3 d 1 m 2 and the temperature of 25 c was adhered to in the optimization simulations 4 1 biofilm growth is a significant contributor to headloss development in bafs treating low turbidity water it is known that the headloss buildup can be attributed to both biofilm growth and particle deposition as described in eqs s9 to s11 moore et al 2001 shen et al 2012 simpson 2008 however the respective contribution of these two factors is still unknown according to eq s 9 even if all the influent particles corresponding to a turbidity of 0 5 ntu were trapped by the baf bed as reflected in the specific deposit σ i they can only lower the bed porosity by 0 5 this suggests that particle deposition is likely a minor contributor to headloss in the potable water reuse pilot and potable water treatment full scale bafs investigated in this study we hypothesize that this phenomenon is attributed to the low influent turbidity of the potable reuse water and potable water to validate this hypothesis the validated model was used to predict the contribution of biofilm growth and particle deposition to the headloss at different influent turbidities after 72 hour of baf run time as described in fig 5 results indicate that particle deposition can contribute between 1 and 15 of the overall headloss development when influent turbidity ranges from 0 5 to 15 ntu this seems to suggest that biofilm growth can be a significant contributor to headloss development in baf especially when the influent turbidity is low fig 5 4 2 effects of the baf media size and bed depth on baf performance media size and bed depth are two parameters that can be manipulated in the design of a baf the typical effective media size is usually between 0 9 and 1 4 mm for potable water treatment page et al 2006 and from 1 5 to 6 mm for potable water reuse treatment and wastewater treatment moore et al 2001 the typical baf bed depth is usually from 0 9 to 1 5 m thus effects of these two parameters on some important indicators of the baf performance were investigated 4 2 1 effect of the baf media size on headloss buildup as shown in fig 6 a headloss will drop over 90 after 72 hour baf run time as the baf media size increases from 0 9 to 2 8 mm this indicates that using larger baf media can help slow headloss development the experimental results from the study by moore et al 2001 support this model prediction as they measured that when the organic loading rate is 8 1 kg cod m 3 d 1 the headloss development in small medium 1 5 3 5 mm filter is two times faster than that in large medium 2 5 4 5 mm filter this phenomenon can be explained by the effect of baf media size on empty bed porosity and biofilm thickness according to eq s 10 the empty bed porosity will increase as the baf media size increase and thus the headloss will decrease accordingly eq s 11 as shown in fig 7 the surface area available for biofilm coverage namely af should decrease as the baf media size increases this should increase influent substrate availability namely biofilm surface loading rate a higher biofilm surface loading rate may then result in faster development of biofilm thickness d l d t eq s 4 interestingly simulations indicate that the growth rate of total biofilm volume in the filtration bed d l d t a f decreases as the baf media size increases this is because the surface area available for biofilm coverage af decreases more rapidly than the increase of biofilm thickness d l d t this helps to explain the headloss reduction observed as media size increase fig 6a 4 2 2 effect of the baf bed depth on headloss buildup results in fig 6a indicated that increasing baf bed depth will only slightly increase the headloss for example the headloss only increases from 2 to 2 5 m after 72 hour baf run time as baf bed depth increases from 0 9 to 1 5 m when 1 4 mm baf media is used this phenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that biofilms primarily grow at the inlet side of the baf i e top layers of the baf media as visualized in fig 3 and model predicted in fig 4 for this reason further increasing bed depth of the baf bed has very limited effect on the headloss due to the lack of biofilm growth in the deeper sections of the bed fig 6a 4 2 3 effects of baf media size and bed depth on organic removal and nitrification as shown in fig 6b increasing baf media size tends to decrease the efficiencies of cod removal δcod and ammonium removal δnh4 n which concurs with the experimental observation by moore et al 2001 a primary reason lies in the reduction of biofilm surface area af as baf media size increases this acts to reduce the biological reaction rates as shown in fig 7 the increases in the δcod and δnh4 n with greater baf bed depth can also be seen from fig 6b and have been observed in practice by numerous prior studies lechevallier et al 1992 mcdowell et al 2006 when examining impacts on nitrification it can be seen that increasing baf bed depth beyond 1 5 m did not appear to further increase δnh4 n under the loading conditions used in this study this finding is important in that it implies that nitrifiers aob or nob can outcompete ohos in water treated for potable water reuse which usually comes with extremely low cod n ratios e g 1 7 in this study 4 2 4 balancing contaminant removal and headloss buildup in practical baf operation it is desired to achieve high contaminant removal with low headloss thus the cod and ammonia removal per unit headloss namely δcod δheadloss and δnh4 n δheadloss are adopted in this study to evaluate baf performance relative to changes in operational and design parameters higher ratios indicate superior performance as shown in fig 6c both δcod δheadloss and δnh4 n δheadloss increase as the baf media size increase meanwhile it also can be seen that neither of these two ratios is highly sensitive to the baf bed depth the significant increase of δcod δheadloss and δnh4 n δheadloss in response to the baf media size increase can be attributed to the fact that biological performance of baf does not deteriorate too much when the media size increases 4 3 implications on baf design it is believed that finding the optimal baf media size is the key to achieve qualified effluent standard at minimized operating cost moore et al 2001 therefore a baf should be capable of removing particulates i e turbidity and contaminants cod nh4 etc while minimizing the headloss the model simulations in this study provide theoretical evidence demonstrating that increasing baf media size may be a very effective strategy to improve the baf performance fig 6c however according to fig 6b as the baf media size increase there is still deterioration in cod and nh4 removal due to the reduction of available surface area for biofilm in addition larger size baf media may raise the concern of possible turbidity removal failure as well for instance moore et al 2001 found that when baf media size range increased from 1 5 3 5 mm to 2 5 4 5 mm turbidity suspended particle removal decreased from 92 to 85 to accommodate for lower removal of these constituents increasing baf bed depth should be considered as a strategy when using larger media in bafs as documented in fig 5 the source waters in this study had low influent turbidity however if the influent turbidity was higher the deterioration of effluent turbidity could have been distinct once again to accommodate for lower removal of turbidity increasing baf bed depth should be considered the number that is used to avoid a breakthrough of a particle in baf is expressed as the ratio of baf bed depth l in mm to effective size of media d in mm namely l d ratio while l d ratio is not an absolute concept it has been derived based on the baf design and operation logsdon 2008 increasing the media depth while keeping the media size constant increases the l d ratio therefore a particle is more likely to be captured by the media in general an l d ratio of 1 200 or greater is recommended logsdon 2008 the l d ratio for the system investigated in this study are in the range of 860 to 2 600 further work is certainly needed to validate the model whether these assumptions are appropriate for bafs treating high turbidity water 5 conclusions a baf modeling framework established in this study can be calibrated and validated to describe headloss buildup as a result of both biofilm growth and particle deposition in response to contaminant removal the model prediction turned out to be sensitive to the biofilm coverage of baf media and revealed that the particle deposition makes marginal contribution to the headloss in potable reuse water treatment and potable water treatment when influent turbidity is low increasing the baf media size appears to be an effective strategy for reducing headloss buildup while minimally impacting contaminant removal the slight deterioration of contaminant removal as a result of larger baf media size increase can be compensated by a moderate increase in baf bed depth

18444,in this study a modeling framework was developed to simulate biologically active filtration baf headloss buildup in response to organic removal and nitrification this model considered not only the biofilm growth on the baf media but also the particle deposition in the baf bed in addition the model also took temperature effect into consideration it was calibrated and validated with data collected from a pilot scale study used for potable water reuse and a full scale facility used for potable water treatment the model prediction provided insights that biofilm growth rather than particle deposition primarily contributes to the headloss buildup therefore biofilm control is essential for managing headloss buildup and reducing the backwash frequency model simulation indicated that the baf performance in terms of pollutant removal per unit headloss is insensitive to the baf bed depth but can be effectively improved by increasing the media size the partial biofilm coverage of the media is confirmed in this study and was mathematically verified to be a prerequisite for the model fitness graphical abstract image 1 keywords baf granular activated carbon headloss backwash biofilm 1 introduction potable water production from water resource recovery facility effluent can employ two main approaches the first approach relies on membrane technologies namely microfiltration mf reverse osmosis ro ultraviolet uv and advanced oxidation process aop in sequence mf ro uv aop while the second approach minimizes the use of membranes and instead uses a combination of flocculation sedimentation ozonation biologically active filtration or biologically active filter baf granular activated carbon gac and ultraviolet irradiation uv o3 baf gac uv schimmoller and foundation 2014 the o3 baf gac uv approach has recently found significant interest with practitioners because it has the potential to generate high quality potable water at a reduced energy and chemical demand versus the mf ro uv aop approach further o3 baf gac uv configuration does not require management and disposal of brines with high total dissolved solids content schimmoller and foundation 2014 the bafs within the o3 baf gac uv configuration are important to overall treatment train performance as they utilize a combination of physical chemical and biological processes to remove particulate colloidal and soluble organic and nutrient materials bouwer et al 1995 evans et al 2016 ottengraf and van den oever 1983 simpson 2008 although baf is an emerging technique for potable water reuse applications it has been an integral part of potable water treatment processes for decades simpson 2008 in that it provides added benefits to polish residual organics and nutrients dussert and van stone 1994 zhang and huck 1996m reduce disinfectant demand dussert and van stone 1994 and in turn diminish the undesirable disinfection by products formation scholz and martin 1997 also potable water treatment baf might contribute to the elimination of some contaminants of emerging concern as well gerrity et al 2011 scholz and martin 1997 zhang et al 2017 for the bafs to function properly it is necessary for bacteria to colonize the filtration media often spent gac as biofilms sun et al 2018 takeuchi et al 1997 during a filter run growth of biofilm as well as removal of particulate material decrease the porosity of the bafs resulting in headloss buildup across the filters leverenz et al 2009 snowball 2006 headloss buildup in this manner decreases filter run time which can increase the number of filters required as well as backwashing frequency in order to meet production demands amburgey and amirtharajah 2005 moore et al 2001 slavik et al 2013 snowball 2006 increased backwash frequency increases energy consumption of baf adams and clark 1989 simpson 2008 and requires between 2 and 5 of finished water to be reused for backwashing therefore reducing the system productivity vigneswaran et al 1996 reduced porosity can also reduce hydraulic retention time within the filters which can increase the potential of contaminant breakthrough in the baf leverenz et al 2009 snowball 2006 optimization of baf therefore requires a comprehensive understanding of what impacts the physical chemical and biological processes as these processes are intrinsically linked to the overall treatment goals for the bafs significant work has been performed to characterize particulate material removal on abiotic and biotic filters bablon et al 1988 boller and kavanaugh 1995 davidson and friedlander 1978 o melia and ali 1979 payatakes et al 1974 similarly much work has been performed to investigate how to control the biofilm growth on baf media surfaces by manipulating water temperature dissolved oxygen do organic content nutrients and ph brown and lauderdale 2006 nishijima et al 1992 scholz and martin 1998 wang et al 1995 research has also been performed to investigate how chemical disinfectants e g chlorine can be used to manipulate biofilm growth with varying degrees of success simpson 2008 despite these works being performed and the fact that bafs are widely utilized in other aspects of the water industry e g wastewater denitrification odor control scrubbers sizing and optimization of bafs for potable water production currently still rely on industry rules of thumbs and site specific piloting technically mathematical model can be used as an effective tool for baf optimization however few mechanistic modeling studies exist that link physical chemical and biological processes in bafs for instance some previous modeling efforts focused on abiotic gac filters al naseri and abbas 2009 clark 1987 han et al 2008 sperlich et al 2005 other baf modeling work has utilized empirical models mann and stephenson 1997 wang et al 2006 or simplified monod model based on single type of biomass or substrate chang and rittmann 1987 liang and chiang 2007 shim et al 2004 although rittmann et al 2002 and sun et al 2017 included multiple species in their baf model the model did not consider headloss buildup during baf operation and ignored plug flow pattern in bulk liquid to the authors knowledge bi et al 2014 and bernier et al 2014 are the only modeling works known to correlate baf headloss to bacterial growth yet these studies had limited datasets for model verification and also ignored both mass diffusion in the biofilms and particle deposition in the baf bed consequently the suitability of these models for describing baf performance both water quality and hydraulics under dynamic operating conditions is unclear which limits their use as an optimization tool this study seeks to fill this gap by developing a model that accounts for mass diffusion governed biofilm growth kinetics temperature effects transformation of organics and inorganic nitrogen species as well as the particle deposition kinetics the model was calibrated and validated with long term seasonal experimental data from both pilot scale potable water reuse and full scale potable water treatment bafs it was demonstrated that the model could effectively predict water quality and hydraulic performance of bafs used to produce potable water the model was then used to develop some insight into how baf design and operating parameters can impact water quality and headloss development it is envisioned that the approach undertaken in this work can help inform future engineering and scientific endeavors related to improving the design and operation of bafs for maximizing performance and productivity within potable water reuse and potable water treatment bafs 2 materials and methods a combination of experimental and modeling work was performed to develop calibrate and validate the baf model data from a pilot scale baf employed in a potable water reuse application as well as from a full scale baf employed in potable water treatment were used in this work 2 1 model development as shown in fig 1 for mathematical modeling purposes the depth of the baf bed was divided into eight continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs in this study to simulate the plug flow nature of baf in each cstr three compartments were modeled namely bulk liquid biofilms and gac fig 1 the dissolved contaminants are assumed to transport from the bulk liquid compartment to the biofilm and gac compartments in each cstr via mass diffusion in the course of their porous flow deshusses et al 1995 the particulate contaminants can be removed through physical deposition in the course of porous flow through the baf bed height the adsorption of contaminants by baf is ignored from this model because the spent gac media used in baf has exhausted almost all adsorption capacity sun et al 2018 vaidya et al 2019 inside the biofilm compartment the dissolved contaminants are transformed along a diffusion gradient by attached microorganisms growing in the form of biofilms the biofilm model framework is adapted from the work by li et al 2019 which is divided into nine layers to simulate the profiles of biomass growth and substrate utilization along the mass diffusion direction the eight cstrs are connected via bulk liquid flowing through the baf bed between cstrs the biological kinetics model includes four types of substrates three functional bacterial groups as well as the production of extracellular polymeric substances epss the four types of substrates include ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 nitrate no3 and biodegradable organic carbon expressed as chemical oxygen demand cod the three functional bacterial groups comprise aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob aerobic nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho the kinetic model was set up with monod type equations commonly used in activated sludge model no 1 henze et al 2000 the stoichiometric matrix expressions and parameter values used in the model are listed in tables s1 s2 and s3 respectively since the bulk liquid in the o3 baf gac uv treatment train is usually supersaturated with dissolved oxygen do 10 mg l 1 do concentration is not considered as a limiting factor for bacterial growth and was excluded from the model for simplification similarly the anoxic denitrification and deammonification were not considered under oxygen saturated conditions nitrification was modeled as a two step process as illustrated in fig s1 which are defined in eqs s15 and s16 presented in table s2 heterotrophic growth in this model is expressed as cod oxidation by oho which is defined in eq s 17 epss are formed during the growth of oho as defined in eq s 21 decay of functional bacterial groups will produce inert biomass xi as shown in table s1 the temperature effect on all rate coefficients used in this study was modeled using the van t hoff arrhenius relationship metcalf et al 1979 it should be noted that both attached growth and suspended growth bacteria were modeled using the same stoichmetric and kinetic coefficients for detailed model development in description of biofilm lifecycle and coverage on baf media surfaces particle deposition in baf bed as well as the headloss buildup as a result of biofilm growth and particle deposition please refer to appendix 2 2 experimental design and datasets 2 2 1 potable water reuse dataset bafs in two pilot scale treatment trains consisting of coagulation flocculation sedimentation o3 baf gac uv were operated at hampton roads sanitation district hrsd york river plant seaford va usa and were used to generate experimental data for model calibration and validation for this study the influent to the pilot system is tertiary treated tn 3 g n m 3 tp 0 3 g p m 3 effluent from an existing full scale biological nitrogen removal treatment plant the basic design and operation information of the two bafs such as dimension flow rates empty bed contact times ebcts and media sizes can be referred to table 1 the biologically activated carbon bac calgon f816 moon township pa usa used in the two bafs was pre exhausted using membrane bioreactor effluent offsite to the point of steady state total organic carbon toc removal 30 toc removal prior to pilot operation vaidya et al 2019 this helped exhausting the adsorptive capacity of the activated carbon media and ensured that toc removal was largely due to biological growth on the media the bafs are backwashed when either the turbidity is above 0 1 ntu or the headloss is above 0 3 m the effluent from gac filtration columns of the pilot is used as the backwash water for the bafs 2 2 2 potable water treatment dataset to verify the general predictability of the model developed in this study the experimental data from one of the bafs in a full scale potable water treatment plant newport news va usa were also used this study table 1 the source water of this potable water treatment plant is reservoir surface water and the upstream processes of baf include coagulation flocculation dissolved air floatation and ozonation the basic design and operational parameters of the full scale bafs such as dimension flow rates ebcts and the media sizes can be referred to table 1 bafs are backwashed when i the turbidity is above 0 1 ntu in two consecutive recorded values at 15 min intervals or ii the headloss is above 2 0 m or the filter run time has reached 120 h the finished water effluent of bafs is used as the backwash water for the bafs 2 3 analytical methods toc dissolved organic carbon doc nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were measured according to the standard methods apha 1998 pilot scale bafs were purchased from intuitech salt lake city ut usa headloss temperature and turbidity were real time monitored by using pressure transmitters ifm efector px3227 malvern pa usa thermometers thermo scientific ph21a1a2 waltham ma usa and turbidimeters hach loveland co usa every 5 min in the pilot scale study these parameters were also monitored in real time in the full scale study but recorded every 15 min the bac samples for fluorescent imaging were collected from the inlet and outlet of the pilot scale potable water reuse bafs and fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde solution immediately following the sample collection then the bac samples were stained with the cell permeable nucleic acid dye syto 9 grand island ny usa for visualizing the microbial distribution the fluorescent images were visualized by using a nikon eclipse e200 microscope melville ny usa 2 4 influent organic composition the model framework uses cod as the basis for tracking organic carbon behavior this approach is consistent with biological process modeling used within the activated sludge field in this work and at many facilities operating bafs toc but not cod is routinely measured to address permit requirements in this work the correlation between toc mg l 1 and cod mg l 1 was expressed by using eq 1 this linear correlation was developed from experimental data utilized in this work fig s2 1 cod 2 91 toc 0 2249 the cod in eq 1 includes both particulate and soluble cod based on the experimental data used for model calibration the differences between toc and doc are less than 5 hence the particulate cod can be approximately regarded as less than 5 of the total cod the removal of particulate cod was ascribed to the particle deposition in this study because the ebct and backwash interval used in this study are assumed to be too short for appreciable particulate cod hydrolysis by bacteria veeken and hamelers 1999 the soluble cod is further categorized into both biodegradable and non biodegradable fractions soluble cod transformation is assumed to be relevant to the biodegradable fraction only in this study because ultimate biodegradability tests were not performed it was necessary to make an assumption of the biodegradable fraction of the soluble cod in this study we assumed that the soluble cod present in the effluent of the baf operating at an ebct of 10 min under summer condition is not readily biodegradable further refinement of this assumption is necessary in future work through direct experimentation and measurement 2 5 model calibration and validation the model was framed with equations in appendix by using matlab 8 6 mathworks inc natick ma parameters without values were regressed by minimizing the sum of squares of the deviations between the measured and the simulated data the model was calibrated and validated by using separate datasets the design and operational parameters as well as the model calibration and validation strategies are summarized in table 1 as shown in table 1 the model calibration of potable water reuse data was performed by using the headloss data from the summer operation of the pilot baf operated at 5 min ebct out of over 250 000 total data points collected 8 314 data points of headloss and turbidity within 12 consecutive days during summer were used to regress seven unknown parameters listed in table s3 to calibrate the model in order to validate the accuracy of the calibrated model and determine its sensitivity to temperature and ebct effects model validation was performed using three separate datasets the first validation effort was performed by using headloss data from the summer operation of the potable water reuse pilot baf operated at 10 min ebct the second validation effort used headloss data from winter operation of a baf operated at 5 min ebct the third validation effort used water quality data from summer and winter operation and focused on matching toc removal and nitrogen turnover along the baf bed depth as well as in the effluent from the baf the model was also calibrated and validated by using data collected from the full scale baf treatment train from the potable water treatment plant a similar calibration and validation procedure was performed as described above and summarized in table 1 briefly data collected during 11 consecutive summer days were used for model calibration while 16 consecutive days of winter headloss profiles were utilized for model validation in the full scale facility only influent and effluent contaminant concentrations were available for use 3 results 3 1 model prediction of headloss is sensitive to the biofilm coverage of baf media calibration of the model required regression fitting of seven parameters linked to the biofilm component biofilm thickness after backwash biofilm detachment rate biofilm coverage factor particle deposition component initial filtration coefficient two empirical parameters and headloss component sphericity of baf media as shown in table s3 once these parameters were regressed the model predicted headloss profiles and turbidity removal very well for the 5 min ebct potable water reuse pilot data r2 0 96 fig 2 a and b when applied to the full scale potable water treatment baf the calibrated model also described summer headloss data similarly well r2 0 94 fig 2e it is noteworthy that out of the seven regressed parameters in table s3 four share exactly the same values between the potable water reuse pilot scale and the potable water treatment full scale model while the remaining three namely biofilm thickness after backwash biofilm coverage factor and biofilm detachment rate are slightly different table s3 which indicates there is no fundamental difference between the bafs used for potable water reuse and potable water treatment during calibration it was initially assumed that the biofilm coverage factor was equal to 100 this was consistent with prior work documented by shen et al 2012 however assuming 100 coverage resulted in the model overpredicting the rate of headloss development versus the experimental data profiles it was necessary to reduce the biofilm coverage factor to 30 and 45 for the potable water reuse pilot and the potable water treatment full scale calibration efforts respectively to confirm this hypothesis baf media from the inlet and outlet of the potable water reuse pilot baf was microscopically visualized the fluorescent images in fig 3 revealed that those baf media were indeed partially covered by biofilms which is in line with the model prediction in this works and supports a previous report by weber et al 1978 further it can be seen from fig 3 that biofilm coverage was higher at the bafs inlet than at the outlet this further supports the biofilm thickness profiles predicted by the model and illustrated in fig 4 3 2 model prediction of the ebct and temperature effects on headloss toc and nitrogen profiles to validate the model prediction the calibrated models were then used to predict headloss development and water quality for i winter operation of the pilot baf at 5 min ebct and ii summer operation of a baf operated at 10 min ebct fig 2c and d no further adjustments were made to regressed values from the calibration effort in table s3 results indicate that the model calibrated to the potable water reuse pilot readily predicts both headloss development in the baf r2 0 96 and 0 92 the model calibrated using the full scale baf was also validated by using the winter headloss data again very good agreement was reached between the model prediction and actual experimental data in fig 2f r2 0 95 the good fitness in fig 2c d and f confirms that the calibrated models are effective for predicting headloss development at different ebcts and temperatures the model outputs of organic and nutrient removal were also compared with the toc and nitrogen transformation profiles measured along the baf bed depth at different ebcts for the potable water reuse pilot in fig 4 it can be seen that the model predicted summer toc and nutrient profiles fit the experimental data very well in fig 4a and b e g r2 for toc nh4 and no3 are 0 83 0 85 and 0 81 when ebct 5 min and 0 96 0 91 and 0 89 when ebct 10 min respectively for winter data both predicted and measured toc and nh4 data matched well in fig 4c r2 for toc and nh4 are 0 70 and 0 99 respectively however predicted profiles of no2 and no3 did not match for the winter condition this is because no2 accumulation was observed in the potable water reuse pilot fig 4c however the current model did not adequately describe this transient nitrite accumulation despite this limitation it was determined that the current models were suitable for examining how design and operational parameters may impact baf performance as related to headloss development as well as toc and nh4 removal 4 discussion the calibrated and validated models were used to investigate how design and operational parameters can be optimized to enhance baf performance as related to headloss development organics cod or toc and nh4 removal for this investigation the model influent was set as following according to the average influent composition of the potable water reuse pilot bafs in hrsd total soluble organics 15 48 mg l 1 cod 5 24 mg l 1 toc biodegradable soluble organics 4 49 mg l 1 cod nh4 1 05 mg n l 1 no2 0 01 mg n l 1 no3 1 56 mg n l 1 turbidity 0 5 ntu except section 4 1 a baf surface loading rate of 220 m3 d 1 m 2 and the temperature of 25 c was adhered to in the optimization simulations 4 1 biofilm growth is a significant contributor to headloss development in bafs treating low turbidity water it is known that the headloss buildup can be attributed to both biofilm growth and particle deposition as described in eqs s9 to s11 moore et al 2001 shen et al 2012 simpson 2008 however the respective contribution of these two factors is still unknown according to eq s 9 even if all the influent particles corresponding to a turbidity of 0 5 ntu were trapped by the baf bed as reflected in the specific deposit σ i they can only lower the bed porosity by 0 5 this suggests that particle deposition is likely a minor contributor to headloss in the potable water reuse pilot and potable water treatment full scale bafs investigated in this study we hypothesize that this phenomenon is attributed to the low influent turbidity of the potable reuse water and potable water to validate this hypothesis the validated model was used to predict the contribution of biofilm growth and particle deposition to the headloss at different influent turbidities after 72 hour of baf run time as described in fig 5 results indicate that particle deposition can contribute between 1 and 15 of the overall headloss development when influent turbidity ranges from 0 5 to 15 ntu this seems to suggest that biofilm growth can be a significant contributor to headloss development in baf especially when the influent turbidity is low fig 5 4 2 effects of the baf media size and bed depth on baf performance media size and bed depth are two parameters that can be manipulated in the design of a baf the typical effective media size is usually between 0 9 and 1 4 mm for potable water treatment page et al 2006 and from 1 5 to 6 mm for potable water reuse treatment and wastewater treatment moore et al 2001 the typical baf bed depth is usually from 0 9 to 1 5 m thus effects of these two parameters on some important indicators of the baf performance were investigated 4 2 1 effect of the baf media size on headloss buildup as shown in fig 6 a headloss will drop over 90 after 72 hour baf run time as the baf media size increases from 0 9 to 2 8 mm this indicates that using larger baf media can help slow headloss development the experimental results from the study by moore et al 2001 support this model prediction as they measured that when the organic loading rate is 8 1 kg cod m 3 d 1 the headloss development in small medium 1 5 3 5 mm filter is two times faster than that in large medium 2 5 4 5 mm filter this phenomenon can be explained by the effect of baf media size on empty bed porosity and biofilm thickness according to eq s 10 the empty bed porosity will increase as the baf media size increase and thus the headloss will decrease accordingly eq s 11 as shown in fig 7 the surface area available for biofilm coverage namely af should decrease as the baf media size increases this should increase influent substrate availability namely biofilm surface loading rate a higher biofilm surface loading rate may then result in faster development of biofilm thickness d l d t eq s 4 interestingly simulations indicate that the growth rate of total biofilm volume in the filtration bed d l d t a f decreases as the baf media size increases this is because the surface area available for biofilm coverage af decreases more rapidly than the increase of biofilm thickness d l d t this helps to explain the headloss reduction observed as media size increase fig 6a 4 2 2 effect of the baf bed depth on headloss buildup results in fig 6a indicated that increasing baf bed depth will only slightly increase the headloss for example the headloss only increases from 2 to 2 5 m after 72 hour baf run time as baf bed depth increases from 0 9 to 1 5 m when 1 4 mm baf media is used this phenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that biofilms primarily grow at the inlet side of the baf i e top layers of the baf media as visualized in fig 3 and model predicted in fig 4 for this reason further increasing bed depth of the baf bed has very limited effect on the headloss due to the lack of biofilm growth in the deeper sections of the bed fig 6a 4 2 3 effects of baf media size and bed depth on organic removal and nitrification as shown in fig 6b increasing baf media size tends to decrease the efficiencies of cod removal δcod and ammonium removal δnh4 n which concurs with the experimental observation by moore et al 2001 a primary reason lies in the reduction of biofilm surface area af as baf media size increases this acts to reduce the biological reaction rates as shown in fig 7 the increases in the δcod and δnh4 n with greater baf bed depth can also be seen from fig 6b and have been observed in practice by numerous prior studies lechevallier et al 1992 mcdowell et al 2006 when examining impacts on nitrification it can be seen that increasing baf bed depth beyond 1 5 m did not appear to further increase δnh4 n under the loading conditions used in this study this finding is important in that it implies that nitrifiers aob or nob can outcompete ohos in water treated for potable water reuse which usually comes with extremely low cod n ratios e g 1 7 in this study 4 2 4 balancing contaminant removal and headloss buildup in practical baf operation it is desired to achieve high contaminant removal with low headloss thus the cod and ammonia removal per unit headloss namely δcod δheadloss and δnh4 n δheadloss are adopted in this study to evaluate baf performance relative to changes in operational and design parameters higher ratios indicate superior performance as shown in fig 6c both δcod δheadloss and δnh4 n δheadloss increase as the baf media size increase meanwhile it also can be seen that neither of these two ratios is highly sensitive to the baf bed depth the significant increase of δcod δheadloss and δnh4 n δheadloss in response to the baf media size increase can be attributed to the fact that biological performance of baf does not deteriorate too much when the media size increases 4 3 implications on baf design it is believed that finding the optimal baf media size is the key to achieve qualified effluent standard at minimized operating cost moore et al 2001 therefore a baf should be capable of removing particulates i e turbidity and contaminants cod nh4 etc while minimizing the headloss the model simulations in this study provide theoretical evidence demonstrating that increasing baf media size may be a very effective strategy to improve the baf performance fig 6c however according to fig 6b as the baf media size increase there is still deterioration in cod and nh4 removal due to the reduction of available surface area for biofilm in addition larger size baf media may raise the concern of possible turbidity removal failure as well for instance moore et al 2001 found that when baf media size range increased from 1 5 3 5 mm to 2 5 4 5 mm turbidity suspended particle removal decreased from 92 to 85 to accommodate for lower removal of these constituents increasing baf bed depth should be considered as a strategy when using larger media in bafs as documented in fig 5 the source waters in this study had low influent turbidity however if the influent turbidity was higher the deterioration of effluent turbidity could have been distinct once again to accommodate for lower removal of turbidity increasing baf bed depth should be considered the number that is used to avoid a breakthrough of a particle in baf is expressed as the ratio of baf bed depth l in mm to effective size of media d in mm namely l d ratio while l d ratio is not an absolute concept it has been derived based on the baf design and operation logsdon 2008 increasing the media depth while keeping the media size constant increases the l d ratio therefore a particle is more likely to be captured by the media in general an l d ratio of 1 200 or greater is recommended logsdon 2008 the l d ratio for the system investigated in this study are in the range of 860 to 2 600 further work is certainly needed to validate the model whether these assumptions are appropriate for bafs treating high turbidity water 5 conclusions a baf modeling framework established in this study can be calibrated and validated to describe headloss buildup as a result of both biofilm growth and particle deposition in response to contaminant removal the model prediction turned out to be sensitive to the biofilm coverage of baf media and revealed that the particle deposition makes marginal contribution to the headloss in potable reuse water treatment and potable water treatment when influent turbidity is low increasing the baf media size appears to be an effective strategy for reducing headloss buildup while minimally impacting contaminant removal the slight deterioration of contaminant removal as a result of larger baf media size increase can be compensated by a moderate increase in baf bed depth
