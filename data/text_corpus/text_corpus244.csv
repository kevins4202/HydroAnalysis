1220,the particle size distribution psd of soil is an important factor in determining heavy metal content mobility and transformation one method of describing the soil psd is applying fractal theory this study explored the use of fractal theory to characterize soil psd in the alluvial proluvial fan located downstream of the yangshuo lead zinc mine the relationships between fractal parameters of soil psd and heavy metal content were analyzed the results showed that soil in front of the mountain fm had higher clay content than soil on the mountain slope ms or in the middle of the alluvial proluvial fan mf among the different sections of the alluvial proluvial fan ms had the largest capacity dimension d 0 information dimension d 1 correlation dimension d 2 single fractal dimension d spectral width δα and d 1 d 0 whereas mf had the greatest symmetry degree δf soil of ms had the highest ω cr and ω fe while fm had the highest ω zn ω mn ω pb ω cu ω as ω sb and ω cd fractal parameters of soil psd and soil mechanical composition were significantly correlated while both variables were correlated with heavy metal content fractal parameters can be used to indicate heavy metal content when heavy metals migrate due to migration of particle size this study thus introduces an empirical method for evaluating heavy metal content in soil and analyzing the mechanisms of their migration making a strong contribution to developing strategies that limit heavy metal pollution keywords alluvial proluvial fan soil particle size heavy metals multifractal system single fractal system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the yangshuo lead zinc mine opened in the 1950s with sphalerite and galena being the principal ore in 1958 a small flotation plant was set up near the mining pit head for beneficiation production qin et al 2019 a simple tailings dam was also built at the source region of the river but collapsed during a storm flood in the 1970s qin et al 2021 tailing sand with high concentrations of heavy metal flowed into the sidi river accumulating downstream and forming an alluvial proluvial fan li et al 2015 local farmers eventually planted crops in the alluvial proluvial fan resulting in severe ecological damage and threatening resident health with heavy metal contamination kong et al 2018 in general heavy metal pollution has become a serious problem that poses a major challenge to environmental protection and restricts regional economic development therefore we urgently need to understand the spatial distribution and migration of heavy metals in alluvial proluvial fans soil is an irregular and complex porous medium with fractal characteristics and self similar structures that favors heavy metal attachment huang et al 2006 omidvar 2021 as one of the most basic physical properties of soil particle size distribution psd is an important factor in determining the concentration mobility and transformation of heavy metals gao et al 2014 zong et al 2016 the size of soil particles can significantly affect the enrichment of heavy metals in soil liu et al 2018 luo et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 generally more heavy metals are accumulated in fine soil particles due to the increase of specific surface area and effective compositions with decreasing soil particle size gong et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 and more anthropogenic heavy metals are accumulated in fine soil particles in their stable forms due to the active compositions such as fe mn oxides liu et al 2018 rout et al 2016 luo et al 2011 in addition some fine soil particles could easily migrate in soil and become favorable carriers of heavy metals in soil buyang et al 2019 liu et al 2018 and fine soil particles adsorbed with heavy metals can migrate to human settlements through wind and hydraulic action endangering resident health cai et al 2019 hu et al 2012 wang et al 2021 zheng et al 2010 therefore understanding the relationships between heavy metals and psd is essential for determining migration mechanisms and limiting health risks soil psd is generally determined via texture which is typically represented as clay silt and sand fractions xu et al 2013 however soil texture analysis may be misleading because particle shape is irregular and size classification standards vary across texture taxonomy systems cui et al 2019 posadas et al 2001 qiao et al 2021 rodriguez lado and lado 2017 wang et al 2008 fortunately fractal theory provides a new method for studying soil psd li et al 2022 qi et al 2018 both single fractal and multifractal theories are widely used to elucidate the complexity and non homogeneity of soil psd siqueira et al 2018 sun et al 2016 wang et al 2022 xia et al 2020 xia et al 2017 single fractal theory reflects soil texture describes overall or average characteristics of particle size and multifractal theory reflects local non homogeneity and intrinsic variability in soil psd jing et al 2020 wang et al 2019b therefore combining single fractal and multifractal theories can adequately describe soil psd characteristics agricultural activities and river erosion will cause the migration of soil particles and heavy metals on alluvial proluvial fan downstream of yangshuo lead zinc mine while fractal parameters can fully indicate soil psd characteristics hypothesis fractal parameters can be used to indicate heavy metal content when heavy metals migrate due to migration of particle size determining the relationships between soil particle size fractal parameters and heavy metal content will clarify the mechanisms of heavy metal migration and contribute to lessening their harmful effects this study aimed to determine soil psd its fractal dimensions and heavy metal content in different areas of an alluvial proluvial fan then quantify the relationships of these three variables finally the potential of using fractal parameters as indicators of heavy metal content was evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study area is located in sidi village of northeast yangshuo county guangxi china 110 33 22 110 33 41 e 24 58 51 24 59 4 n fig 1 the climate is

river and main source of irrigation water originating in the upper mining area it flows into the xingping river to the north of sidi village and joins the lijiang river in xingping town data were collected from a typical alluvial proluvial deposit landform at the lower sidi river the heavy metals had migrated from the lead zinc mining area in the upper reaches of the sidi 2 2 sample collection and laboratory analyses the three field sites 10 10 m were located in front of the mountain fm 110 33 41 e 24 58 56 n on the mountain slope ms 110 33 22 e 24 58 52 n and in the middle of the alluvial proluvial fan mf 110 33 22 e 24 59 04 n fig 1 each site had three sampling points 2 2 m after removing the litter and humus layers soil samples were collected from the 0 100 cm soil layers and each sample contained three replicates because bedrock was present at the mf only soil samples from the 0 80 cm layers were collected the sites were sampled during july 2022 on days without rain and 126 soil samples were collected after storing in polyethylene bags samples were transported to the laboratory all samples were air dried at room temperature and gravel and any other impurities were removed before gently grinding the soil using a ceramic pestle and mortar li et al 2022 the ground samples were screened through a 2 mm soil sieve and kept at room temperature in a labelled zip lock bag li et al 2022 a 0 5 g soil sample was placed in a beaker with a volume of 500 ml and 10 ml of 30 h2o2 was added over 24 h to remove organic matter then 5 ml of 10 hcl was added for 10 min to eliminate calcium carbonate residual h2o2 and hcl were washed out with ultrapure water and then filling the beaker with ultrapure water and standing for 12 h the supernatant was removed and 10 ml of 0 05mol l napo3 6 was added the particle size of soil sample was measured using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 the agitator speed was 2500r min and the shading range was 10 20 soil psd was determined in terms of percentage volume for the 0 02 2000 μm range which was classified as clay 0 2 μm silt 2 20 μm and sand 20 2000 μm heavy metals in soil samples were extracted by hno3 h2o2 epa 3050a contents of as and sb were determined using atomic fluorescence spectrometry afs9700 contents of mn cd and pb were determined with a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer aa700 whereas contents of cu fe zn and cr were measured with icp oes to quality assurance control each digestion group 42 samples inserted four standard reference materials a duplicate sample and two reagent blanks respectively to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the analysis among them standard reference material gss 1 gbw07401 was obtained from the center for national standard reference material of china the recoveries of all heavy metals were within the range of 90 110 blank samples were also measured in all experiments the relative standard deviations for duplicate samples were 5 for all batch treatments 2 3 fractal theory 2 3 1 single fractal dimension a volume based model was used to calculate the single fractal dimension d of the psd bai et al 2020 1 lg v r r v t 3 d lg r r max where r is the soil particle size μm r is a soil particle of some grade μm v r r is the cumulative volume of particle sizes less than r v t is the total volume of soil particles r max is the maximum soil particle size μm and d is the single fractal dimension d increases with finer soil particle size biswas 2019 perfect and kay 1995 2 3 2 multifractal dimension the measured interval i 0 02 2000 μm was divided into 64 cell intervals i i φ i φ i 1 i 1 2 64 with lg φ i φ i 1 as a constant gao et al 2021 a dimensionless interval j 0 5 was constructed via logarithmic transformation of the interval chen et al 2021 calculated as follows 2 φ i lg φ i φ 1 i 1 2 65 where φ i is a dimensionless value of the equal interval based on soil particle size interval φ i is the soil particle size μm and φ 1 0 02 μm in interval j subintervals of equal size were calculated as n ε 2 k with ε 5 2 k for k ranging from 1 to 6 n ε is the number of subintervals and ε is the step length ke et al 2021 μ i ε is defined as the probability of finding soil particles of a given mass within particle size interval j i montero 2005 qi et al 2018 wang et al 2018b the generalized fractal dimension d q is defined as follows 3 d q lim ε 0 1 q 1 lg i 1 n ε μ i ε q lg ε q 1 4 d 1 lim ε 0 i 1 n ε μ i ε lg μ i ε lg ε q 1 where q is the probability density weight index an integer in li et al 2011 d q values for soil psd in different layers were obtained by fitting eqs 3 and 4 using the least squares method liao et al 2021 d 0 d 1 and d 2 are the capacity information and correlation dimensions respectively wang et al 2015 d 0 describes the width of soil psd the width is wider as d 0 increases d 1 represents psd concentration psd is more concentrated as d 1 increases d 1 d 0 represents psd dispersion d 1 d 0 value close to 1 indicates that soil particles are mostly distributed in dense areas whereas a value close to 0 indicates that they are mostly distributed in sparse areas d 2 reflects local psd dispersion as d 2 increases dispersion also increases wang et al 2018a the multifractal singularity index α q and spectrum function f α q of the soil psd were computed using eqs 5 and 6 shi et al 2021 wang et al 2015 5 α q lim ε 0 i 1 n ε μ i q ε lg μ i ε lg ε 6 f α q lim ε 0 i 1 n ε μ i q ε lg μ i q ε lg ε where μ i q ε is defined as 7 μ i q ε μ i ε q i 1 n ε μ i ε q the width of the multifractal spectrum is expressed as δα α q max α q min representing heterogeneity of the probability distribution in the entire fractal structure psd is increasingly uneven as δα increases rodriguez lado and lado 2017 wang et al 2019a spectrum symmetry is expressed as δf f α q min f α q max the asymmetrical f α q spectra are characterized as left skewed when δf 0 and right skewed when δf 0 δf 0 indicates that particles comprising a smaller volume fraction are critical to the complexity of soil particle composition whereas δf 0 indicates the dominance of particles comprising a larger volume hou et al 2021 wang et al 2018a 2 4 statistical analysis fractal parameters were calculated in matlab 2018 mathworks natick massachusetts usa stepwise regression analysis and one way analysis of variance anova were performed in spss 22 0 ibm corporation armonk new york usa pearson s correlations and figure plotting were done in origin pro 2021 originlab northampton massachusetts usa significance was set at p 0 05 3 results and analysis 3 1 characteristics of soil psd the frequency curves of soil particle distribution indicated that the sampling sites had soil with distinct composition characteristics fig 2 approximately 88 83 and 92 58 of soil particle sizes at the fm and ms respectively were in the range of 0 2 230 μm whereas 91 08 of mf soil particles were in the range of 1 5 680 μm soil from the fm differed considerably in composition characteristics from mf and ms soil within fm soil particle composition characteristics of the 80 100 cm soil layer differed from the characteristics of other layers average clay content of fm mf and ms samples was 21 78 8 44 and 20 97 respectively while average sand content was 40 00 57 05 and 35 83 thus fm soil had more clay than ms and mf soil and mf soil had more sand than fm and ms soil the soil layer with the highest soil clay content was 60 80 cm for fm 20 40 cm for mf and 0 20 cm for ms while the soil layer with the highest soil sand content was 80 100 cm for fm 60 80 cm for mf and 40 60 cm for ms with increasing depth soil clay content of fm and mf increased and then decreased while soil clay content of ms decreased and then increased the opposite pattern was observed for soil sand content 3 2 fractal characteristics of soil particle size the range of the single fractal dimension d was 2 50 2 84 for fm 2 55 2 69 for mf and 2 75 2 80 for ms ms fm mf fig 3 as the depth increased d of fm and mf first increased and then decreased whereas ms exhibited opposite pattern more specifically the soil layer with the highest d was 60 80 cm for fm 20 40 cm for mf and 0 20 cm for ms while the soil layer with the lowest d was 80 100 cm for fm 0 20 cm for mf and 40 60 cm for ms the generalized dimensional spectral curves showed an inverse s shaped decreasing function as q value increased when q 0 d q decreased less than when q 0 fig 4a b c this result indicates that variation in soil d q at different sampling sites is greater when soil size distribution is sparse rather than when it is dense furthermore soil particles exhibit greater non uniformity when size distribution is sparse than when the distribution is dense at every sampling site each soil layer exhibited greater capacity dimension d 0 than information dimension d 1 and greater d 1 than correlation dimension d 2 table 2 thus the fractal structure of soil psd was non uniform overall d 0 d 1 d 2 and d 1 d 0 of ms soil psd were the largest across our sampling sites with mean values of 0 94 0 89 0 87 and 0 95 respectively this result indicated that soil psd was the most complex in ms with a wider range of particle sizes the singular spectral curves of soil at different sampling sites were asymmetric convex up left deviating unimodal functions with large differences between the left and right portions fig 4d e f this result indicated that soil particles with a large volume fraction were dominant in soil psd and the multifractal structure had considerable heterogeneity overall spectral width δα was in the order of ms fm mf whereas symmetry degree δf was in the opposite order table 2 sampling sites did not differ significantly in δf but ms had significantly greater δα than mf this result indicated that soil psd asymmetry did not differ between sites although ms soil psd was more uneven 3 3 spatial distribution of heavy metal content tested soil layers had high heavy metal content in all sampling points and the range of the heavy metal content was 51 57 117 34 mg kg for ω cr 235 00 1578 36 mg kg for ω mn 48 934 28 74 498 41 mg kg for ω fe 28 82 164 24 mg kg for ω cu 138 28 1698 92 mg kg for ω zn 15 63 29 97 mg kg for ω as 0 32 4 75 mg kg for ω cd 0 26 17 66 mg kg for ω sb 48 75 2119 58 mg kg for ω pb fig 5 overall performance was ω fe ω zn ω mn ω pb ω cr ω cu ω as ω sb ω cd with increasing depth heavy metal contents increased decreased and then increased again in the ms the 80 100 cm layer had the greatest heavy metal contents in the mf ω cu gradually increased ω cd gradually decreased ω sb first increased decreased then increased again and the other heavy metals tended to increase first before decreasing the soil layer with the highest heavy metal content was 0 20 cm for ω cd 20 40 cm for ω mn ω sb and ω pb 40 60 cm for ω cr ω fe ω zn and ω as 60 80 cm for ω cu in the fm ω cr and ω fe first increased and then decreased whereas the opposite trend occurred for ω mn ω cu ω cd ω sb and ω pb furthermore ω as exhibited an overall m shaped change with increasing depth ω zn had opposite trends and exhibited an overall w shaped change the soil layer with the highest heavy metal content was 40 60 cm for ω cr and ω fe 60 80 cm for ω as 80 100 cm for ω mn ω cu ω zn ω cd ω sb and ω pb comparatively ω cr and ω fe of the ms were the highest whereas ω zn ω mn ω pb ω cu ω as ω sb and ω cd of the fm were the highest 3 4 relationships between heavy metal content and fractal parameters d was negatively correlated with ω pb ω cu ω zn ω cd and ω sb but positively correlated with ω cr and ω fe fig 6 d 1 d 2 d 1 d 0 and silt content were negatively correlated with ω cu ω zn ω cd ω sb ω mn and ω pb d 1 d 2 and d 1 d 0 were positively correlated with ω cr and ω fe clay content was positively correlated with ω cr and ω fe but negatively correlated with ω cu sand content was negatively correlated with ω fe but positively correlated with ω cu ω zn ω cd ω pb and ω sb ω mn ω cd and ω pb were most closely related to d 2 ω cu and ω zn were most closely related to silt content ω cr ω fe ω as and ω sb were most closely related to d 1 d clay content and d 1 d 0 respectively stepwise regression showed that d 1 d 0 explained 44 9 and 61 5 of the variation in ω cr and ω pb respectively table 3 next d 2 explained 64 8 and 54 7 of the variation in ω mn and ω cd respectively silt content explained 59 3 and 53 9 of the variation in ω cu and ω zn clay content alone explained 61 3 of the variation in ω fe clay content silt content and d 1 d 0 combined explained 84 8 of the variation in ω sb with the largest contribution coming from d 1 d 0 clay and sand content combined explained 51 4 of the variation in ω as with clay content having a greater contribution than sand content 4 discussion fm soil had more clay than ms and mf soil and mf soil had more sand than fm and ms soil river diversion and agricultural activity may explain these patterns previous research has shown that agricultural activity coarsens soil through the loss of fine particles whereas forests and grassland contribute to fine soil particle retention richer de forges et al 2022 wang et al 2006b wu et al 2021 xu et al 2013 both fm and ms were covered in vegetation and agricultural activity was high in mf and the sidi river diversion reduced water scouring to the alluvial proluvial fan these environmental features explain why fm and ms had significantly higher clay content than mf finally we observed that as depth increased fm and mf soil clay content first rose and then fell while ms soil clay content first fell and rose the opposite pattern was observed for soil sand content because the alluvial proluvial fan formed over a long period through multiple instances of proluvium accumulation soil mechanical composition did not exhibit any obvious pattern with the increase in depth when soil psd is not uniform d is between 2 and 3 leading to curve shaped multifractal generalized dimension spectrum and singular spectrum function whereas both are straight lines when soil psd is uniform i e d is constant grout et al 1998 li et al 2022 pieri et al 2006 here d was between 2 50 and 2 84 and the singular spectral function exhibited an upward convex left hook curve additionally the multifractal generalized dimension spectral function formed an inverse s shaped monotone decreasing curve and d 0 d 1 d 2 therefore soil psd had typical fractal characteristics at our chosen study sites in the alluvial proluvial fan the d of soils with finer texture and higher fertility typically range from 2 60 to 2 80 and soils having less structure and coarser texture range from 1 83 to 2 64 liu et al 2009 thus the soils with finer texture and higher fertility at our chosen study sites none of the sites differed in d 0 d 1 d 2 d 1 d 0 or δf but ms had significantly larger d and δα than mf these results revealed that the multifractal structures of soil psd were similar across sampling sites and ms soil particles were finer bai et al 2020 biswas 2019 perfect and kay 1995 in line with soil particle distribution frequency curves the alluvial proluvial fan downstream of yangshuo lead zinc mine formed over a long period through multiple instances of proluvium accumulation and the soils with finer texture agricultural activities and water erosion have intensified the migration of soil particles and heavy metals on the alluvial proluvial fan wang et al 2006b wu et al 2021 therefore as the depth increased heavy metal content did not exhibit any obvious pattern as a whole ω cr and ω fe of the ms were the highest whereas ω zn ω mn ω pb ω cu ω as ω sb and ω cd of the fm were the highest fm and ms had higher heavy metal content than mf may be due to strong agricultural activities at mf because plants can repair the pollution of heavy metals in soil and agricultural activities can increase the migration of heavy metals in previous studies luo et al 2019 luo et al 2020 many studies have focused on the distribution of heavy metals in particles of various sizes acosta et al 2011 wang et al 2006a zhao et al 2010 heavy metals are preferentially present in fine particles especially the clay fraction which has a larger surface area negative charge and high levels of organic matter that acts as a sorbent for metals ajmone marsan et al 2008 ljung et al 2006 luo et al 2011 madrid et al 2008 zong et al 2016 we found that ω zn ω pb ω cu ω sb and ω cd were positively correlated with sand content while ω fe and ω cr were positively correlated with clay content these associations may be related to the distribution and bioactivity of heavy metals heavy metals such as zn pb and cu were mainly found in mineral particles and their high bioactivity means that plants can easily absorb all three heavy metals wu et al 2017 in contrast fe and cr mainly adhere to soil particles via fecr2o4 which is highly stable and not easily absorbed by plants wu et al 2017 clay particles are more conducive than sand particles to fe and cr adhesion because of a larger specific surface area luo et al 2011 zong et al 2016 previous studies have shown that soil physicochemical properties and the fractal dimension of soil psd are significantly correlated bai et al 2020 gui et al 2010 here we found a significant correlation between heavy metal content and fractal dimensions suggesting that the latter can be used as an indicator of the former moreover the results of our stepwise regression provide evidence that fractal theory is suitable for analyzing heavy metal content in soil 5 conclusions this study analyzed the relationship between fractal dimensions of soil psd and heavy metal content in different areas of an alluvial proluvial fan we found that the fm had higher soil clay content than the ms or mf whereas the mf had higher soil sand content than the fm or ms the multifractal generalized dimension spectral functions of soil psd across our sampling sites were an inverse s shaped monotone decreasing curve and d 0 d 1 d 2 singular spectral functions were upward convex left hook curves therefore soil psd was highly non homogeneous in the alluvial proluvial fan meaning the application of multifractal analysis was appropriate heavy metal content was high across our tested sites in the alluvial proluvial fan in particular ω cr and ω fe were highest in the ms whereas ω zn ω mn ω pb ω cu ω as ω sb and ω cd were highest in the fm the long formation period of the alluvial proluvial fan meant that we did not observe any obvious patterns in soil mechanical composition fractal parameters or heavy metal content as soil depth increased finally there were significant correlation between heavy metal contents and fractal parameters and the fractal parameter of soil psd has strong potential as an indicator for heavy metal content this research provides a theoretical basis for analyzing the mechanism of heavy metal migration and reducing the harm of heavy metals author contributions conceptualization zhuo tian and meng chen methodology shuaipu zhang

proluvial fan mf 110 33 22 e 24 59 04 n fig 1 each site had three sampling points 2 2 m after removing the litter and humus layers soil samples were collected from the 0 100 cm soil layers and each sample contained three replicates because bedrock was present at the mf only soil samples from the 0 80 cm layers were collected the sites were sampled during july 2022 on days without rain and 126 soil samples were collected after storing in polyethylene bags samples were transported to the laboratory all samples were air dried at room temperature and gravel and any other impurities were removed before gently grinding the soil using a ceramic pestle and mortar li et al 2022 the ground samples were screened through a 2 mm soil sieve and kept at room temperature in a labelled zip lock bag li et al 2022 a 0 5 g soil sample was placed in a beaker with a volume of 500 ml and 10 ml of 30 h2o2 was added over 24 h to remove organic matter then 5 ml of 10 hcl was added for 10 min to eliminate calcium carbonate residual h2o2 and hcl were washed out with ultrapure water and then filling the beaker with ultrapure water and standing for 12 h the supernatant was removed and 10 ml of 0 05mol l napo3 6 was added the particle size of soil sample was measured using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 the agitator speed was 2500r min and the shading range was 10 20 soil psd

epa 3050a contents of as and sb were determined using atomic fluorescence spectrometry afs9700 contents of mn cd and pb were determined with a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer aa700 whereas contents of cu fe zn and cr were measured with icp oes to quality assurance control each digestion group 42 samples inserted four standard reference materials a duplicate sample and two reagent blanks respectively to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the analysis among them standard reference material gss 1 gbw07401 was obtained from the center for national standard reference material of china the recoveries of all heavy metals were within the range of 90 110 blank samples were also measured in all experiments the relative standard deviations for duplicate samples were 5 for all batch treatments 2 3 fractal theory 2 3 1 single fractal dimension a volume based model was used to calculate the single fractal dimension d of the psd bai et al 2020 1 lg v r r v t 3 d lg r r

maximum soil particle size μm and d is the single fractal dimension d increases with finer soil particle size biswas 2019 perfect and kay 1995 2 3 2 multifractal dimension the measured interval i 0 02 2000 μm was divided into 64 cell intervals i i φ i φ i 1 i 1 2 64 with lg φ i φ i 1 as a constant gao et al 2021 a dimensionless interval j 0 5 was constructed via logarithmic transformation of the interval chen et al 2021 calculated as follows 2 φ i lg φ i φ 1 i 1 2 65 where φ i is a dimensionless value of the equal interval based on soil particle size interval φ i is the soil particle size μm and φ 1 0 02 μm in interval j subintervals of equal size were calculated as n ε 2 k with ε 5 2 k for k ranging from 1 to 6 n ε is the number of subintervals and ε is the step length ke et al 2021 μ i ε is defined as the probability of finding soil particles of a given mass within particle size interval j i montero 2005 qi et al 2018 wang et al 2018b the generalized fractal dimension d q is defined as follows 3 d q lim ε 0 1 q 1 lg i 1 n ε μ i ε q lg ε q 1 4 d 1 lim ε 0 i 1 n ε μ i ε lg μ i ε lg ε q 1 where q is the probability density weight index an integer in li et al 2011 d q values for soil psd in different layers were obtained by fitting eqs 3 and 4 using the least squares method liao et al 2021 d 0 d 1 and d 2 are the capacity information and correlation dimensions respectively wang et al 2015 d 0 describes the width of soil psd the width is wider as d 0 increases d 1 represents psd concentration psd is more concentrated as d 1 increases d 1 d 0 represents psd dispersion d 1 d 0 value close to 1 indicates that soil particles are mostly distributed in dense areas whereas a value close to 0 indicates that they are mostly distributed in sparse areas d 2 reflects local psd dispersion as d 2 increases dispersion also increases wang et al 2018a the multifractal singularity index α q and spectrum function f α q of the soil psd were computed using eqs 5 and 6 shi et al 2021

lado 2017 wang et al 2019a spectrum symmetry is expressed as δf f α q min f α q max the asymmetrical f α q spectra are characterized as left skewed when δf 0 and right skewed when δf 0 δf 0 indicates that particles comprising a smaller volume fraction are critical to the complexity of soil particle composition whereas δf 0 indicates the dominance of particles comprising a larger volume hou et al 2021 wang et al 2018a 2 4 statistical analysis fractal parameters were calculated in matlab 2018 mathworks natick massachusetts usa stepwise regression analysis and one way analysis of variance anova were performed in spss 22 0 ibm corporation armonk new york usa pearson s correlations and figure plotting were done in origin pro 2021 originlab northampton massachusetts usa significance was set at p 0 05 3 results and analysis 3 1 characteristics of soil psd the frequency curves of soil particle distribution indicated that the sampling sites had soil with distinct composition characteristics fig 2 approximately 88 83 and 92 58 of soil particle sizes at the fm and ms respectively were in the range of 0 2 230 μm whereas 91 08 of mf soil particles were in the range of 1 5 680 μm soil from the fm differed considerably in composition characteristics from mf and ms soil within fm soil particle composition characteristics of the 80 100 cm soil layer differed from the characteristics of other layers average clay content of fm mf and ms samples was 21 78 8 44 and 20 97 respectively while average sand content was 40 00 57 05 and 35 83 thus fm soil had more clay than ms and mf soil and mf soil had more sand than fm and ms soil the soil layer with the highest soil clay content was 60 80 cm for fm 20 40 cm for mf and 0 20 cm for ms while the soil layer with the highest soil sand content was 80 100 cm for fm 60 80 cm for mf and 40 60 cm for ms with increasing depth soil clay content of fm and mf increased and then decreased while soil clay content of ms decreased and then increased the opposite pattern was observed for soil sand content 3 2 fractal characteristics of soil particle size the range of the single fractal dimension d was 2 50 2 84 for fm 2 55 2 69 for mf and 2 75 2 80 for ms ms fm mf fig 3 as the depth increased d of fm and mf first increased and then decreased whereas ms exhibited opposite pattern more specifically the soil layer with the highest d was 60 80 cm for fm 20 40 cm for mf and 0 20 cm for ms while the soil layer with the lowest d was 80 100 cm for fm 0 20 cm for mf and 40 60 cm for ms the generalized dimensional spectral curves showed an inverse s shaped decreasing function as q value increased when q 0 d q decreased less than when q 0 fig 4a b c this result indicates that variation in soil d q at different sampling sites is greater when soil size distribution is sparse rather than when it is dense furthermore soil particles exhibit greater non uniformity when size distribution is sparse than when the distribution is dense at every sampling site each soil layer exhibited greater capacity dimension d 0 than information dimension d 1 and greater d 1 than correlation dimension d 2 table 2 thus the fractal structure of soil psd was non uniform overall d 0 d 1 d 2 and d 1 d 0 of ms soil psd were the largest across our sampling sites with mean values of 0 94 0 89 0 87 and 0 95 respectively this result indicated that soil psd was the most complex in ms with a wider range of particle sizes the singular spectral curves of soil at different sampling sites were asymmetric convex up left deviating unimodal functions with large differences between the left and right portions fig 4d e f this result indicated that soil particles with a large volume fraction were dominant in soil psd and the multifractal structure had considerable heterogeneity overall spectral width δα was in the order of ms fm mf whereas symmetry degree δf was in the opposite order table 2 sampling sites did not differ significantly in δf but ms had significantly greater δα than mf this result indicated that soil psd asymmetry did not differ between sites although ms soil psd was more uneven 3 3 spatial distribution of heavy metal content tested soil layers had high heavy metal content in all sampling points and the range of the heavy metal content was 51 57 117 34 mg kg for ω cr 235 00 1578 36 mg kg for ω mn 48 934 28 74 498 41 mg kg for ω fe 28 82 164 24 mg kg for ω cu 138 28 1698 92 mg kg for ω zn 15 63 29 97 mg kg for ω as 0 32 4 75 mg kg for ω cd 0 26 17 66 mg kg for ω sb 48 75 2119 58 mg kg for ω pb fig 5 overall performance was ω fe ω zn ω mn ω pb ω cr ω cu ω as ω sb ω cd with increasing depth heavy metal contents increased decreased and then increased again in the ms the 80 100 cm layer had the greatest heavy metal contents in the mf ω cu gradually increased ω cd gradually decreased ω sb first increased decreased then increased again and the other heavy metals tended to increase first before decreasing the soil layer with the highest heavy metal content was 0 20 cm for ω cd 20 40 cm for ω mn ω sb and ω pb 40 60 cm for ω cr ω fe ω zn and ω as 60 80 cm for ω cu in the fm ω cr and ω fe first increased and then decreased whereas the opposite trend occurred for ω mn ω cu ω cd ω sb and ω pb furthermore ω as exhibited an overall m shaped change with increasing depth ω zn had opposite trends and exhibited an overall w shaped change the soil layer with the highest heavy metal content was 40 60 cm for ω cr and ω fe 60 80 cm for ω as 80 100 cm for ω mn ω cu ω zn ω cd ω sb and ω pb comparatively ω cr and ω fe of the ms were the highest whereas ω zn ω mn ω pb ω cu ω as ω sb and ω cd of the fm were the highest 3 4 relationships between heavy metal content and fractal parameters d was negatively correlated with ω pb ω cu ω zn ω cd and ω sb but positively correlated with ω cr and ω fe fig 6 d 1 d 2 d 1 d 0 and silt content were negatively correlated with ω cu ω zn ω cd ω sb ω mn and ω pb d 1 d 2 and d 1 d 0 were positively correlated with ω cr and ω fe clay content was positively correlated with ω cr and ω fe but negatively correlated with ω cu sand content was negatively correlated with ω fe but positively correlated with ω cu ω zn ω cd ω pb and ω sb ω mn ω cd and ω pb were most closely related to d 2 ω cu and ω zn were most closely related to silt content ω cr ω fe ω as and ω sb were most closely related to d 1 d clay content and d 1 d 0 respectively stepwise regression showed that d 1 d 0 explained 44 9 and 61 5 of the variation in ω cr and ω pb respectively table 3 next d 2 explained 64 8 and 54 7 of the variation in ω mn and ω cd respectively silt content explained 59 3 and 53 9 of the variation in ω cu and ω zn clay content alone explained 61 3 of the variation in ω fe clay content silt content and d 1 d 0 combined explained 84 8 of the variation in ω sb with the largest contribution coming from d 1 d 0 clay and sand content combined explained 51 4 of the variation in ω as with clay content having a greater contribution than sand content 4 discussion fm soil had more clay than ms and mf soil and mf soil had more sand than fm and ms soil river diversion and agricultural activity may explain these patterns previous research has shown that agricultural activity coarsens soil through the loss of fine particles whereas forests and grassland contribute to fine soil particle retention richer de forges et al 2022 wang et al 2006b wu et al 2021 xu et al 2013 both fm and ms were covered in vegetation and agricultural activity was high in mf and the sidi river diversion reduced water scouring to the alluvial proluvial fan these environmental features explain why fm and ms had significantly higher clay content than mf finally we observed that as depth increased fm and mf soil clay content first rose and then fell while ms soil clay content first fell and rose the opposite pattern was observed for soil sand content because the alluvial proluvial fan formed over a long period through multiple instances of proluvium accumulation soil mechanical composition did not exhibit any obvious pattern with the increase in depth when soil psd is not uniform d is between 2 and 3 leading to curve shaped multifractal generalized dimension spectrum and singular spectrum function whereas both are straight lines when soil psd is uniform i e d is constant grout et al 1998 li et al 2022 pieri et al 2006 here d was between 2 50 and 2 84 and the singular spectral function exhibited an upward convex left hook curve additionally the multifractal generalized dimension spectral function formed an inverse s shaped monotone decreasing curve and d 0 d 1 d 2 therefore soil psd had typical fractal characteristics at our chosen study sites in the alluvial proluvial fan the d of soils with finer texture and higher fertility typically range from 2 60 to 2 80 and soils having less structure and coarser texture range from 1 83 to 2 64 liu et al 2009 thus the soils with finer texture and higher fertility at our chosen study sites none of the sites differed in d 0 d 1 d 2 d 1 d 0 or δf but ms had significantly larger d and δα than mf these results revealed that the multifractal structures of soil psd were similar across sampling sites and ms soil particles were finer bai et al 2020 biswas 2019 perfect and kay 1995 in line with soil particle distribution frequency curves the alluvial proluvial fan downstream of yangshuo lead zinc mine formed over a long period through multiple instances of proluvium accumulation and the soils with finer texture agricultural activities and water erosion have intensified the migration of soil particles and heavy metals on the alluvial proluvial fan wang et al 2006b wu et al 2021 therefore as the depth increased heavy metal content did not exhibit any obvious pattern as a whole ω cr and ω fe of the ms were the highest whereas ω zn ω mn ω pb ω cu ω as ω sb and ω cd of the fm were the highest fm and ms had higher heavy metal content than mf may be due to strong agricultural activities at mf because plants can repair the pollution of heavy metals in soil and agricultural activities can increase the migration of heavy metals in previous studies luo et al 2019 luo et al 2020 many studies have focused on the distribution of heavy metals in particles of various sizes acosta et al 2011 wang et al 2006a zhao et al 2010 heavy metals are preferentially present in fine particles especially the clay fraction which has a larger surface area negative charge and high levels of organic matter that acts as a sorbent for metals ajmone marsan et al 2008 ljung et al 2006 luo et al 2011 madrid et al 2008 zong et al 2016 we found that ω zn ω pb ω cu ω sb and ω cd were positively correlated with sand content while ω fe and ω cr were positively correlated with clay content these associations may be related to the distribution and bioactivity of heavy metals heavy metals such as zn pb and cu were mainly found in mineral particles and their high bioactivity means that plants can easily absorb all three heavy metals wu et al 2017 in contrast fe and cr mainly adhere to soil particles via fecr2o4 which is highly stable and not easily absorbed by plants wu et al 2017 clay particles are more conducive than sand particles to fe and cr adhesion because of a larger specific surface area luo et al 2011 zong et al 2016 previous studies have shown that soil physicochemical properties and the fractal dimension of soil psd are significantly correlated bai et al 2020 gui et al 2010 here we found a significant correlation between heavy metal content and fractal dimensions suggesting that the latter can be used as an indicator of the former moreover the results of our stepwise regression provide evidence that fractal theory is suitable for analyzing heavy metal content in soil 5 conclusions this study analyzed the relationship between fractal dimensions of soil psd and heavy metal content in different areas of an alluvial proluvial fan we found that the fm had higher soil clay content than the ms or mf whereas the mf had higher soil sand content than the fm or ms the multifractal generalized dimension spectral functions of soil psd across our sampling sites were an inverse s shaped monotone decreasing curve and d 0 d 1 d 2 singular spectral functions were upward convex left hook curves therefore soil psd was highly non homogeneous in the alluvial proluvial fan meaning the application of multifractal analysis was appropriate heavy metal content was high across our tested sites in the alluvial proluvial fan in particular ω cr and ω fe were highest in the ms whereas ω zn ω mn ω pb ω cu ω as ω sb and ω cd were highest in the fm the long formation period of the alluvial proluvial fan meant that we did not observe any obvious patterns in soil mechanical composition fractal parameters or heavy metal content as soil depth increased finally there were significant correlation between heavy metal contents and fractal parameters and the fractal parameter of soil psd has strong potential as an indicator for heavy metal content this research provides a theoretical basis for analyzing the mechanism of heavy metal migration and reducing the harm of heavy metals author contributions conceptualization zhuo tian and meng chen methodology shuaipu zhang

1221,the yunnan guizhou plateau ygp lakes are the typical plateau rift lakes and an important water source in southwest china however there is a scarcity of research on its spatiotemporal water quality variations and driving factors especially on long term scales herein multiple water quality indicators for 11 natural lakes on the ygp were measured from 2005 to 2020 in this study the effects of natural lake attributes human activities and meteorological conditions on water quality were also analyzed the results showed that the water quality of the ygp lakes tended to degrade and was divided into heavy medium and light pollution types total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn permanganate index codmn and biochemical oxygen demand bod5 increased by 14 69 14 44 22 61 and 11 26 respectively from 2005 to 2020 natural attributes of lakes and land use types were the main reasons for the spatial heterogeneity of water quality in ygp in contrast the temporal evolution of lake water quality was mainly related to human activities and climatic conditions the smaller the water terrestrial area ratio water storage capacity and water depth the easier the eutrophication and the worser the water quality of ygp lakes land degradation accelerated the deterioration of water quality in plateau lakes while ecological land played an improving role this study summarizes the water quality changes and influencing factors in ygp lakes over the past 15 years which can provide a scientific database reference for water environment protection in ygp graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords yunnan guizhou plateau plateau lake water quality spatiotemporal variation driving factors data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as an important ecosystem and inland water resource lakes regulate climate record environmental changes and maintain ecosystem balance and biodiversity carpenter et al 2011 mammides 2020 since the start of the 20th century the ecological health and sustainability of lakes have been under serious threat due to rapid urbanization global climate change and high anthropogenic activities ho and goethals 2019 le et al 2010 pollutants from industrial urban and agriculture sectors have accelerated lake eutrophication li et al 2020 and global warming stimulated cyanobacterial blooms and decreased lake water storage fang et al 2018 tong et al 2021 various factors including climate change sediment deposition and land reclamation are causing the shrinkage of the total lake area and lakes are disappearing not only in china but around the world choiński et al 2012 yang and lu 2014 in turn the decline in the lake area and water quality not only reduces the ecological function of the lake and its catchment but also threatens human living conditions grumbine 2014 zhou et al 2022 china has 2693 lakes with a total area of 81 414 6 km2 and the lakes account for approximately 0 9 of the country s territory liu et al 2010 about one third of these lakes are freshwater lakes le et al 2010 however of the 67 major lakes in china 80 have been polluted and 27 show extremely high nitrogen and phosphorus levels huang et al 2014b le et al 2010 liu et al 2010 in southwestern china several environmental problems have appeared in the yunnan guizhou plateau ygp lakes severe blue green algae blooms occurred in erhai lake in 2003 after which its eutrophication index remained around 40 indicating that the lake was in the initial stages of eutrophication lin et al 2021 moreover yangzonghai lake was catastrophically contaminated with arsenic in 2008 with concentrations as high as 0 128 mg l in the lake chen et al 2015 furthermore the average annual concentration of total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn in dianchi lake were 0 77 and 8 75 mg l during 1988 2018 gao et al 2021 respectively and tn in yilong lake remained at a high level 2 15 mg l in 2016 2018 sui et al 2022 the ygp lakes are mostly rift lakes with limited catchment areas which have a weak purification effect on the inflow of pollutants lin et al 2020 wang et al 2022 meanwhile the ygp lakes have abundant inflow streams but few outflow channels leading to long lake residence periods and easy accumulation of pollutants qin et al 2020 more recently urban sewage industrial wastewater and agricultural non point source pollutants have aggravated water pollution and eutrophication in the ygp lakes as the basin s population has increased and economic development has taken place chen et al 2021a yu et al 2021 since the 1970s the water quality of dianchi lake has been adversely affected by domestic and industrial pollution sources in the basin wang et al 2021a and non point source agricultural pollution was the primary reason for algal blooms in 2000 2009 huang et al 2014a wu et al 2021 found that industrial wastewater and tourism were the main driving factors that led to water quality deterioration in yilong lake from 2008 to 2013 lin et al 2020 showed that the algal bloom in erhai lake in 2013 was due to a combination of increasing temperatures and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations ran et al 2022 pointed out that warming temperatures and urbanization led to water quality degeneration in qionghai lake before 2017 the spatiotemporal variability of water quality in different ygp lakes is not the same as they suffer from various anthropogenic and natural pressures chen et al 2021a wang et al 2022 however these current water quality studies in ygp lakes only focus on a single lake or several contributing factors and there is a lack of overall understanding of the long term impact of a combination of factors such as natural morphological features human activities and climatic conditions on water quality throughout the ygp lakes this study investigated water quality parameters trophic level index tli water quality comprehensive pollution index wq cpi morphological characteristics meteorological factors and anthropogenic activities of 11 ygp lakes from 2005 to 2020 the objectives were to 1 explore the spatiotemporal variations of the water quality and

the dcl qll yll and xyl were 0 152 2 66 10 13 and 5 06 mg l fig 2 which were higher than the limit values of gb class iii mep 2002 therefore these four lakes were heavily polluted lakes hpl in addition tli in the hpl was 64 84 at the eutrophic level and wq cpi was 0 64 which was significantly higher than that in other ygp lakes figs 3a b yzhl chhl ehl cahl and qhl can be classified as moderately polluted lakes mpl due to their tli and wq cpi were 43 67 and 0 24 respectively figs 3a b and eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms occurred from time to time lin et al 2021 meanwhile the tp tn codmn and bod5 in the mpl ranged from 0 023 to 0 045 0 44 1 04 2 35 6 21 and 1 17 2 07 mg l respectively indicating a risk of exceeding the standard class iii fig 2 the water environment of fxl and lgl was the best in ygp values of the biochemical indices wq cpi and tli in the 2 slightly polluted lakes spl were low figs 2 3 correspondingly the spatial patterns in the water quality of the ygp were also well illustrated by the hierarchical ca where the 11 lakes were divided into heavy medium and light pollution types fig 2c from 2005 to 2020 the evolution and trends of water quality in the 11 ygp lakes in different pollution states hpl mpl and spl were different at different stages 2005 2010 2010 2015 and 2015 2020 figs 3c f water quality degradation in the ygp lakes was most severe in 2005 2010 with pollutant concentrations increasing significantly in most lakes figs 3c f hpl s water quality improved in 2010 2015 with reduced nutrients wq cpi and tli but continued to deteriorate in several mpl or spl fig 3 during 2015 2020 the tp tn and bod5 in most lakes decreased proportionally but the codmn in mpl and spl increased significantly figs 3c f nonetheless the water quality of the ygp lakes was affected by a combination of lake basin morphological characteristics human activities climate change and government financed investments in environmental restoration huang et al 2014b liu et al 2010 mammides 2020 3 2 water quality of ygp lakes affected by lake morphological characteristics lake morphological characteristics such as water depth water storage ws and water terrestrial area w t ratio are important factors that affect water quality jacquemin et al 2019 qin et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 the ecological stability and self purification capacity of the lake is related to the water depth and ws xu et al 2020 generally the larger the water depth and ws of a lake the stronger the dilution of contaminants qin et al 2020 xiang et al 2021 the four severely polluted lakes in ygp are shallow lakes the mean depths of dcl qll yll and xyl were 5 4 2 7 and 7 m table 1 respectively except for dcl the ws of hpl was 2 108 m3 table 1 fig 4a in general shallow lakes have a weak capacity for self purification and then environmental degradation is evident when pollutant concentrations are above the ecological threshold for a long time huang et al 2021 moreover nutrients in the sediment of shallow lakes are prone to resuspension due to wind or fish disturbance increasing management difficulties and prolonging restoration cycles ran et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 in comparison fxl and lgl as the second and third deepest freshwater lakes in china showed an average depth of 87 and 40 3 m and ws of 2 06 1010 and 2 25 109 m3 respectively table 1 fig 4a hence the lake environment was stable and dilution capacity was strong dai et al 2017 exogenous pollutants can be fully diluted or settled to the lake bottom qin et al 2020 therefore the water quality of shallow lakes dcl qll etc is worse than sub deep lakes ehl qhl etc and worse than deep lakes fxl lgl in ygp table 1 figs 2 3 generally the quantity and quality of terrestrial nutrients nutrients mainly carried away with stormwater runoff can be determined and measured at the catchment areas of the lakes nutrients are considered key driving factors in eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms in lakes therefore impacting the sustainability and ecological health of lakes jacquemin et al 2019 wang et al 2021a typically a large catchment has a dense river system and the pollutants are input through inflowing rivers so the w t ratio can reflect the exogenous load pressure on the lake dai et al 2017 tammelin and kauppila 2018 our study shows that tp tn codmn bod5 tli and wq cpi values are negatively correlated with lake w t ratio p 0 05 with larger w t ratios indicating better water quality figs 2 5 lakes with large w t ratios have limited catchment areas and great water areas responding weakly to events in the watershed zhou et al 2022 in contrast lakes with small w t ratios are prone to deterioration and eutrophication due to their small water area receiving great amounts of pollutants from a large catchment jacquemin et al 2019 liu et al 2010 moreover seasonal water quality differences were found in lakes with w t ratios 0 11 such as dcl ehl and qll figs 4b s1 this indicates that this type of lake is sensitive to environmental changes kopàček et al 2011 furthermore lake hydraulic retention time lhrt and recharge coefficients lrc are important hydrological factors that affect water quality huang et al 2021 the lhrt of dongting lake dtl and hongze lake hzl is only 20 and 27 days and lrc is 483 1 and 98 9 respectively fig 4c the strong mobility and water exchange periods of the eastern plain lakes make them have strong climate change adaptability and pollutant transfer capacity and are less prone to large scale cyanobacterial bloom li et al 2020 liu et al 2010 however ygp is a region with the most active development of rifted lakes and the 11 natural lakes are all formed in geologically rifted structures zhuo et al 2021 lrc is relatively low 10 fig 4c and the water supply mainly depends on rainfall and inflowing runoff dai et al 2017 additionally most of the lakes in ygp are semi closed with many tributaries entering the lake but few channels to drain the water qian and long 2019 yu et al 2020 which results in a long lhrt fig 4c the lhrt of dcl and ehl is more than two years whereas that of fxl and lgl is approximately 166 94 and 38 41 years fig 4c respectively long lhrt increases the retention time of pollutants in the lakes and amplifies the promoting effect of nutrient load on algal growth ho and michalak 2019 song et al 2021 which makes large areas of cyanobacterial blooms still occur frequently in mesotrophic lakes such as qhl and ehl ran et al 2022 wang et al 2021b 3 3 water quality of ygp lakes affected by human activities human activities may be the main reason for the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of water quality in freshwater lakes mammides 2020 van meter et al 2016 a mass of pollution loads flows into the lakes because of population explosion intensification of industrial activities and inappropriate land use compositions chen et al 2020 grumbine 2014 schaldach et al 2018 resulting in the deterioration of the water quality of taihu lake thl chaohu lake chl and dcl huang et al 2021 from 2005 to 2020 the concentrations of tp tn codmn and bod5 in ygp lakes have increased with average amplitudes of 14 69 14 44 22 61 and 11 26 respectively and the greatest increase observed in codmn figs 2 3 meanwhile the ecological land and agricultural land area proportion of the ygp lake region decreased by 0 47 and 1 45 respectively and the degraded land area proportion increased by 1 91 fig 6b fig 5 illustrates that the water quality of ygp lakes shows significant correlation with land use patterns p 0 05 these results indicates that anthropogenic activities and land degradation in the ygp lake basins have gradually intensified and have significantly affected water quality land use types can affect the production distribution and transportation of pollutants in the watershed pak et al 2021 wei et al 2020 among the ygp lake basins hpl had a relatively high degraded land area proportion 6 97 7 98 and 10 37 in 2005 2010 and 2018 respectively fig 6b the degraded land mainly consisted of urban land fig 6b which had become the main pollution source of nitrogen and organic matter in many basins chen et al 2021b therefore the water quality of hpl was significantly affected by domestic sewage and industrial wastewater from the urban land huang et al 2014a wu et al 2021 and tn tp codmn bod5 concentrations were higher than in other lakes fig 2 meanwhile the intensity of cultivation in qll xyl and yll was relatively high figs 6a b the cultivated land was not only near the lake area but also accounted for a great proportion of the watershed fig 6a resulting in a large amount of non point source load entering lakes liu et al 2021 poyatos et al 2003 furthermore mining construction lands can be found along hpl figs 6a b which exacerbated the deterioration of lake water quality chen et al 2021b dai et al 2017 for example the mining of phosphorite in the xyl basin was the reason why the tp in the lake exceeded the standard of inferior class v yu et al 2010 in the mpl watershed yzhl chhl ehl cahl and qhl the average degraded land areal proportions in 2005 and 2010 were only 2 14 and 2 63 fig 6b respectively the annual mean per capital gdp was 14 156 55 rmb yuan in 2010 fig 6c it indicates that the intensity of human activity in the mpl basin was relatively low the pollution load into the lake was not very high in 2005 2010 lin et al 2021 therefore the water quality was preferable when compared to that of hpl fig 2 however mpl water quality showed an overall downward trend in 2005 2020 with tp tn codmn and bod5 increasing by 0 014 0 26 1 38 and 0 80 mg l respectively figs 2 3 the tli and wq cpi also increased and showed maximum values of 44 89 and 0 26 respectively in 2017 fig 3 this is because of the intensification of anthropogenic activities in the mpl basins chen et al 2015 yu et al 2010 yu et al 2021 degraded land and per capita gdp tended to increase year after year and ecological land decreased gradually except for qhl figs 6b c moreover agricultural land in the mpl watersheds invariably accounted for significant percentages fig 6b this means that agricultural pollutants such as nutrients agricultural films chemical fertilizers and livestock manure can enter the lake during the rainy season through surface runoff or irrigation returns chen et al 2021b wei et al 2020 from 2005 to 2020 no significant variations in water quality were detected in fxl and lgl the tp tn codmn and bod5 of the two lakes were 0 005 0 012 0 13 0 20 0 96 1 50 and 0 5 1 71 mg l respectively fig 2 and the wq cpi and tli were lower than 0 12 and 20 respectively fig 3 this is because the ecological land was maintained well and the proportion of degraded land and agricultural land was relatively low in the watershed in the past 15 years figs 6a b previous studies have shown that ecological land s soil and water conservation function is stronger than agricultural land and degraded land wei et al 2020 more precipitation is required to form surface runoff in the watershed which largely reduces surface pollutants entering the lake chen et al 2021b li et al 2015 therefore lakes with a high proportion of forest and grassland in the basins have lower pollutants and a more stable water environment dai et al 2017 grumbine 2014 3 4 water quality of ygp lakes affected by meteorological conditions appropriate precipitation can dilute pollutants and reduce the load pressure of a lake huang et al 2021 while low precipitation leads to a reduction in lake water storage shrinkage of lakeside wetland areas and a weakening of pollutant dilution ho and michalak 2019 jia et al 2021 in 2009 2013 the ygp experienced a rare extreme drought with annual precipitation of 660 09 803 46 mm for the entire lake area and average precipitation of only 747 10 mm fig 7 therefore the ws of the total lake area decreased to 2 77 1010 m3 in 2012 and that in most lakes showed a downward trend fig 4a the decrease in precipitation and ws may be the key factors responsible for the high tli and wq cpi of the ygp lakes in 2013 liu et al 2010 xiang et al 2021 in 2013 tli and wq cpi were 45 33 and 0 44 respectively both of which were the highest values between 2010 and 2020 fig 3 moreover qll yll and xyl exhibited severe eutrophication in 2013 the wq cpi of yll was as high as 1 37 which meant a heavily polluted state fig 3 table s2 from 2015 to 2018 with the increase in precipitation in the ygp fig 7 the ws increased fig 4a and wq cpi and tli decreased fig 3 during this period the annual precipitation in this region was 946 04 1010 93 mm with an average of 980 84 mm fig 7 the overall ws increased to 2 97 1010 m3 in 2018 fig 4a and wq cpi and tli decreased to 0 28 and 42 40 respectively fig 3 in the ygp lake region there is no direct correlation between air temperature and lake water quality fig 5 however the temperature in this area has an upward trend fig 7 which may be one of the reasons for the increase in the frequency of algae blooms in ygp lakes song et al 2021 in addition of the ygp lakes the water quality of ehl xyl and others showed seasonal variability the wq cpi and tli were significantly higher from may to october than in the other months fig s1 it is primarily related to the heavy rainfall leading to no point source pollutants and soil nutrients flowing into the lakes through surface runoff during monsoons li et al 2020 ran et al 2022 xiang et al 2021 in the ygp lake region where bare land and cultivation on steep land are common fig 6a the meteorological characteristics of rainy and hot rings during the same period aggravated the water and soil loss in the basin resulting in the flow of sand into the lake along with the runoff richardson et al 2021 yu et al 2021 3 5 water quality of ygp lakes affected by regional lake protection strategy the water quality of the ygp lakes is also related to the local environmental lake protection strategies zhou et al 2017 however because the water quality changing process of ygp lakes which have varied pollution statuses was different environmental governance and restoration of the lake region should be targeted lin et al 2020 hpl was the most seriously polluted lake in ygp the pollutants exceeded the standard class iii severely figs 2 3 therefore government financed environmental actions were undertaken earlier for these lakes such as improving the treatment rate of urban sewage and industrial wastewater optimizing the land use structure and reducing the use of agricultural fertilizers chen et al 2020 huang et al 2014a therefore the water quality of these lakes improved significantly after 2010 fig 3 the tp tn codmn and bod5 decreased by 0 116 1 36 5 44 and 3 36 mg l respectively fig 2 and the tli and wq cpi also decreased from 71 81 to 65 53 and 0 96 to 0 52 respectively fig 3 nevertheless tli wq cpi and pollutant concentration in mpl showed an increasing trend in 2010 2020 figs 2 3 this highlighted that the restoration efforts in mpl were less than the increase in pollution loads which meant that mpl should be one of the key regions for environmental prevention and management in ygp it is necessary to further strengthen protection and governance and use targeted measures to avoid the continued deterioration of mpl water quality zhang 2016 furthermore the pressure to improve water quality in plateau lakes will continue to increase due to numerous processes of environmental succession and ecological response and the lag in improving lake governance dai et al 2017 yang et al 2016 therefore to prevent secondary pollution of ygp lakes regional lake protection strategies should be implemented on a long term basis li et al 2015 pan et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 generally there is a lack of studies on lake water quality and its driving factors in the ygp region this study investigated multiple water quality indicators morphological characteristics meteorological factors and anthropogenic activities in 11 ygp lakes from 2005 to 2020 the water quality of the 11 ygp lakes showed a decreasing trend and it was classified as heavily moderately and slightly polluted from 2005 to 2020 according to the pollutant concentration before 2010 extensive mining activities and limited water depth storage capacity and w t ratio resulted in poor self purification ability and water quality of hpl however after 2010 the pollutant concentration tli and wqi cpi of hpl showed a downward trend through ecological restoration long lhrt suitable nutrient concentrations and elevated temperatures increased the risk of algal blooms in mpl a large area of ecological land in the catchment and the strong self purification ability of the water body contributed to the good water quality of spl from 2005 to 2020 4 conclusions yunnan guizhou plateau ygp lakes were categorized into three main types heavily moderately and slightly polluted lakes hpl mpl and spl based on data collected from 2005 to 2020 the pollutants in the hpl exceeded the standard class iii severely tli was more than the eutrophic level the value of tli 60 and wq cpi ranged from 0 49 to 0 69 tp and tn concentrations in the mpl were 0 023 0 045 and 0 44 1 04 mg l respectively which showed the risk of exceeding the standard or class iii beyond the class iii pollution limit lakes are likely to have eutrophication issues the water environment of the spl was considerable and it was in an oligotrophic state in terms of time series pollutant concentrations increased significantly in most ygp lakes in 2005 2010 hpl s nutrients wq cpi and tli were reduced in 2010 2015 but the water quality continued to deteriorate in several mpl or spl in 2015 2020 except for codmn water quality indicators in most ygp lakes decreased proportionally the water quality of 11 ygp lakes exhibited spatiotemporal heterogeneity due to the integrated effects of natural lake characteristics climatic conditions human activities and regional lake protection strategies lakes in the ygp with small water terrestrial area ratios water storage capacity and water depth had poor water quality and were sensitive to environmental changes water quality levels corresponded to changes in agriculture pollution and land degradation land degradation droughts and rising temperatures in the ygp lake region have led to a marked decrease in water quality and an increased risk of algal blooms this study provides critical scientific data which can provide an essential base to improve the ecological health and sustainability of ygp lakes credit authorship contribution statement jiao ran formal analysis conceptualization software writing original

1221,the yunnan guizhou plateau ygp lakes are the typical plateau rift lakes and an important water source in southwest china however there is a scarcity of research on its spatiotemporal water quality variations and driving factors especially on long term scales herein multiple water quality indicators for 11 natural lakes on the ygp were measured from 2005 to 2020 in this study the effects of natural lake attributes human activities and meteorological conditions on water quality were also analyzed the results showed that the water quality of the ygp lakes tended to degrade and was divided into heavy medium and light pollution types total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn permanganate index codmn and biochemical oxygen demand bod5 increased by 14 69 14 44 22 61 and 11 26 respectively from 2005 to 2020 natural attributes of lakes and land use types were the main reasons for the spatial heterogeneity of water quality in ygp in contrast the temporal evolution of lake water quality was mainly related to human activities and climatic conditions the smaller the water terrestrial area ratio water storage capacity and water depth the easier the eutrophication and the worser the water quality of ygp lakes land degradation accelerated the deterioration of water quality in plateau lakes while ecological land played an improving role this study summarizes the water quality changes and influencing factors in ygp lakes over the past 15 years which can provide a scientific database reference for water environment protection in ygp graphical abstract unlabelled

ecosystem and inland water resource lakes regulate climate record environmental changes and maintain ecosystem balance and biodiversity carpenter et al 2011 mammides 2020 since the start of the 20th century the ecological health and sustainability of lakes have been under serious threat due to rapid urbanization global climate change and high anthropogenic activities ho and goethals 2019 le et al 2010 pollutants from industrial urban and agriculture sectors have accelerated lake eutrophication li et al 2020 and global warming stimulated cyanobacterial blooms and decreased lake water storage fang et al 2018 tong et al 2021 various factors including climate change sediment deposition and land reclamation are causing the shrinkage of the total lake area and lakes are disappearing not only in china but around the world choiński et al 2012 yang and lu 2014 in turn the decline in the lake area and water quality not only reduces the ecological function of the lake and its catchment but also threatens human living conditions grumbine 2014 zhou et al 2022 china has 2693 lakes with a total area of 81 414 6 km2 and the lakes account for approximately 0 9 of the country s territory liu et al 2010 about one third of these lakes are freshwater lakes le et al 2010 however of the 67 major lakes in china 80 have been polluted and 27 show extremely high nitrogen and phosphorus levels huang et al 2014b le et al 2010 liu et al 2010 in southwestern china several environmental problems have appeared in the yunnan guizhou plateau ygp lakes severe blue green algae blooms occurred in erhai lake in 2003 after which its eutrophication index remained around 40 indicating that the lake was in the initial stages of eutrophication lin et al 2021 moreover yangzonghai lake was catastrophically contaminated with arsenic in 2008 with concentrations as high as 0 128 mg l in the lake chen et al 2015 furthermore the average annual concentration of total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn in dianchi lake were 0 77 and 8 75 mg l during 1988 2018 gao et al 2021 respectively and tn in yilong lake remained at a high level 2 15 mg l in 2016 2018 sui et al 2022 the ygp lakes are mostly rift lakes with limited catchment areas which have a weak purification effect on the inflow of pollutants lin et al 2020 wang et al 2022 meanwhile the ygp lakes have abundant inflow streams but few outflow channels leading to long lake residence periods and easy accumulation of pollutants qin et al 2020 more recently urban sewage industrial wastewater and agricultural non point source pollutants have aggravated water pollution and eutrophication in the ygp lakes as the basin s population has increased and economic development has taken place chen et al 2021a yu et al 2021 since the 1970s the water quality of dianchi lake has been adversely affected by domestic and industrial pollution sources in the basin wang et al 2021a and non point source agricultural pollution was the primary reason for algal blooms in 2000 2009 huang et al 2014a wu et al 2021 found that industrial wastewater and tourism were the main driving factors that led to water quality deterioration in yilong lake from 2008 to 2013 lin et al 2020 showed that the algal bloom in erhai lake in 2013 was due to a combination of increasing temperatures and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations ran et al 2022 pointed out that warming temperatures and urbanization led to water quality degeneration in qionghai lake before 2017 the spatiotemporal variability of water quality in different ygp lakes is not the same as they suffer from various anthropogenic and natural pressures chen et al 2021a wang et al 2022 however these current water quality studies in ygp lakes only focus on a single lake or several contributing factors and there is a lack of overall understanding of the long term impact of a combination of factors such as natural morphological features human activities and climatic conditions on water quality throughout the ygp lakes this study investigated water quality parameters trophic level index tli water quality comprehensive pollution index wq cpi morphological characteristics meteorological factors and anthropogenic activities of 11 ygp lakes from 2005 to 2020 the objectives were to 1 explore the spatiotemporal variations of the water quality and eutrophication in the ygp lakes during 2005 2020 2 investigate the lake s natural characteristics human activities and meteorological conditions changes in the ygp lake area 3 analyze the driving factors of spatiotemporal variability in the water quality of ygp lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study aera the yunnan guizhou plateau ygp is one of the 5th richest regions with natural lakes in

studies have analyzed the excessive pollutants and eutrophication in ygp lakes chen et al 2020 lin et al 2021 however most of them focused on only a single lake dai et al 2017 huang et al 2014a ran et al 2022 in this study the water quality of the 11ygp lakes was investigated it showed significant spatial heterogeneity from 2005 to 2020 fig 2 the average concentrations of tp tn codmn and bod5 in the dcl qll yll and xyl were 0 152 2 66 10 13 and 5 06 mg l fig 2 which were higher than the limit values of gb class iii mep 2002 therefore these four lakes were heavily polluted lakes hpl in addition tli in the hpl was 64 84 at the eutrophic level and wq cpi was 0 64 which was significantly higher than that in other ygp lakes figs 3a b yzhl chhl ehl cahl and qhl can be classified as moderately polluted lakes mpl due to their tli and wq cpi were 43 67 and 0 24 respectively figs 3a b and eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms occurred from time to time lin et al 2021 meanwhile the tp tn codmn and bod5 in the mpl ranged from 0 023 to 0 045 0 44 1 04 2 35 6 21 and 1 17 2 07 mg l respectively indicating a risk of exceeding the standard class iii fig 2 the water environment of fxl and lgl was the best in ygp values of the biochemical indices wq cpi and tli in the 2 slightly polluted lakes spl were low figs 2 3 correspondingly the spatial patterns in the water quality of the ygp were also well illustrated by the hierarchical ca where the 11 lakes were divided into heavy medium and light pollution types fig 2c from 2005 to 2020 the evolution and trends of water quality in the 11 ygp lakes in different pollution states hpl mpl and spl were different at different stages 2005 2010 2010 2015 and 2015 2020 figs 3c f water quality degradation in the ygp lakes was most severe in 2005 2010 with pollutant concentrations increasing significantly in most lakes figs 3c f hpl s water quality improved in 2010 2015 with reduced nutrients wq cpi and tli but continued to deteriorate in several mpl or spl fig 3 during 2015 2020 the tp tn and bod5 in most lakes decreased proportionally but the codmn in mpl and spl increased significantly figs 3c f nonetheless the water quality of the ygp lakes was affected by a combination of lake basin morphological characteristics human activities climate change and government financed investments in environmental restoration huang et al 2014b liu et al 2010 mammides 2020 3 2 water quality of ygp lakes affected by lake morphological characteristics lake morphological characteristics such as water depth water storage ws and water terrestrial area w t ratio are important factors that affect water quality jacquemin et al 2019 qin et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 the ecological stability and self purification capacity of the lake is related to the water depth and ws xu et al 2020 generally the larger the water depth and ws of a lake the stronger the dilution of contaminants qin et al 2020 xiang et al 2021 the four severely polluted lakes in ygp are shallow lakes the mean depths of dcl qll yll and xyl were 5 4 2 7 and 7 m table 1 respectively except for dcl the ws of hpl was 2 108 m3 table 1 fig 4a in general shallow lakes have a weak capacity for self purification and then environmental degradation is evident when pollutant concentrations are above the ecological threshold for a long time huang et al 2021 moreover nutrients in the sediment of shallow lakes are prone to resuspension due to wind or fish disturbance increasing management difficulties and prolonging restoration cycles ran et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 in comparison fxl and lgl as the second and third deepest freshwater lakes in china showed an average depth of 87 and 40 3 m and ws of 2 06 1010 and 2 25 109 m3 respectively table 1 fig 4a hence the lake environment was stable and dilution capacity was strong dai et al 2017 exogenous pollutants can be fully diluted or settled to the lake bottom qin et al 2020 therefore the water quality of shallow lakes dcl qll etc is worse than sub deep lakes ehl qhl etc and worse than deep lakes fxl lgl in ygp table 1 figs 2 3 generally the quantity and quality of terrestrial nutrients nutrients mainly carried away with stormwater runoff can be determined and measured at the catchment areas of the lakes nutrients are considered key driving factors in eutrophication and cyanobacterial blooms in lakes therefore impacting the sustainability and ecological health of lakes jacquemin et al 2019 wang et al 2021a typically a large catchment has a dense river system and the pollutants are input through inflowing rivers so the w t ratio can reflect the exogenous load pressure on the lake dai et al 2017 tammelin and kauppila 2018 our study shows that tp tn codmn bod5 tli and wq cpi values are negatively correlated with lake w t ratio p 0 05 with larger w t ratios indicating better water quality figs 2 5 lakes with large w t ratios have limited catchment areas and great water areas responding weakly to events in the watershed zhou et al 2022 in contrast lakes with small w t ratios are prone to deterioration and eutrophication due to their small water area receiving great amounts of pollutants from a large catchment jacquemin et al 2019 liu et al 2010 moreover seasonal water quality differences were found in lakes with w t ratios 0 11 such as dcl ehl and qll figs 4b s1 this indicates that this type of lake is sensitive to environmental changes kopàček et al 2011 furthermore lake hydraulic retention time lhrt and recharge coefficients lrc are important hydrological factors that affect water quality huang et al 2021 the lhrt of dongting lake dtl and hongze lake hzl is only 20 and 27 days and lrc is 483 1 and 98 9 respectively fig 4c the strong mobility and water exchange periods of the eastern plain lakes make them have strong climate change adaptability and pollutant transfer capacity and are less prone to large scale cyanobacterial bloom li et al 2020 liu et al 2010 however ygp is a region with the most active development of rifted lakes and the 11 natural lakes are all formed in geologically rifted structures zhuo et al 2021 lrc is relatively low 10 fig 4c and the water supply mainly depends on rainfall and inflowing runoff dai et al 2017 additionally most of the lakes in ygp are semi closed with many tributaries entering the lake but few channels to drain the water qian and long 2019 yu et al 2020 which results in a long lhrt fig 4c the lhrt of dcl and ehl is more than two years whereas that of fxl and lgl is approximately 166 94 and 38 41 years fig 4c respectively long lhrt increases the retention time of pollutants in the lakes and amplifies the promoting effect of nutrient load on algal growth ho and michalak 2019 song et al 2021 which makes large areas of cyanobacterial blooms still occur frequently in mesotrophic lakes such as qhl and ehl ran et al 2022 wang et al 2021b 3 3 water quality of ygp lakes affected by human activities human activities may be the main reason for the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of water quality in freshwater lakes mammides 2020 van meter et al 2016 a mass of pollution loads flows into the lakes because of population explosion intensification of industrial activities and inappropriate land use compositions chen et al 2020 grumbine 2014 schaldach et al 2018 resulting in the deterioration of the water quality of taihu lake thl chaohu lake chl and dcl huang et al 2021 from 2005 to 2020 the concentrations of tp tn codmn and bod5 in ygp lakes have increased with average amplitudes of 14 69 14 44 22 61 and 11 26 respectively and the greatest increase observed in codmn figs 2 3 meanwhile the ecological land and agricultural land area proportion of the ygp lake region decreased by 0 47 and 1 45 respectively and the degraded land area proportion increased by 1 91 fig 6b fig 5 illustrates that the water quality of ygp lakes shows significant correlation with land use patterns p 0 05 these results indicates that anthropogenic activities and land degradation in the ygp lake basins have gradually intensified and have significantly affected water quality land use types can affect the production distribution and transportation of pollutants in the watershed pak et al 2021 wei et al 2020 among the ygp lake basins hpl had a relatively high degraded land area proportion 6 97 7 98 and 10 37 in 2005 2010 and 2018 respectively fig 6b the degraded land mainly consisted of urban land fig 6b which had become the main pollution source of nitrogen and organic matter in many basins chen et al 2021b therefore the water quality of hpl was significantly affected by domestic sewage and industrial wastewater from the urban land huang et al 2014a wu et al 2021 and tn tp codmn bod5 concentrations were higher than in other lakes fig 2 meanwhile the intensity of cultivation in qll xyl and yll was relatively high figs 6a b the cultivated land was not only near the lake area but also accounted for a great proportion of the watershed fig 6a resulting in a large amount of non point source load entering lakes liu et al 2021 poyatos et al 2003 furthermore mining construction lands can be found along hpl figs 6a b which exacerbated the deterioration of lake water quality chen et al 2021b dai et al 2017 for example the mining of phosphorite in the xyl basin was the reason why the tp in the lake exceeded the standard of inferior class v yu et al 2010 in the mpl watershed yzhl chhl ehl cahl and qhl the average degraded land areal proportions in 2005 and 2010 were only 2 14 and 2 63 fig 6b respectively the annual mean per capital gdp was 14 156 55 rmb yuan in 2010 fig 6c it indicates that the intensity of human activity in the mpl basin was relatively low the pollution load into the lake was not very high in 2005 2010 lin et al 2021 therefore the water quality was preferable when compared to that of hpl fig 2 however mpl water quality showed an overall downward trend in 2005 2020 with tp tn codmn and bod5 increasing by 0 014 0 26 1 38 and 0 80 mg l respectively figs 2 3 the tli and wq cpi also increased and showed maximum values of 44 89 and 0 26 respectively in 2017 fig 3 this is because of the intensification of anthropogenic activities in the mpl basins chen et al 2015 yu et al 2010 yu et al 2021 degraded land and per capita gdp tended to increase year after year and ecological land decreased gradually except for qhl figs 6b c moreover agricultural land in the mpl watersheds invariably accounted for significant percentages fig 6b this means that agricultural pollutants such as nutrients agricultural films chemical fertilizers and livestock manure can enter the lake during the rainy season through surface runoff or irrigation returns chen et al 2021b wei et al 2020 from 2005 to 2020 no significant variations in water quality were detected in fxl and lgl the tp tn codmn and bod5 of the two lakes were 0 005 0 012 0 13 0 20 0 96 1 50 and 0 5 1 71 mg l respectively fig 2 and the wq cpi and tli were lower than 0 12 and 20 respectively fig 3 this is because the ecological land was maintained well and the proportion of degraded land and agricultural land was relatively low in the watershed in the past 15 years figs 6a b previous studies have shown that ecological land s soil and water conservation function is stronger than agricultural land and degraded land wei et al 2020 more precipitation is required to form surface runoff in the watershed which largely reduces surface pollutants entering the lake chen et al 2021b li et al 2015 therefore lakes with a high proportion of forest and grassland in the basins have lower pollutants and a more stable water environment dai et al 2017 grumbine 2014 3 4 water quality of ygp lakes affected by meteorological conditions appropriate precipitation can dilute pollutants and reduce the load pressure of a lake huang et al 2021 while low precipitation leads to a reduction in lake water storage shrinkage of lakeside wetland areas and a weakening of pollutant dilution ho and michalak 2019 jia et al 2021 in 2009 2013 the ygp experienced a rare extreme drought with annual precipitation of 660 09 803 46 mm for the entire lake area and average precipitation of only 747 10 mm fig 7 therefore the ws of the total lake area decreased to 2 77 1010 m3 in 2012 and that in most lakes showed a downward trend fig 4a the decrease in precipitation and ws may be the key factors responsible for the high tli and wq cpi of the ygp lakes in 2013 liu et al 2010 xiang et al 2021 in 2013 tli and wq cpi were 45 33 and 0 44 respectively both of which were the highest values between 2010 and 2020 fig 3 moreover qll yll and xyl exhibited severe eutrophication in 2013 the wq cpi of yll was as high as 1 37 which meant a heavily polluted state fig 3 table s2 from 2015 to 2018 with the increase in precipitation in the ygp fig 7 the ws increased fig 4a and wq cpi and tli decreased fig 3 during this period the annual precipitation in this region was 946 04 1010 93 mm with an average of 980 84 mm fig 7 the overall ws increased to 2 97 1010 m3 in 2018 fig 4a and wq cpi and tli decreased to 0 28 and 42 40 respectively fig 3 in the ygp lake region there is no direct correlation between air temperature and lake water quality fig 5 however the temperature in this area has an upward trend fig 7 which may be one of the reasons for the increase in the frequency of algae blooms in ygp lakes song et al 2021 in addition of the ygp lakes the water quality of ehl xyl and others showed seasonal variability the wq cpi and tli were significantly higher from may to october than in the other months fig s1 it is primarily related to the heavy rainfall leading to no point source pollutants and soil nutrients flowing into the lakes through surface runoff during monsoons li et al 2020 ran et al 2022 xiang et al 2021 in the ygp lake region where bare land and cultivation on steep land are common fig 6a the meteorological characteristics of rainy and hot rings during the same period aggravated the water and soil loss in the basin resulting in the flow of sand into the lake along with the runoff richardson et al 2021 yu et al 2021 3 5 water quality of ygp lakes affected by regional lake protection strategy the water quality of the ygp lakes is also related to the local environmental lake protection strategies zhou et al 2017 however because the water quality changing process of ygp lakes which have varied pollution statuses was different environmental governance and restoration of the lake region should be targeted lin et al 2020 hpl was the most seriously polluted lake in ygp the pollutants exceeded the standard class iii severely figs 2 3 therefore government financed environmental actions were undertaken earlier for these lakes such as improving the treatment rate of urban sewage and industrial wastewater optimizing the land use structure and reducing the use of agricultural fertilizers chen et al 2020 huang et al 2014a therefore the water quality of these lakes improved significantly after 2010 fig 3 the tp tn codmn and bod5 decreased by 0 116 1 36 5 44 and 3 36 mg l respectively fig 2 and the tli and wq cpi also decreased from 71 81 to 65 53 and 0 96 to 0 52 respectively fig 3 nevertheless tli wq cpi and pollutant concentration in mpl showed an increasing trend in 2010 2020 figs 2 3 this highlighted that the restoration efforts in mpl were less than the increase in pollution loads which meant that mpl should be one of the key regions for environmental prevention and management in ygp it is necessary to further strengthen protection and governance and use targeted measures to avoid the continued deterioration of mpl water quality zhang 2016 furthermore the pressure to improve water quality in plateau lakes will continue to increase due to numerous processes of environmental succession and ecological response and the lag in improving lake governance dai et al 2017 yang et al 2016 therefore to prevent secondary pollution of ygp lakes regional lake protection strategies should be implemented on a long term basis li et al 2015 pan et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 generally there is a lack of studies on lake water quality and its driving factors in the ygp region this study investigated multiple water quality indicators morphological characteristics meteorological factors and anthropogenic activities in 11 ygp lakes from 2005 to 2020 the water quality of the 11 ygp lakes showed a decreasing trend and it was classified as heavily moderately and slightly polluted from 2005 to 2020 according to the pollutant concentration before 2010 extensive mining activities and limited water depth storage capacity and w t ratio resulted in poor self purification ability and water quality of hpl however after 2010 the pollutant concentration tli and wqi cpi of hpl showed a downward trend through ecological restoration long lhrt suitable nutrient concentrations and elevated temperatures increased the risk of algal blooms in mpl a large area of ecological land in the catchment and the strong self purification ability of the water body contributed to the good water quality of spl from 2005 to 2020 4 conclusions yunnan guizhou plateau ygp lakes were categorized into three main types heavily moderately and slightly polluted lakes hpl mpl and spl based on data collected from 2005 to 2020 the pollutants in the hpl exceeded the standard class iii severely tli was more than the eutrophic level the value of tli 60 and wq cpi ranged from 0 49 to 0 69 tp and tn concentrations in the mpl were 0 023 0 045 and 0 44 1 04 mg l respectively which showed the risk of exceeding the standard or class iii beyond the class iii pollution limit lakes are likely to have eutrophication issues the water environment of the spl was considerable and it was in an oligotrophic state in terms of time series pollutant concentrations increased significantly in most ygp lakes in 2005 2010 hpl s nutrients wq cpi and tli were reduced in 2010 2015 but the water quality continued to deteriorate in several mpl or spl in 2015 2020 except for codmn water quality indicators in most ygp lakes decreased proportionally the water quality of 11 ygp lakes exhibited spatiotemporal heterogeneity due to the integrated effects of natural lake characteristics climatic conditions human activities and regional lake protection strategies lakes in the ygp with small water terrestrial area ratios water storage capacity and water depth had poor water quality and were sensitive to environmental changes water quality levels corresponded to changes in agriculture pollution and land degradation land degradation droughts and rising temperatures in the ygp lake region have led to a marked decrease in water quality and an increased risk of algal blooms this study provides critical scientific data which can provide an essential base to improve the ecological health and sustainability of ygp lakes credit authorship contribution statement jiao ran formal analysis conceptualization software writing original

1222,with the increasing requirement of maintaining world energy security and strategic reserves oil storage and transportation facilities are being built at a large scale taking the safe and efficient operation of petroleum storage projects as the goal a set of experimental apparatus to investigate the migration of contaminants in fractures filled with media was developed to predict and evaluate the environmental risk of oil contaminants leakage a multiphase numerical flow model based on comsol was built based on the laboratory experimental model specifically the migration behaviour of light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl through a sand filled fractured medium was studied by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations image and chemical analyses methods were used to monitor and study lnapl migration behaviour for varying grain sizes of porous medium filling the fractures and varying groundwater table elevations laboratory experimental results showed that the lnapl migration velocity in filled fracture network was significantly faster than that in adjoining porous media during the initial stage of infiltration the migration velocity increased with the relative permeability of filled sand which was closely related to the van genuchten vg model parameters α and n lnapl migrated downward with the falling groundwater table and became entrapped with the rising groundwater table and the amount of entrapment depended on vg model parameters hydrogeological parameters were calibrated and lnapl migration in filled fractured media was predicted using the calibrated numerical model simulation results revealed that fracture inclination had an important influence on lnapl migration in filled fractured media and its migration velocity decreased with a decrease in fracture inclination these research results can be applied to the control and remediation of oil contaminated sites in fractured rock settings such as at underground oil storage tanks and caverns as well as at underground oil pipelines graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords contaminant migration fractures filled with porous media laboratory experiment light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl numerical simulation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction with the rapid development of the petrochemical industry leakage of oil storage and transportation facilities has become a prominent worldwide environmental problem the corresponding oil pollution problem has become an important research topic for the international scientific community abd rahman et al 2018 cavelan et al 2022 crude oil and various refined petroleum products such as gasoline diesel jet fuel kerosene lube oil and coal tar are some of the most prevalent organic contaminants in groundwater the main pollution sources are petroleum gas stations oil pipelines and oil storage tanks compared to heavy metal contaminants and inorganic contaminants petroleum contaminants are generally persistent organic contaminants that are relatively insoluble in water they can be highly toxic and difficult to degrade compared to other common contaminants the insoluble non volatile portion is termed non aqueous phase liquid napl including light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl and dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl wang et al 2002 lnapl has lower density than water causing it to position on top of the capillary fringe above the water table in an unconfined aquifer it should also be noted that lnapl may be entrapped below the groundwater table under fluctuating groundwater table conditions with the lnapl amount entrapped depending on the pressure head the most typical representative pollutants are benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex in contrast dnapls have densities larger than water causing it to migrate downwards in the vadose zone and through the saturated zone until it encounters low permeability material it is mainly composed of chlorinated organic solvents coal tar and mineral oil according to liu et al 2013b 7 of the more than four billion tons of oil extracted each year reentered the subsurface environment the infiltration and migration of petroleum contaminants have caused serious pollution of groundwater in many countries and regions threatening the safety of local drinking water the us environmental protection agency has regarded gasoline stations as one of the largest sources of groundwater pollution camp et al 2010 in china about 6 0 109 kg of oil enters the environment every year which results in serious pollution of the atmosphere water and soil liu et al 2022 due to the increasingly serious problem of groundwater contamination many researchers have conducted research on napl migration and its subsequent behaviour in the subsurface alazaiza et al 2015 2017 2020a 2020b 2021 azimi et al 2020 chen and wu 2010 mclaren et al 2012 martel et al 2019 onaa et al 2021 xiao 2017 the subsurface migration of oil is a multiphase flow process and various numerical and analytical methods have been developed by researchers alazaiza et al 2015 2018 2019 cavelan et al 2022 martel et al 2019 onaa et al 2021 slough et al 1999a yamamoto and pruess 2004 the pollution caused by oil leakage in fractured geologic media is particularly prominent and hardisty et al 1998 first systematically studied the lnapl migration theory in fractured rock and explored the effect of groundwater levels on the redistribution of lnapl in a fracture a laboratory two dimensional sandbox was designed by yu et al 2009 to investigate the effect of ethanol on the migration of gasoline pollution plume and the redistribution process of the pollution plume was simulated by the compflow bio model yu et al 2009 alazaiza et al 2020b 2021 used a simplified image analysis method to study the effects of groundwater level fluctuations and water infiltration on lnapl distribution and mobilization liu et al 2013a conducted lnapl infiltration experiments in a two dimensional sand tank and obtained the infiltration characteristics of lnapl at different times when oil pollutants leaked they were mainly affected by capillary pressure viscous gravitational and buoyancy forces during the process of infiltration into the subsurface slough et al 1999a 1999b studied the coupled nonlinear compositional equations describing multiphase multi component flow and transport in discretely fractured carbonate rock for various relationships between capillary pressure and saturation utilizing the compflow numerical model huang et al 2011 studied the effect of a vertical fracture on horizontal seepage in unsaturated fractured rock mass through a laboratory experiment and numerical simulation toluene c6h5ch3 was selected by lu et al 2017 as the representative pollutant of lnapl and the residual distribution of lnapl and the interaction mechanism in the fracture water lnapl system were revealed preferential flow was observed by huang et al 2020 through a laboratory physical model and the mechanisms of lnapl migration and remediation were studied through displacement experiments however most studies on lnapl migration have mainly focused on porous media and fractured media and only few studies have been conducted for petroleum based contaminants in fractured rocks filled with porous media such as gravels sands silts and clays which we refer to as filled fractured media from now on shen et al 2022 investigated the mobilization characteristics of lnapl under unsaturated and saturated conditions by laboratory experiments and obtained an empirical equation for the cumulative height of lnapl in filled fractured media the authors hypothesized that groundwater level fluctuation would impact lnapl migration but no further study was carried out dou et al 2012 used the lattice boltzmann method lbm to investigate the napl migration mechanism in a single filled fracture and analyzed the tailing effect caused by the heterogeneity of filling material the dense and low permeability rocks are often fractured due to various geological processes numerous fractures intersect stagger and connect with each other to form an intricate fracture network inside the rock mass in addition the fracture network of rock formations may be filled with various types of porous media originating from overlying sedimentary layers fractures filled with various loose sediments have been considered as an important pathway for water and contaminant migration that can contribute to significant groundwater contamination wealthall et al 2001 chen and kinzelbach 2002 dou et al 2012 wu et al 2013 markovaara koivisto et al 2014 vega et al 2015 nara et al 2018 guo et al 2019a wang et al 2019 dou et al 2022 sui et al 2022 the main objective of this study is to investigate the migration behaviour of lnapl in filled fractured media by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations diesel was selected as a lnapl due to its relatively high mobility image and chemical analyses methods were used to monitor and study the lnapl migration process and entrapment characteristics in filled fractured media for comparison purposes multiple lnapl infiltration experiments were conducted with three different particle sizes 0 15 0 3 mm 0 25 0 5 mm and 0 5 1 0 mm of filled sand furthermore a multiphase numerical flow model based on comsol was built based on the laboratory experimental model to validate the laboratory experimental results and to investigate the effect of fracture inclination on the migration behaviour of lnapl different from previous studies the effect of the characteristics of filled sand groundwater level fluctuation and fracture inclination on lnapl migration in filled fractured media were systematically investigated and studied finally the results of the experimental and numerical methods applied to the migration behaviour of lnapl were discussed research results from this study could provide important scientific basis for the improved characterization and remediation of petroleum contaminated sites consisting of filled fractured media 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 experimental equipment the designed experimental equipment was mainly composed of two parts the main experimental model and the monitoring and data acquisition systems fig 1 the main experimental model was made of 15 mm thick plexiglass and it had dimensions of 100 cm 80 cm 5 cm the water flow system was mainly composed of three parts the upstream and downstream water tanks that were used to control the groundwater level and a device for injecting distilled water or oil the bottom and sides of the model had drainage holes which were used to allow any entrapped air to escape these holes were closed during experiments with changes in groundwater level the naturally fractured marble was fitted into the model and the gap between the rock surface and the plexiglass was sealed and fixed with glass glue symmetrical ports d 0 3 cm 33 pairs along the fractures on both sides of the model were used to collect lnapl samples and to measure pressure with pressure transducers the monitoring and data acquisition systems consisted of three parts image acquisition lnapl sample collection and an automatic pressure monitoring system a high definition digital camera eos 60d canon inc was used to record the experimental process in real time and to take photos regularly it was kept at the same distance of 1 2 m from the experimental model during each experiment the dynamic range of the camera was 14 bits jpeg and raw 16384 gy levels the camera has an 18 megapixels cmos image sensor 5184 3456 pixels 22 3 mm 14 9 mm and has a 67 mm lens ef s18 135 mm f 3 5 5 6 is canon inc it has an iso value of 100 6400 but can be extended to 12 800 to avoid displacement and vibration the camera was connected to a computer and the image capture process was controlled using the eos utility software the image capture time was set to 24 h and the shooting intervals for different stages were 5 s 30 s 1 min and 10 min lnapl samples were collected regularly from sampling ports placed at different positions of the fractures and they were numbered and sealed an ultraviolet spectrophotometer model 754 automatic shanghai jinghua instrument factory was employed to measure the absorbance of lnapl samples thirty three pressure transducers xgzp6867a wuhu cfsensor co ltd and an automatic high frequency data collection system ads1256 24adc shenzhen xuanwei electronic technology co ltd monitored absolute pressure at different positions in the fractures at numbered ports the temperature of the room was maintained at 20 1 c during all experiments 2 2 experimental materials 1 tracer solution as one of the most common organic light non aqueous pollutants no 0 diesel purchased from jiyin avenue gas station cnpc nanjing 31 53 00 n 118 47 35 e was selected as the tracer because it has been widely used worldwide in various industrial applications moreover compared with other oil pollutants it is less volatile has lower toxicity and is less flammable no 0 diesel has a boiling point of 180 320 c and its density is 840 kg m3 with a dynamic viscosity of 3 55 4 05 mpa s while it has an interfacial tension of 0 025 n m sudan iii c22h16n4o tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute yu et al 2009 pan et al 2018 huang et al 2020 with a relative atomic mass of 352 40 was selected as the dyeing agent due to its bright red colour and its high miscibility with diesel to determine the amount of sudan iii to be added results reported by kechavarzi et al 2000 were considered and the colour comparisons of dyed diesel with different amounts of sudan iii were conducted specifically 0 1 g of sudan iii was added to a square barrel containing 2 l of diesel and they were thoroughly mixed and sealed until used for experiments shen et al 2022 this percentage had a good visual effect when observing diesel migration through the plexiglass the addition of sudan iii would not alter the physical and chemical properties of diesel moreover sudan iii did not transfer between water and diesel and was not absorbed by sand particles alazaiza et al 2020b 2 the fractured rock mass consisted of a marble slab with a size of 50 cm 50 cm 5 cm which was cut into six irregular pieces at a stone processing factory the marble rock matrix was dense and impermeable prior to the start of each experiment the marble was washed with distilled water to remove any fine particles that might be present then they were spliced into a plexiglass frame to form a network of three fractures named as f1 f2 and f3 in order to simulate the geological environment of large filled fractures and faulted fractured zones in the field and facilitate the measurement of experimental data fu 2013 fractures f1 and f2 were positioned to parallel with an inclination of 78 7 and an aperture of 2 cm while the inclination of fracture f3 was 60 and the aperture was 3 cm these inclinations were measured from the horizontal plane the fracture parameters in the present study were similar to those in the study by shen et al 2022 also it should be noted that three fractures were smoothed to avoid the effect of roughness 3 for the experiments standard sand with particle sizes ranging between 0 075 2 0 mm was obtained from xiamen eso standard sand co ltd china three standard sands with different particle size were obtained after full wave vibration as follows a 0 15 0 30 mm b 0 25 0 50 mm and c 0 50 1 00 mm prior to the start of each experiment three standard sands were washed with the distilled water and they were used as filling materials inside fractures and around the marble slabs table 1 shows the main physical parameters of three standard sands 2 3 lnapl concentration absorbance standard curve the absorbance of the diesel tracer was measured with a uv spectrophotometer model 754 automatic shanghai jinghua instrument factory lnapl is sparingly soluble in water while it is miscible with organic solvent ccl4 ccl4 solution has been shown to perform well in obtaining contaminant concentration values huang et al 2020 ccl4 solution was added to the collected lnapl samples to obtain the absorbance of each lnapl sample several specific concentrations of diesel were manually prepared in advance to plot the absorbance and a standard curve between lnapl concentration and absorbance by fitting a linear model fig 2 it should be noted that the lnapl concentration in this paper is the concentration of solution in which the lnapl samples were extracted and fixed to 10 ml with ccl4 solution to ensure the accuracy of results it was important to collect three samples consecutively and then take the average of concentrations of three samples the pinchcocks in the sampling ports at different locations would be removed when collecting the samples to obtain the lnapl concentration the collected lnapl samples were separated and the corresponding absorbance was measured and substituted into the fitted linear model 2 4 experimental procedures laboratory experiments focused on investigating the effect of various factors and conditions on lnapl migration in filled fractured media 2 4 1 filling of standard sand prior to the start of each experiment sand was sieved through a standard sieve and washed with distilled water to remove any fine particles that might be present alazaiza et al 2021 the sieved sand was then oven dried for 6 8 h at 105 110 c to remove any moisture three standard sands with a moisture content of 5 were made to fill the experimental model xiao 2017 after the position of the fractured rock mass was marked the aperture was calibrated with a graduated scale to ensure that the aperture was even and sieved standard sand was evenly laid in the model inside the fractures and around the marble slabs to keep the sand layer tight sand was filled slowly and every 2 3 cm it was gently tapped down uniformly with cardboard the standard sand used for each experiment was weighed and the bulk density of the filled sand was approximately 1 42 1 77 g cm3 the filling of sand was completed when the sand thickness was flush with the top surface of the fractured marble the filled sand was then left to settle under natural ambient conditions for 24 h before lnapl was injected after the formation of three filled fractures a layer of filter screen was laid along the top of the fractured rock mass then a 5 cm high gravel layer consisting of particles with d 5 0 8 0 mm was overlain on the top to mitigate erosion that could potentially take place by lightly compacting with cardboard to keep the gravel layer tight fig 3 2 4 2 assembly of the device a movable iron frame was set on the left side of the model a cylindrical overflow ladle was placed above and a rubber hose with a control valve was used to connect the overflow ladle and the model one side of the symmetrical hole was inserted into the sampling needles and the other side was connected to pressure transducers a high definition digital camera was set up on the front of the model with a tripod and the shooting height and angle were adjusted to track and record lnapl migration process of 2 4 3 injection of lnapl and water lnapl was injected by keeping the volume to be constant an oil pool with a height of 2 cm was formed using a plastic wrap at the top of the 5 cm high gravel layer the initial moisture content of the filled sand during each experiment was 5 the initial water table in the experimental model was 0 cm fig 3 the distilled water was only injected into the model when the effect of groundwater level on lnapl migration was studied at the beginning of the experiment the plastic wrap at the top of the 5 cm high gravel layer was quickly removed to allow the instantaneous and uniform infiltration of lnapl after it was stable for 24 h distilled water was injected orpumped into the model from the bottom inlet valve at a rate of 12 60 ml s using a peristaltic pump bt300 2 j longer precision pump co ltd the peristaltic pump was stopped when the water table reached the set target value of 35 or 60 cm 2 4 4 image calibration and data acquisition when lnapl injection started the high definition digital camera was activated and the shooting intervals at different stages were 5 s 30 s 1 min and 10 min respectively the camera was kept at the same distance of 1 2 m from the experimental model during each experiment the image capture process was controlled using the eos utility software to avoid displacement and vibration the total time for capturing the experimental images was 24 h furthermore the image calibration function in mapgis software was used to correct the captured images to avoid the effects of light intensity and human factors four image calibration points were set up and marked on the experimental model before the start of the experiment with their coordinates being 0 0 0 70 80 70 and 80 0 respectively the four correction points of the captured images were fitted to the standard frame to obtain the calibrated experimental images fig 4 the locations of the lnapl migration front were observed and recorded at regular intervals the lnapl migration depth and contamination area in each fracture were measured the absorbance of each lnapl sample was measured and lnapl concentration was obtained by calculation to ensure the accuracy of results it was important to collect three samples consecutively and then taking the average of the concentrations of the three samples the change in pressure values at each monitoring port were recorded via a datalogger and the results were displayed in real time on a computer monitor which was used as a supplementary method to verify the arrival of lnapl at the ports 2 5 numerical method 2 5 1 mathematical model in the unsaturated zone of fractured media the migration of lnapl is a three phase flow problem including lnapl phase water phase and gas phase the multiphase flow equation is based on the law of conservation of mass darcy s law law of conservation of heat and law of force balance for each phase the effect of temperature and non equilibrium forces were not considered in this simulation the matrix of the fractured rock in the experiment was impermeable while the fractures were all filled with the same type of sand and lnapl only migrated within the network of filled fractures thus the filled fractures were treated to be homogeneous in terms of hydraulic parameters based on the law of conservation of mass and darcy s law the governing equations of each phase i can be obtained as zhou et al 2019a 1 k ρ o k r o μ o p o ρ o q o ρ o n s o t 2 k ρ w k r w μ w p w ρ w q w ρ w n s w t 3 k ρ g k s g μ g ρ o k r o r s μ o ρ w k r w r s w μ w p g ρ g q g ρ o q o ρ w q w

and gas respectively k is intrinsic permeability μ o μ w and μ g are dynamic viscosities of non aqueous liquid water and gas respectively p o p w and p g are pressures of non aqueous liquid water and gas respectively q o q w and q g are source sink intensities of non aqueous fluid water and gas respectively while if a phase has no source sink term it will be 0 n is porosity s o s w and s g are saturations of non aqueous liquid water and gas in the media respectively r s is solubility of gas for a non aqueous liquid under standard state and r sw is solubility of the gas in water under standard state it should be noted that the lnapl concentration in this paper is the concentration of solution in which the lnapl samples were extracted and fixed to 10 ml with ccl4 solution in addition to ensure the uniformity of the experimental and numerical results saturation results obtained from all numerical simulations were also converted into concentrations using the same processing method the fractured rock matrix within the experimental model was impermeable the initial moisture content of filled sand was 5 and lnapl was injected as source sink terms q o at a constant volume from the top of the model standard atmospheric pressure no water or gas was injected in the numerical simulations qw qg 0 the left right and bottom sides of the experimental model were no flow boundaries of oil water and gas the fractures in the experiment were all filled with same type of sand and could be considered as a homogeneous porous medium to describe the relationship between water content of the filled sand and pressure head the van genuchten vg model van genuchten 1980 was used 4 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 αh n 1 1 n 5 s w θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 αh n 1 1 n where h is pressure head which affects the magnitude of the three phase pressures p ρgh in equation 1 3 θ h is sand water content at a pressure head of h θ s and θr are saturated and residual values of sand water content respectively and α and n are vg model parameters s w is saturation of water which is a function of sand water content and its magnitude is influenced by porosity n in equation 1 3 this is because when the sand is saturated saturated water content is numerically the same as porosity of sand θ s n it should be noted that the vg model was only used for the porous medium composed of filled sand and not for fractures also based on the vg model and hydraulic conductivity characteristics the relationship between relative permeability and saturation in multiphase flow is obtained as dou et al 2012 6 k rw s w 1 2 1 1 s w 1 1 1 n 1 1 n 2 as the sum of the saturation of the lnapl water and gas phases is 1 so s w sg 1 and here only the equation for the relative permeability of water is presented while the relative permeability of the other two phases can also be calculated in the experiments all fractures were filled with porous media the seepage characteristics of the filled fractures were not only related to the aperture of the fracture but also to the properties of the filling materials such as the particle composition porosity and particle size maillot et al 2016 7 k f g b 2 12 μ 12 n 3 20 4 1 3 1 n b d 2 k r ρ g μ where k f is the fluid conductivity of filled fracture b is the aperture of fracture μ is the dynamic viscosity the dynamic viscosities of diesel and water are 4 05 mpa s and 1 01 mpa s respectively when the fluid temperature is 20 c n is the porosity sand filling the fractures and d is particle size of filling material k r is relative permeability of fluid and ρ is fluid density equation 7 was input into comsol and invoked automatically comsol automatically calculated the k f values of three fractures f1 f2 and f3 and applied them to all simulations and they are related to saturation of each phase through the relative permeability of each fluid which varies with the saturation of three phases lnapl water and gas 2 5 2 comsol multiphysics comsol multiphysics software is a finite element analysis software based on multiphysics partial differential equations which can be used to solve linear and nonlinear steady state and transient problems the lnapl in this experiment was released with a fixed water head and a peristaltic pump was used to maintain the lnapl height of 2 cm after the lnapl flowed out of the fracture injection was stopped the particle size of the filling sand was 0 15 0 3 mm a numerical model corresponding to the physical model was built considering both multiphase and fracture flow and richards equations under the comsol fluid flow module to simulate the migration of lnapl in filled fractured network the numerical model had the same size 80 cm 80 cm and conditions as the experimental model adaptive mesh refinement was utilized for model scenarios with denser and finer meshing around the fractures the model domain was discretized with 25 980 triangular elements fig 5 the model range of parameters used for the numerical simulations were presented in table 2 the vg model parameters for the three sand types 0 15 0 30 mm 0 25 0 50 mm and 0 50 1 00 mm were presented separately the other hydrogeological parameters input into the model awere the same as in the laboratory experiments table 1 such as dry density porosity and hydraulic conductivity etc they were set to be constant and remained unchanged during simulations 2 5 3 fitting method for numerical and experimental results to run the numerical model and comparing the results to those obtained from the laboratory experiments parameters of filled sand that we input into the model were treated to be the same as in the laboratory experiments such as dry density porosity and hydraulic conductivity in addition vg model parameters α n θ s and θr were calibrated using the root mean square error rmse by comparing the similarity between numerical and experimental results and these parameters were varied to achieve a good fit the calibrated vg model parameters for the three sand types were shown in table 5 the top surface of the fractured rock mass was treated as the zero plane and its distance from the lnapl migration front so 0 001 was treated as the lnapl migration depth the lnapl migration depths in fracture f2 and the porous media were used for calibration and the rmse of the migration depth was calculated by 8 rmse t 1 n l to l t c 2 n where n is the number of data l to is the observed value of lnapl migration depth and l tc is the calculated value of lnapl migration depth 3 results and analysis 3 1 experimental results 3 1 1 the effect of sand size on lnapl migration to minimize soil pollution and avoid large scale contaminant migration most underground oil storage tanks oil storage caverns and underground oil pipelines have been located on bedrock which has low porosity and permeability li et al 2014 liu 2012 however different types and characteristics of filling materials in the fractures will also affect the migration characteristics of lnapl in the experiments three kinds of fracture network filled with different particle sizes were studied and their migration characteristics were analyzed the experiments were divided into three groups consisting of different sand sizes filling fractures 0 15 0 3 mm 0 25 0 5 mm and 0 5 1 0 mm the particle size of the sand filled in the fractures and the sand on both sides of the marble was the same the diesel injection method injection volume boundary conditions source sink term and temperature were the same during the three groups of experiments the migration and changes of lnapl at different times during the infiltration process were recorded by a high definition digital camera fig 6 the statistics of lnapl migration characteristics were shown in table 3 the pressure values at different locations were monitored by automated high frequency pressure data transducers with the instantaneous release of lnapl at a height of 2 cm the lnapl continuously entered the filled fracture network and the porous media on both sides of the fractured rock mass during the early stages of infiltration lnapl migration was very fast later in the infiltration process lnapl migration velocity slowed down significantly and reached the bottom exit of the fractures this was due to more open pores at the top layers of fractures when an uneven compression occurred in the top layers alazaiza et al 2017 within the range of particle size variation of the three groups of filled sand the larger the particle size resulted in a faster the lnapl migration velocity at the same time the greater the depth of infiltration and the larger the lnapl contaminated area fig 6 a b and c showed that particle size of the filling had an important effect on the lnapl migration process after the instantaneous injection of lnapl lnapl infiltrated rapidly in the gravel layer under gravity lnapl preferentially selected three filled fracture channels with lower resistance to migrate preferentially downward because part of the lnapl flow pathway was blocked by marble for the lnapl in porous media on both sides of the fractured marble its migration velocity was lower than that of the lnapl in filled fractures the filling material in the fracture network had a strong controlling effect on lnapl migration when the initial moisture content of the filled sand was 5 the amount of lnapl entering and passing through the fracture channel per unit time was larger if the particle size was larger the migration front advanced faster and the infiltration depth of lnapl in fractured rock mass was larger at the same time the results of concentration detection and pressure monitoring at different positions in the fractures also verified this observation in general the filled fractured marble changed the lnapl migration behaviour when the sand particle sizes were 0 15 0 30 mm 0 25 0 50 mm and 0 5 1 0 mm the lnapl migration velocity in porous media was about 50 41 8 and 30 7 of its migration velocity in filled fractures respectively the larger particle size of the filling material the faster the migration velocity of lnapl and the shorter the migration time the filling material composition in the fracture network in the fractured rock mass area will have an important impact on lnapl migration which requires special attention in the investigation of actual contaminated sites 3 1 2 the effect of groundwater level on lnapl entrapment most oil contaminated sites are caused by leakage from underground oil storage tanks or underground oil pipelines liu 2012 after the lnapl infiltrates into the subsurface most of it will migrate downwards within the complex fracture network of the rock mass due to the strong entrapment capacity and attenuation of the unsaturated zone for aqueous phase contaminants ma and li 2014 guo et al 2019b and the lower density of lnapl than water most of the lnapl will stay in the unsaturated zone above the groundwater surface if the amount of lnapl leakage is not large however with the arrival of the wet season abundant rainfall will result in increased recharge and raise the groundwater level at a contaminated site which will then impact lnapl entrapment in filled fractured media for our laboratory experiments after lnapl migration through filled fractures reached completion groundwater level was raised to study its effect on lnapl below the groundwater level the changes to lnapl positions were observed and monitored through each monitoring port and concentrations were measured when the groundwater level was raised to be flush with the upper end of the fractured rock mass water injection was stopped the change of the pressure at each port was recorded in real time through the pressure monitoring system and lnapl samples from each monitoring port were collected periodically and analyzed for their concentrations the lnapl concentration changes with time at representative monitoring ports under different filling particle sizes were shown in fig 7 after the lnapl infiltration experiments reached a steady state the groundwater level of the three groups of experiments was raised to 70 cm due to the displacement of distilled water the mobile lnapl would migrate upwards with the rising groundwater table resulting in a rapid increase in its concentration within 0 30 min within 30 60 min except for the continuous increase of the sample concentration values at ports h7 h8 and h9 the concentration of the samples collected at the other monitoring ports peaked and then decreased rapidly the reason was that the entrapped lnapl in the original fracture network quickly floated up due to buoyancy and reached the groundwater surface resulting in the accumulation of lnapl at ports h7 h8 and h9 the experimental process images recorded by a high definition digital camera also verified this during the 24 h continuous monitoring process the concentration values at each monitoring port had reached a stable level the concentration at most of the monitoring ports in fractures decreased to 0 mg ml due to the rise of the groundwater level but concentration values at some monitoring ports were still maintained at a certain level fig 7 when the particle size was 0 15 0 3 mm the concentration values at ports h25 h26 and h27 were stable in the range of 0 215 0 230 mg ml and the concentration values at ports h12 h13 h21 and h22 were stable in the range of 0 036 0 077 mg ml when the particle size was 0 25 0 5 mm the concentration values at ports h25 h26 and h27 were stable in the range of 0 237 0 271 mg ml and the concentration values at both ports h13 and h21 were stable in the range of 0 042 0 050 mg ml when the particle size was 0 5 1 0 mm the concentration values at ports h21 h25 h26 and h27 were stable at 0 008 0 020 mg ml in summary the concentration values at each port reached a stable value after the groundwater level was raised for 24 h because the buoyancy of water was not sufficient to overcome the gravitational viscous and capillary forces lnapl was entrapped below the groundwater surface and might become a continuous source of groundwater pollution long term entrapped lnapl would penetrate into the surrounding rock matrix and migrate into other fractures where they would be difficult to remove to further explore the effect of particle size of the filling material in the fracture network on the migration behaviour of lnapl the distribution of lnapl under three particle sizes was continued to be visually compared when the particle size was 0 15 0 3 mm and 0 25 0 5 mm it was difficult for the entrapped lnapl to overcome its own gravitational viscous and capillary forces and move upward due to the large depth of the groundwater level of ports h25 h26 and h27 therefore although the concentration at the three ports decreased rapidly under the influence of the rising groundwater level it finally maintained a high level of 0 20 0 30 mg ml fig 7 a and b however when the particle size was 0 5 1 0 mm the pore size was large thus the amount of entrapped lnapl was reduced and it would slowly move upward to reach the groundwater surface it showed that the entrapped amount of lnapl below the groundwater surface was closely related to the pore size of the filling material in addition when the particle size was 0 15 0 3 mm the number of ports located below the groundwater surface and lnapl was detected was 7 h12 h13 h21 h22 h25 h26 and h27 when the particle size was 0 25 0 5 mm the number of ports located below the groundwater surface and lnapl was detected was 5 h13 h21 h25 h26 and h27 when the particle size was 0 5 1 0 mm the number of ports located below the groundwater surface and lnapl was detected was 4 h21 h25 h26 and h27 and the concentration values were below 0 10 mg ml it could be seen that the larger particle size the smaller the amount of lnapl entrapment within the filled sand and buoyancy would dominate lnapl migration the entrapped amount of lnapl below the groundwater surface decreased as the particle size of the filling material increased at the same time lnapl concentration values at the intersection of the fracture network tended to be higher than in other fractures at the same depth beneath the groundwater level and even higher than in fractures at a deeper depth in general for filled fractured rock mass that has been contaminated with lnapl rising of the groundwater level significantly affected the lnapl migration behaviour within the fracture network 3 1 3 the effect of groundwater level fluctuation on lnapl migration the seasonal fluctuation of groundwater level and the influence of water pumping and water injection during engineering construction will render the migration of lnapl in filled fractured media to be more complicated that is lnapl migration behaviour will change as the groundwater level rises or fails three previous groups of infiltration experiments were all carried out based on the groundwater level being fixed at 0 cm i e the bottom of the experimental model fig 3 and groundwater level lowering experiments were not carried out to further investigate the effect of groundwater level fluctuation on lnapl migration within fractures several additional experiments were performed the particle size of the filling material was 0 5 1 0 mm and the lnapl injection method injection volume boundary conditions source sink term and temperature were same as in previous experiments two groups of experiments were added 1 the initial groundwater level was 35 cm and the groundwater level was raised to 60 cm after the infiltration experiments and the initial groundwater level was 60 cm and the groundwater level was lowered to 35 cm after the infiltration experiments 1 the initial groundwater level was 35 cm and lnapl with a height of 2 cm was allowed to infiltrate instantaneously with the sudden removal of the plastic wrap which quickly allowed for lnapl infiltration to the groundwater surface under the effect of gravity fig 8 a after the lnapl position was completely stabilized the groundwater level was raised to 60 cm and the original entrapped lnapl gradually moved upward to the vicinity of the new groundwater level due to buoyancy fig 8 b due to the differences in permeabilities of geomaterials lnapl migration was hindered by the relatively intact and less permeable rock mass while lnapl quickly migrated downward through three filled fractures from 3 to 10 min lnapl in three fractures all reached the groundwater surface and lnapl in fracture f2 stayed above the groundwater surface however because the large lnapl pressure was greater than capillary and buoyancy forces lnapl in fracture f3 did not stop after reaching the groundwater surface lnapl continued to migrate below the groundwater surface and took the lead to reach port h21 where it intersected with fracture f1 resulting in an increase in lnapl concentration and pressure at port h21 from 10 to 360 min fig 9 lnapl migration velocity gradually slowed down after reaching the groundwater surface continued accumulation of lnapl at the groundwater surface resulted in a continuous increase in lnapl concentration and pressure values from 360 to 1440 min due to the continued accumulation of lnapl lnapl was detected at ports h25 h26 and h27 indicating that a small amount of lnapl entered the lower portion of the filled fractures after lnapl migration stabilized at t 1440 min the groundwater level was raised and lnapl at the original groundwater surface began to move upward along the fracture channels during the rising of the groundwater level from 1440 to 1441 min fig 9 lnapl in three fractures all rose rapidly and began to accumulate at the new groundwater surface the lnapl concentration at ports h21 and h22 suddenly decreased and lnapl was detected in the area between the original groundwater level and the new groundwater level from 1441 to 1500 min lnapl concentration monitored at ports h12 and h13 continued to increase fig 9 the concentration at port h12 was lower than at port h13 because h13 was supplied by lnapl from two fractures lnapl concentration at ports h16 h17 and h18 first increased and then decreased with time this was because the lnapl was entrapped near the three sampling holes with the rising groundwater level lnapl coated the sand particles forming a layer of lnapl film on the surface which made the sand adhesive pan et al 2018 however with the gradual saturation of the filling sand the water phase was more likely to saturate the sand than lnapl lnapl continued to migrate upward to reach the new groundwater surface due to its buoyancy from 1500 to 1800 min fig 9 the increasing rate of lnapl concentration monitored at ports h12 and h13 gradually slowed down among three sampling ports at the middle except for the concentration at port h17 the concentration at ports h16 and h18 decreased slowly which might be the effect of lnapl redissolving from 1800 to 2880 min fig 9 the lnapl height at the groundwater surface remained stable and the lnapl concentration collected at the sampling ports in three fractures did not change significantly however lnapl concentration at ports h21 and h22 were both greater than 0 fig 9 and the existence of lnapl could still be observed around some ports and the most in fracture f3 results showed that lnapl did not fully migrate upwards as the groundwater level rose there was still a significant amount lnapl left in fractures and could be a potential source of groundwater pollution in the future 2 the initial groundwater level was 60 cm and lnapl with a height of 2 cm was allowed to infiltrate instantaneously with the the sudden removal of plastic wrap which allowed lnapl to quickly infiltrate to the groundwater surface under the effect of gravity fig 10 a after lnapl completely stabilized the groundwater level was lowered to 35 cm and lnapl at the original groundwater surface moved down rapidly with the groundwater level fig 10 b from 0 5 to 1 min lnapl in fractures f2 and f3 first reached the groundwater surface and continued to accumulate near the groundwater surface the lnapl migration front in two fractures completed the intersection at port h13 which continuously increased the concentration at port h13 pressure measurements at port h13 also revealed an increase during this period from 1 to 10 min lnapl above the groundwater surface continued to migrate downward but the migration velocity had slowed down significantly lnapl in fracture f1 reached the groundwater surface and began to migrate below the groundwater surface from 10 to 60 min lnapl were detected at ports h16 h17 and h21 in the water saturated zone which were affected by the accumulation of lnapl from 60 to 720 min lnapl concentration at each port remained stable for two reasons the oil pressure formed by lnapl was limited due to the small release and high groundwater level and the other was the limited short term solubility of lnapl experimental results showed that most of the leaked lnapl would float on the groundwater surface however a small amount of lnapl could enter the water saturated zone hardisty et al 1998 2003 dippenaar et al 2005 which was influenced by the amount of lnapl infiltration fracture aperture particle size of filling and groundwater level after the migration of lnapl has become stable at t 1440 min the groundwater level was lowered and lnapl at the original groundwater surface began to migrate downwards along the fracture channels from 1440 to 1450 min fig 11 lnapl in three fractures moved down slowly as the groundwater level and the lnapl concentration at ports h12 and h13 suddenly decreased fig 11 there were visible lnapl columns in the area between the original groundwater level and the new groundwater level and lnapl accumulation began to appear at the lowered groundwater level from 1500 to 2880 min fig 11 the increase of lnapl concentration at the groundwater surface gradually slowed down lnapl coated the sand particles forming a layer of lnapl film on the surface which made the sand adhesive lnapl would fill in the sand pores and cause pore blocking pan et al 2018 different from previous research results although the lnapl accumulating at the groundwater surface was still increasing entrapped lnapl above the groundwater surface was still relatively large and its residual depth range basically included all areas from the initial groundwater level to the final groundwater level lenhard et al 2017 lekmine et al 2017 lnapl could be trapped in sand filled pores and fractures due to the interplay of viscous gravity and capillary forces francisca and montoro 2015 lu et al 2017 results showed that lnapl remained in the unsaturated zone after being entrapped by the filling sand and the amount was very large moreover the lnapl entrapment capacity of sands was different with the smaller the particle size the stronger the entrapment capacity shu et al 2002 zhou et al 2019b the lnapl accumulated in the fracture network migrated downward due to gravity after the groundwater table was lowered but it could not enter the lower part of the filled fractures because the gravitational force on lnapl was insufficient to overcome the capillary force and water buoyancy 3 2 numerical simulation results of lnapl migration in filled fractured media 3 2 1 comparison of numerical and experimental results the laboratory experiment was mainly designed and conducted to simulate lnapl migration in the physical model due to the limitation of experimental conditions and time it was difficult to complete the design and to conduct various laboratory experiments for many specific working conditions such as variable aperture variable inclination and variable number of fractures therefore the study used a numerical method to conduct the related supplementary studies on the migration behaviour of lnapl in filled fractured media the numerical model was assigned values according to relevant parameters of the physical model and reference values from previous research results for these simulations the fractures were filled with sand with a particle size of 0 15 0 3 mm the numerical model was calibrated by comparing the numerical results with experimental results time lapsed experimental and numerical images at 1 min 5 min 10 min and 25 min were shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively comparing the lnapl infiltration images in figs 12 and 13 we can find that the experimental and numerical images of lnapl migration in filled fractured media were consistent in terms of overall lnapl distribution and trend with the continuous injection of lnapl lnapl migration depth gradually increased and the lnapl migration velocity in filled fracture network was significantly different from that of the porous media on both sides to more accurately compare and quantitatively describe the similarity between the numerical and experimental images lnapl migration data in three filled fractures and porous media on both sides at 0 5 min 1 min 3 min 5 min 10 min 15 min 20 min and 25 min were calculated and summarized in table 4 and the migration data of fracture f2 fig 14a and porous media fig 14b on both sides were fitted respectively it could be seen from fig 14 that the overall fit of numerical simulation results to experimental data was good and the trend in curves was generally consistent the root mean square error of lnapl migration depths in f2 and porous media were 1 299 and 1 085 respectively small errors at certain time periods might be due to uneven sand filling as well as experimental and numerical errors during the filling of fractures with sand settlement of sand and uneven artificial compaction could have potentially led increased compaction of filling material at some positions resulting in smaller lnapl migration velocities at these positions for the numerical simulation the filling was considered to be uniformly distributed when assigning relevant parameters thus lnapl migration would not be affected by these factors in summary the simulated and experimental lnapl migration depths were comparable the numerical model was found to simulate laboratory experiment results quite well thus could be used for predictive simulations the calibrated vg model parameters were shown in table 5 and they were used for additional simulations of lnapl migration in filled fractured media as described next 3 2 2 the effect of fracture inclination on lnapl migration based on the calibration of the numerical model the main hydrogeological parameters of the numerical model were obtained the numerical model was used to complement the study of the effect of fracture inclination on lnapl migration in filled fractured media fractures in nature are often randomly distributed and most of them are not vertical but instead may be inclined the lnapl migration behaviour in filled fractured media was studied when the inclination of a single filled fracture was varied over angles of 90 75 and 60 measured relative to a horizontal plane based on laboratory physical model a penetrating fracture was set in the middle of the fractured marble the aperture of fracture was set to be 2 cm and the fracture was filled with sand with a particle size of 0 5 1 0 mm time lapsed images of lnapl migration predicted at different times were obtained and shown on fig 15 it could be seen from fig 15 that fracture inclination had an important influence on lnapl migration in filled fractured media within the range of fracture inclination set by the simulation lnapl migration depth in filled fractured media was proportional to fracture inclination fig 16 lnapl migration depth in porous media on both sides at the same time was basically the same fig 16 at 1 min lnapl migration depth with fracture inclination of 90 75 and 60 in filled fractured media were 8 2 cm 8 1 cm and 7 8 cm respectively during the early stage of lnapl infiltration lnapl had just passed through the gravel layer to reach the fractured rock mass the lnapl amount entering filled fractured media was still small and its weight was not large enough to overcome the resistance of the filling material during this period lnapl migration velocity was similarsame underfor the three fracture inclinations and its migration depth was not significantly impacted by fracture inclination after 2 min lnapl preferentially migrated rapidly in filled fractured media and the lnapl migration velocity with inclinations of 90 and 75 were faster than that of the porous medium on both sides the lnapl migration depth with an inclination of 90 reached 30 2 cm at 5 min while lnapl migration velocity with an inclination of 60 was similar compared to porous media on both sides and the migration depth was only 20 1 cm it could be seen from fig 15 that for higher inclinations of filled fracture lnapl migrates preferentially downward to a lower level compared to the surrounding porous medium at later time t 10 min lnapl migration velocity in filled fractured media decreased with a decrease in fracture inclination at 20 min the lnapl in filled fracture with an inclination of 90 first migrated out of the fracture and the migration depth reached 53 5 cm the lnapl migration velocity in the filled fracture with an inclination of 60 was the slowest and the migration depth was only 38 1 cm based on these results one can conclude that lnapl migration depth in filled fractured media decreases with a decrease in fracture inclination which can provide guidance on anticipated migration depths under field conditions 4 discussion based on previous research results most studies on lnapl migration have focused on porous media alazaiza et al 2017 2020b 2021 onaa et al 2021 such as soil research on lnapl migration in fractured rock mass have been mainly based on laboratory simulation of single fracture and numerical simulations and only few studies on lnapl migration behaviour in filled fractured rock mass have been previously published martel et al 2019 boumaiza et al 2022 based on the previous research results of filled fracture huang et al 2014 an experimental apparatus to study contaminants migration in filled fractured marble was developed for this study our experimental results showed that lnapl would migrate below the groundwater surface when the aperture of the fracture was large enough which was consistent with the results obtained by hardisty et al 1998 2003 comparing our results with results of lu et al 2017 in a rough single fracture and oil thickness in a well computed by atteia et al 2019 it was found that lnapl in filled fracture network would migrate upward with the rise of the groundwater level different from their results a significant amount of lnapl was still trapped below the groundwater level due to lnapl entrapment within the filling material that may act as a potential contamination source of the aquifer in the future during the experiment it was found that the preferential flow behaviour of lnapl in fractured porous media also was observed in filled fractured media mclaren et al 2000 huang et al 2020 in this study the phenomenon of preferential flow was strongly affected by the particle size of the filling material in particular it should be pointed out that lnapl had various phases such as free phase dissolved phase minimal and entrapped phase dippenaar et al 2005 ruan et al 2021 shen et al 2021 the entrapped phase caused the development of anomalous peaks at monitoring ports located below the groundwater surface subsequently a multiphase flow numerical simulation code comsol was introduced and utilized to predict lnapl migration in filled fractured media huo et al 2014 chen et al 2020 thus lnapl migration behaviour was influenced by the composition of the filling groundwater level and fracture inclination further studies on the effects of fracture aperture as well as lnapl properties i e density viscosity surface tension temperature on migration behaviour requires further investigations it is necessary to carry out systematic and in depth research because the migration mechanism is complex and a unified understanding is still lacking thus further research is necessary 5 conclusions with rapid worldwide economic development oil pollution problems caused by leakage of oil storage facilities have dramatically increased in this study lnapl migration behaviour in filled fractured media was studied through laboratory physical experiments and corresponding numerical simulations the focus was on the effect of filling material composition groundwater level fluctuation and fracture inclination on lnapl migration this study led to the following conclusions 1 during the initial stage after lnapl was released its migration velocity in filled fracture network was significantly faster than that in porous media on both sides which was referred to as preferential flow the characteristics of the filling material had an important influence on lnapl migration and its migration velocity increased with the increase of particle size of the filling material 2 the rise of the groundwater level caused the lnapl in filled fractured media to move upward with the groundwater level and eventually reached the groundwater surface but a significant amount of lnapl was still entrapped below the groundwater surface and the entrapped amount had a strong relationship with the particle size of the filling sand as the particle size of the filling sand decreased the entrapment capacity became stronger and the effect of buoyancy was less than the sum of gravitational viscous and capillary forces which made it difficult for lnapl to become mobilized and might become a continuous source of groundwater pollution long term entrapped lnapl could penetrate into the surrounding rock matrix and migrate into other fractures where they would be difficult to remove 3 the seasonal fluctuation of groundwater level resulted in more complex impact on lnapl migration a during the dry season most of the leaked lnapl remained near the groundwater surface but some lnapl overcame the buoyancy of water and migrated below the groundwater surface due to its increasing weight and b during the wet season almost all lnapl remained near the groundwater surface because of the buoyancy of water and caused difficultiesit for the lnapl to enter below the groundwater surface after the groundwater level was lowered lnapl would rapidly migrate downwards with the groundwater level until it reached the new groundwater surface 4 in order to further complement the research the effect of the fracture inclination on lnapl migration in filled fractured media was investigated through numerical simulation methods results showed that the effect of fracture inclination on the migration of lnapl in filled fractured media was not significant during the initial stage of lnapl infiltration however during the later stage of lnapl infiltration lnapl migration velocity and penetration depth increased with an increase in fracture inclination on the whole lnapl migration in filled fractured network media is affected by the particle size of the filling materials groundwater level fluctuation and fracture inclination however the complexity of lnapl migration and possible experimental errors in the experimental process renders our research results to have certain limitations we will continue to study the migration mechanism of lnapl in filled fractured media through

1222,with the increasing requirement of maintaining world energy security and strategic reserves oil storage and transportation facilities are being built at a large scale taking the safe and efficient operation of petroleum storage projects as the goal a set of experimental apparatus to investigate the migration of contaminants in fractures filled with media was developed to predict and evaluate the environmental risk of oil contaminants leakage a multiphase numerical flow model based on comsol was built based on the laboratory experimental model specifically the migration behaviour of light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl through a sand filled fractured medium was studied by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations image and chemical analyses methods were used to monitor and study lnapl migration behaviour for varying grain sizes of porous medium filling the fractures and varying groundwater table elevations laboratory experimental results showed that the lnapl migration velocity in filled fracture network was significantly faster than that in adjoining porous media during the initial stage of infiltration the migration velocity increased with the relative permeability of filled sand which was closely related to the van genuchten vg model parameters α and n lnapl migrated downward with the falling groundwater table and became entrapped with the rising groundwater table and the amount of entrapment depended on vg model parameters hydrogeological parameters were calibrated and lnapl migration in filled fractured media was predicted using the calibrated numerical model simulation results revealed that fracture inclination had an important influence on lnapl migration in filled fractured media and its migration velocity decreased with a decrease in fracture inclination these research results can be applied to the control and remediation of oil contaminated sites in fractured rock settings such as at underground oil storage tanks and caverns as well as at underground oil pipelines graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords contaminant migration fractures filled with porous media laboratory experiment light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl numerical simulation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction with the rapid development of the petrochemical industry leakage of oil storage and transportation facilities has become a prominent worldwide environmental problem the corresponding oil pollution problem has become an important research topic for the international scientific community abd rahman et al 2018 cavelan et al 2022 crude oil and various refined petroleum products such as gasoline diesel jet fuel kerosene lube oil and coal tar are some of the most prevalent organic contaminants in groundwater the main pollution sources are petroleum gas stations oil pipelines and oil storage tanks compared to heavy metal contaminants and inorganic contaminants petroleum contaminants are generally persistent organic contaminants that are relatively insoluble in water they can be highly toxic and difficult to degrade compared to other common contaminants the insoluble non volatile portion is termed non aqueous phase liquid napl including light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl and dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl wang et al 2002 lnapl has lower density than water causing it to position on top of the capillary fringe above the water table in an unconfined aquifer it should also be noted that lnapl may be entrapped below the groundwater table under fluctuating groundwater table conditions with the lnapl amount entrapped depending on the pressure head the most typical representative pollutants are benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex in contrast dnapls have densities larger than water causing it to migrate downwards in the vadose zone and through the saturated zone until it encounters low permeability material it is mainly composed of chlorinated organic solvents coal tar and mineral oil according to liu et al 2013b 7 of the more than four billion tons of oil extracted each year reentered the subsurface environment the infiltration and migration of petroleum contaminants have caused serious pollution of groundwater in many countries and regions threatening the safety of local drinking water the us environmental protection agency has regarded gasoline stations as one of the largest sources of groundwater pollution camp et al 2010 in china about 6 0 109 kg of oil enters the environment every year which results in serious pollution of the atmosphere water and soil liu et al 2022 due to the increasingly serious problem of groundwater contamination many researchers have conducted research on napl migration and its subsequent behaviour in the subsurface alazaiza et al 2015 2017 2020a 2020b 2021 azimi et al 2020 chen and wu 2010 mclaren et al 2012 martel et al 2019 onaa et al 2021 xiao 2017 the subsurface migration of oil is a multiphase flow process and various numerical and analytical methods have been developed by researchers alazaiza et al 2015 2018 2019 cavelan et al 2022 martel et al 2019 onaa et al 2021 slough et al 1999a yamamoto and pruess 2004 the pollution caused by oil leakage in fractured geologic media is particularly prominent and hardisty et al 1998 first systematically studied the lnapl migration theory in fractured rock and explored the effect of groundwater levels on the redistribution of lnapl in a fracture a laboratory two dimensional sandbox was designed by yu et al 2009 to investigate the effect of ethanol on the migration of gasoline pollution plume and the redistribution process of the pollution plume was simulated by the compflow bio model yu et al 2009 alazaiza et al 2020b 2021 used a simplified image analysis method to study the effects of groundwater level fluctuations and water infiltration on lnapl distribution and mobilization liu et al 2013a conducted lnapl infiltration experiments in a two dimensional sand tank and obtained the infiltration characteristics of lnapl at different times when oil pollutants leaked they were mainly affected by capillary pressure viscous gravitational and buoyancy forces during the process of infiltration into the subsurface slough et al 1999a 1999b studied the coupled nonlinear compositional equations describing multiphase multi component flow and transport in discretely fractured carbonate rock for various relationships between capillary pressure and saturation utilizing the compflow numerical model huang et al 2011 studied the effect of a vertical fracture on horizontal seepage in unsaturated fractured rock mass through a laboratory experiment and numerical simulation toluene c6h5ch3 was selected by lu et al 2017 as the representative pollutant of lnapl and the residual distribution of lnapl and the interaction mechanism in the fracture water lnapl system were revealed preferential flow was observed by huang et al 2020 through a laboratory physical model and the mechanisms of lnapl migration and remediation were studied through displacement experiments however most studies on lnapl migration have mainly focused on porous media and fractured media and only few studies have been conducted for petroleum based contaminants in fractured rocks filled with porous media such as gravels sands silts and clays which we refer to as filled fractured media from now on shen et al 2022 investigated the mobilization characteristics of lnapl under unsaturated and saturated conditions by laboratory experiments and obtained an empirical equation for the cumulative height of lnapl in filled fractured media the authors hypothesized that groundwater level fluctuation would impact lnapl migration but no further study was carried out dou et al 2012 used the lattice boltzmann method lbm to investigate the napl migration mechanism in a single filled fracture and analyzed the tailing effect caused by the heterogeneity of filling material the dense and low permeability rocks are often fractured due to various geological processes numerous fractures intersect stagger and connect with each other to form an intricate fracture network inside the rock mass in addition the fracture network of rock formations may be filled with various types of porous media originating from overlying sedimentary layers fractures filled with various loose sediments have been considered as an important pathway for water and contaminant migration that can contribute to significant groundwater contamination wealthall et al 2001 chen and kinzelbach 2002 dou et al 2012 wu et al 2013 markovaara koivisto et al 2014 vega et al 2015 nara et al 2018 guo et al 2019a wang et al 2019 dou et al 2022 sui et al 2022 the main objective of this study is to investigate the migration behaviour of lnapl in filled fractured media by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations diesel was selected as a lnapl due to its relatively high mobility image and chemical analyses methods were used to monitor and study the lnapl migration process and entrapment characteristics in filled fractured media for comparison purposes multiple lnapl infiltration experiments were conducted with three different particle sizes 0 15 0 3 mm 0 25 0 5 mm and 0 5 1 0 mm of filled sand furthermore a multiphase numerical flow model based on comsol was built based on the laboratory experimental model to validate the laboratory experimental results and to investigate the effect of fracture inclination on the migration behaviour of lnapl different from previous studies the effect of the characteristics of filled sand groundwater level fluctuation and fracture inclination on lnapl migration in filled fractured media were systematically investigated and studied finally the results of the experimental and numerical methods applied to the migration behaviour of lnapl were discussed research results from this study could provide important scientific basis for the improved characterization and remediation of petroleum contaminated sites consisting of filled fractured media 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 experimental equipment the designed experimental equipment was mainly composed of two parts the main experimental model and the monitoring and data acquisition systems fig 1 the main experimental model was made of 15 mm thick plexiglass and it had dimensions of 100 cm 80 cm 5 cm the water flow system was mainly composed of three parts the upstream and downstream water tanks that were used to control the groundwater level and a device for injecting distilled water or oil the bottom and sides of the model had drainage holes which were used to allow any entrapped air to escape these holes were closed during experiments with changes in groundwater level the naturally fractured marble was fitted into the model and the gap between the rock surface and the plexiglass was sealed and fixed with glass glue symmetrical ports d 0 3 cm 33 pairs along the fractures on both sides of the model were used to collect lnapl samples and to measure pressure with pressure transducers the monitoring and data acquisition systems consisted of three parts image acquisition lnapl sample collection and an automatic pressure monitoring system a high definition digital camera eos 60d canon inc was used to record the experimental process in real time and to take photos regularly it was kept at the same distance of 1 2 m from the experimental model during each experiment the dynamic range of the camera was 14 bits jpeg and raw 16384 gy levels the camera has an 18 megapixels cmos image sensor 5184 3456 pixels 22 3 mm 14 9 mm and has a 67 mm lens ef s18 135 mm f 3 5 5 6 is canon inc it has an iso value of 100 6400 but can be extended to 12 800 to avoid displacement and vibration the camera was connected to a computer and the image capture process was controlled using the eos utility software the image capture time was set to 24 h and the shooting intervals for different stages were 5 s 30 s 1 min and 10 min lnapl samples were collected regularly from sampling ports placed at different positions of the fractures and they were numbered and sealed an ultraviolet spectrophotometer model 754 automatic shanghai jinghua instrument factory was employed to measure the absorbance of lnapl samples thirty three pressure transducers xgzp6867a wuhu cfsensor co ltd and an automatic high frequency data collection system ads1256 24adc shenzhen xuanwei electronic technology co ltd monitored absolute pressure at different positions in the fractures at numbered ports the temperature of the room was maintained at 20 1 c during all experiments 2 2 experimental materials 1 tracer solution as one of the most common organic light non aqueous pollutants no 0 diesel purchased from jiyin avenue gas station cnpc nanjing 31 53 00 n 118 47 35 e was selected as the tracer because it has been widely used worldwide in various industrial applications moreover compared with other oil pollutants it is less volatile has lower toxicity and is less flammable no 0 diesel has a boiling point of 180 320 c and its density is 840 kg m3 with a dynamic viscosity of 3 55 4 05 mpa s while it has an interfacial tension of 0 025 n m sudan iii c22h16n4o tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute yu et al 2009 pan et al 2018 huang et al 2020 with a relative atomic mass of 352 40 was selected as the dyeing agent due to its bright red colour and its high miscibility with diesel to determine the amount of sudan iii to be added results reported by kechavarzi et al 2000 were considered and the colour comparisons of dyed diesel with different amounts of sudan iii were conducted specifically 0 1 g of sudan iii was added to a square barrel containing 2 l of diesel and they were thoroughly mixed and sealed until used for experiments shen et al 2022 this percentage had a good visual effect when observing diesel migration through the plexiglass the addition of sudan iii would not alter the physical and chemical properties of diesel moreover sudan iii did not transfer between water and diesel and was not absorbed by sand particles alazaiza et al 2020b 2 the fractured rock mass consisted of a marble slab with a size of 50 cm 50 cm 5 cm which was cut into six irregular pieces at a stone processing factory the marble rock matrix was dense and impermeable prior to the start of each experiment the marble was washed with distilled water to remove any fine particles that might be present then they were spliced into a plexiglass frame to form a network of three fractures named as f1 f2 and f3 in order to simulate the geological environment of large filled fractures and faulted fractured zones in the field and facilitate the measurement of experimental data fu 2013 fractures f1 and f2 were positioned to parallel with an inclination of 78 7 and an aperture of 2 cm while the inclination of fracture f3 was 60 and the aperture was 3 cm these inclinations were measured from the horizontal plane the fracture parameters in the present study were similar to those in the study by shen et al 2022 also it should be noted that three fractures were smoothed to avoid the effect of roughness 3 for the experiments standard sand with particle sizes ranging between 0 075 2 0 mm was obtained from xiamen eso standard sand co ltd china three standard sands with different particle size were obtained after full wave vibration as follows a 0 15 0 30 mm b 0 25 0 50 mm and c 0 50 1 00 mm prior to the start of each experiment three standard sands were washed with the distilled water and they were used as filling materials inside fractures and around the marble slabs table 1 shows the main physical parameters of three standard sands 2 3 lnapl concentration absorbance standard curve the absorbance of the diesel tracer was measured with a uv spectrophotometer model 754 automatic shanghai jinghua instrument factory lnapl is sparingly soluble in water while it is miscible with organic solvent ccl4 ccl4 solution has been shown to perform well in obtaining contaminant concentration values huang et al 2020 ccl4 solution was added to the collected lnapl samples to obtain the absorbance of each lnapl sample several specific concentrations of diesel were manually prepared in advance to plot the absorbance and a standard curve between lnapl concentration and absorbance by fitting a linear model fig 2 it should be noted that the lnapl concentration in this paper is the concentration of solution in which the lnapl samples were extracted and fixed to 10 ml with ccl4 solution to ensure the accuracy of results it was important to collect three samples consecutively and then take the average of concentrations of three samples the pinchcocks in the sampling ports at different locations would be removed when collecting the samples to obtain the lnapl concentration the collected lnapl samples were separated and the corresponding absorbance was measured and substituted into the fitted linear model 2 4 experimental procedures laboratory experiments focused on investigating the effect of various factors and conditions on lnapl migration in filled fractured media 2 4 1 filling of standard sand prior to the start of each experiment sand was sieved through a standard sieve and washed with distilled water to remove any fine particles that might be present alazaiza et al 2021 the sieved sand was then oven dried for 6 8 h at 105 110 c to remove any moisture three standard sands with a moisture content of 5 were made to fill the experimental model xiao 2017 after the position of the fractured rock mass was marked the aperture was calibrated with a graduated scale to ensure that the aperture was even and sieved standard sand was evenly laid in the model inside the fractures and around the marble slabs to keep the sand layer tight sand was filled slowly and every 2 3 cm it was gently tapped down uniformly with cardboard the standard sand used for each experiment was weighed and the bulk density of the filled sand was approximately 1 42 1 77 g cm3 the filling of sand was completed when the sand thickness was flush with the top surface of the fractured marble the filled sand was then left to settle under natural ambient conditions for 24 h before lnapl was injected after the formation of three filled fractures a layer of filter screen was laid along the top of the fractured rock mass then a 5 cm high gravel layer consisting of particles with d 5 0 8 0 mm was overlain on the top to mitigate erosion that could potentially take place by lightly compacting with cardboard to keep the gravel layer tight fig 3 2 4 2 assembly of the device a movable iron frame was set on the left side of the model a cylindrical overflow ladle was placed above and a rubber hose with a control valve was used to connect the overflow ladle and the model one side of the symmetrical hole was inserted into the sampling needles and the other side was connected to pressure transducers a high definition digital camera was set up on the front of the model with a tripod and the shooting height and angle were adjusted to track and record lnapl migration process of 2 4 3 injection of lnapl and water lnapl was injected by keeping the volume to be constant an oil pool with a height of 2 cm was formed using a plastic wrap at the top of the 5 cm high gravel layer the initial moisture content of the filled sand during each experiment was 5 the initial water table in the experimental model was 0 cm fig 3 the distilled water was only injected into the model when the effect of groundwater level on lnapl migration was studied at the beginning of the experiment the plastic wrap at the top of the 5 cm high gravel layer was quickly removed to allow the instantaneous and uniform infiltration of lnapl after it was stable for 24 h distilled water was injected orpumped into the model from the bottom inlet valve at a rate of 12 60 ml s using a peristaltic pump bt300 2 j longer precision pump co ltd the peristaltic pump was stopped when the water table reached the set target value of 35 or 60 cm 2 4 4 image calibration and data acquisition when lnapl injection started the high definition digital camera was activated and the shooting intervals at different stages were 5 s 30 s 1 min and 10 min respectively the camera was kept at the same distance of 1 2 m from the experimental model during each experiment the image capture process was controlled using the eos utility software to avoid displacement and vibration the total time for capturing the experimental images was 24 h furthermore the image calibration function in mapgis software was used to correct the captured images to avoid the effects of light intensity and human factors four image calibration points were set up and marked on the experimental model before the start of the experiment with their coordinates being 0 0 0 70 80 70 and 80 0 respectively the four correction points of the captured images were fitted to the standard frame to obtain the calibrated experimental images fig 4 the locations of the lnapl migration front were observed and recorded at regular intervals the lnapl migration depth and contamination area in each fracture were measured the absorbance of each lnapl sample was measured and lnapl concentration was obtained by calculation to ensure the accuracy of results it was important to collect three samples consecutively and then taking the average of the concentrations of the three samples the change in pressure values at each monitoring port were recorded via a datalogger and the results were displayed in real time on a computer monitor which was used as a supplementary method to verify the arrival of lnapl at the ports 2 5 numerical method 2 5 1 mathematical model in the unsaturated zone of fractured media the migration of lnapl is a three phase flow problem including lnapl phase water phase and gas phase the multiphase flow equation is based on the law of conservation of mass darcy s law law of conservation of heat and law of force balance for each phase the effect of temperature and non equilibrium forces were not considered in this simulation the matrix of the fractured rock in the experiment was impermeable while the fractures were all filled with the same type of sand and lnapl only migrated within the network of filled fractures thus the filled fractures were treated to be homogeneous in terms of hydraulic parameters based on the law of conservation of mass and darcy s law the governing equations of each phase i can be obtained as zhou et al 2019a 1 k ρ o k r o μ o p o ρ o q o ρ o n s o t 2 k ρ w k r w μ w p w ρ w q w ρ w n s w t 3 k ρ g k s g μ g ρ o k r o r s μ o ρ w k r w r s w μ w p g ρ g q g ρ o q o ρ w q w t n ρ o r s s o ρ w r s w s w ρ g s g where ρ o ρ w and ρ g are densities of non aqueous liquid water and gas respectively k ro k rw and k sg are relative permeabilities of non aqueous liquid water and gas respectively k is intrinsic permeability μ o μ w and μ g are dynamic viscosities of non aqueous liquid water and gas respectively p o p w and p g are pressures of non aqueous liquid water and gas respectively q o q w and q g are source sink intensities of non aqueous fluid water and gas respectively while if a phase has no source sink term it will be 0 n is porosity s o s w and s g are saturations of non aqueous liquid water and gas in the media respectively r s is solubility of gas for a non aqueous liquid under standard state and r sw is solubility of the gas in water under standard state it should be noted that the lnapl concentration in this paper is the concentration of solution in which the lnapl samples were extracted and fixed to 10 ml with ccl4 solution in addition to ensure the uniformity of the experimental and numerical results saturation results obtained from all numerical simulations were also converted into concentrations using the same processing method the fractured rock matrix within the experimental model was impermeable the initial moisture content of filled sand was 5 and lnapl was injected as source sink terms q o at a constant volume from the top of the model standard atmospheric pressure no water or gas was injected in the numerical simulations qw qg 0 the left right and bottom sides of the experimental model were no flow boundaries of oil water and gas the fractures in the experiment were all filled with same type of sand and could be considered as a homogeneous porous medium to describe the relationship between water content of the filled sand and pressure head the van genuchten vg model van genuchten 1980 was used 4 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 αh n 1 1 n 5 s w θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 αh n 1 1 n where h is pressure head which affects the magnitude of the three phase pressures p ρgh in equation 1 3 θ h is sand water content at a pressure head of h θ s and θr are saturated and residual values of sand water content respectively and α and n are vg model parameters s w is saturation of water which is a function of sand water content and its magnitude is influenced by porosity n in equation 1 3 this is because when the sand is saturated saturated water content is numerically the same as porosity of sand θ s n it should be noted that the vg model was only used for the porous medium composed of filled sand and not for fractures also based on the vg model and hydraulic conductivity characteristics the relationship between relative permeability and saturation in multiphase flow is obtained as dou et al 2012 6 k rw s w 1 2 1 1 s w 1 1 1 n 1 1 n 2 as the sum of the saturation of the lnapl water and gas phases is 1 so s w sg 1 and here only the equation for the relative permeability of water is presented while the relative permeability of the other two phases can also be calculated in the experiments all fractures were filled with porous media the seepage characteristics of the filled fractures were not only related to the aperture of the fracture but also to the properties of the filling materials such as the particle composition porosity and particle size maillot et al 2016 7 k f g b 2 12 μ 12 n 3 20 4 1 3 1 n b d 2 k r ρ g μ where k f is the fluid conductivity of filled fracture b is the aperture of fracture μ is the dynamic viscosity the dynamic viscosities of diesel and water are 4 05 mpa s and 1 01 mpa s respectively when the fluid temperature is 20 c n is the porosity sand filling the fractures and d is particle size of filling material k r is relative permeability of fluid and ρ is fluid density equation 7 was input into comsol and invoked automatically comsol automatically calculated the k f values of three fractures f1 f2 and f3 and applied them to all simulations and they are related to saturation of each phase through the relative permeability of each fluid which varies with the saturation of three phases lnapl water and gas 2 5 2 comsol multiphysics comsol multiphysics software is a finite element analysis software based on multiphysics partial differential equations which can be used to solve linear and nonlinear steady state and transient problems the lnapl in this experiment was released with a fixed water head and a peristaltic pump was used to maintain the lnapl height of 2 cm after the lnapl flowed out of the fracture injection was stopped the particle size of the filling sand was 0 15 0 3 mm a numerical model corresponding to the physical model was built considering both multiphase and fracture flow and richards equations under the comsol fluid flow module to simulate the migration of lnapl in filled fractured network the numerical model had the same size 80 cm 80 cm and conditions as the experimental model adaptive mesh refinement was utilized for model scenarios with denser and finer meshing around the fractures the model domain was discretized with 25 980 triangular elements fig 5 the model range of parameters used for the numerical simulations were presented in table 2 the vg model parameters for the three sand types 0 15 0 30 mm 0 25 0 50 mm and 0 50 1 00 mm were presented separately the other hydrogeological parameters input into the model awere the same as in the laboratory experiments table 1 such as dry density porosity and hydraulic conductivity etc they were set to be constant and remained unchanged during simulations 2 5 3 fitting method for numerical and experimental results to run the numerical model and comparing the results to those obtained from the laboratory experiments parameters of filled sand that we input into the model were treated to be the same as in the laboratory experiments such as dry density porosity and hydraulic conductivity in addition vg model parameters α n θ s and θr were calibrated using the root mean square error rmse by comparing the similarity between numerical and experimental results and these parameters were varied to achieve a good fit the calibrated vg model parameters for the three sand types were shown in table 5 the top surface of the fractured rock mass was treated as the zero plane and its distance from the lnapl migration front so 0 001 was treated as the lnapl migration depth the lnapl migration depths in fracture f2 and the porous media were used for calibration and the rmse of the migration depth was calculated by 8 rmse t 1 n l to l t c 2 n where n is the number of data l to is the observed value of lnapl migration depth and l tc is the calculated value of lnapl migration depth 3 results and analysis 3 1 experimental results 3 1 1 the effect of sand size on lnapl migration to minimize soil pollution and avoid large scale contaminant migration most underground oil storage tanks oil storage caverns and underground oil pipelines have been located on bedrock which has low porosity and permeability li et al 2014 liu 2012 however different types and characteristics of filling materials in the fractures will also affect the migration characteristics of lnapl in the experiments three kinds of fracture network filled with different particle sizes were studied and their migration characteristics were analyzed the experiments were divided into three groups consisting of different sand sizes filling fractures 0 15 0 3 mm 0 25 0 5 mm and 0 5 1 0 mm the particle size of the sand filled in the fractures and the sand on both sides of the marble was the same the diesel injection method injection volume boundary conditions source sink term and temperature were the same during the three groups of experiments the migration and changes of lnapl at different times during the infiltration process were recorded by a high definition digital camera fig 6 the statistics of lnapl migration characteristics were shown in table 3 the pressure values at different locations were monitored by automated high frequency pressure data transducers with the instantaneous release of lnapl at a height of 2 cm the lnapl continuously entered the filled fracture network and the porous media on both sides of the fractured rock mass during the early stages of infiltration lnapl migration was very fast later in the infiltration process lnapl migration velocity slowed down significantly and reached the bottom exit of the fractures this was due to more open pores at the top layers of fractures when an uneven compression occurred in the top layers alazaiza et al 2017 within the range of particle size variation of the three groups of filled sand the larger the particle size resulted in a faster the lnapl migration velocity at the same time the greater the depth of infiltration and the larger the lnapl contaminated area fig 6 a b and c showed that particle size of the filling had an important effect on the lnapl migration process after the instantaneous injection of lnapl lnapl infiltrated rapidly in the gravel layer under gravity lnapl preferentially selected three filled fracture channels with lower resistance to migrate preferentially downward because part of the lnapl flow pathway was blocked by marble for the lnapl in porous media on both sides of the fractured marble its migration velocity was lower than that of the lnapl in filled fractures the filling material in the fracture network had a strong controlling effect on lnapl migration when the initial moisture content of the filled sand was 5 the amount of lnapl entering and passing through the fracture channel per unit time was larger if the particle size was larger the migration front advanced faster and the infiltration depth of lnapl in fractured rock mass was larger at the same time the results of concentration detection and pressure monitoring at different positions in the fractures also verified this observation in general the filled fractured marble changed the lnapl migration behaviour when the sand particle sizes were 0 15 0 30 mm 0 25 0 50 mm and 0 5 1 0 mm the lnapl migration velocity in porous media was about 50 41 8 and 30 7 of its migration velocity in filled fractures respectively the larger particle size of the filling material the faster the migration velocity of lnapl and the shorter the migration time the filling material composition in the fracture network in the fractured rock mass area will have an important impact on lnapl migration which requires special attention in the investigation of actual contaminated sites 3 1 2 the effect of groundwater level on lnapl entrapment most oil contaminated sites are caused by leakage from underground oil storage tanks or underground oil pipelines liu 2012 after the lnapl infiltrates into the subsurface most of it will migrate downwards within the complex fracture network of the rock mass due to the strong entrapment capacity and attenuation of the unsaturated zone for aqueous phase contaminants ma and li 2014 guo et al 2019b and the lower density of lnapl than water most of the lnapl will stay in the unsaturated zone above the groundwater surface if the amount of lnapl leakage is not large however with the arrival of the wet season abundant rainfall will result in increased recharge and raise the groundwater level at a contaminated site which will then impact lnapl entrapment in filled fractured media for our laboratory experiments after lnapl migration through filled fractures reached completion groundwater level was raised to study its effect on lnapl below the groundwater level the changes to lnapl positions were observed and monitored through each monitoring port and concentrations were measured when the groundwater level was raised to be flush with the upper end of the fractured rock mass water injection was stopped the change of the pressure at each port was recorded in real time through the pressure monitoring system and lnapl samples from each monitoring port were collected periodically and analyzed for their concentrations the lnapl concentration changes with time at representative monitoring ports under different filling particle sizes were shown in fig 7 after the lnapl infiltration experiments reached a steady state the groundwater level of the three groups of experiments was raised to 70 cm due to the displacement of distilled water the mobile lnapl would migrate upwards with the rising groundwater table resulting in a rapid increase in its concentration within 0 30 min within 30 60 min except for the continuous increase of the sample concentration values at ports h7 h8 and h9 the concentration of the samples collected at the other monitoring ports peaked and then decreased rapidly the reason was that the entrapped lnapl in the original fracture network quickly floated up due to buoyancy and reached the groundwater surface resulting in the accumulation of lnapl at ports h7 h8 and h9 the experimental process images recorded by a high definition digital camera also verified this during the 24 h continuous monitoring process the concentration values at each monitoring port had reached a stable level the concentration at most of the monitoring ports in fractures decreased to 0 mg ml due to the rise of the groundwater level but concentration values at some monitoring ports were still maintained at a certain level fig 7 when the particle size was 0 15 0 3 mm the concentration values at ports h25 h26 and h27 were stable in the range of 0 215 0 230 mg ml and the concentration values at ports h12 h13 h21 and h22 were stable in the range of 0 036 0 077 mg ml when the particle size was 0 25 0 5 mm the concentration values at ports h25 h26 and h27 were stable in the range of 0 237 0 271 mg ml and the concentration values at both ports h13 and h21 were stable in the range of 0 042 0 050 mg ml when the particle size was 0 5 1 0 mm the concentration values at ports h21 h25 h26 and h27 were stable at 0 008 0 020 mg ml in summary the concentration values at each port reached a stable value after the groundwater level was raised for 24 h because the buoyancy of water was not sufficient to overcome the gravitational viscous and capillary forces lnapl was entrapped below the groundwater surface and might become a continuous source of groundwater pollution long term entrapped lnapl would penetrate into the surrounding rock matrix and migrate into other fractures where they would be difficult to remove to further explore the effect of particle size of the filling material in the fracture network on the migration behaviour of lnapl the distribution of lnapl under three particle sizes was continued to be visually compared when the particle size was 0 15 0 3 mm and 0 25 0 5 mm it was difficult for the entrapped lnapl to overcome its own gravitational viscous and capillary forces and move upward due to the large depth of the groundwater level of ports h25 h26 and h27 therefore although the concentration at the three ports decreased rapidly under the influence of the rising groundwater level it finally maintained a high level of 0 20 0 30 mg ml fig 7 a and b however when the particle size was 0 5 1 0 mm the pore size was large thus the amount of entrapped lnapl was reduced and it would slowly move upward to reach the groundwater surface it showed that the entrapped amount of lnapl below the groundwater surface was closely related to the pore size of the filling material in addition when the particle size was 0 15 0 3 mm the number of ports located below the groundwater surface and lnapl was detected was 7 h12 h13 h21 h22 h25 h26 and h27 when the particle size was 0 25 0 5 mm the number of ports located below the groundwater surface and lnapl was detected was 5 h13 h21 h25 h26 and h27 when the particle size was 0 5 1 0 mm the number of ports located below the groundwater surface and lnapl was detected was 4 h21 h25 h26 and h27 and the concentration values were below 0 10 mg ml it could be seen that the larger particle size the smaller the amount of lnapl entrapment within the filled sand and buoyancy would dominate lnapl migration the entrapped amount of lnapl below the groundwater surface decreased as the particle size of the filling material increased at the same time lnapl concentration values at the intersection of the fracture network tended to be higher than in other fractures at the same depth beneath the groundwater level and even higher than in fractures at a deeper depth in general for filled fractured rock mass that has been contaminated with lnapl rising of the groundwater level significantly affected the lnapl migration behaviour within the fracture network 3 1 3 the effect of groundwater level fluctuation on lnapl migration the seasonal fluctuation of groundwater level and the influence of water pumping and water injection during engineering construction will render the migration of lnapl in filled fractured media to be more complicated that is lnapl migration behaviour will change as the groundwater level rises or fails three previous groups of infiltration experiments were all carried out based on the groundwater level being fixed at 0 cm i e the bottom of the experimental model fig 3 and groundwater level lowering experiments were not carried out to further investigate the effect of groundwater level fluctuation on lnapl migration within fractures several additional experiments were performed the particle size of the filling material was 0 5 1 0 mm and the lnapl injection method injection volume boundary conditions source sink term and temperature were same as in previous experiments two groups of experiments were added 1 the initial groundwater level was 35 cm and the groundwater level was raised to 60 cm after the infiltration experiments and the initial groundwater level was 60 cm and the groundwater level was lowered to 35 cm after the infiltration experiments 1 the initial groundwater level was 35 cm and lnapl with a height of 2 cm was allowed to infiltrate instantaneously with the sudden removal of the plastic wrap which quickly allowed for lnapl infiltration to the groundwater surface under the effect of gravity fig 8 a after the lnapl position was completely stabilized the groundwater level was raised to 60 cm and the original entrapped lnapl gradually moved upward to the vicinity of the new groundwater level due to buoyancy fig 8 b due to the differences in permeabilities of geomaterials lnapl migration was hindered by the relatively intact and less permeable rock mass while lnapl quickly migrated downward through three filled fractures from 3 to 10 min lnapl in three fractures all reached the groundwater surface and lnapl in fracture f2 stayed above the groundwater surface however because the large lnapl pressure was greater than capillary and buoyancy forces lnapl in fracture f3 did not stop after reaching the groundwater surface lnapl continued to migrate below the groundwater surface and took the lead to reach port h21 where it intersected with fracture f1 resulting in an increase in lnapl concentration and pressure at port h21 from 10 to 360 min fig 9 lnapl migration velocity gradually slowed down after reaching the groundwater surface continued accumulation of lnapl at the groundwater surface resulted in a continuous increase in lnapl concentration and pressure values from 360 to 1440 min due to the continued accumulation of lnapl lnapl was detected at ports h25 h26 and h27 indicating that a small amount of lnapl entered the lower portion of the filled fractures after lnapl migration stabilized at t 1440 min the groundwater level was raised and lnapl at the original groundwater surface began to move upward along the fracture channels during the rising of the groundwater level from 1440 to 1441 min fig 9 lnapl in three fractures all rose rapidly and began to accumulate at the new groundwater surface the lnapl concentration at ports h21 and h22 suddenly decreased and lnapl was detected in the area between the original groundwater level and the new groundwater level from 1441 to 1500 min lnapl concentration monitored at ports h12 and h13 continued to increase fig 9 the concentration at port h12 was lower than at port h13 because h13 was supplied by lnapl from two fractures lnapl concentration at ports h16 h17 and h18 first increased and then decreased with time this was because the lnapl was entrapped near the three sampling holes with the rising groundwater level lnapl coated the sand particles forming a layer of lnapl film on the surface which made the sand adhesive pan et al 2018 however with the gradual saturation of the filling sand the water phase was more likely to saturate the sand than lnapl lnapl continued to migrate upward to reach the new groundwater surface due to its buoyancy from 1500 to 1800 min fig 9 the increasing rate of lnapl concentration monitored at ports h12 and h13 gradually slowed down among three sampling ports at the middle except for the concentration at port h17 the concentration at ports h16 and h18 decreased slowly which might be the effect of lnapl redissolving from 1800 to 2880 min fig 9 the lnapl height at the groundwater surface remained stable and the lnapl concentration collected at the sampling ports in three fractures did not change significantly however lnapl concentration at ports h21 and h22 were both greater than 0 fig 9 and the existence of lnapl could still be observed around some ports and the most in fracture f3 results showed that lnapl did not fully migrate upwards as the groundwater level rose there was still a significant amount lnapl left in fractures and could be a potential source of groundwater pollution in the future 2 the initial groundwater level was 60 cm and lnapl with a height of 2 cm was allowed to infiltrate instantaneously with the the sudden removal of plastic wrap which allowed lnapl to quickly infiltrate to the groundwater surface under the effect of gravity fig 10 a after lnapl completely stabilized the groundwater level was lowered to 35 cm and lnapl at the original groundwater surface moved down rapidly with the groundwater level fig 10 b from 0 5 to 1 min lnapl in fractures f2 and f3 first reached the groundwater surface and continued to accumulate near the groundwater surface the lnapl migration front in two fractures completed the intersection at port h13 which continuously increased the concentration at port h13 pressure measurements at port h13 also revealed an increase during this period from 1 to 10 min lnapl above the groundwater surface continued to migrate downward but the migration velocity had slowed down significantly lnapl in fracture f1 reached the groundwater surface and began to migrate below the groundwater surface from 10 to 60 min lnapl were detected at ports h16 h17 and h21 in the water saturated zone which were affected by the accumulation of lnapl from 60 to 720 min lnapl concentration at each port remained stable for two reasons the oil pressure formed by lnapl was limited due to the small release and high groundwater level and the other was the limited short term solubility of lnapl experimental results showed that most of the leaked lnapl would float on the groundwater surface however a small amount of lnapl could enter the water saturated zone hardisty et al 1998 2003 dippenaar et al 2005 which was influenced by the amount of lnapl infiltration fracture aperture particle size of filling and groundwater level after the migration of lnapl has become stable at t 1440 min the groundwater level was lowered and lnapl at the original groundwater surface began to migrate downwards along the fracture channels from 1440 to 1450 min fig 11 lnapl in three fractures moved down slowly as the groundwater level and the lnapl concentration at ports h12 and h13 suddenly decreased fig 11 there were visible lnapl columns in the area between the original groundwater level and the new groundwater level and lnapl accumulation began to appear at the lowered groundwater level from 1500 to 2880 min fig 11 the increase of lnapl concentration at the groundwater surface gradually slowed down lnapl coated the sand particles forming a layer of lnapl film on the surface which made the sand adhesive lnapl would fill in the sand pores and cause pore blocking pan et al 2018 different from previous research results although the lnapl accumulating at the groundwater surface was still increasing entrapped lnapl above the groundwater surface was still relatively large and its residual depth range basically included all areas from the initial groundwater level to the final groundwater level lenhard et al 2017 lekmine et al 2017 lnapl could be trapped in sand filled pores and fractures due to the interplay of viscous gravity and capillary forces francisca and montoro 2015 lu et al 2017 results showed that lnapl remained in the unsaturated zone after being entrapped by the filling sand and the amount was very large moreover the lnapl entrapment capacity of sands was different with the smaller the particle size the stronger the entrapment capacity shu et al 2002 zhou et al 2019b the lnapl accumulated in the fracture network migrated downward due to gravity after the groundwater table was lowered but it could not enter the lower part of the filled fractures because the gravitational force on lnapl was insufficient to overcome the capillary force and water buoyancy 3 2 numerical simulation results of lnapl migration in filled fractured media 3 2 1 comparison of numerical and experimental results the laboratory experiment was mainly designed and conducted to simulate lnapl migration in the physical model due to the limitation of experimental conditions and time it was difficult to complete the design and to conduct various laboratory experiments for many specific working conditions such as variable aperture variable inclination and variable number of fractures therefore the study used a numerical method to conduct the related supplementary studies on the migration behaviour of lnapl in filled fractured media the numerical model was assigned values according to relevant parameters of the physical model and reference values from previous research results for these simulations the fractures were filled with sand with a particle size of 0 15 0 3 mm the numerical model was calibrated by comparing the numerical results with experimental results time lapsed experimental and numerical images at 1 min 5 min 10 min and 25 min were shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively comparing the lnapl infiltration images in figs 12 and 13 we can find that the experimental and numerical images of lnapl migration in filled fractured media were consistent in terms of overall lnapl distribution and trend with the continuous injection of lnapl lnapl migration depth gradually increased and the lnapl migration velocity in filled fracture network was significantly different from that of the porous media on both sides to more accurately compare and quantitatively describe the similarity between the numerical and experimental images lnapl migration data in three filled fractures and porous media on both sides at 0 5 min 1 min 3 min 5 min 10 min 15 min 20 min and 25 min were calculated and summarized in table 4 and the migration data of fracture f2 fig 14a and porous media fig 14b on both sides were fitted respectively it could be seen from fig 14 that the overall fit of numerical simulation results to experimental data was good and the trend in curves was generally consistent the root mean square error of lnapl migration depths in f2 and porous media were 1 299 and 1 085 respectively small errors at certain time periods might be due to uneven sand filling as well as experimental and numerical errors during the filling of fractures with sand settlement of sand and uneven artificial compaction could have potentially led increased compaction of filling material at some positions resulting in smaller lnapl migration velocities at these positions for the numerical simulation the filling was considered to be uniformly distributed when assigning relevant parameters thus lnapl migration would not be affected by these factors in summary the simulated and experimental lnapl migration depths were comparable the numerical model was found to simulate laboratory experiment results quite well thus could be used for predictive simulations the calibrated vg model parameters were shown in table 5 and they were used for additional simulations of lnapl migration in filled fractured media as described next 3 2 2 the effect of fracture inclination on lnapl migration based on the calibration of the numerical model the main hydrogeological parameters of the numerical model were obtained the numerical model was used to complement the study of the effect of fracture inclination on lnapl migration in filled fractured media fractures in nature are often randomly distributed and most of them are not vertical but instead may be inclined the lnapl migration behaviour in filled fractured media was studied when the inclination of a single filled fracture was varied over angles of 90 75 and 60 measured relative to a horizontal plane based on laboratory physical model a penetrating fracture was set in the middle of the fractured marble the aperture of fracture was set to be 2 cm and the fracture was filled with sand with a particle size of 0 5 1 0 mm time lapsed images of lnapl migration predicted at different times were obtained and shown on fig 15 it could be seen from fig 15 that fracture inclination had an important influence on lnapl migration in filled fractured media within the range of fracture inclination set by the simulation lnapl migration depth in filled fractured media was proportional to fracture inclination fig 16 lnapl migration depth in porous media on both sides at the same time was basically the same fig 16 at 1 min lnapl migration depth with fracture inclination of 90 75 and 60 in filled fractured media were 8 2 cm 8 1 cm and 7 8 cm respectively during the early stage of lnapl infiltration lnapl had just passed through the gravel layer to reach the fractured rock mass the lnapl amount entering filled fractured media was still small and its weight was not large enough to overcome the resistance of the filling material during this period lnapl migration velocity was similarsame underfor the three fracture inclinations and its migration depth was not significantly impacted by fracture inclination after 2 min lnapl preferentially migrated rapidly in filled fractured media and the lnapl migration velocity with inclinations of 90 and 75 were faster than that of the porous medium on both sides the lnapl migration depth with an inclination of 90 reached 30 2 cm at 5 min while lnapl migration velocity with an inclination of 60 was similar compared to porous media on both sides and the migration depth was only 20 1 cm it could be seen from fig 15 that for higher inclinations of filled fracture lnapl migrates preferentially downward to a lower level compared to the surrounding porous medium at later time t 10 min lnapl migration velocity in filled fractured media decreased with a decrease in fracture inclination at 20 min the lnapl in filled fracture with an inclination of 90 first migrated out of the fracture and the migration depth reached 53 5 cm the lnapl migration velocity in the filled fracture with an inclination of 60 was the slowest and the migration depth was only 38 1 cm based on these results one can conclude that lnapl migration depth in filled fractured media decreases with a decrease in fracture inclination which can provide guidance on anticipated migration depths under field conditions 4 discussion based on previous research results most studies on lnapl migration have focused on porous media alazaiza et al 2017 2020b 2021 onaa et al 2021 such as soil research on lnapl migration in fractured rock mass have been mainly based on laboratory simulation of single fracture and numerical simulations and only few studies on lnapl migration behaviour in filled fractured rock mass have been previously published martel et al 2019 boumaiza et al 2022 based on the previous research results of filled fracture huang et al 2014 an experimental apparatus to study contaminants migration in filled fractured marble was developed for this study our experimental results showed that lnapl would migrate below the groundwater surface when the aperture of the fracture was large enough which was consistent with the results obtained by hardisty et al 1998 2003 comparing our results with results of lu et al 2017 in a rough single fracture and oil thickness in a well computed by atteia et al 2019 it was found that lnapl in filled fracture network would migrate upward with the rise of the groundwater level different from their results a significant amount of lnapl was still trapped below the groundwater level due to lnapl entrapment within the filling material that may act as a potential contamination source of the aquifer in the future during the experiment it was found that the preferential flow behaviour of lnapl in fractured porous media also was observed in filled fractured media mclaren et al 2000 huang et al 2020 in this study the phenomenon of preferential flow was strongly affected by the particle size of the filling material in particular it should be pointed out that lnapl had various phases such as free phase dissolved phase minimal and entrapped phase dippenaar et al 2005 ruan et al 2021 shen et al 2021 the entrapped phase caused the development of anomalous peaks at monitoring ports located below the groundwater surface subsequently a multiphase flow numerical simulation code comsol was introduced and utilized to predict lnapl migration in filled fractured media huo et al 2014 chen et al 2020 thus lnapl migration behaviour was influenced by the composition of the filling groundwater level and fracture inclination further studies on the effects of fracture aperture as well as lnapl properties i e density viscosity surface tension temperature on migration behaviour requires further investigations it is necessary to carry out systematic and in depth research because the migration mechanism is complex and a unified understanding is still lacking thus further research is necessary 5 conclusions with rapid worldwide economic development oil pollution problems caused by leakage of oil storage facilities have dramatically increased in this study lnapl migration behaviour in filled fractured media was studied through laboratory physical experiments and corresponding numerical simulations the focus was on the effect of filling material composition groundwater level fluctuation and fracture inclination on lnapl migration this study led to the following conclusions 1 during the initial stage after lnapl was released its migration velocity in filled fracture network was significantly faster than that in porous media on both sides which was referred to as preferential flow the characteristics of the filling material had an important influence on lnapl migration and its migration velocity increased with the increase of particle size of the filling material 2 the rise of the groundwater level caused the lnapl in filled fractured media to move upward with the groundwater level and eventually reached the groundwater surface but a significant amount of lnapl was still entrapped below the groundwater surface and the entrapped amount had a strong relationship with the particle size of the filling sand as the particle size of the filling sand decreased the entrapment capacity became stronger and the effect of buoyancy was less than the sum of gravitational viscous and capillary forces which made it difficult for lnapl to become mobilized and might become a continuous source of groundwater pollution long term entrapped lnapl could penetrate into the surrounding rock matrix and migrate into other fractures where they would be difficult to remove 3 the seasonal fluctuation of groundwater level resulted in more complex impact on lnapl migration a during the dry season most of the leaked lnapl remained near the groundwater surface but some lnapl overcame the buoyancy of water and migrated below the groundwater surface due to its increasing weight and b during the wet season almost all lnapl remained near the groundwater surface because of the buoyancy of water and caused difficultiesit for the lnapl to enter below the groundwater surface after the groundwater level was lowered lnapl would rapidly migrate downwards with the groundwater level until it reached the new groundwater surface 4 in order to further complement the research the effect of the fracture inclination on lnapl migration in filled fractured media was investigated through numerical simulation methods results showed that the effect of fracture inclination on the migration of lnapl in filled fractured media was not significant during the initial stage of lnapl infiltration however during the later stage of lnapl infiltration lnapl migration velocity and penetration depth increased with an increase in fracture inclination on the whole lnapl migration in filled fractured network media is affected by the particle size of the filling materials groundwater level fluctuation and fracture inclination however the complexity of lnapl migration and possible experimental errors in the experimental process renders our research results to have certain limitations we will continue to study the migration mechanism of lnapl in filled fractured media through

1223,quantifying voc transport from contaminated groundwater to streams is challenging and important for understanding off site migration of vocs cross media contamination groundwater to surface water and eventually air and potential impacts on downstream ecosystems and human populations a streambed point sampling approach was used to quantify fluxes of water and 14 vocs from groundwater to an urban stream in north carolina usa during summer june 2015 and winter january 2016 the approach is unique in coupling measurements of vertical hydraulic conductivity vertical hydraulic head gradient and groundwater voc concentration at each individual sampling point reducing or eliminating some potential concerns with other darcian methods for quantifying voc inputs to streams most results were consistent with discharge of two main voc plumes on opposite sides of the stream plume 1 from the west side was dominated by cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce and vinyl chloride vc at mean concentrations of 19 and 11 μg l 1 respectively plume 2 from the east side was dominated by benzene mean concentration 56 μg l 1 plume 2 was not previously known and the improved sampling approach allowed voc discharge from both plumes to be quantified simultaneously for 13 of the 14 detected vocs the mean voc flux from groundwater to the stream f voc was higher in january 2016 than in june 2015 mainly because groundwater flux was higher in january the only exception was cdce the most abundant voc in plume 1 which had mean f voc values of 9 8 and 9 5 mg m 2 d 1 in june 2015 and january 2016 respectively benzene was the most abundant voc in plume 2 and had mean f voc values of 11 and 37 mg m 2 d 1 in june 2015 and january 2016 respectively high groundwater flux drove almost all the occurrences of high voc flux for a given voc the flow weighted mean concentration with each voc concentration weighted by the upward groundwater flux at the voc sampling point was generally larger than the unweighted mean concentration thus flow weighting of concentrations gave a more accurate indication of the average voc concentration in net groundwater discharge to the stream an estimate of total voc mass discharge from groundwater to the study reach of the stream 3 6 kg of voc per year was based on the f voc results and streambed area in the reach the bulk of this discharge was due to benzene cdce and vc with individual mass discharges of 2 1 0 83 and 0 40 kg yr 1 respectively estimates of maximum potential voc degradation in the streambed suggest that the 3 6 kg yr 1 estimate of mass discharge was not sensitive to potential degradation of vocs in the streambed sediments above the groundwater sampling depth keywords voc contaminant flux groundwater stream data availability the data used are given in online supplementary material associated with the paper 1 introduction volatile organic compounds vocs are common groundwater contaminants in a survey of voc contamination by the u s geological survey vocs were found in 19 of the groundwater samples from 3498 u s wells when a screening level of 0 2 μg l 1 was applied in a subset of 1687 wells with a lower screening level of 0 02 μg l 1 the percentage of contaminated samples jumped to 51 zogorski et al 2006 quantifying voc flux mass per area per time and mass discharge mass per time is challenging and important for understanding voc transport in the environment this is especially true at the interface between groundwater and surface water where voc mass transfer from contaminated groundwater to streams and rivers can result in off site migration of vocs cross media contamination groundwater to surface water and eventually air and potential impacts on downstream ecosystems and human populations quantifying voc mass flux and discharge from groundwater to surface water generally requires field data on both voc concentration and groundwater flow rate at least in the majority of cases in which advective transport is much greater than molecular diffusive transport one approach has been to estimate voc flux through a vertical plane in an aquifer e g einarson and mackay 2001 basu et al 2006 kübert and finkel 2006 béland pelletier et al 2011 the approach has generally relied on a control plane oriented normal to groundwater flow and defined by a number of multi level samplers mls or well clusters at which contaminant concentrations in groundwater are determined water flux through the plane is generally based on darcy s equation often using a single value of average hydraulic conductivity k and or head gradient i for the entire plane e g guilbeault et al 2005 in some cases the control plane has been positioned parallel to and several meters m from a stream for the purpose of quantifying voc discharge into the stream conant jr et al 2004 rønde et al 2017 in a different approach chapman et al 2007 used two control planes normal to a stream to quantify voc discharge from groundwater to the stream in general potential complications with the control plane approach could include voc flux beneath or around the plane and the significant expense of well cluster or mls installation when the vertical control plane approach is used to estimate voc discharge from groundwater to a stream quantifying the entire discharge would generally require a control plane on each side of the stream unless site information demonstrates no contaminant discharge from one side of the watershed such information may often be lacking especially in urban environments with a complex history of commercial and industrial activity also voc degradation or production between the control plane and the stream channel may cause the flux and discharge of some contaminants into the stream to differ from what is estimated at the control plane for example conant jr et al 2004 concluded that most voc degradation at their site occurred within about 2 5 m of the channel in some cases useful information on in situ degradation at the field scale was derived from the difference in voc mass discharge between two parallel control planes e g barbaro and neupane 2006 basu et al 2006 but degradation between a control plane and a parallel stream channel would cause underestimation of voc discharge to the stream in the control plane approach one concern not fully explored is the averaging generally used especially for k and or i strictly speaking one would want to know k and i for each point at which contaminant concentration c is known and know the partial area of the control plane relevant to each measurement point a and sum the individual ckia values from each area of the control plane to compute total contaminant discharge through the plane because the sum of individual ckia values may differ from the product of the total plane area and the plane average c k and i values that difference is one definition of covariance while the covariance of independent variables is zero it s not obvious that c k and i would generally qualify as independent variables in a plane through contaminated groundwater for example i tends to be high where k is low e g kübert and finkel 2006 conant jr et al 2004 found that voc concentrations were highest where water flux was low and kennedy et al 2009a also found that i was high where k was low while these two studies were in streambeds and not a vertical control plane they provide examples of lack of independence of point scale concentration and groundwater flux variables for a hypothetical contaminant plume in a numerical groundwater model kübert and finkel 2006 investigated the potential uncertainty associated with use of average values in the control plane approach but to our knowledge this issue has not yet been evaluated with field data as an example using data in table 2 of kennedy et al 2009a we calculate that the mean nitrate flux from groundwater to their study stream would be erroneously high by a factor of 1 4 to 2 4 if computed as the product of mean k i and c values in the streambed rather than as the mean of the individual kic products at the individual measurement points some studies have utilized measurements within a stream channel rather than vertical control planes in nearby groundwater a number of studies have looked at voc transformations in streambeds focusing mainly on chlorinated ethenes e g abe et al 2009 freitas et al 2015 weatherill et al 2019 but here we focus only on papers reporting voc flux and or mass discharge in streambeds several such papers are included in the review by weatherill et al 2018 avery 1994 used streambed seepage meters to determine water flux upward into a river but the concentration data needed to compute trichloroethylene tce discharge came from wells roughly 50 100 m from the river rather than groundwater in or below the seepage meters ellis and rivett 2007 estimated tce input to a 7 km river reach based on river discharge and river water tce data but apparently without data to account for tce emission from the river to overlying air this reach mass balance approach can be effective in some cases when groundwater input is large enough relative to stream discharge rønde et al 2017 but in many cases it suffers from large uncertainty due to a relatively small increase in stream or river discharge between the upstream and downstream sampling stations e g jensen et al 2022 a darcian riverbed approach was also used to estimate tce discharge from groundwater to the river ellis and rivett 2007 though it was unclear whether the required k i and c data were all obtained at the same time from the same riverbed sampling points ottosen et al 2020 quantified chlorinated ethene flux through a streambed using sediment bed passive flux meters installed on a transect across a stream they refer to layton et al 2017 for details on the associated flux calculation and flux values are shown in fig s3 of their online supporting information file ottosen et al 2020 also report that the geometric mean of the hydraulic conductivity and the mean gradient were combined using darcy s law corrected for the porosity to obtain the vertical seepage velocity in the streambed though the seepage velocity thus obtained does not seem to have been used to compute flux or mass discharge of the contaminants cremeans et al 2018 quantified mass discharge of chlorinated ethenes from groundwater to a well studied stream reach in denmark by coupling concentration data with three ways of estimating groundwater flux a darcian approach based on k and i a streambed point velocity probe cremeans and devlin 2017 and calculations based on temperature data the darcian approach seems to have blended c k and i data from different places on the streambed and different times i e all three variables not always measured at the same points at the same time if so the approach likely has the potential for error due to the typical large spatial and temporal variability in streambed k and i e g springer et al 1999 cardenas and zlotnik 2003 genereux et al 2008 kennedy et al 2009a 2009b gilmore et al 2016a shrivastava et al 2020 rosenberry et al 2021 here we demonstrate a new darcian approach to quantifying voc discharge from contaminated groundwater to streams to our knowledge this is the first paper in which voc flux mass per streambed area per time and mass discharge mass time are estimated directly from point scale streambed measurements of k i and c all determined simultaneously at the exact same sampling points this approach to darcian estimation of solute flux eliminates potential errors associated with 1 coupling k i and c data from different points and times in heterogeneous streambeds and 2 computing mass discharge as the product of average k i and c values in the study area rather than averaging individual kic values from individual measurement points it also reduces or eliminates some of the potential concerns with the vertical control plane approach such as voc flux beneath a control plane voc degradation or production downgradient of a control plane the need for two planes to observe both sides of a stream and the expense of well or mls installation to define control planes our approach relies in part on a piezomanometer device developed in our lab kennedy et al 2007 that uses a light oil manometer capable of resolving head differences down to about 0 1 mm smaller than the thresholds for reporting head differences in some other darcian efforts e g 7 mm in cremeans et al 2018 the approach taken here with vocs has previously been applied to fluxes of nitrate ammonium dissolved organic nitrogen per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas and age dating tracers from groundwater to streams kennedy et al 2009a 2009b gilmore et al 2016a 2016b pétré et al 2021 2 study area measurements were carried out in the streambed of hominy swamp creek hsc in wilson north carolina nc usa

many places though the study reach in the urban core of wilson is steeply incised the study reach was defined by sampling transects across the channel located 30 m to 78 m downstream south of the goldsboro street south bridge over hsc in wilson nc fig 1 the reach has an average width of 4 55 m and stream depth at baseflow ranged from about 1 to 35 cm and averaged 14 cm based on 51 measurements steep banks in the study reach rise 3 4 m above the streambed on both sides of the channel the streambed is composed of sandy and loamy material with some areas of clayey sediments in the downstream portion of the reach and gravelly areas in the upstream portion there is a vegetative buffer trees and shrubs 2 3 m wide on both the east and west banks the study reach lies roughly in the center of the hsc watershed and is surrounded by low and medium intensity urban land use nearby businesses include a dry cleaner lumber company automotive repair shops and gasoline stations the dry cleaner adjacent to the study reach was in operation throughout the study period and many years prior back to 1946 except for a break in operation during 2007 2011 ranck and macwilliams 2013 2014 2016 in june 2004 tetrachloroethylene pce was identified in groundwater at the dry cleaner ranck and macwilliams 2013 2014 2016 the site was subsequently certified into the ncdeq dry cleaning solvent cleanup act dsca program in august 2005 and assigned dcsa site identification dc980003 past work at the site under the dsca program involved assessment of the pce release through sampling groundwater stream water

spatial patterns of water and voc flux through the hsc streambed were quantified in two sampling campaigns 28 29 june 2015 low flow and 15 16 january 2016 high flow streambed measurement points in the study reach were arranged in seven three point or four point transects across the channel with points roughly evenly spaced within each transect each of the seven transects was named by its distance in meters downstream from the downstream face of the goldsboro street south bridge 30 38 46 54 62 70 and 78 m transect locations were marked with streambank stakes and within each transect the exact distance of each measurement point from the stakes was recorded allowing accurate mapping of flux values on the streambed and assessment of changes between june 2015 and january 2016 the field methods used were developed in our group and have been applied to quantify fluxes of other solutes from groundwater to streams kennedy et al 2009a 2009b gilmore et al 2016a 2016b pétré et al 2021 water and voc flux through the streambed v in m d and f voc in mg m 2 d 1 respectively were quantified at 26 measurement points in june 2015 and 25 points in january 2016 at each streambed measurement point groundwater flux i e specific discharge v was determined from darcy s equation as the product of vertical hydraulic head gradient i and vertical hydraulic conductivity k in the streambed v ki haitjema and anderson 2016 head gradient was measured using a steel and copper piezomanometer equipped with an oil water manometer for accurate measurement of the head difference between stream water and underlying groundwater kennedy et al 2007 2009a piezomanometers were inserted into the streambed such that their 5 cm screens were generally 31 36 cm below the top of the streambed in a few cases refusal was encountered at a slightly shallower depth with the top of the screen positioned 25 to 30 cm deep rather than 31 cm piezomanometers were also used to collect groundwater samples for voc analysis the groundwater sampling line in the piezomanometer was mainly copper tubing with a short section of stainless steel at the bottom the 5 cm long screen and several cm of viton tubing at the top prior to sample collection 300 500 ml of groundwater were purged until stable water quality parameters temp cond ph orp were verified using a ysi model 556 multiprobe with a low volume flow through cell purging was accomplished with the use of 60 ml polyethylene syringes as pumps a syringe was used to draw groundwater up through the copper sampling line of the piezomanometer and then push the groundwater through the flow cell once stable water quality parameters were observed groundwater samples were collected using the same syringe pumping technique taking care to draw groundwater up slowly to minimize the risk of stripping dissolved gases about 100 ml min or less barcelona et al 1989 1994 groundwater samples were collected in amber glass volatile organic analysis voa vials containing 25 mg of ascorbic acid and 200 mg of maleic acid to preserve the sample prakash et al 2009 each vial was filled completely and capped with no head space samples were analyzed within 14 days as required by epa method 524 3 prakash et al 2009 at each streambed sampling point at least 2 groundwater samples were obtained after measurement of vertical head gradient and collection of groundwater samples at a given streambed measurement point a falling head test to determine streambed vertical k was carried out in a field permeameter 7 5 cm diameter that was inserted into the streambed approximately 10 cm from the piezomanometer genereux et al 2008 burnette et al 2016 the permeameter was inserted to the same depth as the top of the piezomanometer screen so that streambed k and i were determined over the same streambed depth interval to summarize the k i and c values at each streambed measurement point were based on a consistent set of measurements on the same body of sediment at the same time with i and c from a piezomanometer and k from an adjacent field permeameter with both devices inserted to the same depth measurements and sampling completed within about 30 min at each point and all points in the full campaign completed during a rainless 36 h period with steady conditions at each sampling point the flux through the streambed was calculated for each individual voc as the product of groundwater specific discharge v ki and the groundwater voc concentration c f voc vc a key innovation and strength of this sampling approach is that there is no spatial or temporal averaging in the individual flux values each individual f voc value is based on three measurements k i and c from the same point at the same time sixteen vocs table 1 commonly found in contaminated groundwater were analyzed according to epa method 524 3 prakash et al 2009 an autosampler aquatek 100 teledyne tekmar mason oh was used to withdraw 5 ml aliquots from the headspace free vials containing water samples and to add internal standards 1 4 difluorobenzene chlorobenzene d 5 1 4 dichlorobenzene d 4 vocs were extracted from samples and concentrated using a purge and trap device lumin teledyne tekmar mason oh and transferred to the gc ms 7890 gc 7010 ms agilent santa clara ca quality control was assured through an initial demonstration of capability continuing calibration checks 0 6 1 0 and 60 0 μg l 1 mean recovery for the 14 detected compounds 102 5 standard deviation 16 2 and sampling in duplicate as outlined by epa method 524 3 three streambed sediment cores were collected in the study reach for measurement of organic carbon content bulk density and porosity cores were obtained by inserting pvc pipes 3 in nominal 7 73 cm inner diameter 31 cm into the streambed and removing the pipes with sediments intact inside core locations were 30 m 54 m and 78 m downstream from the goldsboro street south bridge on the right side left side and center of the channel respectively each core was homogenized oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and weighed to find dry mass for bulk density calculation porosity n was calculated from bulk density ρ b assuming the density of the solids ρ s was 2 65 g cm 3 n 1 ρ b ρ s the fraction of organic carbon f oc was computed as the fraction of mass loss on ignition in a muffle furnace multiplied by an adjustment factor for organic carbon as a fraction of organic matter 0 58 usda 2009 retardation factors were calculated as r 1 k oc f oc ρ b n using k oc values from the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr toxicological profiles atsdr 1996 2000 2006 2007 2008 2012 2015 2019a 2019b 2021a 2021b 2022a 2022b streambed maps of flux and other variables were created using arcgis 10 3 software following procedures in kennedy et al 2009a and gilmore et al 2016a 2016b in arcgis results at each measurement point v i k c and voc flux were assigned as attributes of the spatial location of the point to generate a map for each parameter a raster grid of 25 cm2 was interpolated over the streambed area using radial basis functions interpolation included an anisotropy factor of 8 the approximate ratio of the distance between transects to the distance between sampling points in a given transect mitasova et al 2004 kennedy et al 2009a radial basis functions were chosen over other kriging methods as they provide good results for data sets of various sizes and create smooth surfaces kennedy et al 2007 kennedy et al 2009a arcgis pro 2 8 2021 for each data set mapped on the streambed a spline interpolation approach with tension was used to create raster grids because it gave the most realistic interpolation with fewest artifacts when the tension was chosen to achieve agreement between the mean interpolation residual and the mean measurement error nickels 2016 maps were contoured using jenks natural breaks classification in which classes are defined based on an optimization approach that minimizes the variance within classes while maximizing the deviation from the means of other classes de smith et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydraulic conductivity head gradient groundwater flux considering all 51 streambed measurement points table s1 supplementary material mean vertical hydraulic conductivity k was 18 4 m d 1 mean vertical head gradient i was 0 015 and mean groundwater flux v was 0 30 m d 1 water flux was upward through the streambed from the contaminated aquifer into hominy swamp creek at 47 of the 51 measurement points four points had downward flow from stream to groundwater during low flow conditions in june 2015 mean values of k i and v in january 2016 were 2 1 1 8 and 5 9 times those obtained respectively in june 2015 the january values are similar to those found in other coastal plain streams while the june values are somewhat smaller aucott et al 1987 spruill and bratton 2008 kennedy et al 2009a noorduijn et al 2014 gilmore et al 2016a in most transects higher k values were found near the center of the channel while higher i values were found closer to the sides fig 2 this illustrates an inverse correlation expected in groundwater surface water interaction near a groundwater discharge face the highest gradients develop where k is lowest here as in other cases kennedy et al 2009a gilmore et al 2016a the pattern in v is similar to that of k higher v was typically found closer to the center of the stream the 38 m transect was an exception with high k i and v near the streambank in june 2015 in each sampling campaign the majority of groundwater discharge occurred in a small portion of the streambed area guilbeault et al 2005 reached a similar conclusion for chemical flux through vertical control planes in aquifers in june 2015 23 of the measurement points 6 of 26 accounted for 91 of the total groundwater input to the stream reach in january 2016 24 of the points 6 of 25 accounted for 76 of the total groundwater input 4 2 groundwater hydrogeochemical conditions groundwater at the streambed sampling points had average orp less than zero and dissolved oxygen do 0 5 mg l 1 indicating anoxic conditions table 2 the highest do measured during the study was 1 0 mg l 1 found at one sampling point in january 2016 these results indicate anoxic reducing conditions necessary for reductive dechlorination de bruin et al 1992 do values were lower than those in nearby nc counties and ph was similar table 2 specific conductance was relatively high compared to values in nearby nc counties something not unexpected given the urban nature of the study site and potential for industrial and commercial effluents to the water systems 4 3 voc concentrations among the 14 vocs detected in groundwater discharging to hominy swamp creek table 1 concentrations ranged from below the limit of detection to 600 μg l 1 with many exceedances of state groundwater standards table s2 the highest concentrations were for benzene a chemical not associated with the dry cleaner adjacent to the stream voc results are generally consistent with the discharge of two groundwater plumes through the streambed fig 3 one from the west side of the stream plume 1 and the other from the east plume 2 plume 1 was anticipated based on prior results from nearby monitoring wells ranck and macwilliams 2013 2014 and is characterized by pce tce cdce trans 1 2 dichloroethene tdce 1 1 dichloroethene dce and vc the dry cleaner immediately west of the stream is thought to be an important source for plume 1 ranck and macwilliams 2013 2014 plume 2 previously unknown contained benzene bz 1 1 2 2 tetrachloroethane teca 1 1 dichloroethane 1 1 dca 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dca 1 2 3 trichloropropane tcp and dichloromethane dcm the source of plume 2 is not precisely known plume 2 occurs on the east side of the study reach suggesting it has one or more sources among the commercial or industrial properties east of the creek for example historical resources indicate a lumber mill and underground fuel tanks on the east side of the study reach since 1922 and a gasoline service station adjacent to hominy swamp creek since 1959 sanborn map company 1922 hill directory company 1959 while further investigation would be needed to identify the source s of plume 2 the discovery of plume 2 illustrates the usefulness of streambed groundwater sampling as a flexible low cost investigative tool for identifying locations and rates section 4 4 below of groundwater contaminant discharge to streams plume 2 would have been missed if the investigation had been based on only a vertical control plane on the west side of the stream near the dry cleaner or on measurement of only chloroethenes rather than a broader range of vocs plume 2 was dominated by bz which had overall mean concentrations of 57 and 55 μg l 1 in june 2015 and january 2016 respectively plume 1 was dominated by cdce and vc degradation products of the likely source contaminant pce mean cdce and vc in june 2015 27 and 13 μg l 1 respectively were greater than mean pce 0 087 μg l 1 by factors of 310 and 149 respectively suggesting extensive subsurface degradation of pce in january 2016 mean cdce and vc 11 and 8 2 μg l 1 respectively were only 79 and 59 times greater respectively than mean pce 0 14 μg l 1 higher streambed temperature may be at least partly responsible for the concentration ratios cdce pce and vc pce being higher in june compared to january biodegradation of chlorinated solvents is most rapid at temperatures around 30 c and slower at warmer and colder temperatures friis et al 2007 ramsburg et al 2010 warmer groundwater temperature in june table 2 likely favored faster pce degradation compared to january in both june 2015 and january 2016 the highest pce concentration occurred in the southwest corner of the study reach while the highest concentrations of other chloroethenes occurred farther upstream fig 3 groundwater at all sampling points was anoxic table 2 but the sampling point in the southwest corner of the reach indicates that some pce reaches the stream despite the anoxic conditions possibly along a flowpath in which pce degradation is less extensive than in other flowpaths reaching the streambed compared to a sampling program that relies on wells the streambed sampling used here is better suited for assessing this sort of spotty spatially variable contaminant discharge through different groundwater flowpaths to a stream some observations for bt pce and vc did not fit neatly into a simple 2 plume framework e g the maps labeled other in fig 3 dcp provides another example in june 2015 the streambed area of highest dcp concentration was somewhat separate from both the plume 1 and plume 2 areas but in january 2016 highest dcp coincided with the plume 2 area on the east side of the channel fig 3 also in both june 2015 and january 2016 the highest bt concentration was found at a sampling point with no other significant voc concentrations fig 3 perhaps indicating a unique bt source somewhere in the study area a survey of vocs in us aquifers based on several thousand samples detected bt in only one sample of groundwater zogorski et al 2006 indicating the presence of bt at hominy swamp creek was unusual overall a 2 plume framework is suggested by the spatial clustering of most voc concentration data but does not fully account for all variation the 2 plume framework may oversimplify conditions in an urban environment with numerous potential voc sources and industrial activity dating back to the 19th century lewis 2007 even so this framework based on groundwater sampling beneath the channel points to a spatial separation in voc source locations chloroethenes west of the stream benzene and other vocs east of the stream that could be useful in identifying source locations stream water voc data may indicate whether sources exist upstream in a watershed but cannot indicate whether the source is on one side of the watershed or the other 4 4 voc fluxes spatial patterns of advective voc flux through the streambed f voc table s3 were closely related to the spatial pattern of groundwater flux v through the streambed with some exceptions due to variation in the concentration patterns for example in june 2015 v was highest 1 near the northwest corner of the study reach west side of the 38 m transect and 2 in a band of slightly elevated v running through the center of the channel and spanning the middle three transects 46 54 and 62 m fig 2 these areas of high v coincide with most of the areas of high f voc for 12 of 14 vocs fig 4 seven vocs had their highest fluxes near the northwest corner of the reach and five vocs had their highest fluxes in the area of elevated v in the center of the channel elevated voc concentration rather than v was responsible for two other areas of high f voc high vc flux in the 70 m transect and high pce flux in the southwest corner of the reach in the 78 m transect fig 4 in january 2016 a band of elevated v that increased southward occurred in the center of the channel from the 38 m transect to the 70 m transect fig 2 with the exception of high pce flux in the southwest corner of the reach all areas of high f voc in january coincided with this band of high v fig 4 thus high groundwater flux drove almost all the occurrences of high voc flux with the exception of two vocs in june 2015 generally temporal changes in f voc for plume 1 followed the same changes seen in v with the area of highest f voc shifting about 24 m south from june to january plume 2 vocs generally had high f voc at the 46 m transect in both june and january though most also showed a second area of high discharge farther south in january on the 62 m or 70 m transect fig 4 for each voc in each of the two sampling campaigns the flow weighted mean fwm voc concentration in the groundwater discharge was calculated as σ v j c j σv j where j refers to the measurement point for each voc the summation was over all the measurement points in a given campaign 26 points in june 2015 or 25 in january 2016 the fwm was generally higher than the unweighted mean uwm fig 5 with only 5 exceptions out of 28 cases 14 vocs 2 campaigns consistent with higher voc concentrations at points of higher water flux as noted earlier conant jr et al 2004 found the opposite that voc concentrations were higher where water flux was lower fwm was higher than uwm for bz cdce and vc the dominant vocs at the site illustrating the importance of collecting groundwater flux and concentration data at the same points in studies of voc flux from groundwater to surface water the fwm is a more accurate indication of the average concentration in the net groundwater discharge to the stream because each measured concentration contributes to the fwm in proportion to the groundwater flux at the measurement point the same weighting applicable to each groundwater flowpath to the stream in nature 4 5 voc mass discharge from groundwater to stream assuming the dry conditions in june 2015 and wet conditions in january 2016 roughly bracket the annual range of baseflow an approximate estimate of annual integrated voc mass discharge from groundwater to the study reach was obtained by multiplying the streambed area of the reach by the overall mean flux of each voc the mean of all sampling points in june 2015 and january 2016 and then summing over all 14 vocs detected the estimated overall mass discharge of vocs from groundwater to the stream reach was 3 6 kg yr 1 table 3 the three largest individual contributors were bz 2 1 kg yr 1 cdce 0 83 kg yr 1 and vc 0 40 kg yr 1 the smallest was pce 0 00067 kg yr 1 in the calculations above voc mass discharge was based on mean f voc values determined as the averages of the 25 or 26 individual point f voc values in each sampling campaign june 2015 and january 2016 an alternative that has been used in other studies would be to compute the mean f voc value for each voc in a given sampling campaign as the product of the mean groundwater flux and mean voc concentration for that sampling campaign in other words to compute the product of average k i and c values rather than the average of individual point scale kic products for the data presented here the product of averages approach yielded mean fluxes and mass discharges that ranged from 57 smaller to 648 larger than the average of products approach with an average absolute difference of about 68 across all 14 vocs and 2 sampling campaigns table s4 variations of the product of averages approach have been widely used in the literature but averaging individual point scale f voc values is a more accurate approach that accounts implicitly for potential covariance among k i and c the data collection presented here allowed the more accurate approach because at each measurement point all three variables were determined at the same time within about 30 min and same place within about 10 cm so the calculation of voc flux at a given point on the streambed is not influenced by k i or c values from other points 4 6 influence of streambed voc degradation voc flux and mass discharge values were based on groundwater samples generally collected 31 36 cm deep in the streambed and actual voc flux and discharge could be lower than calculated if there were significant voc degradation in the upper 31 cm of the streambed to investigate the potential significance of this an estimate of the maximum amount of biodegradation in the upper 31 cm of streambed was made using the maximum first order rate constant for anaerobic degradation of each voc k d table s5 for each voc at each streambed sampling point we computed both the maximum and minimum values of f voc vc and vcexp k d t respectively where t ln v is the advective travel time through the upper 31 cm of streambed l 31 cm v the groundwater flux specific discharge at the sampling point and n the mean porosity determined from the three streambed cores 0 41 table s6 for each of the three vocs with the highest mean fluxes bz cdce and vc the mean of the minimum flux values for a given voc in a given campaign june or january ranged from 0 1 to 8 9 less than the mean of the maximum flux values table s3 thus it seems highly unlikely that biodegradation in the streambed sediments above the groundwater sampling depth could have had a large effect on the estimates of mean flux for the primary vocs discharging to hominy swamp creek the largest potential relative impact of degradation was for pce with a 44 difference between mean minimum and mean maximum f voc values but this has a negligible effect on the overall estimate of voc mass discharge from the groundwater system because pce is the smallest contributor to that discharge table 3 also while degradation of pce in the upper part of the streambed could in theory cause the actual fluxes of pce degradation products to be larger than we calculated pce concentrations were generally too small to have this effect much smaller than the cdce and vc concentrations the time available for degradation above the sampling depth is the advective travel time through the top 31 cm of the streambed and a long travel time is necessarily associated with both low voc flux low f voc and high potential for degradation this relationship represents a beneficial feedback for estimating voc mass discharge with the approach used here the estimation of integrated voc mass discharge from groundwater to stream is not sensitive to degradation because greater degradation will generally occur at streambed locations of lower flux assuming the extent of degradation depends on the travel time through the streambed as in a first order rate law applying the maximum degradation correction to all 14 vocs reduces the estimate of integrated voc mass discharge from groundwater to the study stream from 3 6 kg yr 1 table 3 to 3 5 kg yr 1 that reduction does not account for production of vocs by the degradation of other vocs e g vc production from dce such production might eliminate the near negligible degradation effect noted here 4 7 influence of streambed voc retardation computed voc fluxes from groundwater to stream could differ from actual fluxes across the top of the streambed if the groundwater voc concentrations at the top of the streambed differed from the concentrations at the sampling depth of about 31 cm which could potentially occur from voc sorption and retardation in the upper part of the streambed for example if the vocs in question were just beginning to arrive at the streambed and break through to the stream at the time of sampling the voc concentrations at the top of the streambed might be lower than those at the sampling depth but this seems unlikely considering the widely different time scales for 1 transport through the upper 31 cm of streambed and 2 the overall industrial commercial history of the study site in the three streambed sediment cores the mean fraction of organic carbon was 0 57 mean porosity was 0 41 and mean bulk density was 1 57 g cm 3 table s6 these streambed properties and literature values of k oc gave retardation factors r ranging from 1 5 for dcm to 11 for tce the r values together with measured values of v and porosity imply mean voc travel times through the top 31 cm of streambed of 51 to 364 days table s5 the only travel time over 300 days was for pce a negligible contributor to total voc discharge table 3 mean travel times for the three most abundant vocs were 90 days for bz 79 days for cdce and 103 days for vc these time scales are short compared to the history of contamination at the site industrial development of the city of wilson nc dates to the 19th century with larger industries focusing on tobacco processing fertilizer production lumber and eventually vehicle manufacture lewis 2007 the dry cleaner adjacent to the stream the likely source of vocs in plume 1 had been in almost continuous operation since 1946 previous work related to dry cleaner contamination showed evidence of these chemicals in near stream groundwater since 2004 ranck and macwilliams 2013 2014 all plume 1 contaminants except 1 1 dce were detected in stream water samples from june 2015 and january 2016 indicating breakthrough to the stream nickels 2016 for the newly recognized plume 2 the history of contamination is less clear but bz and 1 2 dca were detected in all stream water samples from june 2015 and january 2016 table s6 given the observed breakthrough to the stream and the long 150 yr industrial history of the study site it seems unlikely that the plume 2 vocs were just coincidentally breaking through to the stream during our first sampling campaign in june 2015 even if they were the upper 31 cm of streambed would have been in or near steady state about 200 days later during the january 2016 sampling overall it seems unlikely that transient voc behavior related to retardation in the upper 31 cm of streambed could have caused the actual voc fluxes across the top of the streambed to differ significantly from the fluxes estimated and reported 5 discussion streambed point measurements for voc flux and mass discharge recent publications demonstrate novel approaches to quantifying voc fluxes through streambeds from contaminated groundwater to streams the streambed point velocity probe quantifies average linear velocity of groundwater in a streambed based on a small injection of salty water followed by collection and analysis of specific conductance breakthrough curves at a small point scale cremeans and devlin 2017 cremeans et al 2018 quantifying voc flux and mass discharge into the stream would require streambed porosity data and voc data potential errors may arise if voc data are not collected concurrently and co located with measurements of average linear velocity and porosity the streambed passive flux meter collects vocs onto a sorbent such as granular activated carbon gac using the natural ambient head gradient in the streambed to drive contaminated water through the meter layton et al 2017 ottosen et al 2020 quantifying voc flux and mass discharge into the stream requires knowledge of vertical and horizontal k in the streambed and vertical k of the sorbent in the meter and deploying and later retrieving the meter and carrying out chemical analysis on segments of sorbent in the meter for contaminants of interest and pre sorbed tracers added to the sorbent to allow estimation of water flux the automated tube seepage meter solomon et al 2020 has not yet been applied to the problem of voc transport into streams but is one of most promising new technologies for quantifying water flux specific discharge through streambeds it quantifies specific discharge from precise measurements of the rate of rise of the water level inside a tube installed in the streambed these and other new approaches present promising options that merit continued development and use still darcian methods continue to be widely used due to their simplicity and accessibility here we demonstrated a new darcian approach to quantifying voc flux f voc from contaminated groundwater to streams relying on point scale streambed measurements of k i and c all determined simultaneously at the same sampling points this approach eliminates potential errors associated with 1 coupling k i and c data from different points and times in heterogeneous streambeds and 2 computing mass discharge as the product of average k i and c values in the study area rather than with individual kic values from individual measurement points the approach was made possible with a piezomanometer device used to collect groundwater samples through a short screen and to make accurate measurements of vertical i in streambeds kennedy et al 2007 2009a point values of k i and c are not expected to necessarily be independent in porous media covariance not equal to zero and using individual kic values from individual measurement points is expected to be a more accurate darcian approach to quantifying voc mass discharge through streambeds from groundwater to streams for the data presented here the product of averages approach computing mean voc flux as the product of reach average k i and c values yielded mean voc fluxes and mass discharges that ranged from 57 smaller to 648 larger than the average of products approach computing mean voc flux as the average of the kic values at the individual sampling points with the average absolute value of the difference equal to 68 across all 14 vocs and 2 sampling campaigns 6 summary and conclusions groundwater flux v into the urban study reach of hominy swamp creek was heterogeneous with one quarter of the streambed measurement points accounting for at least 75 of the total groundwater discharge generally v was higher toward the center of the channel and the location of highest v shifted downstream from june to january the magnitude of mean v increased by a factor of 5 9 from june 2015 to january 2016 influencing the distribution and magnitude of voc fluxes significantly fourteen vocs table 1 were quantified in at least 2 plumes plume 1 from the west side of the stream was dominated by pce degradation products mostly cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce and vinyl chloride vc plume 2 from the east side of the stream and was dominated by benzene bz the majority of voc results seem to fit reasonably within this two plume framework though it may oversimplify contaminant sources to this urban stream discovery of plume 2 illustrates the usefulness of streambed sampling as a flexible low cost investigative tool for identifying locations and rates of contaminant plume discharge to streams voc concentrations ranged from below laboratory detection limits to 600 μg l 1 vc bz and tcp were the vocs that most significantly exceeded applicable state groundwater quality standards by factors of 367 56 and 11 respectively based on their mean concentrations values of voc flux from groundwater to the stream f voc were higher in january 2016 than in june 2015 for 13 of the 14 vocs all except cdce largely because groundwater flux was higher on average in january bz had the highest f voc with mean values of 11 and 37 mg m 2 d 1 in june 2015 and january 2016 respectively cdce and vc had mean values of 9 8 and 1 9 mg m 2 d 1 respectively in june 2015 and 9 5 and 7 0 mg m 2 d 1 in january 2016 high groundwater flux drove almost all the occurrences of high voc flux for bz cdce and vc the dominant vocs at the site the flow weighted mean concentration was 20 223 higher than the unweighted mean fig 5 for cdce in june 2015 the flow weighted mean was above the relevant state groundwater quality standard 70 μg l 1 whereas the unweighted mean was well below the standard collecting groundwater flux data at the same points as voc concentrations allowed flow weighting of the concentrations which gave a more accurate indication of the average voc concentration in the integrated groundwater discharge to the stream given that v was generally larger in the center of the channel than on the sides and that discharging groundwater is generally older in the centers of stream channels than on the sides modica et al 1998 kennedy et al 2009b gilmore et al 2016b the finding that flow weighted mean concentration is generally greater than the unweighted mean would be consistent with greater contaminant concentrations in older groundwater at the site which would in turn imply improving conditions at the site less contamination in younger groundwater testing this hypothesis would require additional data for example vertical profiles of voc concentrations in groundwater groundwater age dating tracers or other data an estimate of integrated voc mass discharge from groundwater to the study reach of hominy swamp creek 3 6 kg of voc per year was generated by integrating average voc flux over the streambed area of the reach for each voc the bulk of this total voc discharge was due to bz cdce and vc with their individual mass discharges of 2 1 0 83 and 0 40 kg yr 1 respectively this represents an off site transport of groundwater vocs downstream toward the neuse river with potential exposures and impacts on watershed residents through dermal contact consumption of fish or inhalation of voc volatilized from the surface water analysis suggests voc degradation in the upper streambed was not significant for the major vocs or for the integrated estimate of total voc mass discharge from contaminated groundwater to the study reach as noted in section 4 6 estimates of voc mass discharge from the streambed point sampling approach used are inherently insensitive to voc degradation in the upper streambed because greater degradation above the groundwater sampling depth will generally occur at the points of lower flux this is another benefit of the approach used also in watersheds with decades long histories of voc transport through groundwater to streams the timescale for voc transport through the upper streambed is vastly shorter than the timescale of the contamination history it therefore seems unlikely that retardation in the streambed above the depth of sample collection would cause widespread or significant overestimation of voc flux with the method used declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

1223,quantifying voc transport from contaminated groundwater to streams is challenging and important for understanding off site migration of vocs cross media contamination groundwater to surface water and eventually air and potential impacts on downstream ecosystems and human populations a streambed point sampling approach was used to quantify fluxes of water and 14 vocs from groundwater to an urban stream in north carolina usa during summer june 2015 and winter january 2016 the approach is unique in coupling measurements of vertical hydraulic conductivity vertical hydraulic head gradient and groundwater voc concentration at each individual sampling point reducing or eliminating some potential concerns with other darcian methods for quantifying voc inputs to streams most results were consistent with discharge of two main voc plumes on opposite sides of the stream plume 1 from the west side was dominated by cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce and vinyl chloride vc at mean concentrations of 19 and 11 μg l 1 respectively plume 2 from the east side was dominated by benzene mean concentration 56 μg l 1 plume 2 was not previously known and the improved sampling approach allowed voc discharge from both plumes to be quantified simultaneously for 13 of the 14 detected vocs the mean voc flux from groundwater to the stream f voc was higher in january 2016 than in june 2015 mainly because groundwater flux was higher in january the only exception was cdce the most abundant voc in plume 1 which had mean f voc values of 9 8 and 9 5 mg m 2 d 1 in june 2015 and january 2016 respectively benzene was the most abundant voc in plume 2 and had mean f voc values of 11 and 37 mg m 2 d 1 in june 2015 and january 2016 respectively high groundwater flux drove almost all the occurrences of high voc flux for a given voc the flow weighted mean concentration with each voc concentration weighted by the upward groundwater flux at the voc sampling point was generally larger than the unweighted mean concentration thus flow weighting of concentrations gave a more accurate indication of the average voc concentration in net groundwater discharge to the stream an estimate of total voc mass discharge from groundwater to the study reach of the stream 3 6 kg of voc per year was based on the f voc results and streambed area in the reach the bulk of this discharge was due to benzene cdce and vc with individual mass discharges of 2 1 0 83 and 0 40 kg yr 1 respectively estimates of maximum potential voc degradation in the streambed suggest that the 3 6 kg yr 1 estimate of mass discharge was not sensitive to potential degradation of vocs in the streambed sediments above the groundwater sampling depth keywords voc contaminant flux groundwater stream data availability the data used are given in online supplementary material associated with the paper 1 introduction volatile organic compounds vocs are common groundwater contaminants in a survey of voc contamination by the u s geological survey vocs were found in 19 of the groundwater samples from 3498 u s wells when a screening level of 0 2 μg l 1 was applied in a subset of 1687 wells with a lower screening level of 0 02 μg l 1 the percentage of contaminated samples jumped to 51 zogorski et al 2006 quantifying voc flux mass per area per time and mass discharge mass per time is challenging and important for understanding voc transport in the environment this is especially true at the interface between groundwater and surface water where voc mass transfer from contaminated groundwater to streams and rivers can result in off site migration of vocs cross media contamination groundwater to surface water and eventually air and potential impacts on downstream ecosystems and human populations quantifying voc mass flux and discharge from groundwater to surface water generally requires field data on both voc concentration and groundwater flow rate at least in the majority of cases in which advective transport is much greater than molecular diffusive transport one approach has been to estimate voc flux through a vertical plane in an aquifer e g einarson and mackay 2001 basu et al 2006 kübert and finkel 2006 béland pelletier et al 2011 the approach has generally relied on a control plane oriented normal to groundwater flow and defined by a number of multi level samplers mls or well clusters at which contaminant concentrations in groundwater are determined water flux through the plane is generally based on darcy s equation often using a single value of average hydraulic conductivity k and or head gradient i for the entire plane e g guilbeault et al 2005 in some cases the control plane has been positioned parallel to and several meters m from a stream for the purpose of quantifying voc discharge into the stream conant jr et al 2004 rønde et al 2017 in a different approach chapman et al 2007 used two control planes normal to a stream to quantify voc discharge from groundwater to the stream in general potential complications with the control plane approach could include voc flux beneath or around the plane and the significant expense of well cluster or mls installation when the vertical control plane approach is used to estimate voc discharge from groundwater to a stream quantifying the entire discharge would generally require a control plane on each side of the stream unless site information demonstrates no contaminant discharge from one side of the watershed such information may often be lacking especially in urban environments with a complex history of commercial and industrial activity also voc degradation or production between the control plane and the stream channel may cause the flux and discharge of some contaminants into the stream to differ from what is estimated at the control plane for example conant jr et al 2004 concluded that most voc degradation at their site occurred within about 2 5 m of the channel in some cases useful information on in situ degradation at the field scale was derived from the difference in voc mass discharge between two parallel control planes e g barbaro and neupane 2006 basu et al 2006 but degradation between a control plane and a parallel stream channel would cause underestimation of voc discharge to the stream in the control plane approach one concern not fully explored is the averaging generally used especially for k and or i strictly speaking one would want to know k and i for each point at which contaminant concentration c is known and know the partial area of the control plane relevant to each measurement point a and sum the individual ckia values from each area of the control plane to compute total contaminant discharge through the plane because the sum of individual ckia values may differ from the product of the total plane area and the plane average c k and i values that difference is one definition of covariance while the covariance of independent variables is zero it s not obvious that c k and i would generally qualify as independent variables in a plane through contaminated groundwater for example i tends to be high where k is low e g kübert and finkel 2006 conant jr et al 2004 found that voc concentrations were highest where water flux was low and kennedy et al 2009a also found that i was high where k was low while these two studies were in streambeds and not a vertical control plane they provide examples of lack of independence of point scale concentration and groundwater flux variables for a hypothetical contaminant plume in a numerical groundwater model kübert and finkel 2006 investigated the potential uncertainty associated with use of average values in the control plane approach but to our knowledge this issue has not yet been evaluated with field data as an example using data in table 2 of kennedy et al 2009a we calculate that the mean nitrate flux from groundwater to their study stream would be erroneously high by a factor of 1 4 to 2 4 if computed as the product of mean k i and c values in the streambed rather than as the mean of the individual kic products at the individual measurement points some studies have utilized measurements within a stream channel rather than vertical control planes in nearby groundwater a number of studies have looked at voc transformations in streambeds focusing mainly on chlorinated ethenes e g abe et al 2009 freitas et al 2015 weatherill et al 2019 but here we focus only on papers reporting voc flux and or mass discharge in streambeds several such papers are included in the review by weatherill et al 2018 avery 1994 used streambed seepage meters to determine water flux upward into a river but the concentration data needed to compute trichloroethylene tce discharge came from wells roughly 50 100 m from the river rather than groundwater in or below the seepage meters ellis and rivett 2007 estimated tce input to a 7 km river reach based on river discharge and river water tce data but apparently without data to account for tce emission from the river to overlying air this reach mass balance approach can be effective in some cases when groundwater input is large enough relative to stream discharge rønde et al 2017 but in many cases it suffers from large uncertainty due to a relatively small increase in stream or river discharge between the upstream and downstream sampling stations e g jensen et al 2022 a darcian riverbed approach was also used to estimate tce discharge from groundwater to the river ellis and rivett 2007 though it was unclear whether the required k i and c data were all obtained at the same time from the same riverbed sampling points ottosen et al 2020 quantified chlorinated ethene flux through a streambed using sediment bed passive flux meters installed on a transect across a stream they refer to layton et al 2017 for details on the associated flux calculation and flux values are shown in fig s3 of their online supporting information file ottosen et al 2020 also report that the geometric mean of the hydraulic conductivity and the mean gradient were combined using darcy s law corrected for the porosity to obtain the vertical seepage velocity in the streambed though the seepage velocity thus obtained does not seem to have been used to compute flux or mass discharge of the contaminants cremeans et al 2018 quantified mass discharge of chlorinated ethenes from groundwater to a well studied stream reach in denmark by coupling concentration data with three ways of estimating groundwater flux a darcian approach based on k and i a streambed point velocity probe cremeans and devlin 2017 and calculations based on temperature data the darcian approach seems to have blended c k and i data from different places on the streambed and different times i e all three variables not always measured at the same points at the same time if so the approach likely has the potential for error due to the typical large spatial and temporal variability in streambed k and i e g springer et al 1999 cardenas and zlotnik 2003 genereux et al 2008 kennedy et al 2009a 2009b gilmore et al 2016a shrivastava et al 2020 rosenberry et al 2021 here we demonstrate a new darcian approach to quantifying voc discharge from contaminated groundwater to streams to our knowledge this is the first paper in which voc flux mass per streambed area per time and mass discharge mass time are estimated directly from point scale streambed measurements of k i and c all determined simultaneously at the exact same sampling points this approach to darcian estimation of solute flux eliminates potential errors associated with 1 coupling k i and c data from different points and times in heterogeneous streambeds and 2 computing mass discharge as the product of average k i and c values in the study area rather than averaging individual kic values from individual measurement points it also reduces or eliminates some of the potential concerns with the vertical control plane approach such as voc flux beneath a control plane voc degradation or production downgradient of a control plane the need for two planes to observe both sides of a stream and the expense of well or mls installation to define control planes our approach relies in part on a piezomanometer device developed in our lab kennedy et al 2007 that uses a light oil manometer capable of resolving head differences down to about 0 1 mm smaller than the thresholds for reporting head differences in some other darcian efforts e g 7 mm in cremeans et al 2018 the approach taken here with vocs has previously been applied to fluxes of nitrate ammonium dissolved organic nitrogen per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas and age dating tracers from groundwater to streams kennedy et al 2009a 2009b gilmore et al 2016a 2016b pétré et al 2021 2 study area measurements were carried out in the streambed of hominy swamp creek hsc in wilson north carolina nc usa

spatial patterns of water and voc flux through the hsc streambed were quantified in two sampling campaigns 28 29 june 2015 low flow and 15 16 january 2016 high flow streambed measurement points in the study reach were arranged in seven three point or four point transects across the channel with points roughly evenly spaced within each transect each of the seven transects was named by its distance in meters downstream from the downstream face of the goldsboro street south bridge 30 38 46 54 62 70 and 78 m transect locations were marked with streambank stakes and within each transect the exact distance of each measurement point from the stakes was recorded allowing accurate mapping of flux values on the streambed and assessment of changes between june 2015 and january 2016 the field methods used were developed in our group and have been applied to quantify fluxes of other solutes from groundwater to streams kennedy et al 2009a 2009b gilmore et al 2016a 2016b pétré et al 2021 water and voc flux through the streambed v in m d and f voc in mg m 2 d 1 respectively were quantified at 26 measurement points in june 2015 and 25 points in january 2016 at each streambed measurement point groundwater flux i e specific discharge v was determined from darcy s equation as the product of vertical hydraulic head gradient i and vertical hydraulic conductivity k in the streambed v ki haitjema and anderson 2016 head gradient was measured using a steel and copper piezomanometer equipped with an oil water manometer for accurate measurement of the head difference between stream water and underlying groundwater kennedy et al 2007 2009a piezomanometers were inserted into the streambed such that their 5 cm screens were generally 31 36 cm below the top of the streambed in a few cases refusal was encountered at a slightly shallower depth with the top of the screen positioned 25 to 30 cm deep rather than 31 cm piezomanometers were also used to collect groundwater samples for voc analysis the groundwater sampling line in the piezomanometer was mainly copper tubing with a short section of stainless steel at the bottom the 5 cm long screen and several cm of viton tubing at the top prior to sample collection 300 500 ml of groundwater were purged until stable water quality parameters temp cond ph orp were verified using a ysi model 556 multiprobe with a low volume flow through cell purging was accomplished with the use of 60 ml polyethylene syringes as pumps a syringe was used to draw groundwater up through the copper sampling line of the piezomanometer and then push the groundwater through the flow cell once stable water quality parameters were observed groundwater samples were collected using the same syringe pumping technique taking care to draw groundwater up slowly to minimize the risk of stripping dissolved gases about 100 ml min or less barcelona et al 1989 1994 groundwater samples were collected in amber glass volatile organic analysis voa vials containing 25 mg of ascorbic acid and 200 mg of maleic acid to preserve the sample prakash et al 2009 each vial was filled completely and capped with no head space samples were analyzed within 14 days as required by epa method 524 3 prakash et al 2009 at each streambed sampling point at least 2 groundwater samples were obtained after measurement of vertical head gradient and collection of groundwater samples at a given streambed measurement point a falling head test to determine streambed vertical k was carried out in a field permeameter 7 5 cm diameter that was inserted into the streambed approximately 10 cm from the piezomanometer genereux et al 2008 burnette et al 2016 the permeameter was inserted to the same depth as the top of the piezomanometer screen so that streambed k and i were determined over the same streambed depth interval to summarize the k i and c values at each streambed measurement point were based on a consistent set of measurements on the same body of sediment at the same time with i and c from a piezomanometer and k from an adjacent field permeameter with both devices inserted to the same depth measurements and sampling completed within about 30 min at each point and all points in the full campaign completed during a rainless 36 h period with steady conditions at each sampling point the flux through the streambed was calculated for each individual voc as the product of groundwater specific discharge v ki and the groundwater voc concentration c f voc vc a key innovation and strength of this sampling approach is that there is no spatial or temporal averaging in the individual flux values each individual f voc value is based on three measurements k i and c from the same point at the same time sixteen vocs

three streambed sediment cores were collected in the study reach for measurement of organic carbon content bulk density and porosity cores were obtained by inserting pvc pipes 3 in nominal 7 73 cm inner diameter 31 cm into the streambed and removing the pipes with sediments intact inside core locations were 30 m 54 m and 78 m downstream from the goldsboro street south bridge on the right side left side and center of the channel respectively each core was homogenized oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and weighed to find dry mass for bulk density calculation porosity n was calculated from bulk density ρ b assuming the density of the solids ρ s was 2 65 g cm 3 n 1 ρ b ρ s the fraction of organic carbon f oc was computed as the fraction of mass loss on ignition in a muffle furnace multiplied

substances and disease registry atsdr toxicological profiles atsdr 1996 2000 2006 2007 2008 2012 2015 2019a 2019b 2021a 2021b 2022a 2022b streambed maps of flux and other variables were created using arcgis 10 3 software following procedures in kennedy et al 2009a and gilmore et al 2016a 2016b in arcgis results at each measurement point v i k c and voc flux were assigned as attributes of the spatial location of the point to generate a map for each parameter a raster grid of 25 cm2 was interpolated over the streambed area using radial basis functions interpolation included an anisotropy factor of 8 the approximate ratio of the distance between transects to the distance between sampling points in a given transect mitasova et al 2004 kennedy et al 2009a radial basis functions were chosen over other kriging methods as they provide good results for data sets of various sizes and create smooth surfaces kennedy et al 2007 kennedy et al 2009a arcgis pro 2 8 2021 for each data set mapped on the streambed a spline interpolation approach with tension was used to create raster grids because it gave the most realistic interpolation with fewest artifacts when the tension was chosen to achieve agreement between the mean interpolation residual and the mean measurement error nickels 2016 maps were contoured using jenks natural breaks classification in which classes are defined based on an optimization approach that minimizes the variance within classes while maximizing the deviation from the means of other classes de smith et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydraulic conductivity head gradient groundwater flux considering all 51 streambed measurement points table s1 supplementary material mean vertical hydraulic conductivity k was 18 4 m d 1 mean vertical head gradient i was 0 015 and mean groundwater flux v was 0 30 m d 1 water flux was upward through the streambed from the contaminated aquifer into hominy swamp creek at 47 of the 51 measurement points four points had downward flow from stream to groundwater during low flow conditions in june 2015 mean values of k i and v in january 2016 were 2 1 1 8 and 5 9 times those obtained respectively in june 2015 the january values are similar to those found in other coastal plain streams while the june values are somewhat smaller aucott et al 1987 spruill and bratton 2008 kennedy et al 2009a noorduijn et al 2014 gilmore et al 2016a in most transects higher k values were found near the center of the channel while higher i values were found closer to the sides fig 2 this illustrates an inverse correlation expected in groundwater surface water interaction near a groundwater discharge face the highest gradients develop where k is lowest here as in other cases kennedy et al 2009a gilmore et al 2016a the pattern in v is similar to that of k higher v was typically found closer to the center of the stream the 38 m transect was an exception with high k i and v near the streambank in june 2015 in each sampling campaign the majority of groundwater discharge occurred in a small portion of the streambed area guilbeault et al 2005 reached a similar conclusion for chemical flux through vertical control planes in aquifers in june 2015 23 of the measurement points 6 of 26 accounted for 91 of the total groundwater input to the stream reach in january 2016 24 of the points 6 of 25 accounted for 76 of the total groundwater input 4 2 groundwater hydrogeochemical conditions groundwater at the streambed sampling points had average orp less than zero and dissolved oxygen do 0 5 mg l 1 indicating anoxic conditions table 2 the highest do measured during the study was 1 0 mg l 1 found at one sampling point in january 2016 these results indicate anoxic reducing conditions necessary for reductive dechlorination de bruin et al 1992 do values were lower than those in nearby nc counties and ph was similar table 2 specific conductance was relatively high compared to values in nearby nc counties something not unexpected given the urban nature of the study site and potential for industrial and commercial effluents to the water systems 4 3 voc concentrations among the 14 vocs detected in groundwater discharging to hominy swamp creek table 1 concentrations ranged from below the limit of detection to 600 μg l 1 with many exceedances of state groundwater standards table s2 the highest concentrations were for benzene a chemical not associated with the dry cleaner adjacent to the stream voc results are generally consistent with the discharge of two groundwater plumes through the streambed fig 3 one from the west side of the stream plume 1 and the other from the east plume 2 plume 1 was anticipated based on prior results from nearby monitoring wells ranck and macwilliams 2013 2014 and is characterized by pce tce cdce trans 1 2 dichloroethene tdce 1 1 dichloroethene dce and vc the dry cleaner immediately west of the stream is thought to be an important source for plume 1 ranck and macwilliams 2013 2014 plume 2 previously unknown contained benzene bz 1 1 2 2 tetrachloroethane teca 1 1 dichloroethane 1 1 dca 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dca 1 2 3 trichloropropane tcp and dichloromethane dcm the source of plume 2 is not precisely known plume 2 occurs on the east side of the study reach suggesting it has one or more sources among the commercial or industrial properties east of the creek for example historical resources indicate a lumber mill and underground fuel tanks on the east side of the study reach since 1922 and a gasoline service station adjacent to hominy swamp creek since 1959 sanborn map company 1922 hill directory company 1959 while further investigation would be needed to identify the source s of plume 2 the discovery of plume 2 illustrates the usefulness of streambed groundwater sampling as a flexible low cost investigative tool for identifying locations and rates section 4 4 below of groundwater contaminant discharge to streams plume 2 would have been missed if the investigation had been based on only a vertical control plane on the west side of the stream near the dry cleaner or on measurement of only chloroethenes rather than a broader range of vocs plume 2 was dominated by bz which had overall mean concentrations of 57 and 55 μg l 1 in june 2015 and january 2016 respectively plume 1 was dominated by cdce and vc degradation products of the likely source contaminant pce mean cdce and vc in june 2015 27 and 13 μg l 1 respectively were greater than mean pce 0 087 μg l 1 by factors of 310 and 149 respectively suggesting extensive subsurface degradation of pce in january 2016 mean cdce and vc 11 and 8 2 μg l 1 respectively were only 79 and 59 times greater respectively than mean pce 0 14 μg l 1 higher streambed temperature may be at least partly responsible for the concentration ratios cdce pce and vc pce being higher in june compared to january biodegradation of chlorinated solvents is most rapid at temperatures around 30 c and slower at warmer and colder temperatures friis et al 2007 ramsburg et al 2010 warmer groundwater temperature in june table 2 likely favored faster pce degradation compared to january in both june 2015 and january 2016 the highest pce concentration occurred in the southwest corner of the study reach while the highest concentrations of other chloroethenes occurred farther upstream fig 3 groundwater at all sampling points was anoxic table 2 but the sampling point in the southwest corner of the reach indicates that some pce reaches the stream despite the anoxic conditions possibly along a flowpath in which pce degradation is less extensive than in other flowpaths reaching the streambed compared to a sampling program that relies on wells the streambed sampling used here is better suited for assessing this sort of spotty spatially variable contaminant discharge through different groundwater flowpaths to a stream some observations for bt pce and vc did not fit neatly into a simple 2 plume framework e g the maps labeled other in fig 3 dcp provides another example in june 2015 the streambed area of highest dcp concentration was somewhat separate from both the plume 1 and plume 2 areas but in january 2016 highest dcp coincided with the plume 2 area on the east side of the channel fig 3 also in both june 2015 and january 2016 the highest bt concentration was found at a sampling point with no other significant voc concentrations fig 3 perhaps indicating a unique bt source somewhere in the study area a survey of vocs in us aquifers based on several thousand samples detected bt in only one sample of groundwater zogorski et al 2006 indicating the presence of bt at hominy swamp creek was unusual overall a 2 plume framework is suggested by the spatial clustering of most voc concentration data but does not fully account for all variation the 2 plume framework may oversimplify conditions in an urban environment with numerous potential voc sources and industrial activity dating back to the 19th century lewis 2007 even so this framework based on groundwater sampling beneath the channel points to a spatial separation in voc source locations chloroethenes west of the stream benzene and other vocs east of the stream that could be useful in identifying source locations stream water voc data may indicate whether sources exist upstream in a watershed but cannot indicate whether the source is on one side of the watershed or the other 4 4 voc fluxes spatial patterns of advective voc flux through the streambed f voc table s3 were closely related to the spatial pattern of groundwater flux v through the streambed with some exceptions due to variation in the concentration patterns for example in june 2015 v was highest 1 near the northwest corner of the study reach west side of the 38 m transect and 2 in a band of slightly elevated v running through the center of the channel and spanning the middle three transects 46 54 and 62 m fig 2 these areas of high v coincide with most of the areas of high f voc for 12 of 14 vocs fig 4 seven vocs had their highest fluxes near the northwest corner of the reach and five vocs had their highest fluxes in the area of elevated v in the center of the channel elevated voc concentration rather than v was responsible for two other areas of high f voc high vc flux in the 70 m transect and high pce flux in the southwest corner of the reach in the 78 m transect fig 4 in january 2016 a band of elevated v that increased southward occurred in the center of the channel from the 38 m transect to the 70 m transect fig 2 with the exception of high pce flux in the southwest corner of the reach all areas of high f voc in january coincided with this band of high v fig 4 thus high groundwater flux drove almost all the occurrences of high voc flux with the exception of two vocs in june 2015 generally temporal changes in f voc for plume 1 followed the same changes seen in v with the area of highest f voc shifting about 24 m south from june to january plume 2 vocs generally had high f voc at the 46 m transect in both june and january though most also showed a second area of high discharge farther south in january on the 62 m or 70 m transect fig 4 for each voc in each of the two sampling campaigns the flow weighted mean fwm voc concentration in the groundwater discharge was calculated as σ v j c j σv j where j refers to the measurement point for each voc the summation was over all the measurement points in a given campaign 26 points in june 2015 or 25 in january 2016 the fwm was generally higher than the unweighted mean uwm fig 5 with only 5 exceptions out of 28 cases 14 vocs 2 campaigns consistent with higher voc concentrations at points of higher water flux as noted earlier conant jr et al 2004 found the opposite that voc concentrations were higher where water flux was lower fwm was higher than uwm for bz cdce and vc the dominant vocs at the site illustrating the importance of collecting groundwater flux and concentration data at the same points in studies of voc flux from groundwater to surface water the fwm is a more accurate indication of the average concentration in the net groundwater discharge to the stream because each measured concentration contributes to the fwm in proportion to the groundwater flux at the measurement point the same weighting applicable to each groundwater flowpath to the stream in nature 4 5 voc mass discharge from groundwater to stream assuming the dry conditions in june 2015 and wet conditions in january 2016 roughly bracket the annual range of baseflow an approximate estimate of annual integrated voc mass discharge from groundwater to the study reach was obtained by multiplying the streambed area of the reach by the overall mean flux of each voc the mean of all sampling points in june 2015 and january 2016 and then summing over all 14 vocs detected the estimated overall mass discharge of vocs from groundwater to the stream reach was 3 6 kg yr 1 table 3 the three largest individual contributors were bz 2 1 kg yr 1 cdce 0 83 kg yr 1 and vc 0 40 kg yr 1 the smallest was pce 0 00067 kg yr 1 in the calculations above voc mass discharge was based on mean f voc values determined as the averages of the 25 or 26 individual point f voc values in each sampling campaign june 2015 and january 2016 an alternative that has been used in other studies would be to compute the mean f voc value for each voc in a given sampling campaign as the product of the mean groundwater flux and mean voc concentration for that sampling campaign in other words to compute the product of average k i and c values rather than the average of individual point scale kic products for the data presented here the product of averages approach yielded mean fluxes and mass discharges that ranged from 57 smaller to 648 larger than the average of products approach with an average absolute difference of about 68 across all 14 vocs and 2 sampling campaigns table s4 variations of the product of averages approach have been widely used in the literature but averaging individual point scale f voc values is a more accurate approach that accounts implicitly for potential covariance among k i and c the data collection presented here allowed the more accurate approach because at each measurement point all three variables were determined at the same time within about 30 min and same place within about 10 cm so the calculation of voc flux at a given point on the streambed is not influenced by k i or c values from other points 4 6 influence of streambed voc degradation voc flux and mass discharge values were based on groundwater samples generally collected 31 36 cm deep in the streambed and actual voc flux and discharge could be lower than calculated if there were significant voc degradation in the upper 31 cm of the streambed to investigate the potential significance of this an estimate of the maximum amount of biodegradation in the upper 31 cm of streambed was made using the maximum first order rate constant for anaerobic degradation of each voc k d table s5 for each voc at each streambed sampling point we computed both the maximum and minimum values of f voc vc and vcexp k d t respectively where t ln v is the advective travel time through the upper 31 cm of streambed l 31 cm v the groundwater flux specific discharge at the sampling point and n the mean porosity determined from the three streambed cores 0 41 table s6 for each of the three vocs with the highest mean fluxes bz cdce and vc the mean of the minimum flux values for a given voc in a given campaign june or january ranged from 0 1 to 8 9 less than the mean of the maximum flux values table s3 thus it seems highly unlikely that biodegradation in the streambed sediments above the groundwater sampling depth could have had a large effect on the estimates of mean flux for the primary vocs discharging to hominy swamp creek the largest potential relative impact of degradation was for pce with a 44 difference between mean minimum and mean maximum f voc values but this has a negligible effect on the overall estimate of voc mass discharge from the groundwater system because pce is the smallest contributor to that discharge table 3 also while degradation of pce in the upper part of the streambed could in theory cause the actual fluxes of pce degradation products to be larger than we calculated pce concentrations were generally too small to have this effect much smaller than the cdce and vc concentrations the time available for degradation above the sampling depth is the advective travel time through the top 31 cm of the streambed and a long travel time is necessarily associated with both low voc flux low f voc and high potential for degradation this relationship represents a beneficial feedback for estimating voc mass discharge with the approach used here the estimation of integrated voc mass discharge from groundwater to stream is not sensitive to degradation because greater degradation will generally occur at streambed locations of lower flux assuming the extent of degradation depends on the travel time through the streambed as in a first order rate law applying the maximum degradation correction to all 14 vocs reduces the estimate of integrated voc mass discharge from groundwater to the study stream from 3 6 kg yr 1 table 3 to 3 5 kg yr 1 that reduction does not account for production of vocs by the degradation of other vocs e g vc production from dce such production might eliminate the near negligible degradation effect noted here 4 7 influence of streambed voc retardation computed voc fluxes from groundwater to stream could differ from actual fluxes across the top of the streambed if the groundwater voc concentrations at the top of the streambed differed from the concentrations at the sampling depth of about 31 cm which could potentially occur from voc sorption and retardation in the upper part of the streambed for example if the vocs in question were just beginning to arrive at the streambed and break through to the stream at the time of sampling the voc concentrations at the top of the streambed might be lower than those at the sampling depth but this seems unlikely considering the widely different time scales for 1 transport through the upper 31 cm of streambed and 2 the overall industrial commercial history of the study site in the three streambed sediment cores the mean fraction of organic carbon was 0 57 mean porosity was 0 41 and mean bulk density was 1 57 g cm 3 table s6 these streambed properties and literature values of k oc gave retardation factors r ranging from 1 5 for dcm to 11 for tce the r values together with measured values of v and porosity imply mean voc travel times through the top 31 cm of streambed of 51 to 364 days table s5 the only travel time over 300 days was for pce a negligible contributor to total voc discharge table 3 mean travel times for the three most abundant vocs were 90 days for bz 79 days for cdce and 103 days for vc these time scales are short compared to the history of contamination at the site industrial development of the city of wilson nc dates to the 19th century with larger industries focusing on tobacco processing fertilizer production lumber and eventually vehicle manufacture lewis 2007 the dry cleaner adjacent to the stream the likely source of vocs in plume 1 had been in almost continuous operation since 1946 previous work related to dry cleaner contamination showed evidence of these chemicals in near stream groundwater since 2004 ranck and macwilliams 2013 2014 all plume 1 contaminants except 1 1 dce were detected in stream water samples from june 2015 and january 2016 indicating breakthrough to the stream nickels 2016 for the newly recognized plume 2 the history of contamination is less clear but bz and 1 2 dca were detected in all stream water samples from june 2015 and january 2016 table s6 given the observed breakthrough to the stream and the long 150 yr industrial history of the study site it seems unlikely that the plume 2 vocs were just coincidentally breaking through to the stream during our first sampling campaign in june 2015 even if they were the upper 31 cm of streambed would have been in or near steady state about 200 days later during the january 2016 sampling overall it seems unlikely that transient voc behavior related to retardation in the upper 31 cm of streambed could have caused the actual voc fluxes across the top of the streambed to differ significantly from the fluxes estimated and reported 5 discussion streambed point measurements for voc flux and mass discharge recent publications demonstrate novel approaches to quantifying voc fluxes through streambeds from contaminated groundwater to streams the streambed point velocity probe quantifies average linear velocity of groundwater in a streambed based on a small injection of salty water followed by collection and analysis of specific conductance breakthrough curves at a small point scale cremeans and devlin 2017 cremeans et al 2018 quantifying voc flux and mass discharge into the stream would require streambed porosity data and voc data potential errors may arise if voc data are not collected concurrently and co located with measurements of average linear velocity and porosity the streambed passive flux meter collects vocs onto a sorbent such as granular activated carbon gac using the natural ambient head gradient in the streambed to drive contaminated water through the meter layton et al 2017 ottosen et al 2020 quantifying voc flux and mass discharge into the stream requires knowledge of vertical and horizontal k in the streambed and vertical k of the sorbent in the meter and deploying and later retrieving the meter and carrying out chemical analysis on segments of sorbent in the meter for contaminants of interest and pre sorbed tracers added to the sorbent to allow estimation of water flux the automated tube seepage meter solomon et al 2020 has not yet been applied to the problem of voc transport into streams but is one of most promising new technologies for quantifying water flux specific discharge through streambeds it quantifies specific discharge from precise measurements of the rate of rise of the water level inside a tube installed in the streambed these and other new approaches present promising options that merit continued development and use still darcian methods continue to be widely used due to their simplicity and accessibility here we demonstrated a new darcian approach to quantifying voc flux f voc from contaminated groundwater to streams relying on point scale streambed measurements of k i and c all determined simultaneously at the same sampling points this approach eliminates potential errors associated with 1 coupling k i and c data from different points and times in heterogeneous streambeds and 2 computing mass discharge as the product of average k i and c values in the study area rather than with individual kic values from individual measurement points the approach was made possible with a piezomanometer device used to collect groundwater samples through a short screen and to make accurate measurements of vertical i in streambeds kennedy et al 2007 2009a point values of k i and c are not expected to necessarily be independent in porous media covariance not equal to zero and using individual kic values from individual measurement points is expected to be a more accurate darcian approach to quantifying voc mass discharge through streambeds from groundwater to streams for the data presented here the product of averages approach computing mean voc flux as the product of reach average k i and c values yielded mean voc fluxes and mass discharges that ranged from 57 smaller to 648 larger than the average of products approach computing mean voc flux as the average of the kic values at the individual sampling points with the average absolute value of the difference equal to 68 across all 14 vocs and 2 sampling campaigns 6 summary and conclusions groundwater flux v into the urban study reach of hominy swamp creek was heterogeneous with one quarter of the streambed measurement points accounting for at least 75 of the total groundwater discharge generally v was higher toward the center of the channel and the location of highest v shifted downstream from june to january the magnitude of mean v increased by a factor of 5 9 from june 2015 to january 2016 influencing the distribution and magnitude of voc fluxes significantly fourteen vocs table 1 were quantified in at least 2 plumes plume 1 from the west side of the stream was dominated by pce degradation products mostly cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce and vinyl chloride vc plume 2 from the east side of the stream and was dominated by benzene bz the majority of voc results seem to fit reasonably within this two plume framework though it may oversimplify contaminant sources to this urban stream discovery of plume 2 illustrates the usefulness of streambed sampling as a flexible low cost investigative tool for identifying locations and rates of contaminant plume discharge to streams voc concentrations ranged from below laboratory detection limits to 600 μg l 1 vc bz and tcp were the vocs that most significantly exceeded applicable state groundwater quality standards by factors of 367 56 and 11 respectively based on their mean concentrations values of voc flux from groundwater to the stream f voc were higher in january 2016 than in june 2015 for 13 of the 14 vocs all except cdce largely because groundwater flux was higher on average in january bz had the highest f voc with mean values of 11 and 37 mg m 2 d 1 in june 2015 and january 2016 respectively cdce and vc had mean values of 9 8 and 1 9 mg m 2 d 1 respectively in june 2015 and 9 5 and 7 0 mg m 2 d 1 in january 2016 high groundwater flux drove almost all the occurrences of high voc flux for bz cdce and vc the dominant vocs at the site the flow weighted mean concentration was 20 223 higher than the unweighted mean fig 5 for cdce in june 2015 the flow weighted mean was above the relevant state groundwater quality standard 70 μg l 1 whereas the unweighted mean was well below the standard collecting groundwater flux data at the same points as voc concentrations allowed flow weighting of the concentrations which gave a more accurate indication of the average voc concentration in the integrated groundwater discharge to the stream given that v was generally larger in the center of the channel than on the sides and that discharging groundwater is generally older in the centers of stream channels than on the sides modica et al 1998 kennedy et al 2009b gilmore et al 2016b the finding that flow weighted mean concentration is generally greater than the unweighted mean would be consistent with greater contaminant concentrations in older groundwater at the site which would in turn imply improving conditions at the site less contamination in younger groundwater testing this hypothesis would require additional data for example vertical profiles of voc concentrations in groundwater groundwater age dating tracers or other data an estimate of integrated voc mass discharge from groundwater to the study reach of hominy swamp creek 3 6 kg of voc per year was generated by integrating average voc flux over the streambed area of the reach for each voc the bulk of this total voc discharge was due to bz cdce and vc with their individual mass discharges of 2 1 0 83 and 0 40 kg yr 1 respectively this represents an off site transport of groundwater vocs downstream toward the neuse river with potential exposures and impacts on watershed residents through dermal contact consumption of fish or inhalation of voc volatilized from the surface water analysis suggests voc degradation in the upper streambed was not significant for the major vocs or for the integrated estimate of total voc mass discharge from contaminated groundwater to the study reach as noted in section 4 6 estimates of voc mass discharge from the streambed point sampling approach used are inherently insensitive to voc degradation in the upper streambed because greater degradation above the groundwater sampling depth will generally occur at the points of lower flux this is another benefit of the approach used also in watersheds with decades long histories of voc transport through groundwater to streams the timescale for voc transport through the upper streambed is vastly shorter than the timescale of the contamination history it therefore seems unlikely that retardation in the streambed above the depth of sample collection would cause widespread or significant overestimation of voc flux with the method used declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

valuable natural water resource and vital component of all living beings it is among the most reliable source of useable water for household farming and industrial activities it is assumed that the groundwater is least likely to be contaminated than other water supplies like surface water yadav et al 2018 mandal et al 2021 prasad et al 2021 it meets around 38 of global irrigation water requirement shelar et al 2022 rane et al 2022 in india 60 of irrigated cropland and 85 of drinking water supply are reliant on groundwater doad et al 2022 xiong et al 2022 goala et al 2021 in arid and semiarid areas where people rely primarily on groundwater the situation is drastically worse surface water is scarce in these areas due to higher seasonal variability in rainfall pattern and rapid water return to the atmosphere due to higher evapotranspiration mukherjee and singh 2020 elbeltagi et al 2022 gupta et al 2021 intensive agriculture population growth rapid industrialization unscientific and faulty irrigation practices along the climate change situation has led to an increase in groundwater depletion rates in both our country and overseas bhattacharya et al 2021 according to the world bank if necessary measures are not taken india would be in a water deficit zone by 2025 and a water scarce zone by 2050 arulbalaji et al 2019 boretti and rosa 2019 as a result identifying groundwater potential zones with precise technology is important for long term sustainability in semi arid terrains in order to build a sustainable water resource system planning and monitoring rajesh et al 2021 exploration of groundwater is difficult and challenging as it is a hidden natural resource pande et al 2020 rajesh et al 2021 the most common and widely used methods for identifying borewell location and aquifer thickness are drilling experiments and stratigraphic investigations but these methods are costly and time consuming mukherjee and singh 2020 patra et al 2018 for determining groundwater potential zones combining remote sensing rs with geographical information systems gis has shown to be a time and effort saving approach etikala et al 2019 pande et al 2020 integration of rs and gis techniques for the preparation of different thematic layers such as slope drainage density distance to water channel geology lithology topographic wetness index roughness land use land cover patterns rainfall and soils etc has played a vital role in the demarcation of groundwater potential zones the ability to combine primary and secondary data sets is another important feature of rs and gis burrough 1986 pande et al 2020 furthermore several researchers have been used different rs and gis based techniques for deciphering groundwater potential zones table 1 groundwater potential zones have been mapped by several researchers using the ahp and mif methods the ahp technique was first proposed in the 1970s by prof thomas l saaty to normalise the assigned weights nithya et al 2019 decisions can be made using this method based on hierarchical structure judgments and accurate perception all of which have a significant influence on the final decision rather et al 2022 saaty 1994 the ahp technique is a basic and well structured decision making technique that is universally acknowledged in the multi influencing factors mif technique the interaction between different components is considered while calculating weightage it s also straightforward dependable efficient and well structured depleting groundwater resources topography aquifer features and climatic factors make it necessary to delineate ground water potential zones in a semiarid region therefore the current study was carried out in the jaipur district of rajasthan taking into account the significance of assessing groundwater potentiality using remote sensing gis ahp and mif techniques therefore the present study had following objectives i to characterize the vegetative soil climatic and terrain parameters and ii to delineate gwpz using ahp and mif along with geospatial techniques the research will be useful to planners legislators officials and especially local governments in minimising groundwater vulnerability in this region by proper utilisation and control measures 2 material and methods 2 1 study location the jaipur district is located in the east central portion of the rajasthan state and extends between 26 25 and 27 51 north latitude and 74 55 and 76 15 east longitude fig 1 it covers 11 061 km2 area accounting for around 3 23 of total geographical area of rajasthan the district is divided into 17 tehsils and 15 blocks for administrative purposes according to the census of 2011 jaipur district has a total population of 66 26 178 people with a rural population of 31 54 331 people and urban population of 34 71 847 people jaipur is located in the semi arid region of india bedi et al 2019 and received mean annual rainfall of 527 mm during the period 2001 to 2010 the average summer temperature is 35 to 45 c while the average winter temperature is 5 to 15 c soni et al 2018 the total annual evapotranspiration potential is 1744 7 mm cgwb 2017 2 2 thematic layer preparation groundwater occurrence is affected by several influencing factors such as lithology geomorphology topography lineament rainfall roughness drainage density soil type elevation land use land cover fractures and meteorological parameters of a location rahmati et al 2014 razandi et al 2015 benjmel et al 2021 gis based methodology was usedto demarcate the gwpz of the jaipur district ten thematic layers geomorphology rainfall roughness topographic wetness index twi soil land use land cover lulc slope topographic position index tpi drainage density and curvature have been explored and integrated in gis to delineate the gwpz in the present investigation the detailed methodology of this study is presented in the fig 2 geomorphological properties of a region aid in understanding the spatial distribution of different landforms along with topographic information related to groundwater subsurface movements mukherjee et al 2020 geomorphological features have been used as a key criterion for demarcating gwpz by many researchers gnanachandrasamy et al 2018 arulbalaji et al 2019 kanagaraj et al 2019 allafta et al 2021 the geomorphology map was collected from bhukosh geological survey of india https bhukosh gsi gov in firstly the map was imported in arcgis 10 8 then the study region was extracted using analysis tools extract clip the rate of percolation and infiltration into an aquifer is significantly controlled by the soil anbazhagan et al 2005 the size shape and arrangement of soil particles as well as corresponding pore system have a significant impact on water movement both vertically and laterally allafta et al 2021 the sand silt and clay content were downloaded from international soil reference and information centre soilgrids250m and resampled to 12 5 m the final soil texture map was generated in saga gis using soil texture classification tool soil texture classes were reclassified to soil texture groups sand sandy loam and loamy sand were reclassified as moderately to very coarsely textured soils whereas loam and silt were reclassified as medium textured soils and sandy clay and clay loam were reclassified as moderately fine textured soils land use land cover lulc has an impact on the availability and distribution of groundwater in a region scanlon et al 2005 built up lands often have a lower infiltration rate due to the presence of impervious and paved surfaces forests and agricultural lands on the other hand allow for more water infiltration as the vegetative cover can hold more water and enable infiltration into soil the highest infiltration rate is found in water bodies followed by forests agricultural urban areas and industrial land etikala et al 2019 allafta et al 2021 the lulc map was obtained from the icar indian national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nagpur rainfall is an important part of the hydrological cycle in a region since it provides water to surface water bodies and recharges groundwater through percolation rainfall data for the year 2020 was collected from indian meteorological department pai et al 2014 the data was converted to a raster layer in arcgis 10 8 using the multidimensional tools make netcdf raster layer tool the raster layer was then converted to points using the tools conversion tools from raster raster to point for generating the spatial distribution of rainfall these points were interpolated using inverse distance weighted idw arulbalaji and gurugnanam 2016 slope is an important component for groundwater recharge because it regulates surface runoff and water infiltration into the soil due to faster surface runoff and increased erosion a greater slope gives insufficient residence time for water infiltration ahmed ii and mansor 2018 yang et al 2019 as a result flat surfaces are responsible for very good recharge and steeper slopes indicate poor groundwater recharge a digital elevation model dem with a 12 5 m pixel size of advanced land observing satellite alos phased array type l band sar palsar was downloaded from the alaska satellite facility asf https search asf alaska edu the slope map was created in arcgis 10 8 using the spatial analyst tools surface slope tools the drainage density dd of a basin is a measure of its entire stream length to its total area strahler 1964 it is an inverse function of the permeability and an area with high dd is considered as poor groundwater recharge zone mageshkumar et al 2019 in contrast regions with less dd indicate high groundwater recharge yield and more occurrence of groundwater in the present study dd was calculated using different functions hydrology fill flow direction flow accumulation stream order stream to feature density line density in arcgis 10 8 arulbalaji and gurugnanam 2016 the roughness parameter is used to measure topographical undulation of a region riley et al 1999 higher undulation which is common in hilly rocky regions indicates more surface runoff with less groundwater recharge and infiltration in the present study roughness map was created from dem 12 5 m in arcgis 10 8 1 roughness fs mean fs min fs max fs min where fsmean is the mean focal statistics fsmin is the minimum focal statistics and fsmax is the maximum focal statistics the topographic wetness index twi is a secondary topographical parameter of a region s wetness conditions mukherjee and singh 2020 and commonly used to examine the influence of topography on hydrological processes sörensen et al 2006 this index indicates the predisposition of gravitational forces to move water downslope and the ability for water to fill in a catchment ghorbani nejad et al 2017 the following equation was used to calculate twi in arcgis 10 8 2 twi ln as tanβ where as is the area of the ascending slope and β is the gradient of the slope the topographic position index tpi is a commonly used index for determining slopes and different landforms mokarram et al 2015 tpi has a greater value when there is more surface runoff and less infiltration which indicates inadequate groundwater recharge positive tpi values represents higher elevations than the surroundings whereas negative tpi values represent lower elevations the tpi map was generated from a dem in this study using automated geoscientific analyses in saga gis choubin et al 2019 curvature measures the slope gradient positive and negative values indicate convex and concave surfaces respectively while zero indicates flatness vijith and dodge wan 2019 in arcgis 10 8 the curvature map was created using the tools spatial analyst tools surface curvature three thematic layers were divided based on their categories or formations geomorphology soil texture and lulc natural break classification was used in the gis environment to classify other thematic layers such as rainfall twi dd slope roughness tpi and curvature into five sub classes furthermore some investigations have categorised thematic layers with satisfactory model accuracy utilising natural break categorization jothibasu and anbazhagan 2016 arulbalaji et al 2019 mallick et al 2019 mukherjee and singh 2020 2 3 multi criteria decision analysis using analytical hierarchical process technique the most widely used and well known gis based method for demarcating groundwater potential zones is multi criteria decision analysis mcda using the analytical hierarchical process ahp technique to make an organised decision of priorities we need to make comparisons and a scale of numbers that shows how much more important one parameter in comparison to another in terms of the criterion being compared the ahp is a pairwise comparison assessment theory where parameters are compared with each other using the saaty s scale of relative importance parry et al 2018 mukherjee and singh 2020 morales and de vries 2021 2 4 weight assignment and weight normalization the weightages of thematic layers were determined using saaty s scale 1 9 table 2 with 1 indicating equal impact of the two layers and 9 indicating the greatest impact of one layer over another saaty 1980 thematic layers were given weights based on their importance rahmati et al 2015b allafta et al 2021 according to studies of related literature and specialist viewpoints different parameters have a significant influence on groundwater potentiality in the present study each thematic layers were assigned ranks based on the past literature naghibi et al 2015a mallick et al 2019 arshad et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 mukherjee and singh 2020 allafta et al 2021 geomorphology significantly affects the occurrence and flow of groundwater arulbalaji et al 2019 mukherjee and singh 2020 and as a result it was identified as first important parameter in comparison matrix it was placed in first column and first row based on the prior reviews we chose lulc as the second significant layer because lulc changes are among the most important human induced activities that affect the availability of groundwater resources patra et al 2018 all hydrological parameter i e dd rainfall and twi were selected as third important parameter in the hierarchy and assigned equal rank because rain is the primary source of groundwater recharge patra et al 2018 and twi reflects the spatial pattern of moisture benjmel et al 2021 pinthong et al 2022 the soil texture was chosen as the fourth element in the hierarchy because infiltration and percolation of water are significantly controlled by size and distribution of soil particles sarwar et al 2021 the infiltration of rainfall to the earth is strongly influenced by the slope pathmanandakumar et al 2021 and chosen as the fifth factor in the hierarchy roughness and tpi were selected as the sixth parameter in the hierarchy while curvature was allocated the lowest importance because it has the least impact on groundwater recharge mukherjee and singh 2020 as a result in a pair wise comparison matrix all thematic layers were compared to one another table 3 the sub classes of each thematic layer were ranked on a scale of 0 to 9 based on their relative influence on groundwater occurrence assigned ranks and weight of subclasses of each thematic layer were represented in table 4 2 5 consistency analysis the consistency ratio cr was used to validate the decision based on pair wise comparison of thematic layers and its sub classes saaty 1990 for computing the cr following equation was used 3 cr ci rci where rci is the random consistency index the values were derived from the saaty s standard table 5 ci is the consistency index which was computed using following equation 4 ci λmax n n 1 where n is the total of thematic layers employed in the study and λmax is the principal eigenvalue a cr value 0 10 is acceptable to undertake weighted overlay analysis using ahp if the cr is 0 10 the judgement must be revised to identify the cause of the inconsistency and fix it until the cr 0 10 is reached 2 6 multi criteria decision analysis using multi influencing factor technique the multi influencing factors mif technique is relies on the interdependence and interrelationship of several influencing variables pande et al 2020 the mif technique was used in this study to assign weightage to each thematic layer depending on its significance the interdependence and interrelation of influencing thematic layers to delineate the groundwater potential zones is depicted in fig 3 every relationship in the diagram divided into major and minor impact and their strength is weighted accordingly if there was a major effect a score of 1 0 was given indicating a strong relation between variables in contrast a score of 0 5 was assigned if a minor effect existed indicating weak correlations between components finally proposed score of each thematic layer was computed using the eq 5 and it is presented in table 6 5 proposed score w i x y σ x y 100 where x represents major effect y is the minor effect and wiis the individual parameter weight the weights of sub classes of each layer were computed using the proposed score for that layer the first sub class ci1 was given the same weight as the concerned layer wi the wi value was then divided by the sum of subclasses in the layer and the resulting value pi was deducted from ci1 and assigned to the second sub class mandal et al 2021 for third sub class ci3 pi was subtracted from ci2 and this weight assignment methodwas repeated for the subsequent sub classes table 7 in other words to assign weight to each sub class the following equation was used 6 ci 2 ci 1 pi 7 pi wi n where wi is each thematic layer s proposed score weight and n represents the total number of sub classes in each thematic layer 2 7 overlay analysis and groundwater potential zone map the gwpz map can be generated by stacking all the layers in arcgis 10 8 using the weighted overlay method once weights have been given to thematic layers and their sub classes zghibi et al 2020 mukherjee and singh 2020 8 gwpz i 1 n wi ri where gwpz stands for groundwater potential zone wi represents the weight of each thematic layer and ri represents rank of each thematic layer s sub classes finally gwpzs were classified as poor moderate and good in terms of potentiality 2 8 validation validation is regarded as a significant modelling procedure in terms of scientific significance the well depth data received from the central ground water board s reports cgwb 2020 for the jaipur region was used to validate the gwpz map many researchers validated the produced gwpzs with secondary sources razandi et al 2015 arulbalaji et al 2019 mukherjee and singh 2020 allafta et al 2021 dar et al 2020 the receiver operator characteristics roc curve is used to validate the gwpz the roc curve was created by plotting the true positive rates sensitivity on y axis and false positive rates 1 specificity on x axis pourghasemi et al 2013 the area under the curve auc was estimated from the roc curve and its values ranges from 0 5 to 1 the auc value closer to 1 implies great model performance whereas value near to 0 5 indicates poor prediction accuracy panahi et al 2020 mandal et al 2021 phong et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of factors influencing groundwater potentiality the geomorphology of a region represents landform types including descriptions and physical processes and influence groundwater potential directly or indirectly kordestani et al 2019 the geomorphological features of the study area were classified into eight groups such as hilly terrain dissected hills and pediments pediments upland aravalli plains aeo fluvial plains sandy arid plains and river valley fig 4a aeo fluvial plains cover a largest area 41 8 followed by an upland 23 4 hilly terrain 14 3 and aravalli plains 11 1 the aeo fluvial plains and uplands are mostly found in the region s middle and lower reaches dissected hills and pediments pediments and river valleys accounted for 3 2 2 8 and 1 8 of the overall geographical area respectively the sandy arid plains cover the lowest area 0 1 the areas near water bodies and river valley generally have good groundwater potentiality because of high infiltration rate of loose alluvial soil and were given a higher rank maity and manda 2017 similarly the potential of groundwater is generally high in aravalli plains and uplands zones due to higher infiltration rate whereas the potential is lower in the hilly terrain and dissected hills due to high elevation and runoff mukherjee and singh 2020 pediments are slant areas that form between hills and plains having medium groundwater potentiality rajaveni et al 2015 due to aridity the gw potentiality of aeofluvial plains with sand dunes and sandy arid zones is limited therefore they were given a lower rank saravanan et al 2021 lulc is a significant factor that determines region s groundwater potential through runoff infiltration rate recharge and evapotranspiration bhattacharya et al 2021 the research area s lulc map represents kharif rabi zaid crops 65 0 current fallow land 13 5 land with shrub scrub 8 7 forest shrub scrub degraded 3 4 other wastelands 2 9 built up urban rural 2 1 deciduous forest 2 0 water bodies 1 6 and gullied ravines 0 7 is depicted in fig 4b water bodies woodlands and agricultural fields are suitable for water cycle however built up areas gullies and wasteland have low groundwater potential as explained in the section 2 2 hence water bodies forest and agricultural lands were given larger weights whereas the built up urban rural other wastelands and gullied ravines were given lower weights the dd of an area is mostly determined by the dynamic depiction of geology and geomorphology slope angle and length landforms rainfall percolation rate and vegetation type magesh et al 2012 acharya and nag 2013 dd is inversely proportional to the drainage basin s permeability the dd was divided into five subgroups such as very low 0 38 0 90 km 1 low 0 90 1 41 km 1 medium 1 41 1 93 km 1 high 1 93 2 45 km 1 and very high 2 45 2 97 km 1 as illustrated in fig 4c the study area mostly observed high 37 1 to very high 44 1 dd with poor infiltration rate and peripheral part of the area experienced very low to medium dd the very high dd was observed in the district s south west part areas with high dd indicate more runoff less water infiltration and less groundwater recharge whereas the lower dd indicates the converse is true zghibi et al 2020 therefore the study assigned lower weights to areas with high dd and vice versa the rainfall is the most important component of hydrological cycle and a significant determinant of groundwater recharge in an area the rainfall data from 2020 is used throughout the investigation which is mainly received from south western monsoon and the interpolation technique was used to create a rainfall spatial distribution map as depicted in fig 4d the study area received high precipitation in south eastern part and less precipitation in the northern and western part the rainfall of study area has been categorised into five groups based on minimum and maximum values namely very low 473 49 629 45 mm low 629 45 698 31 mm moderate 698 31 769 20 mm high 769 20 846 17 mm and very high 846 17 989 97 mm rainfall and occupying approximately 3 18 41 32 and 6 of the total geographical area respectively the possibility of groundwater occurrence will be high if the rainfall and duration are high sutradhar et al 2021 mukherjee and singh 2020 therefore higher rainfall sub classes were allotted higher weights whereas the lower rainfall sub classes were getting lower weights soil texture influences groundwater recharge by regulating the infiltration and percolation of surface water into aquifers through porosity pore size distribution soil aggregation and consistency lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 the study area is mainly comprised of moderately to very coarse textured soil 14 4 medium textured 42 2 and moderately fine textured soil 43 4 as presented in fig 5a eastern part of the study area occupied mostly moderately to very coarse textured soil and northern and southern parts have medium textured soils in the present study moderately to very coarse textured soils assigned higher weight than other soils because these soils have high infiltration rate and less runoff which results better recharge of groundwater brouwer et al 1988 owuor et al 2016 allafta et al 2021 conversely fine textured soils assigned lower weight because the infiltration and percolation capability in finer soil is limited slope refers to native and regional relief that incorporates an important impact on groundwater movement and recharge into aquifer gupta and srivastava 2010 the steepness of the slope of a place strongly influences potential of groundwater availability ghosh et al 2020 guru et al 2017 murmu et al 2019 magesh et al 2012 murmu et al 2019 thus it s an important element for groundwater recharge according to the natural break approach the study area s slope was divided into five classes it varies from 0 to 72 97 fig 5b and almost 97 area of the district falls under the slope class of 2 57 which is nearly flat and has a high weightage for groundwater speculation slope of the remaining 3 area of the district ranged from 2 57 to 72 97 and this area covered the northern to north eastern part of the district the steep and very steep classes were given lower weights while the moderate to flat slope class was received a high score due to large possibility for groundwater recharge acharya and nag 2013 naghibi et al 2015b nithya et al 2019 bhattacharya et al 2021 selvam et al 2014 the twi is a secondary topographical feature of a region s wetness conditions which is commonly used to investigate the impact of topography influence on hydrological processes this index reflects the proclivity of gravitational forces to move water downslope and the propensity for water to accumulate in a watershed ghorbani nejad et al 2017 rinderer et al 2014 the district s twi values ranged from 1 46 to 25 94 as shown in fig 5c the values were divided into five categories 1 46 7 12 7 12 9 71 9 71 11 92 11 92 14 99 and 14 99 25 94 nearly 47 area of the district came under the first subclass of twi 1 46 7 12 and only 2 area came under fifth subclass 14 99 25 94 and remaining area shared between other classes the greater twi value indicates possible groundwater infiltration and recharge as a result of topographic impacts as a result higher twi classes were given more weight and vice versa mukherjee and singh 2020 benjmel et al 2021 the tpi is a commonly used technique for categorizing landforms and determining topographic slopes mokarram et al 2015 the tpis of the district ranged between 12 87 to 12 00 the thematic layer of tpi was reclassified into five classes such as 12 87 to 0 583 0 583 to 0 291 0 291 to 0 096 0 096 to 0 294 and 0 0294 to 12 00 as shown in fig 5d the reclassification of the tpi was done by natural break method this index has a greater value when there is more surface runoff and less infiltration resulting in poor groundwater recharge low tpi values were attributed to greater weight and vice versa mukherjee and singh 2020 the roughness index in respect to digital elevation model describes the amount of elevation change between consecutive cells arulbalaji et al 2019 another key variable for predicting a region s groundwater potential is terrain heterogeneity which is quantified using roughness riley et al 1999 fig 6a illustrates the roughness map of the study area and the roughness of the research region ranged from 0 11 to 0 88 the roughness values were divided into five groups 0 11 0 25 0 25 0 40 0 40 0 53 0 53 0 71 and 0 71 0 88 the rougher the surface the higher the undulation and vice versa a total of 99 area of the district came under the first subclass of roughness it means almost whole district have very less topographic variations for low roughness values higher weights are assigned and vice versa mukherjee and singh 2020 a higher roughness value indicates more undulation which is common in hilly areas which results in greater surface runoff and less percolation and groundwater recharge curvature defines the rate at which a direction s slope grade or aspect changes curvature is a numerical indication of surface profile s nature that will be either convex or concave upward nair et al 2017 topographic curvature varied from 23 68 to 21 76 in the studied area the derived curvature values categorised as follows 23 68 to 1 40 1 40 to 0 69 0 69 to 0 15 0 15 to 0 55 and 0 55 to 21 76 the research area s curvature map is shown in fig 6b 99 area of the district came under the third subclass 0 69 to 0 15 of the curvature indicating that the rate of change in slope gradient is moderate in the research area higher weights are attributed for high curvature value and vice versa arulbalaji et al 2019 in a convex surface water tends to slow down and gather in a concave surface 3 2 delineation of groundwater potential zones consistency ratios for each thematic layer table 2 and subcategories of each thematic layer table 3 were calculated before the integration of thematic layers the results revealed that the judgement matrices utilised in the investigation were accurate cr 0 10 and had reasonable consistency the reclassified thematic layers are combined using the weighted overlay approach based on their respective weightage the potential groundwater zones were identified using two different approaches mif and ahp figs 7 and 8 the gwpz maps were classified into 3 groups poor moderate and high potentiality the demarcated gwpz map showed significant differences in the study area s groundwater potentiality the model s output reflects the influence of principal parameters such as geomorphology lulc and topographical features thapa et al 2017 in ahp technique south western region of the study area has high to moderate potential due to large number of water bodies and the northern part has moderate potential which might be due to presence of aravalli plains both uplands and aravalli plains have flat topography high porosity and permeability and higher groundwater recharge potential maity and manda 2017 allafta et al 2021 thapa et al 2017 zghibi et al 2020 it can be observed from the results of ahp that the central part has poor water potential due to the presence of sand dunes and settlements as sand dunes have undulating topography and less groundwater recharge mukherjee and singh 2020 and settlements have high runoff and less infiltration rao and briz kishore 1991 etikala et al 2019 zghibi et al 2020 the eastern part has low water potential due to the more coverage of area under fine textured soil since it has low infiltration poor drainage and high runoff bera et al 2020 in the ahp technique the poor gwpz covers 3842 km2 moderate gwpz covers 5364 km2 and high gwpz covers 1380 km2 of the study area fig 9 in mif the result revealed that the eastern region has high potential while western region has poor water potential fig 8 similar to ahp the results of mif showed that southern region has high potential due to presence of water bodies and upland areas and the northern part has moderate potential due to existence of aravalli plains as discussed earlier all three landforms have good groundwater recharge capacity the western part has poor potential which may be due to presence of sand dunes which have undulating topography and less recharge capacity mukherjee and singh 2020 in mif technique the poor gwpz covers 3731 km2 moderate gwpz covers 4667 km2 and high gwpz covers 2179 km2 area of the district fig 9 3 3 validation the generated gwpz map was cross validated against the depth of observation wells obtained from the cgwb report 2019 20 to ensure its accuracy for this purpose 115 dug wells and piezometers were evaluated across the district representing a wide range of geomorphic features land cover and topographical variance the well depths varied from 13 to 150 m despite the lack of a universal classification system well depth can be grouped certain classification systems based on site specific characteristics and groundwater level for example the well depths were divided into three categories by sarwar et al 2021 as very high potential 2 13 5 79 m high 5 79 10 36 m good 10 36 21 03 m and poor 21 03 32 0 m on the other hand pathmanandakumar et al 2021 classified well depths into five classes as very high groundwater potential 7 m high groundwater potential 7 10 m moderate groundwater potential 10 13 m low groundwater potential 13 17 m and very low groundwater potential 17 m a shallow well depth indicates a high groundwater potentiality whereas a deep well suggests a low groundwater potentiality pathmanandakumar et al 2021 bhattacharya et al 2021 in the present study well depths were divided into three categories on the basis of site specific conditions as high potential 13 20 m moderate potential 21 80 m and poor potential 81 150 m in certain regions of the croplands validation wells showed deeper depths whereas the ahp and mif approaches indicated those areas to have moderate to high capacity the disparity could be the result of long term groundwater over extraction for agricultural uses mukherjee and singh 2020 to undertake a comparison analysis and evaluate the model results the well depth data was overlay on the delimited gwpz map in the ahp technique 87 out of 115 wells were found to correspond with demarcated gwpz map while 80 wells were matched with mif technique in other words 76 and 70 wells accurately matched in ahp and mif respectively the accuracy of the model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristics roc plot which is a commonly used method for evaluating accuracy the relation of prediction precision and the area under curve auc can be divided into five categories bad 0 5 0 6 average 0 6 0 7 good 0 7 0 8 very good 0 8 0 9 and excellent 0 9 1 0 andualem and demeke 2019 pande et al 2021 the results of the roc plot revealed that the auc value was 79 for ahp and 76 for mif technique fig 10 which is considered a significant effect panahi et al 2020 mandal et al 2021 abijith et al 2020 applied ahp and mif technique to delineate gwpz in tamil nadu india and found ahp and mif techniques had 75 and 71 predictive precision respectively mukherjee and singh 2020 used ahp model to demarcate gwpz in semi arid region of east india and found good prediction accuracy of 71 5 pathmanandakumar et al 2021 applied ahp technique to generate groundwater map in kilinochchi sri lanka and found predictive precision of 81 8 mandal et al 2021 mapped the gwpz in rarh region of west bengal india and showed the auc value of 75 using mif technique dar et al 2020 used ahp to demarcate potential zone and found 79 69 auc indicating moderate to high prediction accuracy pande et al 2021 found 86 and 80 auc values for ahp and mif to demarcate the gwpz in maharastra india similarly numerous studies used ahp and mif techniques to define the groundwater potential zones and found fairly accurate results arulbalaji et al 2019 bera et al 2020 sarwar et al 2021 benjmel et al 2021 therefore the techniques followed in the present study can assumed moderate to high accurate and consistent in delineating potential zones 4 conclusions the present study emphasizes the delineation of gwpzs in semi arid regions of western rajasthan the aim of this research is to define the gwpz using two different approaches ahp and mif using remote sensing and geospatial techniques ten thematic layers such as geomorphology tpi soil texture dd curvature slope twi roughness lulc and rainfall were examined the ahp and mif generated map was divided into three potential zones poor moderate and high covering 3731 3842 4667 5364 and 1380 2179 km2 respectively in the study area the southwestern and northern regions have high to moderate potential while western and central regions have poor potential therefore western and central regions of district may soon face groundwater crisis roc plots were used to cross validate the gwpz maps against well depth data the validation results showed that the ahp has predictive precision of 79 while mif has 76 so we can conclude that ahp is more reliable compared to mif technique the generated gwpz maps might be beneficial to decision makers for long term planning and efficient management of groundwater for different sectors since agriculture land covers majority of area this study recommends the implementation of scientific management practices such as rainwater harvesting alternative cropping patterns and efficient irrigation methods like micro drip and sprinkler irrigation be implemented to enhance groundwater recharge in limited zones credit authorship contribution statement brijesh yadav methodology writing original draft writing review editing

1224,groundwater resources are alarmingly depleting due to over exploitation and significant climate changes over time therefore demarcation of groundwater potential zones is essential for addressing the needs of various industries in semi arid area depleting groundwater resources topography aquifer features and climatic factors make it necessary to demarcate ground water potential zones in semiarid region of rajasthan the analytical hierarchy process ahp geographic information system gis and multi influence factor mif were used to determine the groundwater potential zones gwpzs in the semi arid region of jaipur located in western rajasthan in present study ten influential factors were employed i e geomorphology land use land cover lulc drainage density rainfall topographic wetness index twi soil texture slope roughness topographic position index tpi and curvature in ahp technique the pairwise comparison matrix was generated and weightages were given to each thematic layer while for mif a proposed score for each layer was computed from the aggregate weight of major and minor effects the gwpz map generated by ahp technique was categorised into three parts high moderate and poor potential zones covering 13 50 7 and 36 3 of the district while the gwpz map produced with the mif technique was also divided into the same poor moderate and high categories encompassing 35 3 44 1 and 20 6 of the district respectively the results of ahp and mif techniques were then cross validated with well depth data obtained from cgwb report 2019 20 the receiver operating characteristics roc were plotted and the findings shows that the area under the curve auc was 79 and 76 for ahp and mif respectively which is considered as moderate to high in predictive precision the study would be helpful in locating drilling sites for groundwater exploration and developing sustainable groundwater and land use policies keywords groundwater potential zonation analytical hierarchy process multi

valuable natural water resource and vital component of all living beings it is among the most reliable source of useable water for household farming and industrial activities it is assumed that the groundwater is least likely to be contaminated than other water supplies like surface water yadav et al 2018 mandal et al 2021 prasad et al 2021 it meets around 38 of global irrigation water requirement shelar et al 2022 rane et al 2022 in india 60 of irrigated cropland and 85 of drinking water supply are reliant on groundwater doad et al 2022 xiong et al 2022 goala et al 2021 in arid and semiarid areas where people rely primarily on groundwater the situation is drastically worse surface water is scarce in these areas due to higher seasonal variability in rainfall pattern and rapid water return to the atmosphere due to higher evapotranspiration mukherjee and singh 2020 elbeltagi et al 2022 gupta et al 2021 intensive agriculture population growth rapid industrialization unscientific and faulty irrigation practices along the climate change situation has led to an increase in groundwater depletion rates in both our country and overseas bhattacharya et al 2021 according to the world bank if necessary measures are not taken india would be in a water deficit zone by 2025 and a water scarce zone by 2050 arulbalaji et al 2019 boretti and rosa 2019 as a result identifying groundwater potential zones with precise technology is important for long term sustainability in semi arid terrains in order to build a sustainable water resource system planning and monitoring rajesh et al 2021 exploration of groundwater is difficult and challenging as it is a hidden natural resource pande et al 2020 rajesh et al 2021 the most common and widely used methods for identifying borewell location and aquifer thickness are drilling experiments and stratigraphic investigations but these methods are costly and time consuming mukherjee and singh 2020 patra et al 2018 for determining groundwater potential zones combining remote sensing rs with geographical information systems gis has shown to be a time and effort saving approach etikala et al 2019 pande et al 2020 integration of rs and gis techniques for the preparation of different thematic layers such as slope drainage density distance to water channel geology lithology topographic wetness index roughness land use land cover patterns rainfall and soils etc has played a vital role in the demarcation of groundwater potential zones the ability to combine primary and secondary data sets is another important feature of rs and gis burrough 1986 pande et al 2020 furthermore several researchers have been used different rs and gis based techniques for deciphering groundwater potential zones table 1 groundwater potential zones have been mapped by several researchers using the ahp and mif methods the ahp technique was first proposed in the 1970s by prof thomas l saaty to normalise the assigned weights nithya et al 2019 decisions can be made using this method based on hierarchical structure judgments and accurate perception all of which have a significant influence on the final decision rather et al 2022 saaty 1994 the ahp technique is a basic and well structured decision making technique that is universally acknowledged in the multi influencing factors mif technique the interaction between different components is considered while calculating weightage it s also straightforward dependable efficient and well structured depleting groundwater resources topography aquifer features and climatic factors make it necessary to delineate ground water potential zones in a semiarid region therefore the current study was carried out in the jaipur district of rajasthan taking into account the significance of assessing groundwater potentiality using remote sensing gis ahp and mif techniques therefore the present study had following objectives i to characterize the vegetative soil climatic and terrain parameters and ii to delineate gwpz using ahp and mif along with geospatial techniques the research will be useful to planners legislators officials and especially local governments in minimising groundwater vulnerability in this region by proper utilisation and control measures 2 material and methods 2 1 study location the jaipur district is located in the east central portion of the rajasthan state and extends between 26 25 and 27 51 north latitude and 74 55 and 76 15 east longitude fig 1 it covers 11 061 km2 area accounting for around 3 23 of total geographical area of rajasthan the district is divided into 17 tehsils and 15 blocks for administrative purposes according to the census of 2011 jaipur district has a total population of 66 26 178 people with a rural population of 31 54 331 people and urban population of 34 71 847 people jaipur is located in the semi arid region of india bedi et al 2019 and received mean annual rainfall of 527 mm during the period 2001 to 2010 the average summer temperature is 35 to 45 c while the average winter temperature is 5 to 15 c soni et al 2018 the total annual evapotranspiration potential is 1744 7 mm cgwb 2017 2 2 thematic layer preparation groundwater occurrence is affected by several influencing factors such as lithology geomorphology topography lineament rainfall roughness drainage density soil type elevation land use land cover fractures and meteorological parameters of a location rahmati et al 2014 razandi et al 2015 benjmel et al 2021 gis based methodology was usedto demarcate the gwpz of the jaipur district ten thematic layers geomorphology rainfall roughness topographic wetness index twi soil land use land cover lulc slope topographic position index tpi drainage density and curvature have been explored and integrated in gis to delineate the gwpz in the present investigation the detailed methodology of this study is presented in the fig 2 geomorphological properties of a region aid in understanding the spatial distribution of different landforms along with topographic information related to groundwater subsurface movements mukherjee et al 2020 geomorphological features have been used as a key criterion for demarcating gwpz by many researchers gnanachandrasamy et al 2018 arulbalaji et al 2019 kanagaraj et al 2019 allafta et al 2021 the geomorphology map was collected from bhukosh geological survey of india https bhukosh gsi gov in firstly the map was imported in arcgis 10 8 then the study region was extracted using analysis tools extract clip the rate of percolation and infiltration into an aquifer is significantly controlled by the soil anbazhagan et al 2005 the size shape and arrangement of soil particles as well as corresponding pore system have a significant impact on water movement both vertically and laterally allafta et al 2021 the sand silt and clay content were downloaded from international soil reference and information centre soilgrids250m and resampled to 12 5 m the final soil texture map was generated in saga gis using soil texture classification tool soil texture classes were reclassified to soil texture groups sand sandy loam and loamy sand were reclassified as moderately to very coarsely textured soils whereas loam and silt were reclassified as medium textured soils and sandy clay and clay loam were reclassified as moderately fine textured soils land use land cover lulc has an impact on the availability and distribution of groundwater in a region scanlon et al 2005 built up lands often have a lower infiltration rate due to the presence of impervious and paved surfaces forests and agricultural lands on the other hand allow for more water infiltration as the vegetative cover can hold more water and enable infiltration into soil the highest infiltration rate is found in water bodies followed by forests agricultural urban areas and industrial land etikala et al 2019 allafta et al 2021 the lulc map was obtained from the icar indian national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nagpur rainfall is an important part of the hydrological cycle in a region since it provides water to surface water bodies and recharges groundwater through percolation rainfall data for the year 2020 was collected from indian meteorological department pai et al 2014 the data was converted to a raster layer in arcgis 10 8 using the multidimensional tools make netcdf raster layer tool the raster layer was then converted to points using the tools conversion tools from raster raster to point for generating the spatial distribution of rainfall these points were interpolated using inverse distance weighted idw arulbalaji and gurugnanam 2016 slope is an important component for groundwater recharge because it regulates surface runoff and water infiltration into the soil due to faster surface runoff and increased erosion a greater slope gives insufficient residence time for water infiltration ahmed ii and mansor 2018 yang et al 2019 as a result flat surfaces are responsible for very good recharge and steeper slopes indicate poor groundwater recharge a digital elevation model dem with a 12 5 m pixel size of advanced land observing satellite alos phased array type l band sar palsar was downloaded from the alaska satellite facility asf https search asf alaska edu the slope map was created in arcgis 10 8 using the spatial analyst tools surface slope tools the drainage density dd of a basin is a measure of its entire stream length to its total area strahler 1964 it is an inverse function of the permeability and an area with high dd is considered as poor groundwater recharge zone mageshkumar et al 2019 in contrast regions with less dd indicate high groundwater recharge yield and more occurrence of groundwater in the present study dd was calculated using different functions hydrology fill flow direction flow accumulation stream order stream to feature density line density in arcgis 10 8 arulbalaji and gurugnanam 2016 the roughness parameter is used to measure topographical undulation of a region riley et al 1999 higher undulation which is common in hilly rocky regions indicates more surface runoff with less groundwater recharge and infiltration in the present study roughness map was created from dem 12 5 m in arcgis 10 8 1 roughness fs mean fs min fs max fs min where fsmean is the mean focal statistics fsmin is the minimum focal statistics and fsmax is the maximum focal statistics the topographic wetness index twi is a secondary topographical parameter of a region s wetness conditions mukherjee and singh 2020 and commonly used to examine the influence of topography on hydrological processes sörensen et al 2006 this index indicates the predisposition of gravitational forces to move water downslope and the ability for water to fill in a catchment ghorbani nejad et al 2017 the following equation was used to calculate twi in arcgis 10 8 2 twi ln as tanβ where as is the area of the ascending slope and β is the gradient of the slope the topographic position index tpi is a commonly used index for determining slopes and different landforms mokarram et al 2015 tpi has a greater value when there is more surface runoff and less infiltration which indicates inadequate groundwater recharge positive tpi values represents higher elevations than the surroundings whereas negative tpi values represent lower elevations the tpi map was generated from a dem in this study using automated geoscientific analyses in saga gis choubin et al 2019 curvature measures the slope gradient positive and negative values indicate convex and concave surfaces respectively while zero indicates flatness vijith and dodge wan 2019 in arcgis 10 8 the curvature map was created using the tools spatial analyst tools surface curvature three thematic layers were divided based on their categories or formations geomorphology soil texture and lulc natural break classification was used in the gis environment to classify other thematic layers such as rainfall twi dd slope roughness tpi and curvature into five sub classes furthermore some investigations have categorised thematic layers with satisfactory model accuracy utilising natural break categorization jothibasu and anbazhagan 2016 arulbalaji et al 2019 mallick et al 2019 mukherjee and singh 2020 2 3 multi criteria decision analysis using analytical hierarchical process technique the most widely used and well known gis based method for demarcating groundwater potential zones is multi criteria decision analysis mcda using the analytical hierarchical process ahp technique to make an organised decision of priorities we need to make comparisons and a scale of numbers that shows how much more important one parameter in comparison to another in terms of the criterion being compared the ahp is a pairwise comparison assessment theory where parameters are compared with each other using the saaty s scale of relative importance parry et al 2018 mukherjee and singh 2020 morales and de vries 2021 2 4 weight assignment and weight normalization the weightages of thematic layers were determined using saaty s scale 1 9 table 2 with 1 indicating equal impact of the two layers and 9 indicating the greatest impact of one layer over another saaty 1980 thematic layers were given weights based on their importance rahmati et al 2015b allafta et al 2021 according to studies of related literature and specialist viewpoints different parameters have a significant influence on groundwater potentiality in the present study each thematic layers were assigned ranks based on the past literature naghibi et al 2015a mallick et al 2019 arshad et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 mukherjee and singh 2020 allafta et al 2021 geomorphology significantly affects the occurrence and flow of groundwater arulbalaji et al 2019 mukherjee and singh 2020 and as a result it was identified as first important parameter in comparison matrix it was placed in first column and first row based on the prior reviews we chose lulc as the second significant layer because lulc changes are among the most important human induced activities that affect the availability of groundwater resources patra et al 2018 all hydrological parameter i e dd rainfall and twi were selected as third important parameter in the hierarchy and assigned equal rank because rain is the primary source of groundwater recharge patra et al 2018 and twi reflects the spatial pattern of moisture benjmel et al 2021 pinthong et al 2022 the soil texture was chosen as the fourth element in the hierarchy because infiltration and percolation of water are significantly controlled by size and distribution of soil particles sarwar et al 2021 the infiltration of rainfall to the earth is strongly influenced by the slope pathmanandakumar et al 2021 and chosen as the fifth factor in the hierarchy roughness and tpi were selected as the sixth parameter in the hierarchy while curvature was allocated the lowest importance because it has the least impact on groundwater recharge mukherjee and singh 2020 as a result in a pair wise comparison matrix all thematic layers were compared to one another table 3 the sub classes of each thematic layer were ranked on a scale of 0 to 9 based on their relative influence on groundwater occurrence assigned ranks and weight of subclasses of each thematic layer were represented in table 4 2 5 consistency analysis the consistency ratio cr was used to validate the decision based on pair wise comparison of thematic layers and its sub classes saaty 1990 for computing the cr following equation was used 3 cr ci rci where rci is the random consistency index the values were derived from the saaty s standard table 5 ci is the consistency index which was computed using following equation 4 ci λmax n n 1 where n is the total of thematic layers employed in the study and λmax is the principal eigenvalue a cr value 0 10 is acceptable to undertake weighted overlay analysis using ahp if the cr is 0 10 the judgement must be revised to identify the cause of the inconsistency and fix it until the cr 0 10 is reached 2 6 multi criteria decision analysis using multi influencing factor technique the multi influencing factors mif technique is relies on the interdependence and interrelationship of several influencing variables pande et al 2020 the mif technique was used in this study to assign weightage to each thematic layer depending on its significance the interdependence and interrelation of influencing thematic layers to delineate the groundwater potential zones is depicted in fig 3 every relationship in the diagram divided into major and minor impact and their strength is weighted accordingly if there was a major effect a score of 1 0 was given indicating a strong relation between variables in contrast a score of 0 5 was assigned if a minor effect existed indicating weak correlations between components finally proposed score of each thematic layer was computed using the eq 5 and it is presented in table 6 5 proposed score w i x y σ x y 100 where x represents major effect y is the minor effect and wiis the individual parameter weight the weights of sub classes of each layer were computed using the proposed score for that layer the first sub class ci1 was given the same weight as the concerned layer wi the wi value was then divided by the sum of subclasses in the layer and the resulting value pi was deducted from ci1 and assigned to the second sub class mandal et al 2021 for third sub class ci3 pi was subtracted from ci2 and this weight assignment methodwas repeated for the subsequent sub classes table 7 in other words to assign weight to each sub class the following equation was used 6 ci 2 ci 1 pi 7 pi wi n where wi is each thematic layer s proposed score weight and n represents the total number of sub classes in each thematic layer 2 7 overlay analysis and groundwater potential zone map the gwpz map can be generated by stacking all the layers in arcgis 10 8 using the weighted overlay method once weights have been given to thematic layers and their sub classes zghibi et al 2020 mukherjee and singh 2020 8 gwpz i 1 n wi ri where gwpz stands for groundwater potential zone wi represents the weight of each thematic layer and ri represents rank of each thematic layer s sub classes finally gwpzs were classified as poor moderate and good in terms of potentiality 2 8 validation validation is regarded as a significant modelling procedure in terms of scientific significance the well depth data received from the central ground water board s reports cgwb 2020 for the jaipur region was used to validate the gwpz map many researchers validated the produced gwpzs with secondary sources razandi et al 2015 arulbalaji et al 2019 mukherjee and singh 2020 allafta et al 2021 dar et al 2020 the receiver operator characteristics roc curve is used to validate the gwpz the roc curve was created by plotting the true positive rates sensitivity on y axis and false positive rates 1 specificity on x axis pourghasemi et al 2013 the area under the curve auc was estimated from the roc curve and its values ranges from 0 5 to 1 the auc value closer to 1 implies great model performance whereas value near to 0 5 indicates poor prediction accuracy panahi et al 2020 mandal et al 2021 phong et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of factors influencing groundwater potentiality the geomorphology of a region represents landform types including descriptions and physical processes and influence groundwater potential directly or indirectly kordestani et al 2019 the geomorphological features of the study area were classified into eight groups such as hilly terrain dissected hills and pediments pediments upland aravalli plains aeo fluvial plains sandy arid plains and river valley fig 4a aeo fluvial plains cover a largest area 41 8 followed by an upland 23 4 hilly terrain 14 3 and aravalli plains 11 1 the aeo fluvial plains and uplands are mostly found in the region s middle and lower reaches dissected hills and pediments pediments and river valleys accounted for 3 2 2 8 and 1 8 of the overall geographical area respectively the sandy arid plains cover the lowest area 0 1 the areas near water bodies and river valley generally have good groundwater potentiality because of high infiltration rate of loose alluvial soil and were given a higher rank maity and manda 2017 similarly the potential of groundwater is generally high in aravalli plains and uplands zones due to higher infiltration rate whereas the potential is lower in the hilly terrain and dissected hills due to high elevation and runoff mukherjee and singh 2020 pediments are slant areas that form between hills and plains having medium groundwater potentiality rajaveni et al 2015 due to aridity the gw potentiality of aeofluvial plains with sand dunes and sandy arid zones is limited therefore they were given a lower rank saravanan et al 2021 lulc is a significant factor that determines region s groundwater potential through runoff infiltration rate recharge and evapotranspiration bhattacharya et al 2021 the research area s lulc map represents kharif rabi zaid crops 65 0 current fallow land 13 5 land with shrub scrub 8 7 forest shrub scrub degraded 3 4 other wastelands 2 9 built up urban rural 2 1 deciduous forest 2 0 water bodies 1 6 and gullied ravines 0 7 is depicted in fig 4b water bodies woodlands and agricultural fields are suitable for water cycle however built up areas gullies and wasteland have low groundwater potential as explained in the section 2 2 hence water bodies forest and agricultural lands were given larger weights whereas the built up urban rural other wastelands and gullied ravines were given lower weights the dd of an area is mostly determined by the dynamic depiction of geology and geomorphology slope angle and length landforms rainfall percolation rate and vegetation type magesh et al 2012 acharya and nag 2013 dd is inversely proportional to the drainage basin s permeability the dd was divided into five subgroups such as very low 0 38 0 90 km 1 low 0 90 1 41 km 1 medium 1 41 1 93 km 1 high 1 93 2 45 km 1 and very high 2 45 2 97 km 1 as illustrated in fig 4c the study area mostly observed high 37 1 to very high 44 1 dd with poor infiltration rate and peripheral part of the area experienced very low to medium dd the very high dd was observed in the district s south west part areas with high dd indicate more runoff less water infiltration and less groundwater recharge whereas the lower dd indicates the converse is true zghibi et al 2020 therefore the study assigned lower weights to areas with high dd and vice versa the rainfall is the most important component of hydrological cycle and a significant determinant of groundwater recharge in an area the rainfall data from 2020 is used throughout the investigation which is mainly received from south western monsoon and the interpolation technique was used to create a rainfall spatial distribution map as depicted in fig 4d the study area received high precipitation in south eastern part and less precipitation in the northern and western part the rainfall of study area has been categorised into five groups based on minimum and maximum values namely very low 473 49 629 45 mm low 629 45 698 31 mm moderate 698 31 769 20 mm high 769 20 846 17 mm and very high 846 17 989 97 mm rainfall and occupying approximately 3 18 41 32 and 6 of the total geographical area respectively the possibility of groundwater occurrence will be high if the rainfall and duration are high sutradhar et al 2021 mukherjee and singh 2020 therefore higher rainfall sub classes were allotted higher weights whereas the lower rainfall sub classes were getting lower weights soil texture influences groundwater recharge by regulating the infiltration and percolation of surface water into aquifers through porosity pore size distribution soil aggregation and consistency lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 the study area is mainly comprised of moderately to very coarse textured soil 14 4 medium textured 42 2 and moderately fine textured soil 43 4 as presented in fig 5a eastern part of the study area occupied mostly moderately to very coarse textured soil and northern and southern parts have medium textured soils in the present study moderately to very coarse textured soils assigned higher weight than other soils because these soils have high infiltration rate and less runoff which results better recharge of groundwater brouwer et al 1988 owuor et al 2016 allafta et al 2021 conversely fine textured soils assigned lower weight because the infiltration and percolation capability in finer soil is limited slope refers to native and regional relief that incorporates an important impact on groundwater movement and recharge into aquifer gupta and srivastava 2010 the steepness of the slope of a place strongly influences potential of groundwater availability ghosh et al 2020 guru et al 2017 murmu et al 2019 magesh et al 2012 murmu et al 2019 thus it s an important element for groundwater recharge according to the natural break approach the study area s slope was divided into five classes it varies from 0 to 72 97 fig 5b and almost 97 area of the district falls under the slope class of 2 57 which is nearly flat and has a high weightage for groundwater speculation slope of the remaining 3 area of the district ranged from 2 57 to 72 97 and this area covered the northern to north eastern part of the district the steep and very steep classes were given lower weights while the moderate to flat slope class was received a high score due to large possibility for groundwater recharge acharya and nag 2013 naghibi et al 2015b nithya et al 2019 bhattacharya et al 2021 selvam et al 2014 the twi is a secondary topographical feature of a region s wetness conditions which is commonly used to investigate the impact of topography influence on hydrological processes this index reflects the proclivity of gravitational forces to move water downslope and the propensity for water to accumulate in a watershed ghorbani nejad et al 2017 rinderer et al 2014 the district s twi values ranged from 1 46 to 25 94 as shown in fig 5c the values were divided into five categories 1 46 7 12 7 12 9 71 9 71 11 92 11 92 14 99 and 14 99 25 94 nearly 47 area of the district came under the first subclass of twi 1 46 7 12 and only 2 area came under fifth subclass 14 99 25 94 and remaining area shared between other classes the greater twi value indicates possible groundwater infiltration and recharge as a result of topographic impacts as a result higher twi classes were given more weight and vice versa mukherjee and singh 2020 benjmel et al 2021 the tpi is a commonly used technique for categorizing landforms and determining topographic slopes mokarram et al 2015 the tpis of the district ranged between 12 87 to 12 00 the thematic layer of tpi was reclassified into five classes such as 12 87 to 0 583 0 583 to 0 291 0 291 to 0 096 0 096 to 0 294 and 0 0294 to 12 00 as shown in fig 5d the reclassification of the tpi was done by natural break method this index has a greater value when there is more surface runoff and less infiltration resulting in poor groundwater recharge low tpi values were attributed to greater weight and vice versa mukherjee and singh 2020 the roughness index in respect to digital elevation model describes the amount of elevation change between consecutive cells arulbalaji et al 2019 another key variable for predicting a region s groundwater potential is terrain heterogeneity which is quantified using roughness riley et al 1999 fig 6a illustrates the roughness map of the study area and the roughness of the research region ranged from 0 11 to 0 88 the roughness values were divided into five groups 0 11 0 25 0 25 0 40 0 40 0 53 0 53 0 71 and 0 71 0 88 the rougher the surface the higher the undulation and vice versa a total of 99 area of the district came under the first subclass of roughness it means almost whole district have very less topographic variations for low roughness values higher weights are assigned and vice versa mukherjee and singh 2020 a higher roughness value indicates more undulation which is common in hilly areas which results in greater surface runoff and less percolation and groundwater recharge curvature defines the rate at which a direction s slope grade or aspect changes curvature is a numerical indication of surface profile s nature that will be either convex or concave upward nair et al 2017 topographic curvature varied from 23 68 to 21 76 in the studied area the derived curvature values categorised as follows 23 68 to 1 40 1 40 to 0 69 0 69 to 0 15 0 15 to 0 55 and 0 55 to 21 76 the research area s curvature map is shown in fig 6b 99 area of the district came under the third subclass 0 69 to 0 15 of the curvature indicating that the rate of change in slope gradient is moderate in the research area higher weights are attributed for high curvature value and vice versa arulbalaji et al 2019 in a convex surface water tends to slow down and gather in a concave surface 3 2 delineation of groundwater potential zones consistency ratios for each thematic layer table 2 and subcategories of each thematic layer table 3 were calculated before the integration of thematic layers the results revealed that the judgement matrices utilised in the investigation were accurate cr 0 10 and had reasonable consistency the reclassified thematic layers are combined using the weighted overlay approach based on their respective weightage the potential groundwater zones were identified using two different approaches mif and ahp figs 7 and 8 the gwpz maps were classified into 3 groups poor moderate and high potentiality the demarcated gwpz map showed significant differences in the study area s groundwater potentiality the model s output reflects the influence of principal parameters such as geomorphology lulc and topographical features thapa et al 2017 in ahp technique south western region of the study area has high to moderate potential due to large number of water bodies and the northern part has moderate potential which might be due to presence of aravalli plains both uplands and aravalli plains have flat topography high porosity and permeability and higher groundwater recharge potential maity and manda 2017 allafta et al 2021 thapa et al 2017 zghibi et al 2020 it can be observed from the results of ahp that the central part has poor water potential due to the presence of sand dunes and settlements as sand dunes have undulating topography and less groundwater recharge mukherjee and singh 2020 and settlements have high runoff and less infiltration rao and briz kishore 1991 etikala et al 2019 zghibi et al 2020 the eastern part has low water potential due to the more coverage of area under fine textured soil since it has low infiltration poor drainage and high runoff bera et al 2020 in the ahp technique the poor gwpz covers 3842 km2 moderate gwpz covers 5364 km2 and high gwpz covers 1380 km2 of the study area fig 9 in mif the result revealed that the eastern region has high potential while western region has poor water potential fig 8 similar to ahp the results of mif showed that southern region has high potential due to presence of water bodies and upland areas and the northern part has moderate potential due to existence of aravalli plains as discussed earlier all three landforms have good groundwater recharge capacity the western part has poor potential which may be due to presence of sand dunes which have undulating topography and less recharge capacity mukherjee and singh 2020 in mif technique the poor gwpz covers 3731 km2 moderate gwpz covers 4667 km2 and high gwpz covers 2179 km2 area of the district fig 9 3 3 validation the generated gwpz map was cross validated against the depth of observation wells obtained from the cgwb report 2019 20 to ensure its accuracy for this purpose 115 dug wells and piezometers were evaluated across the district representing a wide range of geomorphic features land cover and topographical variance the well depths varied from 13 to 150 m despite the lack of a universal classification system well depth can be grouped certain classification systems based on site specific characteristics and groundwater level for example the well depths were divided into three categories by sarwar et al 2021 as very high potential 2 13 5 79 m high 5 79 10 36 m good 10 36 21 03 m and poor 21 03 32 0 m on the other hand pathmanandakumar et al 2021 classified well depths into five classes as very high groundwater potential 7 m high groundwater potential 7 10 m moderate groundwater potential 10 13 m low groundwater potential 13 17 m and very low groundwater potential 17 m a shallow well depth indicates a high groundwater potentiality whereas a deep well suggests a low groundwater potentiality pathmanandakumar et al 2021 bhattacharya et al 2021 in the present study well depths were divided into three categories on the basis of site specific conditions as high potential 13 20 m moderate potential 21 80 m and poor potential 81 150 m in certain regions of the croplands validation wells showed deeper depths whereas the ahp and mif approaches indicated those areas to have moderate to high capacity the disparity could be the result of long term groundwater over extraction for agricultural uses mukherjee and singh 2020 to undertake a comparison analysis and evaluate the model results the well depth data was overlay on the delimited gwpz map in the ahp technique 87 out of 115 wells were found to correspond with demarcated gwpz map while 80 wells were matched with mif technique in other words 76 and 70 wells accurately matched in ahp and mif respectively the accuracy of the model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristics roc plot which is a commonly used method for evaluating accuracy the relation of prediction precision and the area under curve auc can be divided into five categories bad 0 5 0 6 average 0 6 0 7 good 0 7 0 8 very good 0 8 0 9 and excellent 0 9 1 0 andualem and demeke 2019 pande et al 2021 the results of the roc plot revealed that the auc value was 79 for ahp and 76 for mif technique fig 10 which is considered a significant effect panahi et al 2020 mandal et al 2021 abijith et al 2020 applied ahp and mif technique to delineate gwpz in tamil nadu india and found ahp and mif techniques had 75 and 71 predictive precision respectively mukherjee and singh 2020 used ahp model to demarcate gwpz in semi arid region of east india and found good prediction accuracy of 71 5 pathmanandakumar et al 2021 applied ahp technique to generate groundwater map in kilinochchi sri lanka and found predictive precision of 81 8 mandal et al 2021 mapped the gwpz in rarh region of west bengal india and showed the auc value of 75 using mif technique dar et al 2020 used ahp to demarcate potential zone and found 79 69 auc indicating moderate to high prediction accuracy pande et al 2021 found 86 and 80 auc values for ahp and mif to demarcate the gwpz in maharastra india similarly numerous studies used ahp and mif techniques to define the groundwater potential zones and found fairly accurate results arulbalaji et al 2019 bera et al 2020 sarwar et al 2021 benjmel et al 2021 therefore the techniques followed in the present study can assumed moderate to high accurate and consistent in delineating potential zones 4 conclusions the present study emphasizes the delineation of gwpzs in semi arid regions of western rajasthan the aim of this research is to define the gwpz using two different approaches ahp and mif using remote sensing and geospatial techniques ten thematic layers such as geomorphology tpi soil texture dd curvature slope twi roughness lulc and rainfall were examined the ahp and mif generated map was divided into three potential zones poor moderate and high covering 3731 3842 4667 5364 and 1380 2179 km2 respectively in the study area the southwestern and northern regions have high to moderate potential while western and central regions have poor potential therefore western and central regions of district may soon face groundwater crisis roc plots were used to cross validate the gwpz maps against well depth data the validation results showed that the ahp has predictive precision of 79 while mif has 76 so we can conclude that ahp is more reliable compared to mif technique the generated gwpz maps might be beneficial to decision makers for long term planning and efficient management of groundwater for different sectors since agriculture land covers majority of area this study recommends the implementation of scientific management practices such as rainwater harvesting alternative cropping patterns and efficient irrigation methods like micro drip and sprinkler irrigation be implemented to enhance groundwater recharge in limited zones credit authorship contribution statement brijesh yadav methodology writing original draft writing review editing
