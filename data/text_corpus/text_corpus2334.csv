groundwater is a vital resource that provides 30 of the global fresh water requirement and more than two billion people worldwide depend on groundwater as the primary source of drinking water ajami 2020 it is a crucial part of the hydrologic cycle necessary for sustaining streams wetlands lakes and aquatic communities alley et al 2002 on a global scale the quality of groundwater resources is under threat owing to the exposure to a wide spectrum of contaminants originating from urbanization increased agricultural production and changing patterns of land use rodak et al 2014 the pollutants may be of anthropogenic or natural origin and can comprise of organic and inorganic materials microorganisms heavy metals or pharmaceuticals these pollutants affect public health as well as ecosystems stefanakis et al 2015 the conventional technology commonly employed for the remediation of contaminated groundwater is the pump and treat method however the clean up goals are barely achieved by this method notably several studies have focused on the development of innovative and effective groundwater remediation methods faisal et al 2018 henderson and demond 2007 sathya and elango 2018 permeable reactive barriers prbs are a passive and sustainable technology that provides an alternative in situ approach to supplement or replace other existing techniques blowes et al 2000 faisal et al 2018 according to the united states environmental protection agency u s epa 2002 prbs are one of the pioneering technologies for the in situ remediation of migrating contaminant plumes in groundwater in this method reactive materials within the barrier are selected to facilitate the geochemical reactions that remove the contaminants present in groundwater under ideal conditions these materials are adequately reactive to treat water over the long term from years to decades blowes et al 2000 previous studies developed prbs and demonstrated their effectiveness in removing heavy metals asokbunyarat et al 2017 ludwig et al 2002 statham et al 2016 radioactive isotopes de pourcq et al 2015 torres et al 2017 chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons lai et al 2006 muchitsch et al 2011 and several organic and inorganic pollutants simon and meggyes 2000 sun et al 2017 in general a prb must be sufficiently reactive to trap or degrade the contaminant and permeable enough to allow the groundwater to flow through the reactive material further properties such as low maintenance easy availability accessibility and low cost are desirable for prb materials de pourcq et al 2015 the barrier must be more permeable than an aquifer so that it does not block the ambient groundwater flow during the treatment of the contaminant the primary removal mechanisms include sorption precipitation chemical reactions and reactions with biological mechanisms these mechanisms combine passive chemical and or biological treatments and the treated water exits the prb on the downstream side speight 2020 therefore contaminated groundwater need not be extracted to the surface for treatment in summary prbs offer an in situ low cost and environment friendly remediation strategy for a wide range of contaminants the aims of this study are to 1 discuss the fundamentals of prb installation for groundwater remediation 2 illustrate the different prb designs and explain their effects on degradation performance 3 compare conventional and non conventional reactive media used in prb remediation in terms of their mechanisms and 4 provide optimization guidelines for prb remediation concerning longevity and cost effectiveness more specifically this review aims to critically summarize the factors that affect the design and installation of prb systems for providing an effective durable economic and practical remediation method in section 2 we discuss the field site selection criteria along with the prb modelling process in section 3 we present different prb designs in section 4 we list and compare conventional and non conventional reactive materials that can be used in prb systems for different types of contaminants finally in section 5 we highlight the importance of the optimization for existing prb systems from the economical effectiveness and durability perspectives 2 fundamentals of prbs installation the first step in prb based groundwater remediation is generally the selection of the site containing the contaminated groundwater based on contaminant analysis the prb can be installed in the most contaminated zone and a solute transport model should be built a suitable design of the prb should be selected to ensure the maximum removal percentage in highly contaminated areas finally a performance evaluation is necessary to verify if the process requires the use of a single prb or multiple prbs singh et al 2019 2020 2 1 selection of prbs field site field site selection is crucial for groundwater remediation considering the difficulty in prb installation owing to the heterogeneity of the aquifer and the sub surface thorough site characterization is necessary before prb installation to ensure efficient and persistent contaminant removal thakur et al 2020 the site characteristics include aquifer properties geotechnical and topographic factors hydrogeological characteristics and site geochemistry aquifer characteristics include the groundwater depth flow velocity lateral and vertical gradients and the depth thickness and continuity of the aquitard along with the hydraulic conductivity and porosity of the underground layers and the plume size and distribution geotechnical and topographic factors include underground and aboveground obstacles that hinder the installation of a prb to ensure a careful examination of the location hydrogeological characteristics include shear strength and cohesion properties for sands silts and clay degree of wetness or dryness of materials grain sizes of different layers at the site and densities of different materials site geochemistry includes the level of unwanted electron acceptors such as species of dissolved oxygen nitrate and bioavailable iron these species can reduce the possibility of effective and complete anaerobic degradation using prbs based on biological processes thus the location cost efficiency dimensions and design of the prb system can be determined based on these characteristics gavaskar et al 2000 thakur et al 2020 2 2 modelling of prbs systems generally numerical modelling is performed to aid in prb design modelling can provide a complete picture of the travel paths and flow volume of the groundwater thus establishing a suitable design with sufficient safety margin and without increasing the design cost scott and folkes 2000 in prb modelling the following three aspects are considered 1 hydrogeology for groundwater flow 2 geochemistry for chemical reactions and 3 economy for construction and operational costs modelling can be achieved through a single combined model or coupled independent models more specifically prb simulation models require the following features 1 three dimensional 3d hydrogeologic models however for sites that do not have significant vertical flow and fully penetrating prbs two dimensional 2d models can be more efficient the model should be capable of handling complexities such as site heterogeneities tunnels and streams as well as large contrasts in the hydraulic conductivity at the funnel walls 2 geochemical model that considers important chemical reactions and solute transport processes including those with heavy metals along with simultaneous reactions 3 economic model to calculate prb construction and operational costs for the selected design taking into consideration complexities such as piece wise functions for construction techniques painter 2005 the variations in the spatio temporal groundwater quality porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the reactive granular media can be predicted through the complete computational approach while considering chemical and biological clogging in a prb for the 3d movement of groundwater and when the density in porous earthen media is constant the modular finite difference flow model modflow can be used as explained in eq 1 medawela and indraratna 2020 1 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z q s s h t where kxx kyy kzz hydraulic conductivity values along the x y and z axes respectively h hydraulic head q volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources q 0 and or sinks q 0 s s specific storage of the porous material t time generally in the saturated zone of an aquifer the transport of dissolved contaminants near and across a prb is often dominated by advection and dispersion for a porous medium having a uniform porosity distribution the mass transport equation can be effective bear 1979 bortone et al 2013 the general macroscopic equation that describes the transport and the fate of aqueous species in multi dimensional saturated porous media can be expressed as follows medawela and indraratna 2020 2 c t x i d i j c x i x i v i c q ϕ c s r k where c concentration of the pollutant dissolved in groundwater x i distance along the respective coordinate axis d ij hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor ѵ i seepage or linear pore water velocity q volumetric flux of water per unit volume of aquifer at concentration cs added from an external source φ soil porosity r k reaction term for removal or generation of pollutant in the aqueous phase the hydrodynamic dispersion d ij is a second rank tensor defined as a sum of the mechanical dispersion tensor d hij and the molecular diffusion coefficient d m bortone et al 2013 the second term on the right side of eq 2 is the advection term bortone et al 2013 the linear pore water velocity can be expressed as follows zheng and wang 1999 3 v i k i ϕ h x i where k i principal component of the hydraulic conductivity tensor h hydraulic head determined using eq 1 the third term with q 0 considers the possible external sources of contaminated water at concentration c s injected into the domain for q 0 it is considered to be a sink term where contaminant mass is removed from the domain typically in this case c s c the last term on the right side of eq 2 describes the reactions involved in the transport of a dissolved contaminant in a prb where adsorption generally occurs the chemical reaction is represented by adsorption expressed as follows bortone et al 2013 4 r k ρ b ϕ ω t k c a c c ω where ω pollutant concentration on solid ρ b and φ the dry bulk density and porosity of the adsorbing material respectively c c ω is the liquid pollutant concentration at thermodynamic equilibrium with adsorbing solid where c is derived from the adsorption isotherm and defines the mass transfer driving force in the transport model equation a specific surface area of the adsorbent k c global mass transfer coefficient generally groundwater flow and transport modelling are dominated by numerical methods such as those implemented in modflow developed by the united states geological survey for 3d flow modeling mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and mt3dms which is a 3d multi species transport model zheng and wang 1999 modflow and mt3dms can be combined using pre processing and post processing software graphical user interfaces to facilitate the model application and analysis for complex 3d problems konikow 2010 these tools are based on finite difference techniques such as explicit implicit and crank nicolson methods and can be utilized to simulate prb performance singh et al 2020 notably groundwater bioremediation modelling has been reported in the literature in several previous studies mohamed et al 2007 2010a 2010b mohamed and hatfield 2005 2011 initially the flow problem was solved in terms of the hydraulic head to subsequently determine the flow velocities and solve the reaction transport model modflow is capable of calculating the seepage velocity and hydraulic head which can then be used in rt3d finite difference model to solve the general macroscopic eq 2 to calculate the chemical species concentrations at a particular time step however species concentration may impact hydraulic conductivity and thus feed back into the flow equation in the hybrid modlfow rt3d model after determining the hydraulic conductivity and porosity for the 1st time step the software is not capable of automatically updating the values in each time step as a result an array of time varied hydraulic conductivity and porosity can be introduced as input into the simulation as shown in eqs 5 7 medawela and indraratna 2020 5 ϕ t ϕ o δ ϕ t 6 δ ϕ t x s ρ c σ k 1 n m m k r k t 7 k k o ϕ o δ ϕ t ϕ o 3 1 ϕ o δ ϕ t 1 ϕ o 2 where φ o φ t and δφ t initial porosity

facilitates the assessment of long term performance additionally it may simulate the system behaviour under different scenarios by changing different factors such as the configuration and orientation of the prb barrier location and contaminant properties singh et al 2020 by simulating different widths of a continuous reactive barrier gate or funnel one can evaluate the trade offs of different parameters in the prb design gavaskar et al 2000 notably the model can evaluate the potential for the overflow underflow or flow across aquifers while considering the impacts of fluctuations in the flow velocity and direction of groundwater into the design moreover the model can improve the process of selecting the media by specifying the reactive medium s hydraulic conductivity and particle size with respect to the aquifer s hydraulic conductivity furthermore the model can be used to plan the location of the monitoring wells and the monitoring frequencies gupta and fox 1999 chung et al 2011 utilized modflow to optimize prb location and predict its performance using 3d groundwater flow simulation the groundwater head and the concentration distribution model for the contaminants were developed xu et al 2012 developed a modified modflow mt3dms system that was capable of simulating a 3d aquifer contaminated by perchloroethylene and its daughters the results demonstrated that the modified modflow mt3dms can effectively simulate multi species mother daughter chain kinetic reactions with multiple prbs being more preferable that single prbs singh et al 2019 used modflow followed by mt3dms to assess the feasibility of a prb for remediating a target aquifer they investigated two factors for virtual prb modelling 1 the selection of a suitable prb design and 2 the analysis of the variations in the hydraulic conductivity ratio of different aquifers along with different barriers along with the removal efficiency of the virtual prb system with time rad and fazlali 2020 used modflow for the quantitative analysis of groundwater flow and mt3dms for the qualitative analysis of groundwater contamination the optimum location and dimensions of the prb were determined by applying the model they also applied the groundwater modelling system gms software as a graphical interface to optimize the prb dimensions and the remediation location for groundwater contaminated by landfill pollution zhao et al 2018 used the cxtfit 2 1 software to obtain the transport parameters through the non linear fitting of transport models to the experimental data they used the one dimensional 1d advection dispersion equation to simulate the kcl breakthrough processes and then calculated the prb lifetime as shown in eqs 8 and 9 notably for the 1d equation without sources sinks and where the reaction consisted of instantaneous sorption eq 8 was considered to be similar to eq 2 expressed by the retardation factor r as follows 8 r c t d 2 c x 2 v c x 9 t l 120 q m 1 ϕ ƞ ρ l c

associated with the darcian flow velocity obiri nyarko et al 2015 used geochemical modelling to estimate the removal of lead heavy metals using a prb consisting of zeolite as a reactive material the phreeqc ph ph re redox eq equilibrium and c program written in c program was used to model the 1d transport of lead and good agreement was found between the experimental data and numerical simulations the phreeqc model can be used to achieve the design and management objectives beak and wilkin 2009 used geochemical modelling a valuable tool that can portray the contrast in the ph dependence for both as iii and as v precipitation at moderate alkaline ph conditions as iii is unlikely to be precipitated as an oxide or sulphide phase and the increase in ph can result in the precipitation of metal arsenates including ferrous arsenate jeen 2017 used geochemical data to clarify the associated reaction with the reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing minerals that may be the source of arsenic release in sediments the study demonstrated that the associated reactions with the reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing minerals can be realized through reactive transport modelling based on the site s geochemical data these reactions may be the potential sources of arsenic release in the sediment in certain conditions in contrast to the numerical approaches klammler and hatfield 2008a derived a 2 d analytical solution to determine the flow fields toward the rectangular prbs having a continuous wall configuration with and without impermeable side walls their approach was based on the conformal mapping technique and assumed that the aquifer was homogeneous with a uniform ambient flow field klammler and hatfield 2009 also considered the classic funnel and gate configuration with perpendicular funnel arms and prbs having velocity equalization walls they proposed an efficient analytical approach to estimate the reactor conductivity and capture the flow by monitoring the hydraulic loss at the reactor the approach was also used to investigate flow by pass problems due to the lateral exit of significant ambient flow components from the prb which may result in incomplete contaminant treatment to avoid the by pass for different prb types the maximum permissible deviations for ambient groundwater flow direction were defined klammler and hatfield 2008b in addition the analytical solution can be used for prb hydraulics in heterogeneous conditions this can be achieved by 1 assuming that the aquifer is effectively homogeneous and 2 incorporating the effects of aquifer heterogeneity on plume spreading using an effective transverse macro dispersion coefficient klammler et al 2014 the analytical solutions have been applied to several prb studies in the literature and provide insights into the hydraulic behaviour of prbs which is not evident from complex numerical approaches the results were used for practitioner friendly applications based on the dimensionless charts of captured widths klammler et al 2010 3 prbs design according to gavaskar et al 2000 the design of a prb system includes successive steps that consider preliminary technical and economic evaluations barrier site characterization reactive media selection treatability studies batch and column tests engineering design selection of construction methods preparation of monitoring plans and economic analysis he et al 2019 indicated that during the design and installation of prbs many factors needed to be considered 1 the prb permeability should be 2 10 times or more the aquifer permeability for obtaining the best results considering that the permeability of the prb reactive material may decrease with time owing to many limiting factors as shown in previous equations 2 the thickness of the reactive barrier should be sufficient depending on the contaminants present in the water groundwater flow rate and degradation rate of pollutants among other factors although thick prbs are required to achieve a high removal rate they increase the construction costs 3 the portion of the reactive material consumed over time should be considered in a good design 4 the removal of other materials such as sediments by flushing with water or air should be considered for the pipeline design 5 finally the reactive barrier system and materials should be monitored inspected and updated through openings such as monitoring wells the two most commonly used configurations in prb designs are the continuous trench slurry type fig 1 a and the funnel and gate fig 1b configurations in the former configuration a single and sufficiently permeable reactive zone is installed across a contaminant plume that allows water to pass through the barrier under its natural hydraulic gradient striegel et al 2001 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 the continuous trench is preferable in most types of soils at depths of 5 30 m thakur et al 2020 owing to its simple design and high cost effectiveness compared with the funnel and gate configuration it is widely used in developing countries offers convenient installation causes less interference to ambient groundwater flow and is applicable in a wide variety of hydrological and geological conditions he et al 2019 thakur et al 2020 however this arrangement has some limitations especially when undesired and buried materials are present thakur et al 2020 the effectiveness of this configuration has been previously documented hocking and wells 2002 mountjoy et al 2003 wilkin et al 2014 the funnel and gate design fig 1b consists of a reactive permeable gate between two impermeable walls that direct the contaminant plume into the reactive zone for treatment thus it primarily comprises of an impermeable funnel a highly permeable gate and an active material to hinder the pollutant and capture the remediated water exiting from the downstream side the impermeable funnel acts as a cut off barrier that directs the groundwater flow into the reactor gate where treatment occurs through the reactive medium he et al 2019 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 notably to achieve remediation at the least cost the ratio of the funnel area to the gate area must be balanced plumes containing a mixture of contaminants can be funnelled through a gate with multiple reactive walls arranged in series striegel et al 2001 the barrier length must be more than the lateral extent of the plume and the plume must be passively directed toward the reactive gate under the natural gradient the geometric arrangement of the funnel wall could be a straight line with the gate or other arrangements depending on the site conditions speight 2020 thakur et al 2020 this configuration offers better control better homogeneity of contaminant concentration for non uniform contaminant distribution sufficient residence times for wide plumes and high groundwater velocity speight 2020 sequential prbs are another type of configuration which may comprise of an iron filled barrier and a bio barrier which may be suitably employed for removing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah thakur et al 2020 they are installed at locations that are known to contain several groundwater contaminants for example at gas works sites phillips 2009 this type of prb employs multiple reactive materials in more than one reactive zone to remediate the contaminated groundwater bastiaens et al 2005 choi et al 2007 considered removing 2 4 6 trichlorophenol on a lab scale using a sequential prb the first chemical reactor contained palladium coated iron and the second bioreactor contained anaerobic microbe seeded sand jun et al 2009 reported that a sequenced prb system could remediate landfill leachate polluted groundwater effectively in their study zero valent iron zvi and a mixture of zeolites and zvi constituted the first section of the two reactors whereas the second section comprised of oxygen releasing compounds furthermore statham et al 2016 assessed the appropriateness of the prb media sequence to remediate sites contaminated by both hydrocarbons and heavy metals puls 2006 reported that the construction methods based on prbs have expanded from the original funnel and gate design involving the typical excavation equipment to include several other equipment such as continuous deep trenching machines vertical hydraulic fracturing deep soil mixing vibrated beams jetting and bioslurry methods nowadays excavation by biodegradable slurry vertical hydraulic fracturing and continuous trenching machines are the commonly used techniques for prb installation the configuration selection is based on the characteristics of the site and the cost of the reactive medium compared with continuous barriers funnel and gate systems are always preferable when more expensive reactive materials are used to restrict the relatively high construction costs thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 the heterogeneous nature of the sub surface and aquifers makes the installation of prbs difficult therefore it is important to improve the effectiveness of prb by thorough site characterization to achieve reasonable long term remediation notably without the backing of a proper study before setting up the prb the performance may deteriorate over time thakur et al 2020 4 reactive mechanisms and materials in addition to the contaminant characteristics and groundwater chemistry the reactive media are crucial in the contaminant removal process ambrosini 2004 the removal mechanisms are mainly classified into two categories namely destructive and non destructive processes examples of destructive processes are abiotic and biotic dechlorinations wherein a toxic pollutant is transformed into less harmful or non toxic forms examples of non destructive processes are adsorption cation exchange precipitation and surface complexation the removal efficiencies of prbs depend on these processes as well as the applied design and reactive media contaminant removal also relies on the concentration and composition of the pollutant to be removed physical and chemical properties of the groundwater and hydrogeochemical conditions of the site he et al 2019 madzin et al 2016 in biochemical degradation processes such as redox reactions and microbial degradation the pollutants are either retained in the prb as less harmful substances or precipitated in other cases the contaminants may pass through the prb in the case of organic compound biodegradation the microbial enzyme changes these compounds to less or non toxic compounds such as co2 h2o inorganic compounds and biomass he et al 2019 suponik 2010 the biodegradation mechanism is favourable because the pollutants are removed via the processes of growth and metabolism of microorganisms by consuming the organic matter in groundwater with regard to redox reactions zvi is considered to be the most reactive redox material currently available and it releases electrons when exposed to chlorinated groundwater he et al 2019 in non destructive approaches such as physical adsorption and ion exchange the pollutant is adsorbed on the active material surface or forms precipitates to fix the pollutants in the prb reaction area physical adsorption of the pollutant on the large surface of the porous reactive material only involves van der waals interactions and the pollutant can be effectively removed from the groundwater he et al 2019 suponik 2010 thus the different mechanisms of active materials enable them to remove various substances for example activated carbon ac removes organic pollutants zeolites can effectively remove heavy metals and cationic surfactants can also be used for pollutant removal he et al 2019 zeolites zvi and ac satisfy the characteristics required for high efficiency groundwater remediation to remediate groundwater contaminants these conventional materials can be individually applied or combined at different percentages some studies presented a comparison of the pollutant removal efficiencies to determine the best materials for different degradation processes maamoun et al 2020 su and puls 2007 recently alternative materials for prb deployment such as sand apatite and straw based materials were proven effective the selection of the reactive media depends on many factors that impact pollutant removal some factors that directly affect the relative removal efficiency include the type concentration and required remediation method for a given contaminant along with the reactive materials reactivity and stability of the materials and the cost and availability of the reactive media the type and concentration of the target contaminant and the required remediation mechanism influence the selection of the reactive material the material must enable the degradation and removal of the contaminant within the residence time in the reaction zone he et al 2019 mcgovern et al 2002 further the reactive materials must be suitable for use in the given sub surface environment because the material s hydraulic performance is a function of its grain size bronstein 2005 he et al 2019 obiri nyarko et al 2014 balancing permeability and particle size are crucial as permeability is related to the particle size the permeability is higher for larger particles and the reaction time is shorter however in the case of larger particle size the contaminant plume will pass through more easily raising the overall cost because of the insufficient reaction in most cases the coefficient of permeability of the prb should be more than twice that of the aquifer he et al 2019 additionally the reactivity of the media should be determined to estimate the required residence time and size of the prb using the reaction rate and equilibrium constant bronstein 2005 to reduce the cost of extraction and replacement the reactive material must continue to be sufficiently stable to remove contaminants as secondary precipitates form over an extended period of time the formation of precipitates is influenced by adjusting the acidity and alkalinity of the water such that long term system operation can be realized bronstein 2005 he et al 2019 finally the availability and low cost of the reactive media are also important considerations in prb selection bronstein 2005 he et al 2019 obiri nyarko et al 2014 fig 2 illustrates a few factors that influence the selection of the reactive media the different types of reactive materials and their effects on groundwater remediation are discussed in the following subsections 4 1 zero valent iron zvi at present zvi is considered as the most efficient and commonly used type of prb reactive material more than 60 of the prbs globally are iron based and it has yielded successful results for different contaminants including non homogeneous inorganic organic and radioactive nuclide pollutants obiri nyarko et al 2014 thakur et al 2020 andrade and dos santos 2020 reported that zvi has many advantageous characteristics such as high specific surface area high reactivity strong reducing power e0 0 44 v and the ability to adsorb different contaminants thus zvi oxidizes and releases electrons into the contaminants in the groundwater via the reductive mechanism resulting in the precipitation or degradation of the contaminants thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 furthermore zvi is non toxic and inexpensive can be easily synthesized and requires little maintenance fu et al 2014 the effective removal rate of a contaminant primarily relies on the specific grain size and surface areas that are affected by the ph redox conditions and dissolved organic carbon notably zvi mechanisms involve both destructive and non destructive processes such as the degradation adsorption and transfer of ions in anaerobic conditions madzin et al 2016 the natural substances in groundwater such as nitrogen oxygen sulphur and carbon are considered the reaction partners affected by iron oxidation for example dissolved oxygen is considered a preferred electron acceptor in aerobic conditions ambrosini 2004 the synthesis and different reactions of zvi are expressed in eqs 10 15 andrade and dos santos 2020 fu et al 2014 naser and shahwan 2019 the reduction of ferrous ions in an aqueous solution carried out using borohydride is described in eq 10 oxygen availability enhances the oxidation of zvi forming a mixture of ferric oxyhydroxides or rust as demonstrated in eqs 11 and 12 the absence of oxygen results in the dissolution of zvi where water is the oxidant and the reduction of aqueous protons produces hydrogen gas as shown in eq 13 the anaerobic dissolution of zvi can be ensured owing to the presence of hydrogen gas and the increase in the ph values on the other hand zvi releases two electrons to oxygen to produce h2o2 which can be reduced to water via another two electron transfer from the zvi as shown in eq 14 finally the fenton reaction occurs by the combination of h2o2 and fe2 to produce strongly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals oh that are useful for several organic compounds as shown in eq 15 10 f e 2 2 b h 4 6 h 2 o f e 0 2 b o h 3 7 h 2 11 2 f e 0 z v i 4 h o 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e 2 12 4 f e 0 z v i 6 h 2 o 3 o 2 4 f e o h 3 s o l i d 13 f e 0 z v i 2 h f e 2 h 2 14 f e 0 h 2 o 2 2 h f e 2 2 h 2 o 15 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h through the application of zvi groundwater containing severe pollutants such as toxic heavy metals and organic compounds was successfully remediated the highly toxic arsenic was efficiently removed from synthetic water samples through a prb having a removal efficiency of 99 5 lee et al 2009 a batch kinetic study estimated a time scale of less than a few hours in typical conditions used for prb treatment where zvi 20 g l and arsenic 1 mg l the flow through columns operated at a flow rate of 2 ml h continuously for 360 days with the sampling time intervals being 90 150 230 and 360 days the removal rate decreased by 45 in aerobic and 39 in anoxic conditions implying that efficient arsenic removal necessitates the regular replacement of the reactive material in another study zvi efficiently removed the arsenic content in groundwater by maintaining the arsenic concentration at 10 μg l in the treated water in both the batch and column experiments for 180 days in each column abedin et al 2011 the arsenic concentration decreased exponentially with time and its removal was mainly affected by the contact time initial concentration and to a lesser degree the amount of iron njaramba et al 2020 investigated the removal of heavy metals arsenic and zinc using a zvi and pumice mixture both heavy metals were almost completely removed in a column reactor using the mixture however the removal mechanisms used were different arsenic was removed by coprecipitation and adsorption whereas zinc was adsorbed at the active sites at a constant hydraulic conductivity for 30 days as the pumice enhanced the porosity and inter particle distance between the zvi and the pumice the heavy metal pb ii was effectively removed by zvi by redox reaction and floc adsorption the initial pb ii concentration was 10 mg l the particle size of the iron powder was 400 mesh and the reaction time was 90 min although the initial pb ii concentration did not have a significant effect on the removal rate the smaller particle size and longer reaction time yielded better results further experiments were conducted to enhance the pb ii removal process the experiments indicated that 1 acid pre treatment improved the removal rate and decreased the iron powder amount and that 2 an increase in the iron sand mass ratio can increase the pb ii removal efficiency in the reaction column moreover the combination of zvi and sawdust was more stable and better than using zvi or sawdust alone 3 the addition of ac to zvi and sawdust showed physical adsorption and catalytic role in the reaction and produced micro electrolysis gao et al 2019 furthermore the mixture of zvi gravel and sand were investigated for the in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater containing cr vi by examining the resulting responses in the indigenous microbial community the results demonstrated the ability of the active reaction medium of 20 zvi to decrease the cr vi concentration from 27 29 242 65 mg l to 0 1 mg l the decrease in the concentration resulted from chemical reduction notably in this process the competitive growth of cr vi reducing bacteria was induced due to the zvi content in the prb moreover its enrichment in the downgradient part of the prb could aid in the further bio reduction of cr vi to cr iii the lifetime of a prb could be increased due to the secondary mechanism of cr vi bio reduction wang et al 2022 through this method multiple heavy metals were removed using zvi in batch and continuous flow column experiments the batch experiment results indicated that in single metal systems the removal efficiency for cu ii co ii cr ⅵ and as iii could reach 98 at equilibrium the results from the continuous test column filled with chitosan zvi were different the removal in 30 days was 98 84 for cu ii 88 28 for co ii 95 65 for cr ⅵ and 87 10 for as iii zhu et al 2022 a granular zvi prb was efficiently applied to remediate heavy metals such as copper and zinc in cold regions exposed to freezing notably both cu2 and zn2 ions were removed in the laboratory study during solution flow and freeze thaw cycles the hydraulic retention time decreased by 15 18 after the first set of freeze thaw cycling and it remained constant after the second set of freeze thaw cycling the uniformity in particle size distribution and particle agglomeration decreased whereas the hydraulic conductivity remained unchanged within the uncertainty associated with the calculation method statham et al 2015 the feasibility of using different granular mixtures for groundwater remediation with prbs was studied by bilardi et al 2019 in which the removal of cu2 ni2 and zn2 were examined using granular mixtures of zvi and lapillus with weight ratios of 30 70 and 50 50 the heavy metals were effectively removed through the two granular reactive media the removal sequence for the three heavy metals was cu zn ni in the case 50 50 mixture the experiment yielded a higher removal rate but the hydraulic conductivity strongly decreased in the long run thus adsorption was considered the main mechanism of removal for zinc and nickel granular zvi pumice mixtures were used to remove heavy metal ni more efficiently compared to the use of zvi alone the higher the zvi pumice weight ratio the higher the ni removal 74 removal was achieved for a 50 50 mixture 62 removal for a 30 70 mixture and only 40 removal for a 10 90 mixture after 3240 h of treating using 50 mg l of ni solution calabrò et al 2012 notably zvi and the granular mixtures of zvi pumice and zvi pumice in series were used to investigate nickel and copper removal for prb groundwater remediation the results indicated that the granular mixtures of zvi pumice 1 performed well 2 portrayed a metal removal efficiency comparable to that achieved by pure zvi and 3 maintained long term hydraulic conductivity moraci and calabrò 2010 the zvi was modified using raw wheat straw to check its geochemical stability for nitrate contaminated groundwater guo et al 2021 the lab scale results indicated that the removal of no3 was stable with 90 of no3 removed in 22 days of the hydraulic retention time using denitrifying bacteria 34 37 in contrast the field scale results indicated that the removal of no3 reached 60 at a flow rate of 0 01 m3 d nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi can also be used as a reactive material in a prb either alone or as a bi metallic mixture to achieve a high removal efficiency eljamal et al 2020 examined the effectiveness of the nzvi and bi metallic iron copper nanoparticles in removing phosphorus the bimetallic mixture resulted in an anti aggregation effect and enhanced the phosphorus removal by up to 2 2 times than that achieved using only nzvi furthermore using the mixture phosphorus removal was improved at a lower flow rate 10 ml min by 22 compared to that at a higher flow rate 60 ml min another experimental result indicated that stabilized nzvi could be used as an effective adsorbent for pb2 in a prb this is related to its advantages of high reducing power large surface area and excellent stability the removal efficiency was enhanced by reducing the initial concentration of pb2 and increasing the dosage of the stabilized nzvi tehrani et al 2015 table 1 summarizes the results of different zvi applications for groundwater remediation fig 3 highlights some of the successful applications of zvi in prbs for different contaminants 4 2 activated carbon ac activated carbon is widely used as a reactive material in prbs because of its high adsorptive power and ability to remove organic and inorganic pollutants prbs containing ac are also called permeable adsorptive barriers pabs this design was successfully applied for the removal of multiple pollutants such as tetrachloroethylene pce and trichloroethylene tce erto et al 2014 erto et al 2011 indicated that pabs remediated a pce contaminated aquifer to below regulatory limits thus validating the use of pabs in the effective in situ treatment of pce di natale et al 2008 removed the highly toxic heavy metal cd from a contaminated shallow aquifer using a pab thereby preventing river pollution with a long term efficiency of seven months the pab reduced the pollutant concentration peaks and kept the levels below the hazardous levels ensuring compliance with the environmental safety standards and validating the use of pabs in reducing pollution hazards the decrease in the removal rates with time can be addressed by integrating an electro kinetic ek process into a prb rather than replacing the reactive media which increases the cost in a previous study modified ac in prbs were effective in remediating nitrate contaminated groundwater in synthetically contaminated water wherein an electric gradient of 1 25 v cm was applied to the prb the adsorption capacity increased by 90 in optimum conditions and the nitrate concentration was maintained below the standard limit for approximately 111 h conversely the prbs without an electric gradient achieved the same results for approximately 59 h ghaeminia and mokhtarani 2018 recently a combined treatment system of granular activated carbon gac was utilized in a novel microwave mw based regenerating prb to remove cs from groundwater using batch and column setups this system was advantageous compared to the conventional prb systems and was potentially cost effective notably the prb longevity was calculated against groundwater velocity curves to estimate the performance response of the remediation activities and for the designing and upscaling of the combined mw prb treatment the mw prb system is more cost efficient than the conventional prb after 10 successive mw regeneration cycles the laboratory results indicated that the regeneration of cs via mw irradiation had high regeneration yields of 79 110 and low gac weight loss 6 78 falciglia et al 2020 in another study the removal of nitrate and phosphate from pit toilet leachate was investigated using waste by products mixed with effective proportions of traditionally used materials in prb systems mittal et al 2020 examined the use of fly ash fa and rice husk rh with various proportions of ac activated alumina aa and quartz sand qs they achieved a removal efficiency of more than 95 at ph 6 with a weight proportion of 1 2 1 2 4 for ac rh aa qs fa these results were well modelled using the langmuir isotherm model with a sorption capacity of 32 6 mg g for nitrate and 46 5 mg g for phosphate ions faisal et al 2020c also carried out landfill leachate contaminated groundwater remediation using sludge resin and ac the results of the batch and column tests indicated that a multi layered bed of sorbents could treat the leachate contaminated with cd ii nh3 n and dissolved organic matter represented by chemical oxygen demand cod the results were well described using the langmuir model the sorption capacities were 5 634 mg g for cd ii onto sludge 14 908 mg g for nh3 n onto the resin and 3 938 mg g for cod onto ac table 2 lists the different applications of ac reported for groundwater remediation fig 4 portrays the maximum adsorption sorption capacities for a few important contaminants from reported studies using ac in prb based on the langmuir model 4 3 zeolite zeolite is a crystalline hydrated aluminosilicate with small pores that is used in experiments because of its adsorptive and ion exchange capacities matsuda 2018 it can efficiently treat groundwater contaminated by a variety of pollutants such as heavy metals and ammonium owing to its high cation exchange capacity clinoptilolite is one of the most common natural zeolites used for groundwater remediation in previous studies different cation concentrations and practical sizes were investigated in batch tests to determine the optimum conditions for the removal of ammonium and heavy metals such as lead and copper park et al 2002 notably for experiments conducted using clinoptilolite the removal efficiency was more than 80 for all contaminants the only exception being water with high initial concentrations of ammonium and copper 80 and 40 ppm respectively the effect of the particle size was negligible in column test the hydraulic conductivity ranged from 2 10 3 to 7 10 4 cm s when sieved to an adequate size 0 42 0 85 mm and mixed with sands the strength property was similar to that of the soils in the aquifer the removal of ammonium from groundwater was studied in a pilot scale prb design using zeolite the removal occurred by sequential nitrification adsorption and denitrification in addition aerobic conditions were ensured through oxygen releasing compounds such that the microbial oxidization of nh4 n to nitrate could take place as a result the remaining nh4 n was removed abiotically li et al 2014 another prb study used oxygen releasing compound and clinoptilolite to remove ammonium nitrogen from groundwater the pilot test indicated an almost complete depletion for nh4 n at 99 a combination of oxygen release ion exchange biological nitrification and bio regeneration was observed in the prb process huang et al 2015a another study applied a sequential three zone prb of oxygen releasing compound clinoptilolite spongy iron to remove groundwater contaminated by ammonium nitrogen after 21 pore volumes the removal efficiency was as high as 90 43 for the influent dissolved oxygen concentration of 0 68 2 45 mg l and ph of 6 76 7 42 huang et al 2015b hydrocarbons such as toluene were successfully treated in cold regions along with variable water flows containing diphenyldichlorosilane coated zeolite indicating higher adsorption capacity and long term stability than that observed in previous studies the adsorption behaviour was slightly affected by temperature even under high flow rates and the regeneration tests ensured that the coated zeolite could be reused at least three times with high adsorptive power ma et al 2020 obiri nyarko et al 2020 explored the selection between zeolite and composite zeolite mixtures to remove dissolved lead from acidic water at ph of 2 4 in a column experiment the results indicated that the composite zeolite mixture provided better results than zeolite alone the maximum adsorption capacities were 0 097 and 0 151 mg g for zeolite and the composite zeolite mixture respectively and contaminant removal was achieved by both ion exchange and adsorption the authors observed a non equilibrium sorption effect accompanied by a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity by 2 and 28 8 for the zeolite and composite zeolite mixture respectively table 3 lists different reported zeolite applications for groundwater remediation groundwater can be remediated using more than a single permeable reactive material to obtain higher remediation efficiencies in previous studies activated carbon fibre acf was used to support a nzvi composite to remove cr vi from groundwater qu et al 2017 the study proved that acf inhibited the aggregation of the nzvi particles and increased reactivity the removal efficiency was increased by increasing the amount of nzvi on the acf and by decreasing the initial cr vi concentration furthermore by decreasing the initial ph values almost 100 of cr vi was removed in acidic conditions within 60 min of the reaction finally the removal efficiency depended on the co existing ions the removal of u vi can be promoted by zvi ac particles through micro electrolysis when citric acid mixed with ferric chloride was used as a composite electrolyte better results were obtained for the zvi ac mixture than those for only zvi or ac in prbs furthermore the feasibility of coupling an ek process with fe c prb was investigated a moderate increase in prb numbers and decrease in prb thickness improved the removal of u vi the best removal efficiency for u vi was 80 58 0 99 after 120 h under optimum conditions and the removal mechanism was related to the reduction of soluble u vi to insoluble u iv in the zvi ac mixture or the adsorption of ac or iron corrosion products regardless of the ph distribution xiao et al 2020 another study in 2022 demonstrated that coupling ek with zvi fe3o4 ac efficiently removed cr vi by up to 93 the reduction in cr vi was related to the high production of active fe2 from fe3o4 and surface micro electrolysis the lifetime could be prolonged due to a weak direct current supply that enhanced the system s electron transfer capability to maintain the redox process cao et al 2022 notably zvi and ac were both used in the treatment of nitrate contaminated groundwater using two layer prbs in two continuous up flow columns the first layer in the first column was filled with granular oxygen capturing materials to maintain anaerobic conditions and provide nutrition to the denitrifying bacteria in the second layer which was prepared from zvi powder sodium citrate and other inorganic salts the second column was filled with ac intended for the immobilization of the denitrifying microbial consortium the results revealed that the nitrate removal efficiency of the method was 94 and the metabolic intermediate nitrite could be further degraded liu et al 2013 in another study two laboratory scale reactors using zvi and a zvi zeolite mixture were used to investigate the effects of mixing the two reactive materials results indicated that the five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 cod increased from 0 32 to 0 61 and 0 6 in the two reactors moreover the removal efficiency was higher for the zvi zeolite mixture than that for zvi and zeolite exhibited selective removal with efficiencies of 97 2 99 6 95 9 95 2 90 5 and 97 4 for zinc manganese magnesium cadmium strontium and ammonium respectively jun et al 2009 zeolite was also used to support microscale zvi as a potential adsorbent for prbs to remove pb2 and cd2 the results indicated that the adsorption capacity could reach 154 61 mg g and 63 14 mg g for pb2 and cd2 respectively the composite adsorbent proved its high removal capacity over a wide ph range and during the presence of competitive ions in addition it could immobilize the products of pb2 and cd2 efficiently and decrease remobilization possibility even at low ph kong et al 2017 different mixtures of zvi zeolite and ac were examined for the remediation of heavily contaminated landfill leachate to obtain the optimum composite for prb materials having grain sizes of 0 01 0 25 3 0 5 0 and 0 7 1 0 mm respectively the results indicated that zvi and ac are the primary contributors to contaminant removal with the optimum weight ratio for removal being 5 1 4 for zvi zeolite ac to maintain adequate hydraulic conductivity the mixture reduced the contaminants cod by 55 8 tn by 70 8 ammonium by 89 2 nickel by 70 7 lead by 92 7 and 16 pah by 94 2 zhou et al 2014 furthermore statham et al 2016 remediated groundwater containing hydrocarbons and heavy metals by modifying the existing prbs into sequenced prbs using three sections the first section contained zeopro and gac for nutrient release and fuel sorption the second section contained granular iron and sand for capturing phosphorous and heavy metals and the third section contained zeolite for nutrient release and capturing excess iron the results confirmed that with the modification higher phosphorous removal could be achieved than that obtained using previously existing prbs this may be contributed to a decrease in the phosphorous concentration in the second section and the decrease in the iron concentration in the third section a comparison of the different reactive materials was also performed in terms of their removal efficiency maamoun et al 2020 examined the removal of cr vi from groundwater using nzvi bi metallic nzvi copper ac and sand zeolite s z mixture the results revealed that nzvi and nzvi copper both performed better with higher efficiencies 89 7 for nzvi and 84 1 for nzvi copper conversely ac and s z portrayed lower efficiencies of 23 01 and 14 0 respectively overall response surface methodology optimization portrayed that nzvi performed better than the other materials in terms of feasibility long residency 22 days and low cost barrier thickness 0 521 m with 95 2 desirability of its optimal solution carbonaceous solid materials cotton burr compost zvi and sediments were examined for their effectiveness alone and in a mixture to remediate the groundwater contaminated by nitrate the cotton burr composite alone showed significantly higher removal rates whereas mixing it with zvi and or sediment was not effective su and puls 2007 however further investigation is required for comparing the performances of different reactive materials with different contaminants 4 4 sulphate reducing bacteria and limestone permeable reactive barrier can be used to treat acid mining drainage physically chemically or biologically in fact prbs are considered to be the most promising treatment for acid mining drainage when compared to passivation in situ biological remediation lime neutralization waste heap covers and backfilling tigue et al 2019 the acid mining drainage method is characterized by high levels of sulphates metals and acidity gibert et al 2002 sulphate reducing bacteria in prbs can be used as a reactive filler to treat acid mining drainage it is capable of reducing sulphates to sulphides by deriving their energy from the oxidizing organic compounds and hydrogen molecules which react with metals to form metal sulphides as shown in eqs 16 18 cohen 2006 thakur et al 2020 16 s o 4 2 c h 3 c o o h 2 h h s 2 h c o 3 3 h 17 h 2 s h s h s 2 2 h 18 h s m e 2 m e s s h previous studies on the acid mining drainage treatment used sulphate reducing bacteria prbs gibert et al 2002 portrayed that the efficient treatment of acid mining drainage can be achieved using available organic matter the bacteria activity was maintained by satisfying nutrient requirements through a simple carbon substrate the residence time should be enough for a prb to overcome reaction rate limitations metal was removed through 1 sulphate reducing bacteria 2 metal precipitation and 3 processes related to ph increase rather than redox potential decrease which may result in metal precipitation of carbonates and hydroxides in a more recent study algae promoted sulphate reduction as an electron donor in acid rock drainage bioremediation ayala parra et al 2016a a synthetic medium of h2so4 and cu2 was fed into anaerobic granular sludge in inoculated columns the results indicated that sufficient sulphate was reduced in four months and the copper removal efficiency exceeded 99 5 another study conducted two column experiments to examine bacterial sulphate reduction and metal sulphide precipitation using simulated acid mining drainage water through mixtures of reactive organic carbon the results indicated that the sulphate removal rate in 14 months was 500 800 mmol d m3 the contents of iron reduced from 300 1200 to 0 01 220 mg l zinc from 0 6 1 2 to 0 01 0 15 mg l and nickel from 0 8 12 8 to 0 01 mg l waybrant et al 2002 moreover a mathematical model was used for simulating the sulphate reducing process experimentally validated through a fixed bed column laboratory scale prb the results indicated good agreement between the simulation and experimental results the model outputs were influenced by the sulphate reducing parameters at steady state conditions viggi et al 2011 organic carbon amended by zvi were examined to treat acid mine drainage organic carbon is essential for sulphate reducing bacteria and to enhance zvi remediation of acid mine drainage enhancement to prb performance could be reached by minimum addition of zvi however an optimum mixture of zvi to organic carbon is essential to be identified for long term acid mining drainage treatment lindsay et al 2008 another study treated acid rock drainage using a sulphate reducing bioreactor containing zvi it highlighted several advantages of using zvi as a substrate in sulphate reducing prbs including 1 promoting highly stable metal sulphides precipitation 2 driving sulphate reduction 3 decrease in fe2 ions discharge formed from corrosion in prb effluent and 4 neutralization of high acidic levels ayala parra et al 2016b additionally limestone is an alkaline material that can be used to treat acid mining drainage limestone is capable of adjusting the ph value to reduce the metal solubility and allow their precipitation careful control of the ph value will allow better metal removal due to different solubilities obiri nyarko et al 2014 the high acidic and metal water results from the weathering of minerals which are rich in sulphur and iron the overall reaction produces sulfuric acid and acidity at the surface as shown in eqs 19 and 20 in the case of underground environments the oxidation of iron resulted in further acid production and iron hydroxide as shown in eq 21 the high acidity increased the solubility of metals which necessitated ph adjustment turner et al 2005 19 4 f e s 2 15 o 2 14 h 2 o 4 f e o h 3 8 h 2 s

ability to target appropriate permeability values by mixing prb with low cost materials e g sand moreover limestone can be used under suitable geochemical conditioning in combination with microbial processes to treat metal contamination chromium aluminium iron nickel and manganese turner et al 2005 however limestone usage poses a few challenges such as 1 environmental problems including a rise in carbon dioxide content and groundwater hardness 2 decrease in barrier performance due to clogging obiri nyarko et al 2014 3 limited prior knowledge of manganese precipitation issues important when limestone is utilized as a filling material thakur et al 2020 torregrosa et al 2019 and 4 formation of hydroxide minerals and ferric carbonate which can reduce the longevity of limestone therefore replacement of reaction materials should be considered during the system design turner et al 2005 more studies are encouraged to use limestone for acid mining drainage locations while focusing on solving the current technical and environmental issues 4 5 other reactive media recently different materials were investigated by many researchers to test their feasibility as reactive media in prbs and examine their effectiveness in remediating groundwater containing different contaminants kumarasinghe et al 2018 examined the effectiveness of mixing three materials namely soil biochar and bricks as adsorbents to remove cadmium and lead the results proved that adsorption on the triple mixture was independent of ph and ionic strength the removal efficiency was 75 for cadmium and 95 for lead and the experimental isotherm was of the langmuir type sand prbs were examined by many researchers and their effectiveness in removing heavy metals and organic contaminants were established a sludge filter sand prb for removing toxic lead ions from contaminated groundwater was examined by faisal et al 2020b in a batch experiment which achieved a removal efficiency of 97 the sorption behaviour was well described by the langmuir isotherm model with a maximum capacity of 20 41 mg g an early breakthrough point can be attained if the bed depth is small or if the flow rate and metal concentration are high the removal of cd and cu ions in contaminated groundwater by coated sand iron oxide as prb reactive material was also examined these results portrayed better agreement with the langmuir isotherm model than with the freundlich model with the maximum adsorption capacities being 1 9 mg g for cd and 7 6 mg g for cu contaminant migration was delayed by the barrier because of an increase in the bed depth in combination with a decrease in the flow rate and inlet concentration abdul kareem and faisal 2020 faisal et al 2020a examined the removal of cd and cu ions from groundwater after the plantation of humic acid nanoparticles on inert sand through simple impregnation the batch tests indicated that the sorption data were well represented by the langmuir model and more than 98 removal efficiency was achieved with the maximum sorption capacities being 18 9 mg g for cd and 87 5 mg g for cu the humic acid nanoparticles were proved to have precipitated on the surface of the sand metal propagation was delayed because of a decrease in the concentration and flow rate at a specific bed depth rao et al 2020 examined the removal of toluene using a sand mixture and tyre crumb rubber in a prb using 2 5 of tyre crumb rubber and 97 5 of sand column 38 916 pore volumes of water contaminated by 0 15 mg l of toluene could be treated the adsorption of toluene was considered to be due to the van der waals attraction at the energetically heterogeneous sites of tyre crumb rubber particles following the freundlich isotherm and dubinin radushkevich equation furthermore the process was endothermic and expended greater energy for the dehydration of non polar molecules in aqueous solutions apatite and pyrite have been widely used as reactive media for prbs natural pyrite which is an iron sulphide material with extremely low iron and sulphur contents was investigated by liu et al 2015 to remove cr vi from groundwater the removal was influenced by the ph and was highly efficient in acidic conditions however the effects of ionic strength and natural organic matter on cr vi removal were negligible another study examined the use of an apatite ii prb for the removal of heavy metals such as zinc lead and cadmium conca and wright 2006 the mechanisms of immobilization for the three heavy metals differed in terms of the primary mechanism the removal mechanism of zn and cd was microbially mediated so4 reduction and the subsequent precipitation of sphalerite zns whereas the mechanism for the immobilization of lead was the precipitation of pyromorphite pb10 po4 6 oh cl 2 the removal efficiencies were high and the remaining concentrations of cd and pb zn so4 and no3 were 2 μg l 100 μg l 100 200 mg l and 50 μg l respectively hydroxyapatite coated quartz sand also portrayed significant remediation efficiency for the removal of uranium from an aqueous solution the removal was greatly influenced by the initial concentration of uranium reaching 75 32 when the initial uranium concentration was 5 mg l followed by sorbent particle size and hydraulic loading the transport behaviour was well modelled by the thomas and yoon nelson models and the breakthrough times varied in the different columns 100 12 251 91 d zhang et al 2020 iron turning waste was considered as an inexpensive and sustainable prb media to remove pesticides such as dieldrin endrin ddt and lindane the batch experiment demonstrated that the removal efficiency of lindane 41 was lower than that of other pesticides which ranged between 86 and 91 for 20 μg l for each pesticide after 10 min the acidic condition was preferred for pesticide removal the combination of iron turning waste with sand media in a continuous flow column setting simulating prb was able to effectively remove pesticides for at least 25 days abbas et al 2021 a prb based on calcium carbonate and consisting of limestone and crushed concrete was tested by wang et al 2016 for the remediation of groundwater containing high concentrations of iron and manganese the prb successfully removed the dissolved iron by 91 95 by mass in the first year of operation however this rate declined to 64 61 in the third year of operation the dominant removal mechanism for both iron and manganese was precipitation of carbonate minerals and the removal was enhanced by additional precipitation at higher ph associated with the crushed concrete slow release oxygen or a bio sparging containment wall can be used as an alternative to zvi for treating some contaminants in the case of petroleum hydrocarbon plumes the reaction is not amenable with zvi therefore slow release oxygen or bio sparging can be used instead an aerobic condition occurs within the wall which subjects dissolved contaminants to biodegradation when passing through the barrier speight 2020 slow injection or diffusion of oxygen or air are used in bio barriers designs to deliver amendments into the sub surface for avoiding the usage of substantial energy input for amendments delivery which may reflect on the operation and maintenance costs turner et al 2005 the idea of oxygen releasing compounds which are solid peroxides is to release oxygen slowly by dispersal in water accordingly a sufficient amount of oxygen is available for groundwater bioremediation from interstice microorganisms entrapment or encapsulation for oxygen releasing compounds is required to use solid peroxides in prbs examples of oxygen releasing compounds include mgo2 cao2 or na2co3 eqs 22 24 illustrate the formation of oxygen or hydroxyl radical depending on the chemical and physical conditions when using cao2 mosmeri et al 2018 which can be expressed as follows 22 c a o 2 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 c a o h 2 23 2 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o o 2 24 h 2 o 2 e o h o h nanoparticles of calcium peroxide in a prb removed naphthalene from groundwater at an optimum concentration of 400 mg l cao2 nanoparticles for bioremediation of 20 mg l of naphthalene increasing ph from 3 to 12 increased the dissolved oxygen from 4 mg l to 13 6 mg l and improved the stability of the nanoparticles to 70 d an increase in temperature from 4 c to 30 c also reduced the stability of calcium peroxide from 120 d to 30 d gholami et al 2018 another study focused on the effect of nanoparticles of calcium peroxide during naphthalene removal during the prb bioremediation process the alpha diversity analysis demonstrated that naphthalene presence decreased species richness gholami et al 2019b calcium peroxide and straw biochar were used as a new material in a prb to remove pah from contaminated groundwater prbs were designed and tested for the two materials namely wheat straw and coconut shell biochar depending on the self domestication mechanism of microbes to remediate the groundwater containing phenanthrene although the batch and column results indicated a 100 removal of the phenanthrene by both materials the coconut shell biochar was more promising pseudomonas and sphingomonas were seven times more abundant in coconut shell biochar than wheat straw thus proving the superiority of the coconut shell biochar and the release of organic carbon from coconut shell biochar was even more stable than that from wheat straw liu et al 2019 gholami et al 2019a examined the use of nanoparticles of magnesium peroxide encapsulated within sodium alginate as reactive prb material to remediate naphthalene and toluene as model contaminants for btex and pah compounds the encapsulation of magnesium peroxide decreased the negative impacts on the microbial flora in water and increased the stability of nanoparticles thereby enhancing the overall removal efficiency in this case naphthalene was more prone to biodegradation than toluene with the removal efficiencies reaching 100 at 20 d and 30 d respectively four different layers were designed to remediate the groundwater contaminated with pce in an anaerobic aerobic prb system the 1st layer was for oxygen capture to maintain the level of dissolved oxygen lower than 1 35 mg l in the influent water of the 2nd anaerobic layer the 3rd layer was for oxygen release to maintain the concentration level of dissolved oxygen higher than 11 3 mg l in the influent water of the 4th aerobic layer the design succeeded to control pce and its degradation by products the removal rates were 99 for pce 98 for tce 90 for dichloroethylene and 92 for vinyl chloride liu et al 2017 straw based materials for prbs were efficiently utilized for the denitrification processes in groundwater with the nitrate removal rates being 60 90 the secondary pollution was minimal because of the biochemical coupling reactions verifying the ability of the straw based materials as an effective alternative in situ material to woodchips wen et al 2020 notably the btex removal in a prb was examined using a real time polymerase chain reaction technique based on microbial community dynamics yeh et al 2010 the column study portrayed that the highest dissolved oxygen concentration of 5 08 mg l was obtained at the 40 level of calcium peroxide such that the ratio of calcium peroxide in the oxygen releasing compounds was 40 w w the removal efficiency was in the order ethylbenzene toluene p xylene benzene and p xylene ethylbenzene benzene toluene before and after shock loading thus both the aerobic degradation and changes in the microbial community structure were proven another study analysed the removal of btex at high concentrations through bioaugmentation using mycobacterium sp chxy119 and pseudomonas sp yato411 immobilized bead xin et al 2013 minimal oxygen supply was required for the bioremediation of btex by the immobilized bead for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and p xylene the actual mineralization rates were 10 8 10 5 5 8 and 11 4 and the degradation rates were 97 8 94 2 84 7 and 87 4 respectively and the groundwater toxicity decreased by 91 2 a variety of materials were tested in a mixture or individually to optimize their efficiency for remediating groundwater gravel and mulch mixture were utilized as the carbon source in prbs for the denitrification of groundwater under different no3 loadings the removal percentage was as high as 97 at the inlet concentrations below 280 mg l but decreased to 66 at a higher concentration of 530 mg l other heterotrophic processes revealed by the analysis of so4 2 co2 and ch4 included aerobic respiration sulphate reduction and methanogenesis gibert et al 2019 another prb with a mixture of clay illite and wood chips was also utilized for the remediation of groundwater contaminated using radioactive cs 137 and adequate performance and removal efficiency were confirmed torres et al 2017 the effectiveness of sodium alginate graphene oxide hydrogel beads as a reactive material to remediate groundwater from the antibiotics namely ciprofloxacin was investigated by zhao et al 2018 the isotherm data followed the freundlich model with the adsorption capacity reaching 100 mg g at the ph of 7 the adsorption process was influenced by contact time initial concentration and ionic strength but not by the ph in another experiment turner et al 2008 remediated fluoride from contaminated groundwater using a calcite prb and found that lowering the ph increased the removal of fluoride mass and that ph can be regulated through co2 addition the experimental and model results both showed 99 removal of fluoride 2300 mg l when co2 was injected directly into the barrier a recent 2022 study integrated in situ chemical oxidation and a prb using peroxydisulfate as the oxidant and copper oxide as the reactive barrier material in a novel system to remove chlorophenols the removal efficiency was affected by the following factors 1 removal efficiency was 90 when peroxydisulfate μm chlorophenol μm 1 2 removal efficiency decreased with increasing flow rates from 1 8 to 14 4 ml min and chlorophenol concentrations from 10 to 150 μm 3 removal efficiency decreased to 90 for 2 4 dichlorophenol and 85 for 2 4 6 trichlorophenol when real groundwater was used and 4 removal efficiency decreased to 20 for pentachlorophenol when high alkaline groundwater was used cho et al 2022 overall the previous applications of prbs in combination with different reactive materials or mixtures portrayed that the prb model s efficiency for groundwater remediation can be enhanced by controlling certain factors singh et al 2020 confirmed this and portrayed that multiple prbs provided better performance than single systems and natural attenuation additionally thick prbs performed better than thin prbs owing to longer residence times and consequently better reactivity moreover an optimum depth was important for achieving the maximum removal efficiency and retaining the treatment rate for a longer time table 4 and fig 5 portray the different reactive media and mechanisms used in prbs for successful groundwater remediation for different contaminants from reported studies heavy metals and organic contaminants are the pollutants most frequently removed by prbs using non conventional materials 5 prbs longevity and optimization a prb captures the contaminant on its surface and then transforms it into a less harmful form in other words the prb has a hydraulic capture function followed by reactivity functions accordingly a sufficiently long residence time is necessary for ensuring effective pollutant capture and the reaction and longevity of a prb s ability for maintaining these functions for long term hence it is important to determine the time over which the prb will work efficiently without any need for maintenance or replacement of the reactive media the interstate technology and regulatory council 2011 zvi is the only known medium that undergoes performance reduction with time because of the accumulation of secondary mineral precipitates that fill its pores and affects the hydraulic conductivity of the prbs notably the longevity could decrease due to insufficient or non uniform mass of the material obiri nyarko et al 2014 the longevity and monitoring of a prb directly affects both the operational and maintenance costs because replacement is always required as soon as the material is saturated with a pollutant gavaskar et al 2000 obiri nyarko et al 2014 studies on the enhancement of the long term performance of prbs without efficiency reduction are ongoing furthermore prb design is crucial in determining the construction costs for example the funnel and gate configuration requires less material which is preferable when using more expensive materials conversely the construction cost of continuous barriers is lower than that of funnel and gate barriers thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 furthermore some characteristics related to groundwater can affect the cost for example when the groundwater velocity is high the barrier construction cost may be higher as the barrier should be sufficiently thick to achieve the desired residence time additionally aquifer depth can influence the construction cost of the prb if the aquifer is too deep the cost will be higher however scientists are working to overcome depth constrains through innovative techniques such as jetting gavaskar et al 2000 although there are minor considerations related to prb economics groundwater remediation by prbs is generally considered a low cost technique with few environmental problems and low energy consumption due to the low requirements of continuous energy supply this consequently reduces the operating and life cycle costs moreover for this kind of in situ treatment above ground facilities for storage transport and disposal are not required because the contaminant is brought in contact with the reactive media underground the reactive media can last for years and technical and regulatory problems can be avoided using prbs day et al 1999 kankanige et al 2019 liu et al 2013 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 although the cost of reactive media may be significant recently reactive materials such as ac were mixed with low cost materials e g sand that are effective for removing contaminants mittal et al 2020 moreover different materials have been examined as alternatives for the traditional or high cost materials to efficiently remediate groundwater either alone or by mixing with materials such as soil biochar bricks sand pyrite apatite ii hydroxyapatite straw based materials gravel and mulch mixture and clay illite and wood chip mixtures conca and wright 2006 faisal et al 2020b gibert et al 2019 kumarasinghe et al 2018 liu et al 2015 2019 torres et al 2017 wen et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however the cost estimates for these materials are still uncertain and need further investigation moreover the selection of low cost prb reactive materials which are not readily soluble or have low reactivity can result in the persistence of the reactive material over a long time maitra 2019 6 conclusions and aspects of future studies the contamination of groundwater remains a controversial problem owing to the difficult choices between the optimum reduction of different pollutants and the selection of cost effective treatment techniques to a certain degree this complexity was solved using prbs with high degrees of efficiency practicality and longevity in this review we examined the fundamental principles of contaminant removal from groundwater starting from the selection of a suitable study area through the examination of aquifer properties geotechnical and topographic factors hydrogeological characteristics and site geochemistry next we presented the most common modelling equations and discussed how modelling can aid in assessing optimum prb design furthermore we detailed the most typical prb designs including the funnel and gate continuous and sequential types highlighting the advantages of each one notably prbs can be applied in situ to remove pollutants on its internal surface by mainly two mechanisms namely destructive processes including abiotic or biotic transformations of harmful pollutants to less toxic forms and non destructive processes including adsorption ion exchange and precipitation in which pollutants are simply retained in the barrier different conventional reactive materials can be selected for prbs including zvi ac and zeolite among these reactive materials zvi has so far been the most widely applied material in prbs when these reactive materials are not combined adsorption is the most frequent remediation mechanism with other mechanisms exceeding half of the cases presented in this review the combination of two or more of these materials portrayed high percentages of removal up to almost 100 for some contaminants however the optimum weight ratio must be carefully examined for the highest removal results additionally using these materials in sequential designs will increase the efficiency of the model and remove several contaminants in addition sulphate reducing bacteria and limestone were used in prbs to treat acid mining drainage many other materials have been recently examined as alternatives to conventional materials such as soil biochar bricks sand pyrite apatite ii hydroxyapatite straw based materials gravel with mulch mixture and clay illite and wood chip mixtures these materials were successfully applied to remediate groundwater containing different contaminants such as organic heavy metals and radioactive substances with a high degree of removal efficiency finally the longevity and optimization of prbs were investigated to assure a maximum effect of prbs for groundwater remediation the optimal design was determined depending on both technical and economic analysis coupling prbs with ek processes could also save the cost of replacing reactive materials due to a decrease in the removal rates with time therefore prbs can be considered as an efficient low cost in situ method for groundwater remediation for a wide range of contaminants including organics and heavy metals with the appropriate selection of the design and reactive material in the most suitable location for a prb system the technique is highly effective in the remediation of groundwater contaminant plumes future studies must work towards improved prb monitoring for different site characteristics such as aquifer properties geotechnical and topographic factors and site geochemistry which are a vital aspect for the successful implementation and execution of this promising technology moreover effective prb monitoring can decrease the overall cost through replacement maintenance of material at the most suitable time this is a function of the medium s remediation capacity and can increase the performance of a prb model scientists are encouraged to develop more advanced monitoring tools based on the theoretical modelling of prb systems additionally the lengthy clean up time is considered a drawback for some locations and future studies may target solutions to further reduce the cost time and effort expended the cost of prbs may be reduced using less expensive reactive media without reducing the effectiveness of plume remediation notably future studies must use limestone for acid mining drainage locations while focusing on solving current problems related to technical and environmental issues in addition to provide a complete and accurate assessment of different materials used in prb systems a detailed investigation is still ongoing for the cost of non conventional materials that were successfully applied to remediate groundwater to determine whether they are more cost effective than the conventional media finally an additional scientific examination is required for the remediation of different contaminants such as uncontrolled hazardous waste and organic contaminants of emerging concerns such as pesticides pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds that may seep into groundwater funding this work was funded by the national water and energy center at uae university under projects no 31r191 declaration of competing interest

methods for prb optimization to achieve maximum removal rates of pollutants the reactive mechanisms which play a crucial role in the removal process are reviewed in detail for various types of reactive media the effect of combining multiple materials for enhancing the performance of single and multiple prb systems was also reviewed finally we determined the optimization factors that contribute to the longevity of the various prb designs to ultimately enhance groundwater remediation with the correct design and appropriate selection of reactive materials a prb system could be highly effective in the remediation of groundwater contaminant plumes previous studies reported that the prb could successfully treat groundwater contaminated with organics heavy metals and radioactive substances including benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex arsenic lead caesium 137 and uranium several reactive materials including zero valent iron activated carbon and zeolites satisfy the characteristics required for groundwater remediation in addition we analysed the potential of new reactive materials including sand apatite straw based materials gravel and mulch mixture to remove different contaminants through the use of prb systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater remediation permeable reactive barrier biodegradation treatment reactive materials

groundwater is a vital resource that provides 30 of the global fresh water requirement and more than two billion people worldwide depend on groundwater as the primary source of drinking water ajami 2020 it is a crucial part of the hydrologic cycle necessary for sustaining streams wetlands lakes and aquatic communities alley et al 2002 on a global scale the quality of groundwater resources is under threat owing to the exposure to a wide spectrum of contaminants originating from urbanization increased agricultural production and changing patterns of land use rodak et al 2014 the pollutants may be of anthropogenic or natural origin and can comprise of organic and inorganic materials microorganisms heavy metals or pharmaceuticals these pollutants affect public health as well as ecosystems stefanakis et al 2015 the conventional technology commonly employed for the remediation of contaminated groundwater is the pump and treat method however the clean up goals are barely achieved by this method notably several studies have focused on the development of innovative and effective groundwater remediation methods faisal et al 2018 henderson and demond 2007 sathya and elango 2018 permeable reactive barriers prbs are a passive and sustainable technology that provides an alternative in situ approach to supplement or replace other existing techniques blowes et al 2000 faisal et al 2018 according to the united states environmental protection agency u s epa 2002 prbs are one of the pioneering technologies for the in situ remediation of migrating contaminant plumes in groundwater in this method reactive materials within the barrier are selected to facilitate the geochemical reactions that remove the contaminants present in groundwater under ideal conditions these materials are adequately reactive to treat water over the long term from years to decades blowes et al 2000 previous studies developed prbs and demonstrated their effectiveness in removing heavy metals asokbunyarat et al 2017 ludwig et al 2002 statham et al 2016 radioactive isotopes de pourcq et al 2015 torres et al 2017 chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons lai et al 2006 muchitsch et al 2011 and several organic and inorganic pollutants simon and meggyes 2000 sun et al 2017 in general a prb must be sufficiently reactive to trap or degrade the contaminant and permeable enough to allow the groundwater to flow through the reactive material further properties such as low maintenance easy availability accessibility and low cost are desirable for prb materials de pourcq et al 2015 the barrier must be more permeable than an aquifer so that it does not block the ambient groundwater flow during the treatment of the contaminant the primary removal mechanisms include sorption precipitation chemical reactions and reactions with biological mechanisms these mechanisms combine passive chemical and or biological treatments and the treated water exits the prb on the downstream side speight 2020 therefore contaminated groundwater need not be extracted to the surface for treatment in summary prbs offer an in situ low cost and environment friendly remediation strategy for a wide range of contaminants the aims of this study are to 1 discuss the fundamentals of prb installation for groundwater remediation 2 illustrate the different prb designs and explain their effects on degradation performance 3 compare conventional and non conventional reactive media used in prb remediation in terms of their mechanisms and 4 provide optimization guidelines for prb remediation concerning longevity and cost effectiveness more specifically this review aims to critically summarize the factors that affect the design and installation of prb systems for providing an effective durable economic and practical remediation method in section 2 we discuss the field site selection criteria along with the prb modelling process in section 3 we present different prb designs in section 4 we list and compare conventional and non conventional reactive materials that can be used in prb systems for different types of contaminants finally in section 5 we highlight the importance of the optimization for existing prb systems from the economical effectiveness and durability perspectives 2 fundamentals of prbs installation the first step in prb based groundwater remediation is generally the selection of the site containing the contaminated groundwater based on contaminant analysis the prb can be installed in the most contaminated zone and a solute transport model should be built a suitable design of the prb should be selected to ensure the maximum removal percentage in highly contaminated areas finally a performance evaluation is necessary to verify if the process requires the use of a single prb or multiple prbs singh et al 2019 2020 2 1 selection of prbs field site field site selection is crucial for groundwater remediation considering the difficulty in prb installation owing to the heterogeneity of the aquifer and the sub surface thorough site characterization is necessary before prb installation to ensure efficient and persistent contaminant removal thakur et al 2020 the site characteristics include aquifer properties geotechnical and topographic factors hydrogeological characteristics and site geochemistry aquifer characteristics include the groundwater depth flow velocity lateral and vertical gradients and the depth thickness and continuity of the aquitard along with the hydraulic conductivity and porosity of the underground layers and the plume size and distribution geotechnical and topographic factors include underground and aboveground obstacles that hinder the installation of a prb to ensure a careful examination of the location hydrogeological characteristics include shear strength and cohesion properties for sands silts and clay degree of wetness or dryness of materials grain sizes of different layers at the site and densities of different materials site geochemistry includes the level of unwanted electron acceptors such as species of dissolved oxygen nitrate and bioavailable iron these species can reduce the possibility of effective and complete anaerobic degradation using prbs based on biological processes thus the location cost efficiency dimensions and design of the prb system can be determined based on these characteristics gavaskar et al 2000 thakur et al 2020 2 2 modelling of prbs systems generally numerical modelling is performed to aid in prb design modelling can provide a complete picture of the travel paths and flow volume of the groundwater thus establishing a suitable design with sufficient safety margin and without increasing the design cost scott and folkes 2000 in prb modelling the following three aspects are considered 1 hydrogeology for groundwater flow 2 geochemistry for chemical reactions and 3 economy for construction and operational costs modelling can be achieved through a single combined model or coupled independent models more specifically prb simulation models require the following features 1 three dimensional 3d hydrogeologic models however for sites that do not have significant vertical flow and fully penetrating prbs two dimensional 2d models can be more efficient the model should be capable of handling complexities such as site heterogeneities tunnels and streams as well as large contrasts in the hydraulic conductivity at the funnel walls 2 geochemical model that considers important chemical reactions and solute transport processes including those with heavy metals along with simultaneous reactions 3 economic model to calculate prb construction and operational costs for the selected design taking into consideration complexities such as piece wise functions for construction techniques painter 2005 the variations in the spatio temporal groundwater quality porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the reactive granular media can be predicted through the complete computational approach while considering chemical and biological clogging in a prb for the 3d movement of groundwater and when the density in porous earthen media is constant the modular finite difference flow model modflow can be used as explained in eq 1 medawela and indraratna 2020 1 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z q s s h t where kxx kyy kzz hydraulic conductivity values along the x y and z axes respectively h hydraulic head q volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources q 0 and or sinks q 0 s s specific storage of the porous material t time generally in the saturated zone of an aquifer the transport of dissolved contaminants near and across a prb is often dominated by advection and dispersion for a porous medium having a uniform porosity distribution the mass transport equation can be effective bear 1979 bortone et al 2013 the general macroscopic equation that describes the transport and the fate of aqueous species in multi dimensional saturated porous media can be expressed as follows medawela and indraratna 2020 2 c t x i d i j c x i x i v i c q ϕ c s r k where c concentration of the pollutant dissolved in groundwater x i distance along the respective coordinate axis d ij hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor ѵ i seepage or linear pore water velocity q volumetric flux of water per unit volume of aquifer at concentration cs added from an external source φ soil porosity r k reaction term for removal or generation of pollutant in the aqueous phase the hydrodynamic dispersion d ij is a second rank tensor defined as a sum of the mechanical dispersion tensor d hij and the molecular diffusion coefficient d m bortone et al 2013 the second term on the right side of eq 2 is the advection term bortone et al 2013 the linear pore water velocity can be expressed as follows zheng and wang 1999 3 v i k i ϕ h x i where k i principal component of the hydraulic conductivity tensor h hydraulic head determined using eq 1 the third term with q 0 considers the possible external sources of contaminated water at concentration c s injected into the domain for q 0 it is considered to be a sink term where contaminant mass is removed from the domain typically in this case c s c the last term on the right side of eq 2 describes the reactions involved in the transport of a dissolved contaminant in a prb where adsorption generally occurs the chemical reaction is represented by adsorption expressed as follows bortone et al 2013 4 r k ρ b ϕ ω t k c a c c ω where ω pollutant concentration on solid ρ b and φ the dry bulk density and porosity of the adsorbing material respectively c c ω is the liquid pollutant concentration at thermodynamic equilibrium with adsorbing solid where c is derived from the adsorption isotherm and defines the mass transfer driving force in the transport model equation a specific surface area of the adsorbent k c global mass transfer coefficient generally groundwater flow and transport modelling are dominated by numerical methods such as those implemented in modflow developed by the united states geological survey for 3d flow modeling mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and mt3dms which is a 3d multi species transport model zheng and wang 1999 modflow and mt3dms can be combined using pre processing and post processing software graphical user interfaces to facilitate the model application and analysis for complex 3d problems konikow 2010 these tools are based on finite difference techniques such as explicit implicit and crank nicolson methods and can be utilized to simulate prb performance singh et al 2020 notably groundwater bioremediation modelling has been reported in the literature in several previous studies mohamed et al 2007 2010a 2010b mohamed and hatfield 2005 2011 initially the flow problem was solved in terms of the hydraulic head to subsequently determine the flow velocities and solve the reaction transport model modflow is capable of calculating the seepage velocity and hydraulic head which can then be used in rt3d finite difference model to solve the general macroscopic eq 2 to calculate the chemical species concentrations at a particular time step however species concentration may impact hydraulic conductivity and thus feed back into the flow equation in the hybrid modlfow rt3d model after determining the hydraulic conductivity and porosity for the 1st time step the software is not capable of automatically updating the values in each time step as a result an array of time varied hydraulic conductivity and porosity can be introduced as input into the simulation as shown in eqs 5 7 medawela and indraratna 2020 5 ϕ t ϕ o δ ϕ t 6 δ ϕ t x s ρ c σ k 1 n m m k r k t 7 k k o ϕ o δ ϕ t ϕ o 3 1 ϕ o δ ϕ t 1 ϕ o 2 where φ o φ t and δφ t initial porosity

phase concentration of bacterial cells m k molar volume of the mineral n m number of minerals r k summation of individual reaction rates of mineral dissolution and precipitation prb modelling facilitates the assessment of long term performance additionally it may simulate the system behaviour under different scenarios by changing different factors such as the configuration and orientation of the prb barrier location and contaminant properties singh et al 2020 by simulating different widths of a continuous reactive barrier gate or funnel one can evaluate the trade offs of different parameters in the prb design gavaskar et al 2000 notably the model can evaluate the potential for the overflow underflow or flow across aquifers while considering the impacts of fluctuations in the flow velocity and direction of groundwater into the design moreover the model can improve the process of selecting the media by specifying the reactive medium s hydraulic conductivity and particle size with respect to the aquifer s hydraulic conductivity furthermore the model can be used to plan the location of the monitoring wells and the monitoring frequencies gupta and fox 1999 chung et al 2011 utilized modflow to optimize prb location and predict its performance using 3d groundwater flow simulation the groundwater head and the concentration distribution model for the contaminants were developed xu et al 2012 developed a modified modflow mt3dms system that was capable of simulating a 3d aquifer contaminated by perchloroethylene and its daughters the results demonstrated that the modified modflow mt3dms can effectively simulate multi species mother daughter chain kinetic reactions with multiple prbs being more preferable that single prbs singh et al 2019 used modflow followed by mt3dms to assess the feasibility of a prb for remediating a target aquifer they investigated two factors for virtual prb modelling 1 the selection of a suitable prb design and 2 the analysis of the variations in the hydraulic conductivity ratio of different aquifers along with different barriers along with the removal efficiency of the virtual prb system with time rad and fazlali 2020 used modflow for the quantitative analysis of groundwater flow and mt3dms for the qualitative analysis of groundwater contamination the optimum location and dimensions of the prb were determined by applying the model they also applied the groundwater modelling system gms software as a graphical interface to optimize the prb dimensions and the remediation location for groundwater contaminated by landfill pollution zhao et al 2018 used the cxtfit 2 1 software to obtain the transport parameters through the non linear fitting of transport models to the experimental data they used the one dimensional 1d advection dispersion equation to simulate the kcl breakthrough processes and then calculated the prb lifetime as shown in eqs 8 and 9 notably for the 1d equation without sources sinks and where the reaction consisted of instantaneous sorption eq 8 was considered to be similar to eq 2 expressed by the retardation factor r as follows 8 r c t d 2 c x 2 v c x 9 t l 120 q m 1 ϕ ƞ ρ l c

associated with the darcian flow velocity obiri nyarko et al 2015 used geochemical modelling to estimate the removal of lead heavy metals using a prb consisting of zeolite as a reactive material the phreeqc ph ph re redox eq equilibrium and c program written in c program was used to model the 1d transport of lead and good agreement was found between the experimental data and numerical simulations the phreeqc model can be used to achieve the design and management objectives beak and wilkin 2009 used geochemical modelling a valuable tool that can portray the contrast in the ph dependence for both as iii and as v precipitation at moderate alkaline ph conditions as iii is unlikely to be precipitated as an oxide or sulphide phase and the increase in ph can result in the precipitation of metal arsenates including ferrous arsenate jeen 2017 used geochemical data to clarify the associated reaction with the reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing minerals that may be the source of arsenic release in sediments the study demonstrated that the associated reactions with the reductive dissolution of arsenic bearing minerals can be realized through reactive transport modelling based on the site s geochemical data these reactions may be the potential sources of arsenic release in the sediment in certain conditions in contrast to the numerical approaches klammler and hatfield 2008a derived a 2 d analytical solution to determine the flow fields toward the rectangular prbs having a continuous wall configuration with and without impermeable side walls their approach was based on the conformal mapping technique and assumed that the aquifer was homogeneous with a uniform ambient flow field klammler and hatfield 2009 also considered the classic funnel and gate configuration with perpendicular funnel arms and prbs having velocity equalization walls they proposed an efficient analytical approach to estimate the reactor conductivity and capture the flow by monitoring the hydraulic loss at the reactor the approach was also used to investigate flow by pass problems due to the lateral exit of significant ambient flow components from the prb which may result in incomplete contaminant treatment to avoid the by pass for different prb types the maximum permissible deviations for ambient groundwater flow direction were defined klammler and hatfield 2008b in addition the analytical solution can be used for prb hydraulics in heterogeneous conditions this can be achieved by 1 assuming that the aquifer is effectively homogeneous and 2 incorporating the effects of aquifer heterogeneity on plume spreading using an effective transverse macro dispersion coefficient klammler et al 2014 the analytical solutions have been applied to several prb studies in the literature and provide insights into the hydraulic behaviour of prbs which is not evident from complex numerical approaches the results were used for practitioner friendly applications based on the dimensionless charts of captured widths klammler et al 2010 3 prbs design according to gavaskar et al 2000 the design of a prb system includes successive steps that consider preliminary technical and economic evaluations barrier site characterization reactive media selection treatability studies batch and column tests engineering design selection of construction methods preparation of monitoring plans and economic analysis he et al 2019 indicated that during the design and installation of prbs many factors needed to be considered 1 the prb permeability should be 2 10 times or more the aquifer permeability for obtaining the best results considering that the permeability of the prb reactive material may decrease with time owing to many limiting factors as shown in previous equations 2 the thickness of the reactive barrier should be sufficient depending on the contaminants present in the water groundwater flow rate and degradation rate of pollutants among other factors although thick prbs are required to achieve a high removal rate they increase the construction costs 3 the portion of the reactive material consumed over time should be considered in a good design 4 the removal of other materials such as sediments by flushing with water or air should be considered for the pipeline design 5 finally the reactive barrier system and materials should be monitored inspected and updated through openings such as monitoring wells the two most commonly used configurations in prb designs are the continuous trench slurry type fig 1 a and the funnel and gate fig 1b configurations in the former configuration a single and sufficiently permeable reactive zone is installed across a contaminant plume that allows water to pass through the barrier under its natural hydraulic gradient striegel et al 2001 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 the continuous trench is preferable in most types of soils at depths of 5 30 m thakur et al 2020 owing to its simple design and high cost effectiveness compared with the funnel and gate configuration it is widely used in developing countries offers convenient installation causes less interference to ambient groundwater flow and is applicable in a wide variety of hydrological and geological conditions he et al 2019 thakur et al 2020 however this arrangement has some limitations especially when undesired and buried materials are present thakur et al 2020 the effectiveness of this configuration has been previously documented hocking and wells 2002 mountjoy et al 2003 wilkin et al 2014 the funnel and gate design fig 1b consists of a reactive permeable gate between two impermeable walls that direct the contaminant plume into the reactive zone for treatment thus it primarily comprises of an impermeable funnel a highly permeable gate and an active material to hinder the pollutant and capture the remediated water exiting from the downstream side the impermeable funnel acts as a cut off barrier that directs the groundwater flow into the reactor gate where treatment occurs through the reactive medium he et al 2019 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 notably to achieve remediation at the least cost the ratio of the funnel area to the gate area must be balanced plumes containing a mixture of contaminants can be funnelled through a gate with multiple reactive walls arranged in series striegel et al 2001 the barrier length must be more than the lateral extent of the plume and the plume must be passively directed toward the reactive gate under the natural gradient the geometric arrangement of the funnel wall could be a straight line with the gate or other arrangements depending on the site conditions speight 2020 thakur et al 2020 this configuration offers better control better homogeneity of contaminant concentration for non uniform contaminant distribution sufficient residence times for wide plumes and high groundwater velocity speight 2020 sequential prbs are another type of configuration which may comprise of an iron filled barrier and a bio barrier which may be suitably employed for removing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah thakur et al 2020 they are installed at locations that are known to contain several groundwater contaminants for example at gas works sites phillips 2009 this type of prb employs multiple reactive materials in more than one reactive zone to remediate the contaminated groundwater bastiaens et al 2005 choi et al 2007 considered removing 2 4 6 trichlorophenol on a lab scale using a sequential prb the first chemical reactor contained palladium coated iron and the second bioreactor contained anaerobic microbe seeded sand jun et al 2009 reported that a sequenced prb system could remediate landfill leachate polluted groundwater effectively in their study zero valent iron zvi and a mixture of zeolites and zvi constituted the first section of the two reactors whereas the second section comprised of oxygen releasing compounds furthermore statham et al 2016 assessed the appropriateness of the prb media sequence to remediate sites contaminated by both hydrocarbons and heavy metals puls 2006 reported that the construction methods based on prbs have expanded from the original funnel and gate design involving the typical excavation equipment to include several other equipment such as continuous deep trenching machines vertical hydraulic fracturing deep soil mixing vibrated beams jetting and bioslurry methods nowadays excavation by biodegradable slurry vertical hydraulic fracturing and continuous trenching machines are the commonly used techniques for prb installation the configuration selection is based on the characteristics of the site and the cost of the reactive medium compared with continuous barriers funnel and gate systems are always preferable when more expensive reactive materials are used to restrict the relatively high construction costs thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 the heterogeneous nature of the sub surface and aquifers makes the installation of prbs difficult therefore it is important to improve the effectiveness of prb by thorough site characterization to achieve reasonable long term remediation notably without the backing of a proper study before setting up the prb the performance may deteriorate over time thakur et al 2020 4 reactive mechanisms and materials in addition to the contaminant characteristics and groundwater chemistry the reactive media are crucial in the contaminant removal process ambrosini 2004 the removal mechanisms are mainly classified into two categories namely destructive and non destructive processes examples of destructive processes are abiotic and biotic dechlorinations wherein a toxic pollutant is transformed into less harmful or non toxic forms examples of non destructive processes are adsorption cation exchange precipitation and surface complexation the removal efficiencies of prbs depend on these processes as well as the applied design and reactive media contaminant removal also relies on the concentration and composition of the pollutant to be removed physical and chemical properties of the groundwater and hydrogeochemical conditions of the site he et al 2019 madzin et al 2016 in biochemical degradation processes such as redox reactions and microbial degradation the pollutants are either retained in the prb as less harmful substances or precipitated in other cases the contaminants may pass through the prb in the case of organic compound biodegradation the microbial enzyme changes these compounds to less or non toxic compounds such as co2 h2o inorganic compounds and biomass he et al 2019 suponik 2010 the biodegradation mechanism is favourable because the pollutants are removed via the processes of growth and metabolism of microorganisms by consuming the organic matter in groundwater with regard to redox reactions zvi is considered to be the most reactive redox material currently available and it releases electrons when exposed to chlorinated groundwater he et al 2019 in non destructive approaches such as physical adsorption and ion exchange the pollutant is adsorbed on the active material surface or forms precipitates to fix the pollutants in the prb reaction area physical adsorption of the pollutant on the large surface of the porous reactive material only involves van der waals interactions and the pollutant can be effectively removed from the groundwater he et al 2019 suponik 2010 thus the different mechanisms of active materials enable them to remove various substances for example activated carbon ac removes organic pollutants zeolites can effectively remove heavy metals and cationic surfactants can also be used for pollutant removal he et al 2019 zeolites zvi and ac satisfy the characteristics required for high efficiency groundwater remediation to remediate groundwater contaminants these conventional materials can be individually applied or combined at different percentages some studies presented a comparison of the pollutant removal efficiencies to determine the best materials for different degradation processes maamoun et al 2020 su and puls 2007 recently alternative materials for prb deployment such as sand apatite and straw based materials were proven effective the selection of the reactive media depends on many factors that impact pollutant removal some factors that directly affect the relative removal efficiency include the type concentration and required remediation method for a given contaminant along with the reactive materials reactivity and stability of the materials and the cost and availability of the reactive media the type and concentration of the target contaminant and the required remediation mechanism influence the selection of the reactive material the material must enable the degradation and removal of the contaminant within the residence time in the reaction zone he et al 2019 mcgovern et al 2002 further the reactive materials must be suitable for use in the given sub surface environment because the material s hydraulic performance is a function of its grain size bronstein 2005 he et al 2019 obiri nyarko et al 2014 balancing permeability and particle size are crucial as permeability is related to the particle size the permeability is higher for larger particles and the reaction time is shorter however in the case of larger particle size the contaminant plume will pass through more easily raising the overall cost because of the insufficient reaction in most cases the coefficient of permeability of the prb should be more than twice that of the aquifer he et al 2019 additionally the reactivity of the media should be determined to estimate the required residence time and size of the prb using the reaction rate and equilibrium constant bronstein 2005 to reduce the cost of extraction and replacement the reactive material must continue to be sufficiently stable to remove contaminants as secondary precipitates form over an extended period of time the formation of precipitates is influenced by adjusting the acidity and alkalinity of the water such that long term system operation can be realized bronstein 2005 he et al 2019 finally the availability and low cost of the reactive media are also important considerations in prb selection bronstein 2005 he et al 2019 obiri nyarko et al 2014 fig 2 illustrates a few factors that influence the selection of the reactive media the different types of reactive materials and their effects on groundwater remediation are discussed in the following subsections 4 1 zero valent iron zvi at present zvi is considered as the most efficient and commonly used type of prb reactive material more than 60 of the prbs globally are iron based and it has yielded successful results for different contaminants including non homogeneous inorganic organic and radioactive nuclide pollutants obiri nyarko et al 2014 thakur et al 2020 andrade and dos santos 2020 reported that zvi has many advantageous characteristics such as high specific surface area high reactivity strong reducing power e0 0 44 v and the ability to adsorb different contaminants thus zvi oxidizes and releases electrons into the contaminants in the groundwater via the reductive mechanism resulting in the precipitation or degradation of the contaminants thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 furthermore zvi is non toxic and inexpensive can be easily synthesized and requires little maintenance fu et al 2014 the effective removal rate of a contaminant primarily relies on the specific grain size and surface areas that are affected by the ph redox conditions and dissolved organic carbon notably zvi mechanisms involve both destructive and non destructive processes such as the degradation adsorption and transfer of ions in anaerobic conditions madzin et al 2016 the natural substances in groundwater such as nitrogen oxygen sulphur and carbon are considered the reaction partners affected by iron oxidation for example dissolved oxygen is considered a preferred electron acceptor in aerobic conditions ambrosini 2004 the synthesis and different reactions of zvi are expressed in eqs 10 15 andrade and dos santos 2020 fu et al 2014 naser and shahwan 2019 the reduction of ferrous ions in an aqueous solution carried out using borohydride is described in eq 10 oxygen availability enhances the oxidation of zvi forming a mixture of ferric oxyhydroxides or rust as demonstrated in eqs 11 and 12 the absence of oxygen results in the dissolution of zvi where water is the oxidant and the reduction of aqueous protons produces hydrogen gas as shown in eq 13 the anaerobic dissolution of zvi can be ensured owing to the presence of hydrogen gas and the increase in the ph values on the other hand zvi releases two electrons to oxygen to produce h2o2 which can be reduced to water via another two electron transfer from the zvi as shown in eq 14 finally the fenton reaction occurs by the combination of h2o2 and fe2 to produce strongly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals oh that are useful for several organic compounds as shown in eq 15 10 f e 2 2 b h 4 6 h 2 o f e 0 2 b o h 3 7 h 2 11 2 f e 0 z v i 4 h o 2

groundwater containing severe pollutants such as toxic heavy metals and organic compounds was successfully remediated the highly toxic arsenic was efficiently removed from synthetic water samples through a prb having a removal efficiency of 99 5 lee et al 2009 a batch kinetic study estimated a time scale of less than a few hours in typical conditions used for prb treatment where zvi 20 g l and arsenic 1 mg l the flow through columns operated at a flow rate of 2 ml h continuously for 360 days with the sampling time intervals being 90 150 230 and 360 days the removal rate decreased by 45 in aerobic and 39 in anoxic conditions implying that efficient arsenic removal necessitates the regular replacement of the reactive material in another study zvi efficiently removed the arsenic content in groundwater by maintaining the arsenic concentration at 10 μg l in the treated water in both the batch and column experiments for 180 days in each column abedin et al 2011 the arsenic concentration decreased exponentially with time and its removal was mainly affected by the contact time initial concentration and to a lesser degree the amount of iron njaramba et al 2020 investigated the removal of heavy metals arsenic and zinc using a zvi and pumice mixture both heavy metals were almost completely removed in a column reactor using the mixture however the removal mechanisms used were different arsenic was removed by coprecipitation and adsorption whereas zinc was adsorbed at the active sites at a constant hydraulic conductivity for 30 days as the pumice enhanced the porosity and inter particle distance between the zvi and the pumice the heavy metal pb ii was effectively removed by zvi by redox reaction and floc adsorption the initial pb ii concentration was 10 mg l the particle size of the iron powder was 400 mesh and the reaction time was 90 min although the initial pb ii concentration did not have a significant effect on the removal rate the smaller particle size and longer reaction time yielded better results further experiments were conducted to enhance the pb ii removal process the experiments indicated that 1 acid pre treatment improved the removal rate and decreased the iron powder amount and that 2 an increase in the iron sand mass ratio can increase the pb ii removal efficiency in the reaction column moreover the combination of zvi and sawdust was more stable and better than using zvi or sawdust alone 3 the addition of ac to zvi and sawdust showed physical adsorption and catalytic role in the reaction and produced micro electrolysis gao et al 2019 furthermore the mixture of zvi gravel and sand were investigated for the in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater containing cr vi by examining the resulting responses in the indigenous microbial community the results demonstrated the ability of the active reaction medium of 20 zvi to decrease the cr vi concentration from 27 29 242 65 mg l to 0 1 mg l the decrease in the concentration resulted from chemical reduction notably in this process the competitive growth of cr vi reducing bacteria was induced due to the zvi content in the prb moreover its enrichment in the downgradient part of the prb could aid in the further bio reduction of cr vi to cr iii the lifetime of a prb could be increased due to the secondary mechanism of cr vi bio reduction wang et al 2022 through this method multiple heavy metals were removed using zvi in batch and continuous flow column experiments the batch experiment results indicated that in single metal systems the removal efficiency for cu ii co ii cr ⅵ and as iii could reach 98 at equilibrium the results from the continuous test column filled with chitosan zvi were different the removal in 30 days was 98 84 for cu ii 88 28 for co ii 95 65 for cr ⅵ and 87 10 for as iii zhu et al 2022 a granular zvi prb was efficiently applied to remediate heavy metals such as copper and zinc in cold regions exposed to freezing notably both cu2 and zn2 ions were removed in the laboratory study during solution flow and freeze thaw cycles the hydraulic retention time decreased by 15 18 after the first set of freeze thaw cycling and it remained constant after the second set of freeze thaw cycling the uniformity in particle size distribution and particle agglomeration decreased whereas the hydraulic conductivity remained unchanged within the uncertainty associated with the calculation method statham et al 2015 the feasibility of using different granular mixtures for groundwater remediation with prbs was studied by bilardi et al 2019 in which the removal of cu2 ni2 and zn2 were examined using granular mixtures of zvi and lapillus with weight ratios of 30 70 and 50 50 the heavy metals were effectively removed through the two granular reactive media the removal sequence for the three heavy metals was cu zn ni in the case 50 50 mixture the experiment yielded a higher removal rate but the hydraulic conductivity strongly decreased in the long run thus adsorption was considered the main mechanism of removal for zinc and nickel granular zvi pumice mixtures were used to remove heavy metal ni more efficiently compared to the use of zvi alone the higher the zvi pumice weight ratio the higher the ni removal 74 removal was achieved for a 50 50 mixture 62 removal for a 30 70 mixture and only 40 removal for a 10 90 mixture after 3240 h of treating using 50 mg l of ni solution calabrò et al 2012 notably zvi and the granular mixtures of zvi pumice and zvi pumice in series were used to investigate nickel and copper removal for prb groundwater remediation the results indicated that the granular mixtures of zvi pumice 1 performed well 2 portrayed a metal removal efficiency comparable to that achieved by pure zvi and 3 maintained long term hydraulic conductivity moraci and calabrò 2010 the zvi was modified using raw wheat straw to check its geochemical stability for nitrate contaminated groundwater guo et al 2021 the lab scale results indicated that the removal of no3 was stable with 90 of no3 removed in 22 days of the hydraulic retention time using denitrifying bacteria 34 37 in contrast the field scale results indicated that the removal of no3 reached 60 at a flow rate of 0 01 m3 d nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi can also be used as a reactive material in a prb either alone or as a bi metallic mixture to achieve a high removal efficiency eljamal et al 2020 examined the effectiveness of the nzvi and bi metallic iron copper nanoparticles in removing phosphorus the bimetallic mixture resulted in an anti aggregation effect and enhanced the phosphorus removal by up to 2 2 times than that achieved using only nzvi furthermore using the mixture phosphorus removal was improved at a lower flow rate 10 ml min by 22 compared to that at a higher flow rate 60 ml min another experimental result indicated that stabilized nzvi could be used as an effective adsorbent for pb2 in a prb this is related to its advantages of high reducing power large surface area and excellent stability the removal efficiency was enhanced by reducing the initial concentration of pb2 and increasing the dosage of the stabilized nzvi tehrani et al 2015 table 1 summarizes the results of different zvi applications for groundwater remediation fig 3 highlights some of the successful applications of zvi in prbs for different contaminants 4 2 activated carbon ac activated carbon is widely used as a reactive material in prbs because of its high adsorptive power and ability to remove organic and inorganic pollutants prbs containing ac are also called permeable adsorptive barriers pabs this design was successfully applied for the removal of multiple pollutants such as tetrachloroethylene pce and trichloroethylene tce erto et al 2014 erto et al 2011 indicated that pabs remediated a pce contaminated aquifer to below regulatory limits thus validating the use of pabs in the effective in situ treatment of pce di natale et al 2008 removed the highly toxic heavy metal cd from a contaminated shallow aquifer using a pab thereby preventing river pollution with a long term efficiency of seven months the pab reduced the pollutant concentration peaks and kept the levels below the hazardous levels ensuring compliance with the environmental safety standards and validating the use of pabs in reducing pollution hazards the decrease in the removal rates with time can be addressed by integrating an electro kinetic ek process into a prb rather than replacing the reactive media which increases the cost in a previous study modified ac in prbs were effective in remediating nitrate contaminated groundwater in synthetically contaminated water wherein an electric gradient of 1 25 v cm was applied to the prb the adsorption capacity increased by 90 in optimum conditions and the nitrate concentration was maintained below the standard limit for approximately 111 h conversely the prbs without an electric gradient achieved the same results for approximately 59 h ghaeminia and mokhtarani 2018 recently a combined treatment system of granular activated carbon gac was utilized in a novel microwave mw based regenerating prb to remove cs from groundwater using batch and column setups this system was advantageous compared to the conventional prb systems and was potentially cost effective notably the prb longevity was calculated against groundwater velocity curves to estimate the performance response of the remediation activities and for the designing and upscaling of the combined mw prb treatment the mw prb system is more cost efficient than the conventional prb after 10 successive mw regeneration cycles the laboratory results indicated that the regeneration of cs via mw irradiation had high regeneration yields of 79 110 and low gac weight loss 6 78 falciglia et al 2020 in another study the removal of nitrate and phosphate from pit toilet leachate was investigated using waste by products mixed with effective proportions of traditionally used materials in prb systems mittal et al 2020 examined the use of fly ash fa and rice husk rh with various proportions of ac activated alumina aa and quartz sand qs they achieved a removal efficiency of more than 95 at ph 6 with a weight proportion of 1 2 1 2 4 for ac rh aa qs fa these results were well modelled using the langmuir isotherm model with a sorption capacity of 32 6 mg g for nitrate and 46 5 mg g for phosphate ions faisal et al 2020c also carried out landfill leachate contaminated groundwater remediation using sludge resin and ac the results of the batch and column tests indicated that a multi layered bed of sorbents could treat the leachate contaminated with cd ii nh3 n and dissolved organic matter represented by chemical oxygen demand cod the results were well described using the langmuir model the sorption capacities were 5 634 mg g for cd ii onto sludge 14 908 mg g for nh3 n onto the resin and 3 938 mg g for cod onto ac table 2 lists the different applications of ac reported for groundwater remediation fig 4 portrays the maximum adsorption sorption capacities for a few important contaminants from reported studies using ac in prb based on the langmuir model 4 3 zeolite zeolite is a crystalline hydrated aluminosilicate with small pores that is used in experiments because of its adsorptive and ion exchange capacities matsuda 2018 it can efficiently treat groundwater contaminated by a variety of pollutants such as heavy metals and ammonium owing to its high cation exchange capacity clinoptilolite is one of the most common natural zeolites used for groundwater remediation in previous studies different cation concentrations and practical sizes were investigated in batch tests to determine the optimum conditions for the removal of ammonium and heavy metals such as lead and copper park et al 2002 notably for experiments conducted using clinoptilolite the removal efficiency was more than 80 for all contaminants the only exception being water with high initial concentrations of ammonium and copper 80 and 40 ppm respectively the effect of the particle size was negligible in column test the hydraulic conductivity ranged from 2 10 3 to 7 10 4 cm s when sieved to an adequate size 0 42 0 85 mm and mixed with sands the strength property was similar to that of the soils in the aquifer the removal of ammonium from groundwater was studied in a pilot scale prb design using zeolite the removal occurred by sequential nitrification adsorption and denitrification in addition aerobic conditions were ensured through oxygen releasing compounds such that the microbial oxidization of nh4 n to nitrate could take place as a result the remaining nh4 n was removed abiotically li et al 2014 another prb study used oxygen releasing compound and clinoptilolite to remove ammonium nitrogen from groundwater the pilot test indicated an almost complete depletion for nh4 n at 99 a combination of oxygen release ion exchange biological nitrification and bio regeneration was observed in the prb process huang et al 2015a another study applied a sequential three zone prb of oxygen releasing compound clinoptilolite spongy iron to remove groundwater contaminated by ammonium nitrogen after 21 pore volumes the removal efficiency was as high as 90 43 for the influent dissolved oxygen concentration of 0 68 2 45 mg l and ph of 6 76 7 42 huang et al 2015b hydrocarbons such as toluene were successfully treated in cold regions along with variable water flows containing diphenyldichlorosilane coated zeolite indicating higher adsorption capacity and long term stability than that observed in previous studies the adsorption behaviour was slightly affected by temperature even under high flow rates and the regeneration tests ensured that the coated zeolite could be reused at least three times with high adsorptive power ma et al 2020 obiri nyarko et al 2020 explored the selection between zeolite and composite zeolite mixtures to remove dissolved lead from acidic water at ph of 2 4 in a column experiment the results indicated that the composite zeolite mixture provided better results than zeolite alone the maximum adsorption capacities were 0 097 and 0 151 mg g for zeolite and the composite zeolite mixture respectively and contaminant removal was achieved by both ion exchange and adsorption the authors observed a non equilibrium sorption effect accompanied by a decrease in the hydraulic conductivity by 2 and 28 8 for the zeolite and composite zeolite mixture respectively table 3 lists different reported zeolite applications for groundwater remediation groundwater can be remediated using more than a single permeable reactive material to obtain higher remediation efficiencies in previous studies activated carbon fibre acf was used to support a nzvi composite to remove cr vi from groundwater qu et al 2017 the study proved that acf inhibited the aggregation of the nzvi particles and increased reactivity the removal efficiency was increased by increasing the amount of nzvi on the acf and by decreasing the initial cr vi concentration furthermore by decreasing the initial ph values almost 100 of cr vi was removed in acidic conditions within 60 min of the reaction finally the removal efficiency depended on the co existing ions the removal of u vi can be promoted by zvi ac particles through micro electrolysis when citric acid mixed with ferric chloride was used as a composite electrolyte better results were obtained for the zvi ac mixture than those for only zvi or ac in prbs furthermore the feasibility of coupling an ek process with fe c prb was investigated a moderate increase in prb numbers and decrease in prb thickness improved the removal of u vi the best removal efficiency for u vi was 80 58 0 99 after 120 h under optimum conditions and the removal mechanism was related to the reduction of soluble u vi to insoluble u iv in the zvi ac mixture or the adsorption of ac or iron corrosion products regardless of the ph distribution xiao et al 2020 another study in 2022 demonstrated that coupling ek with zvi fe3o4 ac efficiently removed cr vi by up to 93 the reduction in cr vi was related to the high production of active fe2 from fe3o4 and surface micro electrolysis the lifetime could be prolonged due to a weak direct current supply that enhanced the system s electron transfer capability to maintain the redox process cao et al 2022 notably zvi and ac were both used in the treatment of nitrate contaminated groundwater using two layer prbs in two continuous up flow columns the first layer in the first column was filled with granular oxygen capturing materials to maintain anaerobic conditions and provide nutrition to the denitrifying bacteria in the second layer which was prepared from zvi powder sodium citrate and other inorganic salts the second column was filled with ac intended for the immobilization of the denitrifying microbial consortium the results revealed that the nitrate removal efficiency of the method was 94 and the metabolic intermediate nitrite could be further degraded liu et al 2013 in another study two laboratory scale reactors using zvi and a zvi zeolite mixture were used to investigate the effects of mixing the two reactive materials results indicated that the five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 cod increased from 0 32 to 0 61 and 0 6 in the two reactors moreover the removal efficiency was higher for the zvi zeolite mixture than that for zvi and zeolite exhibited selective removal with efficiencies of 97 2 99 6 95 9 95 2 90 5 and 97 4 for zinc manganese magnesium cadmium strontium and ammonium respectively jun et al 2009 zeolite was also used to support microscale zvi as a potential adsorbent for prbs to remove pb2 and cd2 the results indicated that the adsorption capacity could reach 154 61 mg g and 63 14 mg g for pb2 and cd2 respectively the composite adsorbent proved its high removal capacity over a wide ph range and during the presence of competitive ions in addition it could immobilize the products of pb2 and cd2 efficiently and decrease remobilization possibility even at low ph kong et al 2017 different mixtures of zvi zeolite and ac were examined for the remediation of heavily contaminated landfill leachate to obtain the optimum composite for prb materials having grain sizes of 0 01 0 25 3 0 5 0 and 0 7 1 0 mm respectively the results indicated that zvi and ac are the primary contributors to contaminant removal with the optimum weight ratio for removal being 5 1 4 for zvi zeolite ac to maintain adequate hydraulic conductivity the mixture reduced the contaminants cod by 55 8 tn by 70 8 ammonium by 89 2 nickel by 70 7 lead by 92 7 and 16 pah by 94 2 zhou et al 2014 furthermore statham et al 2016 remediated groundwater containing hydrocarbons and heavy metals by modifying the existing prbs into sequenced prbs using three sections the first section contained zeopro and gac for nutrient release and fuel sorption the second section contained granular iron and sand for capturing phosphorous and heavy metals and the third section contained zeolite for nutrient release and capturing excess iron the results confirmed that with the modification higher phosphorous removal could be achieved than that obtained using previously existing prbs this may be contributed to a decrease in the phosphorous concentration in the second section and the decrease in the iron concentration in the third section a comparison of the different reactive materials was also performed in terms of their removal efficiency maamoun et al 2020 examined the removal of cr vi from groundwater using nzvi bi metallic nzvi copper ac and sand zeolite s z mixture the results revealed that nzvi and nzvi copper both performed better with higher efficiencies 89 7 for nzvi and 84 1 for nzvi copper conversely ac and s z portrayed lower efficiencies of 23 01 and 14 0 respectively overall response surface methodology optimization portrayed that nzvi performed better than the other materials in terms of feasibility long residency 22 days and low cost barrier thickness 0 521 m with 95 2 desirability of its optimal solution carbonaceous solid materials cotton burr compost zvi and sediments were examined for their effectiveness alone and in a mixture to remediate the groundwater contaminated by nitrate the cotton burr composite alone showed significantly higher removal rates whereas mixing it with zvi and or sediment was not effective su and puls 2007 however further investigation is required for comparing the performances of different reactive materials with different contaminants 4 4 sulphate reducing bacteria and limestone permeable reactive barrier can be used to treat acid mining drainage physically chemically or biologically in fact prbs are considered to be the most promising treatment for acid mining drainage when compared to passivation in situ biological remediation lime neutralization waste heap covers and backfilling tigue et al 2019 the acid mining drainage method is characterized by high levels of sulphates metals and acidity gibert et al 2002 sulphate reducing bacteria in prbs can be used as a reactive filler to treat acid mining drainage it is capable of reducing sulphates to sulphides by deriving their energy from the oxidizing organic compounds and hydrogen molecules which react with metals to form metal sulphides as shown in eqs 16 18 cohen 2006 thakur et al 2020 16 s o 4 2 c h 3 c o o h 2 h h s 2 h c o 3 3 h 17 h 2 s h s h s 2 2 h 18 h s m e 2 m e s s h previous studies on the acid mining drainage treatment used sulphate reducing bacteria prbs gibert et al 2002 portrayed that the efficient treatment of acid mining drainage can be achieved using available organic matter the bacteria activity was maintained by satisfying nutrient requirements through a simple carbon substrate the residence time should be enough for a prb to overcome reaction rate limitations metal was removed through 1 sulphate reducing bacteria 2 metal precipitation and 3 processes related to ph increase rather than redox potential decrease which may result in metal precipitation of carbonates and hydroxides in a more recent study algae promoted sulphate reduction as an electron donor in acid rock drainage bioremediation ayala parra et al 2016a a synthetic medium of h2so4 and cu2 was fed into anaerobic granular sludge in inoculated columns the results indicated that sufficient sulphate was reduced in four months and the copper removal efficiency exceeded 99 5 another study conducted two column experiments to examine bacterial sulphate reduction and metal sulphide precipitation using simulated acid mining drainage water through mixtures of reactive organic carbon the results indicated that the sulphate removal rate in 14 months was 500 800 mmol d m3 the contents of iron reduced from 300 1200 to 0 01 220 mg l zinc from 0 6 1 2 to 0 01 0 15 mg l and nickel from 0 8 12 8 to 0 01 mg l waybrant et al 2002 moreover a mathematical model was used for simulating the sulphate reducing process experimentally validated through a fixed bed column laboratory scale prb the results indicated good agreement between the simulation and experimental results the model outputs were influenced by the sulphate reducing parameters at steady state conditions viggi et al 2011 organic carbon amended by zvi were examined to treat acid mine drainage organic carbon is essential for sulphate reducing bacteria and to enhance zvi remediation of acid mine drainage enhancement to prb performance could be reached by minimum addition of zvi however an optimum mixture of zvi to organic carbon is essential to be identified for long term acid mining drainage treatment lindsay et al 2008 another study treated acid rock drainage using a sulphate reducing bioreactor containing zvi it highlighted several advantages of using zvi as a substrate in sulphate reducing prbs including 1 promoting highly stable metal sulphides precipitation 2 driving sulphate reduction 3 decrease in fe2 ions discharge formed from corrosion in prb effluent and 4 neutralization of high acidic levels ayala parra et al 2016b additionally limestone is an alkaline material that can be used to treat acid mining drainage limestone is capable of adjusting the ph value to reduce the metal solubility and allow their precipitation careful control of the ph value will allow better metal removal due to different solubilities obiri nyarko et al 2014 the high acidic and metal water results from the weathering of minerals which are rich in sulphur and iron the overall reaction produces sulfuric acid and acidity at the surface as shown in eqs 19 and 20 in the case of underground environments the oxidation of iron resulted in further acid production and iron hydroxide as shown in eq 21 the high acidity increased the solubility of metals which necessitated ph adjustment turner et al 2005 19 4 f e s 2 15 o 2 14 h 2 o 4 f e o h 3 8 h 2 s

ability to target appropriate permeability values by mixing prb with low cost materials e g sand moreover limestone can be used under suitable geochemical conditioning in combination with microbial processes to treat metal contamination chromium aluminium iron nickel and manganese turner et al 2005 however limestone usage poses a few challenges such as 1 environmental problems including a rise in carbon dioxide content and groundwater hardness 2 decrease in barrier performance due to clogging obiri nyarko et al 2014 3 limited prior knowledge of manganese precipitation issues important when limestone is utilized as a filling material thakur et al 2020 torregrosa et al 2019 and 4 formation of hydroxide minerals and ferric carbonate which can reduce the longevity of limestone therefore replacement of reaction materials should be considered during the system design turner et al 2005 more studies are encouraged to use limestone for acid mining drainage locations while focusing on solving the current technical and environmental issues 4 5 other reactive media recently different materials were investigated by many researchers to test their feasibility as reactive media in prbs and examine their effectiveness in remediating groundwater containing different contaminants kumarasinghe et al 2018 examined the effectiveness of mixing three materials namely soil biochar and bricks as adsorbents to remove cadmium and lead the results proved that adsorption on the triple mixture was independent of ph and ionic strength the removal efficiency was 75 for cadmium and 95 for lead and the experimental isotherm was of the langmuir type sand prbs were examined by many researchers and their effectiveness in removing heavy metals and organic contaminants were established a sludge filter sand prb for removing toxic lead ions from contaminated groundwater was examined by faisal et al 2020b in a batch experiment which achieved a removal efficiency of 97 the sorption behaviour was well described by the langmuir isotherm model with a maximum capacity of 20 41 mg g an early breakthrough point can be attained if the bed depth is small or if the flow rate and metal concentration are high the removal of cd and cu ions in contaminated groundwater by coated sand iron oxide as prb reactive material was also examined these results portrayed better agreement with the langmuir isotherm model than with the freundlich model with the maximum adsorption capacities being 1 9 mg g for cd and 7 6 mg g for cu contaminant migration was delayed by the barrier because of an increase in the bed depth in combination with a decrease in the flow rate and inlet concentration abdul kareem and faisal 2020 faisal et al 2020a examined the removal of cd and cu ions from groundwater after the plantation of humic acid nanoparticles on inert sand through simple impregnation the batch tests indicated that the sorption data were well represented by the langmuir model and more than 98 removal efficiency was achieved with the maximum sorption capacities being 18 9 mg g for cd and 87 5 mg g for cu the humic acid nanoparticles were proved to have precipitated on the surface of the sand metal propagation was delayed because of a decrease in the concentration and flow rate at a specific bed depth rao et al 2020 examined the removal of toluene using a sand mixture and tyre crumb rubber in a prb using 2 5 of tyre crumb rubber and 97 5 of sand column 38 916 pore volumes of water contaminated by 0 15 mg l of toluene could be treated the adsorption of toluene was considered to be due to the van der waals attraction at the energetically heterogeneous sites of tyre crumb rubber particles following the freundlich isotherm and dubinin radushkevich equation furthermore the process was endothermic and expended greater energy for the dehydration of non polar molecules in aqueous solutions apatite and pyrite have been widely used as reactive media for prbs natural pyrite which is an iron sulphide material with extremely low iron and sulphur contents was investigated by liu et al 2015 to remove cr vi from groundwater the removal was influenced by the ph and was highly efficient in acidic conditions however the effects of ionic strength and natural organic matter on cr vi removal were negligible another study examined the use of an apatite ii prb for the removal of heavy metals such as zinc lead and cadmium conca and wright 2006 the mechanisms of immobilization for the three heavy metals differed in terms of the primary mechanism the removal mechanism of zn and cd was microbially mediated so4 reduction and the subsequent precipitation of sphalerite zns whereas the mechanism for the immobilization of lead was the precipitation of pyromorphite pb10 po4 6 oh cl 2 the removal efficiencies were high and the remaining concentrations of cd and pb zn so4 and no3 were 2 μg l 100 μg l 100 200 mg l and 50 μg l respectively hydroxyapatite coated quartz sand also portrayed significant remediation efficiency for the removal of uranium from an aqueous solution the removal was greatly influenced by the initial concentration of uranium reaching 75 32 when the initial uranium concentration was 5 mg l followed by sorbent particle size and hydraulic loading the transport behaviour was well modelled by the thomas and yoon nelson models and the breakthrough times varied in the different columns 100 12 251 91 d zhang et al 2020 iron turning waste was considered as an inexpensive and sustainable prb media to remove pesticides such as dieldrin endrin ddt and lindane the batch experiment demonstrated that the removal efficiency of lindane 41 was lower than that of other pesticides which ranged between 86 and 91 for 20 μg l for each pesticide after 10 min the acidic condition was preferred for pesticide removal the combination of iron turning waste with sand media in a continuous flow column setting simulating prb was able to effectively remove pesticides for at least 25 days abbas et al 2021 a prb based on calcium carbonate and consisting of limestone and crushed concrete was tested by wang et al 2016 for the remediation of groundwater containing high concentrations of iron and manganese the prb successfully removed the dissolved iron by 91 95 by mass in the first year of operation however this rate declined to 64 61 in the third year of operation the dominant removal mechanism for both iron and manganese was precipitation of carbonate minerals and the removal was enhanced by additional precipitation at higher ph associated with the crushed concrete slow release oxygen or a bio sparging containment wall can be used as an alternative to zvi for treating some contaminants in the case of petroleum hydrocarbon plumes the reaction is not amenable with zvi therefore slow release oxygen or bio sparging can be used instead an aerobic condition occurs within the wall which subjects dissolved contaminants to biodegradation when passing through the barrier speight 2020 slow injection or diffusion of oxygen or air are used in bio barriers designs to deliver amendments into the sub surface for avoiding the usage of substantial energy input for amendments delivery which may reflect on the operation and maintenance costs turner et al 2005 the idea of oxygen releasing compounds which are solid peroxides is to release oxygen slowly by dispersal in water accordingly a sufficient amount of oxygen is available for groundwater bioremediation from interstice microorganisms entrapment or encapsulation for oxygen releasing compounds is required to use solid peroxides in prbs examples of oxygen releasing compounds include mgo2 cao2 or na2co3 eqs 22 24 illustrate the formation of oxygen or hydroxyl radical

from 3 to 12 increased the dissolved oxygen from 4 mg l to 13 6 mg l and improved the stability of the nanoparticles to 70 d an increase in temperature from 4 c to 30 c also reduced the stability of calcium peroxide from 120 d to 30 d gholami et al 2018 another study focused on the effect of nanoparticles of calcium peroxide during naphthalene removal during the prb bioremediation process the alpha diversity analysis demonstrated that naphthalene presence decreased species richness gholami et al 2019b calcium peroxide and straw biochar were used as a new material in a prb to remove pah from contaminated groundwater prbs were designed and tested for the two materials namely wheat straw and coconut shell biochar depending on the self domestication mechanism of microbes to remediate the groundwater containing phenanthrene although the batch and column results indicated a 100 removal of the phenanthrene by both materials the coconut shell biochar was more promising pseudomonas and sphingomonas were seven times more abundant in coconut shell biochar than wheat straw thus proving the superiority of the coconut shell biochar and the release of organic carbon from coconut shell biochar was even more stable than that from wheat straw liu et al 2019 gholami et al 2019a examined the use of nanoparticles of magnesium peroxide encapsulated within sodium alginate as reactive prb material to remediate naphthalene and toluene as model contaminants for btex and pah compounds the encapsulation of magnesium peroxide decreased the negative impacts on the microbial flora in water and increased the stability of nanoparticles thereby enhancing the overall removal efficiency in this case naphthalene was more prone to biodegradation than toluene with the removal efficiencies reaching 100 at 20 d and 30 d respectively four different layers were designed to remediate the groundwater contaminated with pce in an anaerobic aerobic prb system the 1st layer was for oxygen capture to maintain the level of dissolved oxygen lower than 1 35 mg l in the influent water of the 2nd anaerobic layer the 3rd layer was for oxygen release to maintain the concentration level of dissolved oxygen higher than 11 3 mg l in the influent water of the 4th aerobic layer the design succeeded to control pce and its degradation by products the removal rates were 99 for pce 98 for tce 90 for dichloroethylene and 92 for vinyl chloride liu et al 2017 straw based materials for prbs were efficiently utilized for the denitrification processes in groundwater with the nitrate removal rates being 60 90 the secondary pollution was minimal because of the biochemical coupling reactions verifying the ability of the straw based materials as an effective alternative in situ material to woodchips wen et al 2020 notably the btex removal in a prb was examined using a real time polymerase chain reaction technique based on microbial community dynamics yeh et al 2010 the column study portrayed that the highest dissolved oxygen concentration of 5 08 mg l was obtained at the 40 level of calcium peroxide such that the ratio of calcium peroxide in the oxygen releasing compounds was 40 w w the removal efficiency was in the order ethylbenzene toluene p xylene benzene and p xylene ethylbenzene benzene toluene before and after shock loading thus both the aerobic degradation and changes in the microbial community structure were proven another study analysed the removal of btex at high concentrations through bioaugmentation using mycobacterium sp chxy119 and pseudomonas sp yato411 immobilized bead xin et al 2013 minimal oxygen supply was required for the bioremediation of btex by the immobilized bead for benzene toluene ethylbenzene and p xylene the actual mineralization rates were 10 8 10 5 5 8 and 11 4 and the degradation rates were 97 8 94 2 84 7 and 87 4 respectively and the groundwater toxicity decreased by 91 2 a variety of materials were tested in a mixture or individually to optimize their efficiency for remediating groundwater gravel and mulch mixture were utilized as the carbon source in prbs for the denitrification of groundwater under different no3 loadings the removal percentage was as high as 97 at the inlet concentrations below 280 mg l but decreased to 66 at a higher concentration of 530 mg l other heterotrophic processes revealed by the analysis of so4 2 co2 and ch4 included aerobic respiration sulphate reduction and methanogenesis gibert et al 2019 another prb with a mixture of clay illite and wood chips was also utilized for the remediation of groundwater contaminated using radioactive cs 137 and adequate performance and removal efficiency were confirmed torres et al 2017 the effectiveness of sodium alginate graphene oxide hydrogel beads as a reactive material to remediate groundwater from the antibiotics namely ciprofloxacin was investigated by zhao et al 2018 the isotherm data followed the freundlich model with the adsorption capacity reaching 100 mg g at the ph of 7 the adsorption process was influenced by contact time initial concentration and ionic strength but not by the ph in another experiment turner et al 2008 remediated fluoride from contaminated groundwater using a calcite prb and found that lowering the ph increased the removal of fluoride mass and that ph can be regulated through co2 addition the experimental and model results both showed 99 removal of fluoride 2300 mg l when co2 was injected directly into the barrier a recent 2022 study integrated in situ chemical oxidation and a prb using peroxydisulfate as the oxidant and copper oxide as the reactive barrier material in a novel system to remove chlorophenols the removal efficiency was affected by the following factors 1 removal efficiency was 90 when peroxydisulfate μm chlorophenol μm 1 2 removal efficiency decreased with increasing flow rates from 1 8 to 14 4 ml min and chlorophenol concentrations from 10 to 150 μm 3 removal efficiency decreased to 90 for 2 4 dichlorophenol and 85 for 2 4 6 trichlorophenol when real groundwater was used and 4 removal efficiency decreased to 20 for pentachlorophenol when high alkaline groundwater was used cho et al 2022 overall the previous applications of prbs in combination with different reactive materials or mixtures portrayed that the prb model s efficiency for groundwater remediation can be enhanced by controlling certain factors singh et al 2020 confirmed this and portrayed that multiple prbs provided better performance than single systems and natural attenuation additionally thick prbs performed better than thin prbs owing to longer residence times and consequently better reactivity moreover an optimum depth was important for achieving the maximum removal efficiency and retaining the treatment rate for a longer time table 4 and fig 5 portray the different reactive media and mechanisms used in prbs for successful groundwater remediation for different contaminants from reported studies heavy metals and organic contaminants are the pollutants most frequently removed by prbs using non conventional materials 5 prbs longevity and optimization a prb captures the contaminant on its surface and then transforms it into a less harmful form in other words the prb has a hydraulic capture function followed by reactivity functions accordingly a sufficiently long residence time is necessary for ensuring effective pollutant capture and the reaction and longevity of a prb s ability for maintaining these functions for long term hence it is important to determine the time over which the prb will work efficiently without any need for maintenance or replacement of the reactive media the interstate technology and regulatory council 2011 zvi is the only known medium that undergoes performance reduction with time because of the accumulation of secondary mineral precipitates that fill its pores and affects the hydraulic conductivity of the prbs notably the longevity could decrease due to insufficient or non uniform mass of the material obiri nyarko et al 2014 the longevity and monitoring of a prb directly affects both the operational and maintenance costs because replacement is always required as soon as the material is saturated with a pollutant gavaskar et al 2000 obiri nyarko et al 2014 studies on the enhancement of the long term performance of prbs without efficiency reduction are ongoing furthermore prb design is crucial in determining the construction costs for example the funnel and gate configuration requires less material which is preferable when using more expensive materials conversely the construction cost of continuous barriers is lower than that of funnel and gate barriers thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 furthermore some characteristics related to groundwater can affect the cost for example when the groundwater velocity is high the barrier construction cost may be higher as the barrier should be sufficiently thick to achieve the desired residence time additionally aquifer depth can influence the construction cost of the prb if the aquifer is too deep the cost will be higher however scientists are working to overcome depth constrains through innovative techniques such as jetting gavaskar et al 2000 although there are minor considerations related to prb economics groundwater remediation by prbs is generally considered a low cost technique with few environmental problems and low energy consumption due to the low requirements of continuous energy supply this consequently reduces the operating and life cycle costs moreover for this kind of in situ treatment above ground facilities for storage transport and disposal are not required because the contaminant is brought in contact with the reactive media underground the reactive media can last for years and technical and regulatory problems can be avoided using prbs day et al 1999 kankanige et al 2019 liu et al 2013 thiruvenkatachari et al 2008 although the cost of reactive media may be significant recently reactive materials such as ac were mixed with low cost materials e g sand that are effective for removing contaminants mittal et al 2020 moreover different materials have been examined as alternatives for the traditional or high cost materials to efficiently remediate groundwater either alone or by mixing with materials such as soil biochar bricks sand pyrite apatite ii hydroxyapatite straw based materials gravel and mulch mixture and clay illite and wood chip mixtures conca and wright 2006 faisal et al 2020b gibert et al 2019 kumarasinghe et al 2018 liu et al 2015 2019 torres et al 2017 wen et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however the cost estimates for these materials are still uncertain and need further investigation moreover the selection of low cost prb reactive materials which are not readily soluble or have low reactivity can result in the persistence of the reactive material over a long time maitra 2019 6 conclusions and aspects of future studies the contamination of groundwater remains a controversial problem owing to the difficult choices between the optimum reduction of different pollutants and the selection of cost effective treatment techniques to a certain degree this complexity was solved using prbs with high degrees of efficiency practicality and longevity in this review we examined the fundamental principles of contaminant removal from groundwater starting from the selection of a suitable study area through the examination of aquifer properties geotechnical and topographic factors hydrogeological characteristics and site geochemistry next we presented the most common modelling equations and discussed how modelling can aid in assessing optimum prb design furthermore we detailed the most typical prb designs including the funnel and gate continuous and sequential types highlighting the advantages of each one notably prbs can be applied in situ to remove pollutants on its internal surface by mainly two mechanisms namely destructive processes including abiotic or biotic transformations of harmful pollutants to less toxic forms and non destructive processes including adsorption ion exchange and precipitation in which pollutants are simply retained in the barrier different conventional reactive materials can be selected for prbs including zvi ac and zeolite among these reactive materials zvi has so far been the most widely applied material in prbs when these reactive materials are not combined adsorption is the most frequent remediation mechanism with other mechanisms exceeding half of the cases presented in this review the combination of two or more of these materials portrayed high percentages of removal up to almost 100 for some contaminants however the optimum weight ratio must be carefully examined for the highest removal results additionally using these materials in sequential designs will increase the efficiency of the model and remove several contaminants in addition sulphate reducing bacteria and limestone were used in prbs to treat acid mining drainage many other materials have been recently examined as alternatives to conventional materials such as soil biochar bricks sand pyrite apatite ii hydroxyapatite straw based materials gravel with mulch mixture and clay illite and wood chip mixtures these materials were successfully applied to remediate groundwater containing different contaminants such as organic heavy metals and radioactive substances with a high degree of removal efficiency finally the longevity and optimization of prbs were investigated to assure a maximum effect of prbs for groundwater remediation the optimal design was determined depending on both technical and economic analysis coupling prbs with ek processes could also save the cost of replacing reactive materials due to a decrease in the removal rates with time therefore prbs can be considered as an efficient low cost in situ method for groundwater remediation for a wide range of contaminants including organics and heavy metals with the appropriate selection of the design and reactive material in the most suitable location for a prb system the technique is highly effective in the remediation of groundwater contaminant plumes future studies must work towards improved prb monitoring for different site characteristics such as aquifer properties geotechnical and topographic factors and site geochemistry which are a vital aspect for the successful implementation and execution of this promising technology moreover effective prb monitoring can decrease the overall cost through replacement maintenance of material at the most suitable time this is a function of the medium s remediation capacity and can increase the performance of a prb model scientists are encouraged to develop more advanced monitoring tools based on the theoretical modelling of prb systems additionally the lengthy clean up time is considered a drawback for some locations and future studies may target solutions to further reduce the cost time and effort expended the cost of prbs may be reduced using less expensive reactive media without reducing the effectiveness of plume remediation notably future studies must use limestone for acid mining drainage locations while focusing on solving current problems related to technical and environmental issues in addition to provide a complete and accurate assessment of different materials used in prb systems a detailed investigation is still ongoing for the cost of non conventional materials that were successfully applied to remediate groundwater to determine whether they are more cost effective than the conventional media finally an additional scientific examination is required for the remediation of different contaminants such as uncontrolled hazardous waste and organic contaminants of emerging concerns such as pesticides pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds that may seep into groundwater funding this work was funded by the national water and energy center at uae university under projects no 31r191 declaration of competing interest

has been found that drinking water with salinity may lead to the risk of hypertension skin diseases infertility watery stool and severe respiratory illness abedin et al 2019 some coastal areas of bangladesh are facing massive disputes to meet the rising needs for freshwater because of excess saline water disturbance that prevents the fresh drinking water supply in coastal areas excessive extraction of groundwater has caused decreasing water levels of shallow aquifers that have been recharged by deep aquifers which ultimately result in groundwater salinization groundwater salinity has turned into a major crisis especially in the southwest coastal zone of bangladesh ahmed et al 2021 2022 in coastal zone of bangladesh the saline water interruption could alter the physico chemical characteristics of soil which could later have huge influence on the solid water boundary behaviors of heavy metals stumm 1992 in spite of high salinity in coastal aquifer the groundwater in several

geological system the geochemistry of groundwater is measured by different factors such as chemical weathering of rocks quality of input water from different sources and geology those processes are the responsible factors for changes in groundwater quality mostafa et al 2017 the geochemical processes in groundwater are determined by the major ion chemistry of groundwater which is controlled by weathering of minerals within the rocks bartarya 1993 on the other hand human activities influence on nature that result in anthropogenic sources of pollutant inputs when agrochemicals are used in land that result in increased mobilization of pollutants and their expansion sebastian et al 2020 several species of heavy metals like fluoride fe lead pb cadmium cd zinc zn mercury hg iron fe

affected zone this study concentrates on the groundwater quality in the southwest coastal region of bangladesh where salinity intrusion into the aquifers and freshwater swamp has been an always rising event and is increased through the rising of sea level which occurred by the worldwide climate change khanom 2016 moreover very little information is available on the groundwater quality hydrochemistry pollution level and probable health risk to humans across the experimental area at paikgacha upazila under the coastal zone of khulna district hence this study was carried out i to

environmental studies to determine the association between parameters classify the essential factors and sources that are accountable for variation of groundwater quality rahman et al 2014 multivariate statistical analysis was carried using spss 22 0 version for windows pca is a technique for transforming unique variables of a data set into new unrelated factors called principle components pcs which are graphical summations of the unique factors bhuiyan et al 2011 this practice involved data reduction and the extraction of a little quantity of hidden components for assessing associations between recognizable factors islam et al 2018 pca was utilized to take out principle components pcs from the sampling locations as well as to assess geographical alterations and potential origination of trace metals and corruption in water sources bodrud doza et al 2016 the most common technique is hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis which is used to generate groupings of samples with alike and dissimilar elements panda et al 2006 as well as to add useful data to pca outcomes generally the ward algorithmic approach is applied to calculate cluster analysis ca which is then squared the euclidean distance is used to determine how far apart clusters of related and dissimilar parameter content bhuiyan et al 2010 2 4 health risk appraisal of human 2 4 1 non carcinogenic

table 3 in the study area ph of the groundwater ranged from 6 66 to 7 08 with an average value of 6 88 indicating that the nature of the analyzed groundwater is acidic table 3 similar acidic groundwater was also observed from the adjoining shymnagar upazila of satkhira district in the southwest coastal zone of bangladesh rakib et al 2020 the potential acidification has been occurred probably due to oxidation of pyrite minerals in the southwest coastal zone of bangladesh benison and bowen 2015 ha et al 2019 rakib et al 2020 electrical conductivity ec of the study groundwater samples ranged from 462 68 to 5895 52 μs cm with a mean value of 2426 57 μs cm signifying the high concentration of salts in groundwater that can be classified as saline table 3 the higher average value of ec was also found to be 7135 67 μs cm in neighboring shymnagar upazila under satkhira district rakib et al 2020 the mean value of tds was found 1625 81 mgl 1 which ranged from 310 to 3950 mgl

2011b standard limit of tds is 1000 mgl 1 used for drinking purposes the higher amount of tds was measured from most of the sampling points the sea water interruption is the major reason for higher quantity of tds in the coastal groundwater of bangladesh miah et al 2015 the average concentration of tds in coastal aquifer in the other neighboring upazilas of khulna district was 1556 05 mgl 1 which was found by islam et al 2017 the present study also revealed that maximum salinity value was 15 405 ppt and the minimum value was 93 ppt with a mean value of 3520 84 ppt which was not in line with recommended limit table 3 total alkalinity of groundwater samples ranged between 361 48 and 1566 45 mgl 1 with a mean concentration of 874 57 mgl 1 which was greater than that of doe 1997 standard except the values from sampling stations s1 s3 s9 and s28 generally total alkalinity increased harshly as ph raised the total alkalinity is present in groundwater because of dissolved carbonate bicarbonate and hydroxide and is determined by neutralization titration lee et al 2006 sircus 2011 alkaline water along with high minerals tends to remove normal skin oils and cause too much drying of the skin miah et al 2015 in the present study the sodium ion concentration ranged from 65 20 to 929 13 mg l 1 with a mean concentration of 405 36 mg l 1 the sodium values observed in groundwater samples except sampling stations s1 s2 s6 s25 s26 s27 s28 and s30 in this study were exceeded the doe 1997 limit indicating that it may be detrimental to human health and also for the purposes of drinking datta et al 2011 the higher value of sodium might be owing to sea water disturbance into the aquifer system potassium values of maximum groundwater samples were within the doe 1997 standards for drinking uses table 3 the average concentration of k was found to be 117 59 mgl 1 all groundwater samples except sampling stations s25 s27 and s28 were crossed the limit value of doe 1997 for drinking purposes in addition the maximum concentration of k was established to be 17 05 mgl 1 in shallow groundwater of khulna district islam et al 2017 in the present study ca2 ranged from 58 93 to 156 45 mgl 1 with a mean value of 108 08 mgl 1 which was greater than doe 1997 standard mg2 was found in the range of 21 38 98 04 mgl 1 with a mean concentration of 46 57 mgl 1 all samples except 3 samples from s14 s27 and s28 stations exceeded the doe 1997 standard values of drinking water das et al 2021 also reported the average concentration of mg2 that was 25 12 mgl 1 in satkhira municipality of bangladesh the mean concentration of total hardness was 485 39 mgl 1 and 19 samples out of 31 samples were within the acceptable range of 500 mgl 1 according to doe 1997 and who 1998 maximum concentration of f was 1 16 mg l 67 1 m well depth and the minimum was 0 02 mg l 61 m well depth with an average concentration of 0 25 mg l that was smaller than the bangladesh standard 1997 and who 2011a guideline for drinking purposes table 3 the value of chloride was in the range of 36 21 2136 39 mgl 1 in coastal region high chloride concentration in groundwater sources may be owing to the sea water interruption adhikary et al 2012 rakib et al 2020 also found the average value of chloride 2940 78 mgl 1 in neighboring shymnagar upazila of satkhira district which was much higher than the present study all the samples showed much lower so4 2 contents than the prescribed standard 400 mg l of bangladesh doe 1997 the concentration of so4 2 in groundwater may be due to the dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite minerals it might also be arisen from leaching because the soil of coastal bangladesh is so4 2 and cl dominated emenike et al 2018 phosphate value of the study groundwater ranged between 3 2 and 32 5 mgl 1 with an average value of 10 91 mgl 1 total 26 groundwater samples showed much higher po4 3 contents than the prescribed standard 6 mgl 1 of bangladesh doe 1997 the present analyses revealed that no3 contents were in the range of 0 02 0 11 mgl 1 with an average value of 0 056 mgl 1 which was within the acceptable range of doe 1997 standard for drinking purposes bicarbonate in the study groundwater varied between 432 07 and 1617 06 mgl 1 with a mean value of 914 24 mgl 1 which was much higher than the average hco3 value of 221 42 mgl 1 observed by islam et al 2020 in the coastal belt of bangladesh generally the weathering of carbonate and silicate minerals together with organic substances deposition from sunderbans mangrove forest might be responsible for high concentrations of hco3 in groundwater das et al 2021 rina et al 2012 the value of fe in the groundwater samples ranged from 0 32 to 6 38 mgl 1 with an average concentration of 2 96 mgl 1 that exceeded the doe 1997 standard for consumption purposes table 3 the elevated concentrations of fe in the study groundwater might be due to decline of oxyhydroxides via the biodegradation of organic resources bodrud doza et al 2016 mn value in the study samples ranged from 0 02 to 0 3 mgl 1 with an average value of 0 09 mgl 1 that did not exceed the value of bangladesh standard doe 1997 except the values from sampling stations 24 and 31 rakib et al 2020 found the much higher average value of mn 1 22 mgl 1 in coastal groundwater of the neighboring shymnagar upazila under satkhira district in the study area as values were in the range of 0 004 0 12 mgl 1 with the mean value of 0 05 mgl 1 arsenic as values of maximum sampling stations were exceeded the standard value of doe 1997 for drinking purposes rakib et al 2020 found an average as value of 0 02 mgl 1 in coastal groundwater of shymnagar upazila of satkhira district in the southeast coastal area of bangladesh as values were found in the range of 0 00021 0 02425 mgl 1 with mean value of 0 00393 mgl 1 islam et al 2021 however as concentration in the study groundwater was higher compared to other coastal regions of bangladesh 3 2 spatial variation of hydro chemical elements and trace metals in groundwater spatial distribution of hydro chemical elements cations anions and some trace metals of groundwater samples in the sampling zone of paikgacha upazila are represented in fig 3 a d fig 4 a f and fig 5 a c these spatial distribution maps were interpolated by utilizing arcgis 10 5 version from the maps it was obviously exhibited that the concentrations of all physico chemical parameters cations anions and trace metals assorted from site to site with respect to the depth of tube wells in the study region 3 3 sources of ions and controlling factors of groundwater quality the groundwater quality data were subjected to principal component analysis pca by means of varimax rotation and kaiser normalization the summation of variance of the factor coefficients was utilized in varimax rotation to examine the various sources of physico chemical variables and metals that affect the quality of studied groundwater systems gotelli and ellison 2004 islam et al 2021 the loading plot of the five 5 important factors pc1 pc2 pc3 pc4 and pc5 along with percentages of variance and cumulative percentages from the pca is presented in table 4 five 5 factors were derived for the data sets of groundwater quality on the basis of the condition of eigenvalues 1 explaining 39 29 13 87 11 14 7 41 and 7 0 of the total variance in the current experimental zone as well an eigenvalue denotes a measure of the importance of the factors such as the factors with maximum eigenvalues are considered as the most significant thus eigenvalues 1 0 are considered as significant in factor loadings kim et al 1978 in accordance with liu et al 2003 the factor loadings can be categorized as strong for 0 75 moderate for 0 75 0 50 and weak for 0 50 0 30 the scree plot graph is widely utilized to identify the numeral of principal components of the fundamental data arrangement liu et al 2003 the scree plot fig 6 a represented the selected eigenvalues from big to little as a function of the principal component number pcs this plot is used to identify the number of pcs to be retained to understand the underlying parameter s structure besides this figure also exhibited a distinct alteration of slope after the 12th eigenvalue five components or factors are placed about 64 30 of the total variance has been shown in the first 3 loading factors pc1 pc2 and pc3 in the study samples of groundwater fig 6b the positive and negative scores in pcs in table 4 indicated that the majority of study groundwater samples were either fundamentally influenced or uninfluenced through the existence of derived loads on a single factor component bhuiyan et al 2016 as presented in table 4 pc1 is the most important explaining 39 29 of the total variance with strong positive loading on ec tds salinity cl na k ca2 mg2 and total hardness and with weak positive loading on total alkalinity the high considerable optimistic loadings values 0 823 0 933 of salinity linked variables such as ec tds cl and na that may improve the dissolution rate of several pollutants in the coastal region s rock water interaction umarani et al 2019 and this has an impact on groundwater quality which could be altered by ionic or opposite ionic exchange liu et al 2003 the pc1 was also resulting from mixed origin for instance salinity from the sea water intrusion into the coastal aquifer bodrud doza et al 2016 the pc2 in the groundwater quality data structure represented 13 87 of total variance and strongly positive loaded with f and moderately loaded with total alkalinity moreover the pc2 also positively weak loaded with ec tds salinity cl po4 3 hco3 na and negatively loaded with mg2 here f was produced by geogenic sources with similar chemical properties to groundwater sources rahman et al 2021 besides strong influence of sea water intrusion in the coastal ecosystem a significant amount of fertilizers and pesticides utilization in the farming land might result in extreme amount of ionic replace which might enhance the dissolution of ionic variables islam et al 2021 the pc3 elucidated 11 14 of total variance that exhibited a moderate and considerable positive loading on so4 2 po4 3 hco3 and negatively loaded on no3 and weak positive loading on total alkalinity however the pc3 explained that the no3 so4 2 and po4 3 derived from the anthropogenic sources which were from the discharge of so4 2 and chemical fertilizers in the study area with too much utilization of agrochemicals wagh et al 2017 the pc4 accounting for 7 41 of total variance was moderately loaded on as positively and fe negatively and could be attributed to the abundance of fe as crustal structure and it was accomplished that this factor was geogenic in environment ahmed et al 2019 bhutiani et al 2016 omo irabor et al 2008 however pc4 also showed weak positive loading on ph explained that the as and ph might be positively influenced by sea water interruption which might increase the concentrations of every variable in the coastal groundwater islam et al 2021 aside from that the disintegration of parent rock in the study groundwater resulted in watery as and ph both of which were associated to as release islam et al 2019 finally pc5 represented 7 00 of total variance in the study groundwater parameters and showed significant strong loading on mn moderate loading on ph and weak loading on hco3 the high level of mn might be the derivative from the assorted sources like salinity from the sea water intrusion flooding of farming land etc islam et al 2021 3 4 spatial similarity of analyzed parameters the cluster analysis ca placed nine 9 major clusters for data structure of the experimented hydro chemical elements ca was used to represent the hydro chemical parameters and trace metals grouping in the data arrangement of groundwater and the outcomes are revealed in fig 7 in general elements belonging to the similar group were about to be originated from an equivalent sources bhuiyan et al 2016 in fig 7 cluster 1 incorporated ec tds na cl and salinity which were positively interrelated with elevated salinity problems in the groundwater of coastal area moreover it also exposed that the distinctiveness of the pollutants was mostly alike with respect to loads source and level of contagion rakib et al 2020 cluster 2 consisted of k and it represented the leakage of chemical elements as fertilizers from the soil horizon to the groundwater bodrud doza et al 2016 cluster 3 grouped with ca2 mg2 and total hardness and these ions attributed to geogenic effect as a result of rock water contact such as erosion of limestone dolomite calcite or magnesite or chemical weathering of parent materials badmus et al 2020 cluster 4 contained po4 3 hco3 total alkalinity and reflected by the suspension of carbonate minerals islam et al 2017 kwame and bawa 2022 cluster 5 consists of f and exhibited the rock weathering into the groundwater cluster 6 donated by fe and signified the rock water interface into the groundwater eaton et al 2014 cluster 7 and cluster 8 incorporated with so4 2 as and ph which elucidated through the suspension of minerals below the basic circumstances bodrud doza et al 2016 finally cluster 9 consisted of no3 and mn representing the pollution by household and industrial activities omo irabor et al 2008 3 5 human health risk evaluation table 5 summarized the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks of groundwater contamination for both adults and children via oral routes in table 5 for groundwater the hazard index hi values ranged between 0 70 and 3 76 with a mean value of 2 26 for adults and 1 38 to 7 48 with a mean value of 4 49 for children it has been shown that the mean concentration of hi of the selected parameters for adults was 1 hi 4 indicating a moderate non carcinogenic health risk for adults and for children was 4 hi indicating a high non carcinogenic health risk of children in the present study hq values for arsenic as ranged from 0 06 to 1 89 with a mean value of 0 79 for adult and from 0 12 to 3 75 with an average value of 1 57 for children according to usepa 2001 if hq 1 it is considered as an undesirable threat of non cancer influence on human body and if hq 1 then it is considered as an acceptable level with regard to hq values in the present study the hq values for as were considered within acceptable level for adults and as objectionable risk of adverse non carcinogenic consequences on health for children excessive ingestion of trace metals and other elements and durable chronic contact to these elements may have harmful consequences on human health the hqoral values for both adults and children in coastal aquifer are presented in fig 8 table s1 and table s2 with respect to experimental water the elevated non cancer risk locations were chiefly in mothbari s5 laxmikhola s7 alomtola s8 loskor s9 katakhali s10 moukhali s11 gojalia s12 patkelpota s15 basakhali s16 goraikhali s17 santa s18 deluti purbopara s20 deluti dakshinpara s21 lota purbopara s22 lota majherpara s23 lota bazar s24 protapkati s29 and 4 no batikhali s31 overall these areas shaped the major non cancer risk points that were not appropriate for ingestion of water regards and need to pay further concentration by everyone in addition sea water intrusion climate change shrimp cultivation and human and agricultural activities might be the high risk sites for contamination sources and the administration sector should be strengthened for the management procedures besides the discharge and mobilization of trace metals like as mn and fe from different sources in groundwater may affect the chemistry of hydro chemical properties in aquifer tong et al 2021 the spatial map of the non cancer health risk values for both adults and children via oral route is shown in fig 8a and b respectively according to the spatial analysis of hioral for adults moderate non carcinogenic 1 hi 4 health risks were observed in all parts of study area fig 8a whereas hioral values for children were found 4 hi in the northeast southeast and southwest sides of the experimental zone fig 8b indicating elevated non carcinogenic risk for children health in addition moderate non carcinogenic health risks 1 hi 4 are found for children in the northwest portion of study zone fig 8b arsenic is the major contributor among the chosen elements which causes undesirable health influence on the human health both adults and children hence the cancer risk of as were designed for both adults and children in this study and presented in table 5 in carcinogenic risk cr analysis of human health table 5 the carcinogenic risk cr of arsenic as for adults in the groundwater samples varied from 1 9 10 4 to 5 7 10 3 with an average value of 2 4 10 3 on the other hand the carcinogenic risk of as for children ranged from 4 0 10 4 to 1 1 10 2 with the mean value of 5 0 10 3 the mean value of cr for as for both adults and children were 10 4 which implies that cancer risk is high on both adults and children it is notable that children are much more at threat to trace metal contamination of groundwater due to greater water drinking rates 1 25 l compared to their body mass 20 kg whereas adults ingestion rate is 2 2 l compared to their body mass of 70 kg islam et al 2020 the spatial allocation maps of cancer health risk cr for both adults and children in the experimental zone are exhibited in fig 8c and d respectively in accordance with the spatial distribution of cancer risk for arsenic as it is proved that cancer risk is high cr 0 0001 for both adults fig 8c and children fig 8d due to contact of the groundwater contaminants in all sides of the study area the allocation of spatiality was as southwest southeast northeast northwest areas fig 8c and d the health risk level via oral route is very much undesirable for both groups of people adults and children in the current analyses since oral ingestion has a connection to the metabolic pathway which may be due to extended contact period kabir et al 2021 and similar outcomes were also observed in the southern laizhou coastal bay of china wen et al 2019 it has been established that extended period of exposure of as via drinking water could occur probable cancer risk of health like liver cancer lung cancer bladder cancer kidney cancer and skin cancer non carcinogenic risk such as hypertension cardiovascular diseases and neuropathy can also occur due to intake of as bearing groundwater phung et al 2017 it is proved that children are especially more vulnerable to as exposure because as connects to neurological diseases in the premature life stages calatayud et al 2019 a considerable unenthusiastic outcome might happen on neurodevelopment of child with exposure of as among the ages of 5 15 years old rodríguez barranco et al 2013 in bangladesh elevated as rich drinking water approximately 0 05 mgl 1 might cause decreased brain task on children wasserman et al 2004 finally increased heavy metals and long term salinization played an instantaneous function in assessing water quality with respect to human health hazards as a result considerably more concentration should be paid to as value in future and well organized management is required to control undesirable impacts on the local environment and human health 4 conclusion the present study identified the current status of groundwater quality in paikgacha upazila under the coastal zone of khulna district in most groundwater samples ec tds na cl hco3 po4 3 fe and total alkalinity exceeded the acceptable limits of who and doe for drinking purposes pca contributed to make out the factors responsible for 19 variations into 5 significant pcs that explain 78 71 information of the data set pc1 is explaining 39 29 of the total variance with strong positive values on ec tds salinity na k ca2 mg2 cl and total hardness factors obtained from the pca indicated that these ions may increase the dissolution rate of much pollutants in rock water interaction in the coastal area and could have influenced via ionic or opposite ionic exchange and resulting from mixed origins from sea water intrusion into the coastal aquifer and from anthropogenic sources cluster analysis classified the 19 parameters into nine 9 clusters indicating that these parameters may be ascribed to geogenic influence resultant from the rock water relations and anthropogenic sources that are similar to results obtained from pca in addition a significant health risk of human might appear because of the intake of contaminated groundwater in the study zone not only ec tds na ca2 mg2 cl and hco3 but also trace metals like fe mn and as might be a considerable threat issue in the study region conversely spatial distribution maps established that all parts of the study area possess moderate non carcinogenic health threat to adults and the northeast southeast and southwest parts also possess high non carcinogenic health risk to children moreover relatively high carcinogenic risk for as may occur to both children and adults in all parts of the study zone in this study most of the studied tube wells are affected by salt water which results in the causes of hypertension for coastal people especially for women high saline water may also increase the risks of eclampsia high blood pressure as well as infant mortality in order to mitigate the salinity of drinking water rainwater harvesting and storage system pond sand filter psf managed aquifer recharge mar water and solar desalinization plants are suggested in controlling the water salinity in the study area this is the first research work covering the study area to evaluate groundwater quality via multivariate statistical analysis pollution load index and health risk assessment along with spatial analysis the

11671,the higher salinity and other physico chemical elements along with trace metals have become a major risk in the coastal areas of bangladesh this study investigated the quality of physico chemical parameters and some trace elements along with the appraisal of potential human health risk in groundwater groundwater samples were collected from 31 pre selected tube wells of the study area and analyzed for ph ec tds major cations anions and some heavy metals almost all the parameters including heavy metals in groundwater were found much higher than the standard permissible limits increased major cations and anions in groundwater samples represent the presence of seawater in coastal aquifers and increased heavy metals indicate the presence of anthropogenic actions principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis were also performed to establish the pollution source and controlling factors which indicated the groundwater mainly influenced by geogenic evolutions along with some anthropogenic sources chronic health risks of cations and anions exposure via oral route were identified by calculating the hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi for both adults and children results reveal that non carcinogenic health risk may occur moderately to adults and highly to children spatial distribution analysis reveals that study area possesses a high cancer risk of arsenic as for both adult and children due to consumption of contaminated groundwater for long time finally this research clearly represented the groundwater quality challenges by taking into consideration the multi hazards in the study area that will help taking initiative for the development of sustainable treatment policies to remove the pollution from groundwater in future graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater coastal region human health risk appraisal multivariate analyses data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction groundwater acts as a fundamental function for the nourishment of living beings and is regarded as a protected storage of quality water batabyal 2018 martínez pérez et al 2022 because of its quick accessibility and normal security from microbial contamination it is utilized as the global key sources for ingestion agricultural and industrial purposes in many countries peng et al 2022 saha et al 2018 selvam et al 2017 in spite of the importance of groundwater the quality of this natural resource is not governed properly diverse contamination factors such as climate change excess groundwater extraction surface water characteristics subsurface geochemical reactions geological locations distinctive rainfall and human activities are the major important issues which influence the quantity and quality of groundwater directly and indirectly krishna kumar et al 2014 recently it has been reported that groundwater may also be contaminated by pathogenic viruses that enters through the fractures of aquifers kumar et al 2020 however these contamination factors of groundwater may have severe health influence because of their poisonous perseverance and cancer risk in environment naz et al 2016 rahman et al 2017 because of drinking unsafe water millions of people are suffering from various water related sickness like diarrhea cholera typhoid and parasites in the developing countries khan et al 2011 it has been found that drinking water with salinity may lead to the risk of hypertension skin diseases infertility watery stool and severe respiratory illness abedin et al 2019 some coastal areas of bangladesh are facing massive disputes to meet the rising needs for freshwater because of excess saline water disturbance that prevents the fresh drinking water supply in coastal areas excessive extraction of groundwater has caused decreasing water levels of shallow aquifers that have been recharged by deep aquifers which ultimately result in groundwater salinization groundwater salinity has turned into a major crisis especially in the southwest coastal zone of bangladesh ahmed et al 2021 2022 in coastal zone of bangladesh the saline water interruption could alter the physico chemical characteristics of soil which could later have huge influence on the solid water boundary behaviors of heavy metals stumm 1992 in spite of high salinity in coastal aquifer the groundwater in several coastal district of bangladesh experienced elevated amount of a number of heavy elements like arsenic manganese and iron islam et al 2017 recently few studies have concentrated on groundwater deterioration because of salinity natural as well as human involvement due to social and biophysical aspects das et al 2017 rakib et al 2020 generally natural processes and anthropogenic activities control the groundwater quality naturally parent rock interacts upon water and results in the dissolution of mineral that is provided by a pathway for ions accumulation in groundwater the quality of groundwater of a specific aquifer greatly depends on the sub surface geochemical processes precipitation recharged water and surface water during the groundwater movement through the pore spaces of rocks a significant chemical reaction occurs that exists in the geochemistry of groundwater amadi et al 2012 geochemistry uses the principles of chemistry for explaining the mechanisms that occur in geological system the geochemistry of groundwater is measured by different factors such as chemical weathering of rocks quality of input water from different sources and geology those processes are the responsible factors for changes in groundwater quality mostafa et al 2017 the geochemical processes in groundwater are determined by the major ion chemistry of groundwater which is controlled by weathering of minerals within the rocks bartarya 1993 on the other hand human activities influence on nature that result in anthropogenic sources of pollutant inputs when agrochemicals are used in land that result in increased mobilization of pollutants and their expansion sebastian et al 2020 several species of heavy metals like fluoride fe lead pb cadmium cd zinc zn mercury hg iron fe manganese mn arsenic as etc are available in concentration higher than the who standard in groundwater these heavy elements affected the human or animal health either by drinking or inhaling and caused comprehensive harms to brain liver and kidney hutchinson and meema 1987 among the above heavy metals arsenic as is considered one of the most toxic chemicals in nature elevated concentration of arsenic 0 010 mgl 1 in groundwater was identified in over hundred countries in the world herath et al 2016 in groundwater higher concentration of as affected the quality of drinking water causing extremely detrimental to human or animal health kumar and puri 2012 excessive consumption of fe may cause hemachromatosis that can destroy body organs colter and mahler 2006 other symptoms like weight loss fatigue and joint pain could occur because of excess fe in drinking water increased amount of mn consumption for long time may cause neurological disorder who 2011b and also unlikely responsible for cancer or reproductive damage usepa 2004a in the past many scientists conducted their research either for removal or reduction of dissolved heavy metals from water chakraborty et al 2012 gorchev and ozolins 1984 there are some traditional techniques or methods to remove heavy metals from groundwater that include ion exchange coagulation flocculation precipitation filtration carbon adsorption and oxidation reduction however these methods have some disadvantages and reduced performances kapahi and sachdeva 2019 mani kumar 2014 no doubt membrane technology is most suitable for removal of heavy metals from groundwater kehrein et al 2020 recently many scientists reported effect of membrane technology on human health algieri et al 2022 groundwater cleaning by reject of iron ore slime rios sarkar et al 2021 and integrated membrane systems using nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro gharsallah et al 2022 in bangladesh few researchers bodrud doza et al 2020 islam et al 2021 rakib et al 2020 worked on groundwater quality and reported increased amount of trace metals in several coastal districts of bangladesh mainly increased abundance of iron fe manganese mn and arsenic as has been identified in their works islam et al 2017 reported high as values from 1 04 to 19 24 μgl 1 with mean value of 7 0 μgl 1 and lower values of mn in patuakhali district of bangladesh rahman et al 2017 studied the groundwater of gopalganj district of bangladesh and reported as concentrations from 5 0 to 198 0 μgl 1 with mean value of 37 17 μgl 1 fe concentrations from 0 9 to 25 2 μgl 1 with mean value of 5 12 μgl 1 and mn concentrations from 0 1 to 0 94 μgl 1 rakib et al 2020 investigated the groundwater quality of shyamnagar upazila under satkhira district and found increased average values of as mn and fe as 16 55 μgl 1 1 22 μgl 1 and 4 9 μgl 1 respectively however high level of heavy elements in groundwater might intensify the health risks of coastal people in the salinity affected zone this study concentrates on the groundwater quality in the southwest coastal region of bangladesh where salinity intrusion into the aquifers and freshwater swamp has been an always rising event and is increased through the rising of sea level which occurred by the worldwide climate change khanom 2016 moreover very little information is available on the groundwater quality hydrochemistry pollution level and probable health risk to humans across the experimental area at paikgacha upazila under the coastal zone of khulna district hence this study was carried out i to investigate the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater through hydrochemical analyses ii to determine the pollution sources and controlling factors by using principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca and iii to assess the potential human health risk utilizing health risk parameters like chronic daily intake cdi hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi along with the spatial distribution maps 2 materials and methods 2 1 background of the study area this study focused on paikgacha upazila with an area of 411 19 km2 which is the southwest coastal part of khulna district bangladesh geographically the study area is located between 22 35 3 ń latitude and 89 20 2 ś longitude shown in fig 1 this study area covered ten union parishads and one municipality with total population of 225 085 and population density of 550 km2 this upazila is bounded by batiaghata and dacope upazila on the east assasuni upazila on the west koyra upazila on the south and tala and dumuria upazila on the north there are some small rivers like shibsa kobadak haria marichop and mora bhadar gang etc which flow through this upazila this upazila comprises a low lying coastal plain with a complicated network of rivers that gently slopes into the bay of bengal in the south the underlying alluvial aquifer system is hydraulically linked to a complicated river and channel network the geology of this area is a component of the bengal basin s overall quaternary geology this is the slightly populated and quality water deficient area the people of this area are severely suffering from shortage of drinking water especially in the dry season they mainly depend on groundwater for their drinking and other purposes considering the above issues thirty one tube wells have been selected for sampling which covered almost entire paikgacha upazila see fig 2 2 2 sampling process and analytical design groundwater samples were collected from 31 pre selected tube wells of the study area paikgacha upazila khulna in dry november season geographic location of each tube well was determined by gps explorist 200 megellan according to well depth ranges samples were taken from two types of tube wells 1 intermediary tube wells 71 145 m depth and 2 superficial tube wells 15 70 m depth the sampling points of the study area are presented in fig 1 prior to sampling each tube well was pumped for at least 5 10 min and pre cleaned high density polypropylene bottles were used for sample collection following the standard method ahmed et al 2019 eaton et al 2014 habib et al 2020 and

and metals are expressed in mgl 1 2 3 multivariate statistical analysis principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca are multivariate statistical techniques that are commonly utilized in environmental studies to determine the association between parameters classify the essential factors and sources that are accountable for variation of groundwater quality rahman et al 2014 multivariate statistical analysis was carried using spss 22 0 version for windows pca is a technique for transforming unique variables of a data set into new unrelated factors called principle components pcs which are graphical summations of the unique factors bhuiyan et al 2011 this practice involved data reduction and the extraction of a little quantity of hidden components for assessing associations between recognizable factors islam et al 2018 pca was utilized to take out principle components pcs from the sampling locations as well as to assess geographical alterations and potential origination of trace metals and corruption in water sources bodrud doza et al 2016 the most common technique is hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis which is used to generate groupings of samples with alike and dissimilar elements panda et al 2006 as well as to add useful data to pca outcomes generally the ward algorithmic approach is applied to calculate cluster analysis ca which is then squared the euclidean distance is used to determine how far apart clusters of related and dissimilar parameter content bhuiyan et al 2010 2 4 health risk appraisal of human 2 4 1 non carcinogenic ncr health risk evaluation the health risk assessment hra is a crucial method for shaping the relationship between specific environmental contamination and human health human health risk evaluation also refers to the procedure of estimating the character as well as likelihood of severe health consequences in individuals who may be uncovered to chemicals in polluted ecological media at present or in the upcoming suggested by the united states environmental protection agency usepa the evaluation of the chance of any known amount of negative health impacts occurring during a specific period of time is known as health hazard appraisal bortey sam et al 2015 hra entails i identifying threat indices of probable hazard sources ii calculating risk indices values and iii measuring the health effects of exposure ni et al 2010 this appraisal is typically occurred on the basis of hazard point estimation and uttered in terms of cancer and non cancer health risks usepa 2009 the chronic daily intake cdi of parameters is determined using the subsequent equation which takes into account both oral and cutaneous exposure pathways karim 2011 usepa 1989 1 c d i c w i r e f e d b w a t where cdi

human health usepa 2004b 3 results and discussions 3 1 general hydrochemistry of groundwater the status of various hydro chemical parameters and trace elements in groundwater sources has been shown in table 3 in the study area ph of the groundwater ranged from 6 66 to 7 08 with an average value of 6 88 indicating that the nature of the analyzed groundwater is acidic table 3 similar acidic groundwater was also observed from the adjoining shymnagar upazila of satkhira district in the southwest coastal zone of bangladesh rakib et al 2020 the potential acidification has been occurred probably due to oxidation of pyrite minerals in the southwest coastal zone of bangladesh benison and bowen 2015 ha et al 2019 rakib et al 2020 electrical conductivity ec of the study groundwater samples ranged from 462 68 to 5895 52 μs cm with a mean value of 2426 57 μs cm signifying the high concentration of salts in groundwater that can be classified as saline table 3 the higher average value of ec was also found to be 7135 67 μs cm in neighboring shymnagar upazila under satkhira district rakib et al 2020 the mean value of tds was found 1625 81 mgl 1 which ranged from 310 to 3950 mgl 1 in the present study table 3 the most acceptable limit of tds value is 500 mgl 1 for domestic purposes and up to 1000 mgl 1 is the highest allowable limit recommended by doe 1997 according to who 2011b standard limit of tds is 1000 mgl 1 used for drinking purposes the higher amount of tds was measured from most of the sampling points the sea water interruption is the major reason for higher quantity of tds in the coastal groundwater of bangladesh miah et al 2015 the average concentration of tds in coastal aquifer in the other neighboring upazilas of khulna district was 1556 05 mgl 1 which was found by islam et al 2017 the present study also revealed that maximum salinity value was 15 405 ppt and the minimum value was 93 ppt with a mean value of 3520 84 ppt which was not in line with recommended limit table 3 total alkalinity of groundwater samples ranged between 361 48 and 1566 45 mgl 1 with a mean concentration of 874 57 mgl 1 which was greater than that of doe 1997 standard except the values from sampling stations s1 s3 s9 and s28 generally total alkalinity increased harshly as ph raised the total alkalinity is present in groundwater because of dissolved carbonate bicarbonate and hydroxide and is determined by neutralization titration lee et al 2006 sircus 2011 alkaline water along with high minerals tends to remove normal skin oils and cause too much drying of the skin miah et al 2015 in the present study the sodium ion concentration ranged from 65 20 to 929 13 mg l 1 with a mean concentration of 405 36 mg l 1 the sodium values observed in groundwater samples except sampling stations s1 s2 s6 s25 s26 s27 s28 and s30 in this study were exceeded the doe 1997 limit indicating that it may be detrimental to human health and also for the purposes of drinking datta et al 2011 the higher value of sodium might be owing to sea water disturbance into the aquifer system potassium values of maximum groundwater samples were within the doe 1997 standards for drinking uses table 3 the average concentration of k was found to be 117 59 mgl 1 all groundwater samples except sampling stations s25 s27 and s28 were crossed the limit value of doe 1997 for drinking purposes in addition the maximum concentration of k was established to be 17 05 mgl 1 in shallow groundwater of khulna district islam et al 2017 in the present study ca2 ranged from 58 93 to 156 45 mgl 1 with a mean value of 108 08 mgl 1 which was greater than doe 1997 standard mg2 was found in the range of 21 38 98 04 mgl 1 with a mean concentration of 46 57 mgl 1 all samples except 3 samples from s14 s27 and s28 stations exceeded the doe 1997 standard values of drinking water das et al 2021 also reported the average concentration of mg2 that was 25 12 mgl 1 in satkhira municipality of bangladesh the mean concentration of total hardness was 485 39 mgl 1 and 19 samples out of 31 samples were within the acceptable range of 500 mgl 1 according to doe 1997 and who 1998 maximum concentration of f was 1 16 mg l 67 1 m well depth and the minimum was 0 02 mg l 61 m well depth with an average concentration of 0 25 mg l that was smaller than the bangladesh standard 1997 and who 2011a guideline for drinking purposes table 3 the value of chloride was in the range of 36 21 2136 39 mgl 1 in coastal region high chloride concentration in groundwater sources may be owing to the sea water interruption adhikary et al 2012 rakib et al 2020 also found the average value of chloride 2940 78 mgl 1 in neighboring shymnagar upazila of satkhira district which was much higher than the present study all the samples showed much lower so4 2 contents than the prescribed standard 400 mg l of bangladesh doe 1997 the concentration of so4 2 in groundwater may be due to the dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite minerals it might also be arisen from leaching because the soil of coastal bangladesh is so4 2 and cl dominated emenike et al 2018 phosphate value of the study groundwater ranged between 3 2 and 32 5 mgl 1 with an average value of 10 91 mgl 1 total 26 groundwater samples showed much higher po4 3 contents than the prescribed standard 6 mgl 1 of bangladesh doe 1997 the present analyses revealed that no3 contents were in the range of 0 02 0 11 mgl 1 with an average value of 0 056 mgl 1 which was within the acceptable range of doe 1997 standard for drinking purposes bicarbonate in the study groundwater varied between 432 07 and 1617 06 mgl 1 with a mean value of 914 24 mgl 1 which was much higher than the average hco3 value of 221 42 mgl 1 observed by islam et al 2020 in the coastal belt of bangladesh generally the weathering of carbonate and silicate minerals together with organic substances deposition from sunderbans mangrove forest might be responsible for high concentrations of hco3 in groundwater das et al 2021 rina et al 2012 the value of fe in the groundwater samples ranged from 0 32 to 6 38 mgl 1 with an average concentration of 2 96 mgl 1 that exceeded the doe 1997 standard for consumption purposes table 3 the elevated concentrations of fe in the study groundwater might be due to decline of oxyhydroxides via the biodegradation of organic resources bodrud doza et al 2016 mn value in the study samples ranged from 0 02 to 0 3 mgl 1 with an average value of 0 09 mgl 1 that did not exceed the value of bangladesh standard doe 1997 except the values from sampling stations 24 and 31 rakib et al 2020 found the much higher average value of mn 1 22 mgl 1 in coastal groundwater of the neighboring shymnagar upazila under satkhira district in the study area as values were in the range of 0 004 0 12 mgl 1 with the mean value of 0 05 mgl 1 arsenic as values of maximum sampling stations were exceeded the standard value of doe 1997 for drinking purposes rakib et al 2020 found an average as value of 0 02 mgl 1 in coastal groundwater of shymnagar upazila of satkhira district in the southeast coastal area of bangladesh as values were found in the range of 0 00021 0 02425 mgl 1 with mean value of 0 00393 mgl 1 islam et al 2021 however as concentration in the study groundwater was higher compared to other coastal regions of bangladesh 3 2 spatial variation of hydro chemical elements and trace metals in groundwater spatial distribution of hydro chemical elements cations anions and some trace metals of groundwater samples in the sampling zone of paikgacha upazila are represented in fig 3 a d fig 4 a f and fig 5 a c these spatial distribution maps were interpolated by utilizing arcgis 10 5 version from the maps it was obviously exhibited that the concentrations of all physico chemical parameters cations anions and trace metals assorted from site to site with respect to the depth of tube wells in the study region 3 3 sources of ions and controlling factors of groundwater quality the groundwater quality data were subjected to principal component analysis pca by means of varimax rotation and kaiser normalization the summation of variance of the factor coefficients was utilized in varimax rotation to examine the various sources of physico chemical variables and metals that affect the quality of studied groundwater systems gotelli and ellison 2004 islam et al 2021 the loading plot of the five 5 important factors pc1 pc2 pc3 pc4 and pc5 along with percentages of variance and cumulative percentages from the pca is presented in table 4 five 5 factors were derived for the data sets of groundwater quality on the basis of the condition of eigenvalues 1 explaining 39 29 13 87 11 14 7 41 and 7 0 of the total variance in the current experimental zone as well an eigenvalue denotes a measure of the importance of the factors such as the factors with maximum eigenvalues are considered as the most significant thus eigenvalues 1 0 are considered as significant in factor loadings kim et al 1978 in accordance with liu et al 2003 the factor loadings can be categorized as strong for 0 75 moderate for 0 75 0 50 and weak for 0 50 0 30 the scree plot graph is widely utilized to identify the numeral of principal components of the fundamental data arrangement liu et al 2003 the scree plot fig 6 a represented the selected eigenvalues from big to little as a function of the principal component number pcs this plot is used to identify the number of pcs to be retained to understand the underlying parameter s structure besides this figure also exhibited a distinct alteration of slope after the 12th eigenvalue five components or factors are placed about 64 30 of the total variance has been shown in the first 3 loading factors pc1 pc2 and pc3 in the study samples of groundwater fig 6b the positive and negative scores in pcs in table 4 indicated that the majority of study groundwater samples were either fundamentally influenced or uninfluenced through the existence of derived loads on a single factor component bhuiyan et al 2016 as presented in table 4 pc1 is the most important explaining 39 29 of the total variance with strong positive loading on ec tds salinity cl na k ca2 mg2 and total hardness and with weak positive loading on total alkalinity the high considerable optimistic loadings values 0 823 0 933 of salinity linked variables such as ec tds cl and na that may improve the dissolution rate of several pollutants in the coastal region s rock water interaction umarani et al 2019 and this has an impact on groundwater quality which could be altered by ionic or opposite ionic exchange liu et al 2003 the pc1 was also resulting from mixed origin for instance salinity from the sea water intrusion into the coastal aquifer bodrud doza et al 2016 the pc2 in the groundwater quality data structure represented 13 87 of total variance and strongly positive loaded with f and moderately loaded with total alkalinity moreover the pc2 also positively weak loaded with ec tds salinity cl po4 3 hco3 na and negatively loaded with mg2 here f was produced by geogenic sources with similar chemical properties to groundwater sources rahman et al 2021 besides strong influence of sea water intrusion in the coastal ecosystem a significant amount of fertilizers and pesticides utilization in the farming land might result in extreme amount of ionic replace which might enhance the dissolution of ionic variables islam et al 2021 the pc3 elucidated 11 14 of total variance that exhibited a moderate and considerable positive loading on so4 2 po4 3 hco3 and negatively loaded on no3 and weak positive loading on total alkalinity however the pc3 explained that the no3 so4 2 and po4 3 derived from the anthropogenic sources which were from the discharge of so4 2 and chemical fertilizers in the study area with too much utilization of agrochemicals wagh et al 2017 the pc4 accounting for 7 41 of total variance was moderately loaded on as positively and fe negatively and could be attributed to the abundance of fe as crustal structure and it was accomplished that this factor was geogenic in environment ahmed et al 2019 bhutiani et al 2016 omo irabor et al 2008 however pc4 also showed weak positive loading on ph explained that the as and ph might be positively influenced by sea water interruption which might increase the concentrations of every variable in the coastal groundwater islam et al 2021 aside from that the disintegration of parent rock in the study groundwater resulted in watery as and ph both of which were associated to as release islam et al 2019 finally pc5 represented 7 00 of total variance in the study groundwater parameters and showed significant strong loading on mn moderate loading on ph and weak loading on hco3 the high level of mn might be the derivative from the assorted sources like salinity from the sea water intrusion flooding of farming land etc islam et al 2021 3 4 spatial similarity of analyzed parameters the cluster analysis ca placed nine 9 major clusters for data structure of the experimented hydro chemical elements ca was used to represent the hydro chemical parameters and trace metals grouping in the data arrangement of groundwater and the outcomes are revealed in fig 7 in general elements belonging to the similar group were about to be originated from an equivalent sources bhuiyan et al 2016 in fig 7 cluster 1 incorporated ec tds na cl and salinity which were positively interrelated with elevated salinity problems in the groundwater of coastal area moreover it also exposed that the distinctiveness of the pollutants was mostly alike with respect to loads source and level of contagion rakib et al 2020 cluster 2 consisted of k and it represented the leakage of chemical elements as fertilizers from the soil horizon to the groundwater bodrud doza et al 2016 cluster 3 grouped with ca2 mg2 and total hardness and these ions attributed to geogenic effect as a result of rock water contact such as erosion of limestone dolomite calcite or magnesite or chemical weathering of parent materials badmus et al 2020 cluster 4 contained po4 3 hco3 total alkalinity and reflected by the suspension of carbonate minerals islam et al 2017 kwame and bawa 2022 cluster 5 consists of f and exhibited the rock weathering into the groundwater cluster 6 donated by fe and signified the rock water interface into the groundwater eaton et al 2014 cluster 7 and cluster 8 incorporated with so4 2 as and ph which elucidated through the suspension of minerals below the basic circumstances bodrud doza et al 2016 finally cluster 9 consisted of no3 and mn representing the pollution by household and industrial activities omo irabor et al 2008 3 5 human health risk evaluation table 5 summarized the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks of groundwater contamination for both adults and children via oral routes in table 5 for groundwater the hazard index hi values ranged between 0 70 and 3 76 with a mean value of 2 26 for adults and 1 38 to 7 48 with a mean value of 4 49 for children it has been shown that the mean concentration of hi of the selected parameters for adults was 1 hi 4 indicating a moderate non carcinogenic health risk for adults and for children was 4 hi indicating a high non carcinogenic health risk of children in the present study hq values for arsenic as ranged from 0 06 to 1 89 with a mean value of 0 79 for adult and from 0 12 to 3 75 with an average value of 1 57 for children according to usepa 2001 if hq 1 it is considered as an undesirable threat of non cancer influence on human body and if hq 1 then it is considered as an acceptable level with regard to hq values in the present study the hq values for as were considered within acceptable level for adults and as objectionable risk of adverse non carcinogenic consequences on health for children excessive ingestion of trace metals and other elements and durable chronic contact to these elements may have harmful consequences on human health the hqoral values for both adults and children in coastal aquifer are presented in fig 8 table s1 and table s2 with respect to experimental water the elevated non cancer risk locations were chiefly in mothbari s5 laxmikhola s7 alomtola s8 loskor s9 katakhali s10 moukhali s11 gojalia s12 patkelpota s15 basakhali s16 goraikhali s17 santa s18 deluti purbopara s20 deluti dakshinpara s21 lota purbopara s22 lota majherpara s23 lota bazar s24 protapkati s29 and 4 no batikhali s31 overall these areas shaped the major non cancer risk points that were not appropriate for ingestion of water regards and need to pay further concentration by everyone in addition sea water intrusion climate change shrimp cultivation and human and agricultural activities might be the high risk sites for contamination sources and the administration sector should be strengthened for the management procedures besides the discharge and mobilization of trace metals like as mn and fe from different sources in groundwater may affect the chemistry of hydro chemical properties in aquifer tong et al 2021 the spatial map of the non cancer health risk values for both adults and children via oral route is shown in fig 8a and b respectively according to the spatial analysis of hioral for adults moderate non carcinogenic 1 hi 4 health risks were observed in all parts of study area fig 8a whereas hioral values for children were found 4 hi in the northeast southeast and southwest sides of the experimental zone fig 8b indicating elevated non carcinogenic risk for children health in addition moderate non carcinogenic health risks 1 hi 4 are found for children in the northwest portion of study zone fig 8b arsenic is the major contributor among the chosen elements which causes undesirable health influence on the human health both adults and children hence the cancer risk of as were designed for both adults and children in this study and presented in table 5 in carcinogenic risk cr analysis of human health table 5 the carcinogenic risk cr of arsenic as for adults in the groundwater samples varied from 1 9 10 4 to 5 7 10 3 with an average value of 2 4 10 3 on the other hand the carcinogenic risk of as for children ranged from 4 0 10 4 to 1 1 10 2 with the mean value of 5 0 10 3 the mean value of cr for as for both adults and children were 10 4 which implies that cancer risk is high on both adults and children it is notable that children are much more at threat to trace metal contamination of groundwater due to greater water drinking rates 1 25 l compared to their body mass 20 kg whereas adults ingestion rate is 2 2 l compared to their body mass of 70 kg islam et al 2020 the spatial allocation maps of cancer health risk cr for both adults and children in the experimental zone are exhibited in fig 8c and d respectively in accordance with the spatial distribution of cancer risk for arsenic as it is proved that cancer risk is high cr 0 0001 for both adults fig 8c and children fig 8d due to contact of the groundwater contaminants in all sides of the study area the allocation of spatiality was as southwest southeast northeast northwest areas fig 8c and d the health risk level via oral route is very much undesirable for both groups of people adults and children in the current analyses since oral ingestion has a connection to the metabolic pathway which may be due to extended contact period kabir et al 2021 and similar outcomes were also observed in the southern laizhou coastal bay of china wen et al 2019 it has been established that extended period of exposure of as via drinking water could occur probable cancer risk of health like liver cancer lung cancer bladder cancer kidney cancer and skin cancer non carcinogenic risk such as hypertension cardiovascular diseases and neuropathy can also occur due to intake of as bearing groundwater phung et al 2017 it is proved that children are especially more vulnerable to as exposure because as connects to neurological diseases in the premature life stages calatayud et al 2019 a considerable unenthusiastic outcome might happen on neurodevelopment of child with exposure of as among the ages of 5 15 years old rodríguez barranco et al 2013 in bangladesh elevated as rich drinking water approximately 0 05 mgl 1 might cause decreased brain task on children wasserman et al 2004 finally increased heavy metals and long term salinization played an instantaneous function in assessing water quality with respect to human health hazards as a result considerably more concentration should be paid to as value in future and well organized management is required to control undesirable impacts on the local environment and human health 4 conclusion the present study identified the current status of groundwater quality in paikgacha upazila under the coastal zone of khulna district in most groundwater samples ec tds na cl hco3 po4 3 fe and total alkalinity exceeded the acceptable limits of who and doe for drinking purposes pca contributed to make out the factors responsible for 19 variations into 5 significant pcs that explain 78 71 information of the data set pc1 is explaining 39 29 of the total variance with strong positive values on ec tds salinity na k ca2 mg2 cl and total hardness factors obtained from the pca indicated that these ions may increase the dissolution rate of much pollutants in rock water interaction in the coastal area and could have influenced via ionic or opposite ionic exchange and resulting from mixed origins from sea water intrusion into the coastal aquifer and from anthropogenic sources cluster analysis classified the 19 parameters into nine 9 clusters indicating that these parameters may be ascribed to geogenic influence resultant from the rock water relations and anthropogenic sources that are similar to results obtained from pca in addition a significant health risk of human might appear because of the intake of contaminated groundwater in the study zone not only ec tds na ca2 mg2 cl and hco3 but also trace metals like fe mn and as might be a considerable threat issue in the study region conversely spatial distribution maps established that all parts of the study area possess moderate non carcinogenic health threat to adults and the northeast southeast and southwest parts also possess high non carcinogenic health risk to children moreover relatively high carcinogenic risk for as may occur to both children and adults in all parts of the study zone in this study most of the studied tube wells are affected by salt water which results in the causes of hypertension for coastal people especially for women high saline water may also increase the risks of eclampsia high blood pressure as well as infant mortality in order to mitigate the salinity of drinking water rainwater harvesting and storage system pond sand filter psf managed aquifer recharge mar water and solar desalinization plants are suggested in controlling the water salinity in the study area this is the first research work covering the study area to evaluate groundwater quality via multivariate statistical analysis pollution load index and health risk assessment along with spatial analysis the

bpa stock solution was prepared in distilled water by dissolving 1000 mg in a 1000 ml volumetric flask to make a solution of 1000 mg l and stored in a refrigerator the working solution was prepared daily by diluting the stock solution to a certain volume to make the desired solution 2 3 adsorption experiments the batch adsorption experiments for the optimization were conducted based on the bbd model according to table 1 generated by the design expert software stat ease design expert 11 1 0 1 the input variables concentration of the bpa x1 zif 8 dosages x2 ph x3 and contact time x4 were used the values of the levels were concentration of the bpa 10 90 mg l zif 8 dosage 0 1 0 5 mg l ph 2 10 and contact time 10 70 min for the adsorption studies 100 ml of the bpa in an erlenmeyer flask was used at stirring speed of 250 rpm and atmospheric temperature of 25 c after predetermined time about 2 ml of the supernatant was collected and filtered with a nylon syringe membrane 0 45 μm the sample s absorbance was measured at 276 nm using uv spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1800 the adsorption efficiency of the zif 8 for bpa removal was determined from the equation 1 r c o c e c o 100 moreover the quantity of bpa adsorbed onto the zif 8 at equilibrium q e was determined from the equation 2 q e c o c e v w where c 0 initial concentration of bpa and c e is the equilibrium concentrations of the adsorbate mg l 1 w is the mass of dosage of g l 1 and v is the volume of the adsorbate l the combination of the four major independent variables bpa concentrations zif 8 dosages ph and contact time according to the statistical bbd of the rsm model has resulted in 29 experimental runs n defined as n 2 k k 1 r where k is the factor number and r is the replication of the number of central points as described in table 1 of the design matrix according to the polynomial model of the quadratic equation 3 the equation shows the coding of the chosen variables 3 x i x i x i δ x i xi characterize the coded value of the i th test parameter whereas xi is the encoded value of the itch test parameter x i is the xi respective amount at the central point in the studied area and δxi is the step size soleimanzadeh et al 2019 2 4 thermodynamics studies the effect of temperature change on the adsorption process was studied at a temperature range of 25 45 c using the optimum adsorption condition bpa initial concentration of 50 mg l zif 8 dosages of 0 3 g l ph of 6 and contact time of 40 min the thermodynamics parameters were determined from the results 2 5 regeneration and reusability studies the reusability of zif 8 for bpa adsorption was studied in the adsorption experiment the adsorbent was regenerated by soaking it in a methanol solution for 2 h washed thoroughly with an ethanol solution and followed with distilled water zif 8 was then vacuum dried in an oven for 8 h at 80 c the subsequent adsorption experiments were conducted using the optimum conditions for the batch process described in section 2 4 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of zif 8 the morphological property of the zif 8 was analyzed by fesem fig 1 shows the image obtained at 30 and 100 k magnifications depicting fine and smooth particles with the hexagonal cubic structure the particle sizes were in the range of 200 600 nm elemental analysis from the edx fig s1 revealed the surface elemental compositions of the material containing carbon 45 55 nitrogen 30 34 zinc 18 70 and oxygen 5 41 the porosity of the zif 8 was investigated by the nitrogen adsorption desorption measurement for the surface area pore size and pore volumes zif 8 has shown a microporous structure correspond to type i isotherm the initial stage of the isotherm could be attributed to adsorption by micropores of the zif 8 wang et al 2016 the material possessed higher bet specific surface area and pore volume of 1299 m2 g and 0 60 m3 g respectively similarly the pore diameter of the zif 8 was 8 30 nm this correspond to the previous studies such as the work of giraldo et al 2017 and chen et al 2019 with the zif 8 having bet surface area of 2266 and 1174 m2 g respectively giraldo et al 2017 chen et al 2019 the higher microporosity of the zif 8 can promote the contact with the bpa due to their much lar ger specific surface area and pore volume the characteristic isotherm curve of the zif 8 presented in fig 2 was described as type i hysteresis loops and corresponds with the previous reports on zif 8 chen et al 2019 the crystallinity of the zif 8 was described by the xrd diffractogram presented in fig 4 the graph shows various peaks patterns at angles 2θ 12 14 16 22 25 26 30 32 and 34 indexed by the crystal lattice of 211 220 310 114 233 134 044 244 and 235 respectively this pattern indicated the crystal structure of the zif 8 and corresponded to the patterns of the zif 8 earlier reported such as the work of pradhan et al 2023 and rovani et al 2020 for the adsorption of bpa from environmental waters see fig 3 3 2 adsorption studies the response from the combination of the input variables was analyzed for the determination of the relationship between the process parameters using a second order polynomial equation developed from the bbd model for the fitting of the experimental data as represented by equation 4 4 y β 0 β i x i β i i x i 2 β i j x i x j where β i is the slope of the effect of linear input factor x i β ii is the quadratic effect β ij is the linear by linear interaction effect β 0 is the constant coefficient and x i x j represents the response surface y is the predicted response dehghani et al 2020 the combinations of the 4 primary adsorption parameters initial concentration of bpa x1 zif 8 dosages x2 ph x3 and contact time x4 have resulted in 29 experimental runs with their responses as highlighted in table 3 the best interaction for the input variables was manifested in the experimental runs achieving higher removal at various levels of the parameter s combination good adsorption efficiency was observed with even higher concentrations of the bpa and lower dosages of the zif 8 for instance the removal efficiency achieved at run 5 and 15 was 99 93 and 99 53 achieved with the bpa concentrations of 50 and 90 mg l and zif 8 dosages of 0 3 and 0 1 g l respectively at the same time the other parameters were held constant at ph and contact time of 6 and 40 min respectively indicating that the zif 8 was good material for bpa adsorption the 3 dimensional response plot shows the simultaneous interaction between the input variables in achieving the highest adsorption fig 4 depicts the excellent interaction between the zif 8 dosages and the adsorption time the adsorption efficiency increased at both higher zif 8 dosages and contact time similar interactions were observed between the zif 8 dosage and the bpa initial concentrations fig s1 these findings were supported by the porosity analysis of the zif 8 with the higher bet surface area and pore volume of 1299 m2 g 1 and 0 60 m3 g 1 respectively the fitting of the model and the efficiency of the zif 8 for bpa adsorption was held by the coded factor of the quadratic polynomial model evaluated by eq 5 the data have shown the significance of the model in predicting the adsorption efficiency the significance of the model was also determined by the statistical tests of the analysis of variance anova with a 95 confidence level as highlighted in table 2 the overall model f and p values were 6 37 and 0 0007 respectively indicating the robustness of the model for the experimental data the closeness of the experimental and predicted coefficients of determination r2 with lower discrepancies of less than 0 2 reaffirmed the fitting of the model zaferani et al 2019 likewise the non significant lack of fit and higher adequate precision values of 0 3018 and 9 1381 respectively indicate the model significance in navigating the design space usman et al 2021a 5 c o d

the desirability of the adsorption efficiency for the combination of the input variables was further illustrated by the ramp graph in fig 5 the results showed good model desirability for the optimum solution of the experimental runs the desirability achieved was 0 924 at the highest adsorption efficiency of 99 93 the target responses achieved were in good agreement with the rsm prediction mourabet et al 2017 as highlighted in table 4 indicating the model accuracy for the proposed bbd model this was further confirmed by the scatter plot attached as fig s2 depicting the good agreement between the actual responses of the experimental runs and the rsm prediction of the model this validated the model s accuracy and compatibility for the adsorption experiments 3 3 artificial neural network ann model the experimental data from the bbd was used as a composition for the ann mapping to predict and validate the experimental findings the ann architecture was designed using multi layer perceptron ann with backward propagation the set of values comprising 116 data from the four adsorption parameters concentration dosage ph and contact time were divided into training and validation constituting 70 and 30 respectively the ann topography was designed to constitute three structural layers input hidden and output thus varying the number of neurons for the hidden layer allows for the best network of the ann architecture fig 6 depicts the ideal ann topography obtained at node 11 4 10 1 to have the best statistical r2 values of 0 9704 and 0 983 and the best root mean square error rmse values of 0 2214 and 0 5252 for the training and validation results respectively the corresponding scatter plots for the ann analysis agreed with the rsm findings and the result was presented in fig s4 table 3 presents results of the experimental runs generated by the bbd from the effect of parameters interaction the rsm and ann were used to predict the experimental findings it was noteworthy that the two models demonstrated excellent prediction efficiency with higher accuracies however for the purpose of comparison the ann model has fewer errors compared to the rsm notwithstanding the efficiency of the rsm model the ann is designed to imitate human intelligence in understanding the pattern of the experimental datasets and make excellent prediction for decision making ahmad et al 2022 thus in this study the ann model has demonstrated better correlation between the experimental and predicted responses 3 4 thermodynamics studies fig 7 illustrates the plot of ln k versus 1 t for bpa adsorption onto the zif 8 the thermodynamic values deducted from the plot are presented in table s1 all the obtained gibbs free energy δg were negative and increased with temperature indicating that the process was spontaneous isiyaka et al 2022 similarly the values of the enthalpy δh and entropy δs changes were 9 557 kj mol and 0 0142 j mol k respectively signifying the endothermic adsorption process 3 5 possible mechanism of the bpa adsorption the proposed process controlling mechanism for the bpa adsorption onto the zif 8 is shown in fig 8 the adsorbent is made by zinc ions coordinated by four imidazolate rings in the same way as silicon si and aluminium al atoms are covalently joined by bridging oxygens in zeolites since bpa has hydroxyl groups oh on the edge of the rings the formation of hydrogen bonds with amine groups nh of the zif 8 has been identified as the major interaction between them further detail of the mechanism has been illustrated in our previous work mahmad et al 2022a 3 6 regeneration and reusability studies on the other hand the reusability of the zif 8 for the bpa has been studied upon regeneration of the material as described in the section after the 1st adsorption cycle the performance of the zif 8 was reported for four repeated cycles as depicted in fig 9 achieving 97 1 84 2 78 2 and 68 2 for the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th cycles respectively the gradual decrease in the material s performance as the number of users was attributed to the incomplete desorption of the bpa from the pores hence the limited active sites for trapping the bpa molecules due to good regeneration and reusable zif 8 has low costs operation and is environmentally friendly however to establish good potentiality of the zif 8 for the effective reusable performance for pollutants adsorption further studies on the structural stability and desorption process of reusable zif 8 is recommend 3 7 comparison with other adsorbents table 4 highlighted some comparison between the zif 8 employed in this work and other adsorbents such as biomass activated carbon ac carbon nanotubes cnts molecularly imprinted polymers mips and other organic and inorganic adsorbents reported in the literature it is noteworthy that the zif 8 reported in this work has demonstrated efficient adsorption performance towards the bpa remediation the adsorption efficiency achieved was 99 93 which depicted complete removal of the bpa as compared to the other adsorbents with far less removal efficiency similarly the time necessary for attaining the equilibrium was therefore it is foreseeing that the zif 8 has the good potentiality as future adsorbent for the bpa remediation from wastewater 4 conclusion zif 8 was employed as a potential adsorbent for bpa removal from the aqueous medium the process was optimized and predicted according to the bbd of the rsm model with four input variables initial concentration of bpa zif 8 dosages ph and contact time denoted as x1 x2 x3 and x4 respectively resulting in 29 experimental runs the factor s combination achieved the best performance at runs 5 and 15 with a removal efficiency of 99 93 and 99 53 respectively the significance and robustness of the model were justified by the best r2 and lack of fit values of 0 9641 and 0 3018 respectively furthermore ann was employed to predict and validate the adsorption process using multilayer perceptron mlp ann the best topography was obtained at node 10 with the r2 values of 0 9704 and 0 983 as rmse values of 0 2214 and 0 5252 for the training and validation datasets interestingly the rsm and ann validation were in good agreement and each predicted the experimental output with greater accuracy and precision the thermodynamic studies described the process as exothermic with negative δg values increased with temperature the best performance of the adsorbent was manifested in the reusability studies achieving up to 68 after four consecutive cycles thus it demonstrated good potential of the zif 8 for bpa adsorption from wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

according to the statistical bbd of the rsm model has resulted in 29 experimental runs n defined as n 2 k k 1 r where k is the factor number and r is the replication of the number of central points as described in table 1 of the design matrix according to the polynomial model of the quadratic equation 3 the equation shows the coding of the chosen variables 3 x i x i x i δ x i xi characterize the coded value of the i th test parameter whereas xi is the encoded value of the itch test parameter x i is the xi respective amount at the central point in the studied area and δxi is the step size soleimanzadeh et al 2019 2 4 thermodynamics studies the effect of temperature change on the adsorption process was studied at a temperature range of 25 45 c using the optimum adsorption condition bpa initial concentration of 50 mg l zif 8 dosages of 0 3 g l ph of 6 and contact time of 40 min the thermodynamics parameters were determined from the results 2 5 regeneration and reusability studies the reusability of zif 8 for bpa adsorption was studied in the adsorption experiment the adsorbent was regenerated by soaking it in a methanol solution for 2 h washed thoroughly with an ethanol solution and followed with distilled water zif 8 was then vacuum dried in an oven for 8 h at 80 c the subsequent adsorption experiments were conducted using the optimum conditions for the batch process described in section 2 4 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of zif 8 the morphological property of the zif 8 was analyzed by fesem fig 1 shows the image obtained at 30 and 100 k magnifications depicting fine and smooth particles with the hexagonal cubic structure the particle sizes were in the range of 200 600 nm elemental analysis from the edx fig s1 revealed the surface elemental compositions of the material containing carbon 45 55 nitrogen 30 34 zinc 18 70 and oxygen 5 41 the porosity of the zif 8 was investigated by the nitrogen adsorption desorption measurement for the surface area pore size and pore volumes zif 8 has shown a microporous structure correspond to type i isotherm the initial stage of the isotherm could be attributed to adsorption by micropores of the zif 8 wang et al 2016 the material possessed higher bet specific surface area and pore volume of 1299 m2 g and 0 60 m3 g respectively similarly the pore diameter of the zif 8 was 8 30 nm this correspond to the previous studies such as the work of giraldo et al 2017 and chen et al 2019 with the zif 8 having bet surface area of 2266 and 1174 m2 g respectively giraldo et al 2017 chen et al 2019 the higher microporosity of the zif 8 can promote the contact with the bpa due to their much lar ger specific surface area and pore volume the characteristic isotherm curve of the zif 8 presented in fig 2 was described as type i hysteresis loops and corresponds with the previous reports on zif 8 chen et al 2019 the crystallinity of the zif 8 was described by the xrd diffractogram presented in fig 4 the graph shows various peaks patterns at angles 2θ 12 14 16 22 25 26 30 32 and 34 indexed by the crystal lattice of 211 220 310 114 233 134 044 244 and 235 respectively this pattern indicated the crystal structure of the zif 8 and corresponded to the patterns of the zif 8 earlier reported such as the work of pradhan et al 2023 and rovani et al 2020 for the adsorption of bpa from environmental waters see fig 3 3 2 adsorption studies the response from the combination of the input variables was analyzed for the determination of the relationship between the process parameters using a second order polynomial equation developed from the bbd model for the fitting of the experimental data as represented by equation 4 4 y β 0 β i x i β i i x i 2 β i j x i x j where β i is the slope of the effect of linear input factor x i β ii is the quadratic effect β ij is the linear by linear interaction effect β 0 is the constant coefficient and x i x j represents the response surface y is the predicted response dehghani et al 2020 the combinations of the 4 primary adsorption parameters initial concentration of bpa x1 zif 8 dosages x2 ph x3 and contact time x4 have resulted in 29 experimental runs with their responses as highlighted in table 3 the best interaction for the input variables was manifested in the experimental runs achieving higher removal at various levels of the parameter s combination good adsorption efficiency was observed with even higher concentrations of the bpa and lower dosages of the zif 8 for instance the removal efficiency achieved at run 5 and 15 was 99 93 and 99 53 achieved with the bpa concentrations of 50 and 90 mg l and zif 8 dosages of 0 3 and 0 1 g l respectively at the same time the other parameters were held constant at ph and contact time of 6 and 40 min respectively indicating that the zif 8 was good material for bpa adsorption the 3 dimensional response plot shows the simultaneous interaction between the input variables in achieving the highest adsorption fig 4 depicts the excellent interaction between the zif 8 dosages and the adsorption time the adsorption efficiency increased at both higher zif 8 dosages and contact time similar interactions were observed between the zif 8 dosage and the bpa initial concentrations fig s1 these findings were supported by the porosity analysis of the zif 8 with the higher bet surface area and pore volume of 1299 m2 g 1 and 0 60 m3 g 1 respectively the fitting of the model and the efficiency of the zif 8 for bpa adsorption was held by the coded factor of the quadratic polynomial model evaluated by eq 5 the data have shown the significance of the model in predicting the adsorption efficiency the significance of the model was also determined by the statistical tests of the analysis of variance anova with a 95 confidence level as highlighted in table 2 the overall model f and p values were 6 37 and 0 0007 respectively indicating the robustness of the model for the experimental data the closeness of the experimental and predicted coefficients of determination r2 with lower discrepancies of less than 0 2 reaffirmed the fitting of the model zaferani et al 2019 likewise the non significant lack of fit and higher adequate precision values of 0 3018 and 9 1381 respectively indicate the model significance in navigating the design space usman et al 2021a 5 c o d e d a d s o r p t i o n e f f i c i e n c y r 0 1002 0 0002 a 0 0001 b 0 0002 c 0 0007 d 0 0002 a b 0 0003 a c 0 0000 a d 0 0003 b c 0 0004 b d 0 0003 c d 0 0001 a 2 0 0002 b 2 0 0002 c 2 0 0005 d 2 the desirability of the adsorption efficiency for the combination of the input variables was further illustrated by the ramp graph in fig 5 the results showed good model desirability for the optimum solution of the experimental runs the desirability achieved was 0 924 at the highest adsorption efficiency of 99 93 the target responses achieved were in good agreement with the rsm prediction mourabet et al 2017 as highlighted in table 4 indicating the model accuracy for the proposed bbd model this was further confirmed by the scatter plot attached as fig s2 depicting the good agreement between the actual responses of the experimental runs and the rsm prediction of the model this validated the model s accuracy and compatibility for the adsorption experiments 3 3 artificial neural network ann model the experimental data from the bbd was used as a composition for the ann mapping to predict and validate the experimental findings the ann architecture was designed using multi layer perceptron ann with backward propagation the set of values comprising 116 data from the four adsorption parameters concentration dosage ph and contact time were divided into training and validation constituting 70 and 30 respectively the ann topography was designed to constitute three structural layers input hidden and output thus varying the number of neurons for the hidden layer allows for the best network of the ann architecture fig 6 depicts the ideal ann topography obtained at node 11 4 10 1 to have the best statistical r2 values of 0 9704 and 0 983 and the best root mean square error rmse values of 0 2214 and 0 5252 for the training and validation results respectively the corresponding scatter plots for the ann analysis agreed with the rsm findings and the result was presented in fig s4 table 3 presents results of the experimental runs generated by the bbd from the effect of parameters interaction the rsm and ann were used to predict the experimental findings it was noteworthy that the two models demonstrated excellent prediction efficiency with higher accuracies however for the purpose of comparison the ann model has fewer errors compared to the rsm notwithstanding the efficiency of the rsm model the ann is designed to imitate human intelligence in understanding the pattern of the experimental datasets and make excellent prediction for decision making ahmad et al 2022 thus in this study the ann model has demonstrated better correlation between the experimental and predicted responses 3 4 thermodynamics studies fig 7 illustrates the plot of ln k versus 1 t for bpa adsorption onto the zif 8 the thermodynamic values deducted from the plot are presented in table s1 all the obtained gibbs free energy δg were negative and increased with temperature indicating that the process was spontaneous isiyaka et al 2022 similarly the values of the enthalpy δh and entropy δs changes were 9 557 kj mol and 0 0142 j mol k respectively signifying the endothermic adsorption process 3 5 possible mechanism of the bpa adsorption the proposed process controlling mechanism for the bpa adsorption onto the zif 8 is shown in fig 8 the adsorbent is made by zinc ions coordinated by four imidazolate rings in the same way as silicon si and aluminium al atoms are covalently joined by bridging oxygens in zeolites since bpa has hydroxyl groups oh on the edge of the rings the formation of hydrogen bonds with amine groups nh of the zif 8 has been identified as the major interaction between them further detail of the mechanism has been illustrated in our previous work mahmad et al 2022a 3 6 regeneration and reusability studies on the other hand the reusability of the zif 8 for the bpa has been studied upon regeneration of the material as described in the section after the 1st adsorption cycle the performance of the zif 8 was reported for four repeated cycles as depicted in fig 9 achieving 97 1 84 2 78 2 and 68 2 for the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th cycles respectively the gradual decrease in the material s performance as the number of users was attributed to the incomplete desorption of the bpa from the pores hence the limited active sites for trapping the bpa molecules due to good regeneration and reusable zif 8 has low costs operation and is environmentally friendly however to establish good potentiality of the zif 8 for the effective reusable performance for pollutants adsorption further studies on the structural stability and desorption process of reusable zif 8 is recommend 3 7 comparison with other adsorbents table 4 highlighted some comparison between the zif 8 employed in this work and other adsorbents such as biomass activated carbon ac carbon nanotubes cnts molecularly imprinted polymers mips and other organic and inorganic adsorbents reported in the literature it is noteworthy that the zif 8 reported in this work has demonstrated efficient adsorption performance towards the bpa remediation the adsorption efficiency achieved was 99 93 which depicted complete removal of the bpa as compared to the other adsorbents with far less removal efficiency similarly the time necessary for attaining the equilibrium was therefore it is foreseeing that the zif 8 has the good potentiality as future adsorbent for the bpa remediation from wastewater 4 conclusion zif 8 was employed as a potential adsorbent for bpa removal from the aqueous medium the process was optimized and predicted according to the bbd of the rsm model with four input variables initial concentration of bpa zif 8 dosages ph and contact time denoted as x1 x2 x3 and x4 respectively resulting in 29 experimental runs the factor s combination achieved the best performance at runs 5 and 15 with a removal efficiency of 99 93 and 99 53 respectively the significance and robustness of the model were justified by the best r2 and lack of fit values of 0 9641 and 0 3018 respectively furthermore ann was employed to predict and validate the adsorption process using multilayer perceptron mlp ann the best topography was obtained at node 10 with the r2 values of 0 9704 and 0 983 as rmse values of 0 2214 and 0 5252 for the training and validation datasets interestingly the rsm and ann validation were in good agreement and each predicted the experimental output with greater accuracy and precision the thermodynamic studies described the process as exothermic with negative δg values increased with temperature the best performance of the adsorbent was manifested in the reusability studies achieving up to 68 after four consecutive cycles thus it demonstrated good potential of the zif 8 for bpa adsorption from wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

include naturally occurring radioactive materials norm heavy and potentially toxic metals which are ubiquitous in the environment naturally occurring radionuclides such as 222rn are the major precursors of lung and other types of cancer in humans exposure to radon in drinking water in excess of 300 pci l is treated as a radiological risk while toxic metals in excess of the world health organization who maximum permissible levels in drinking water are considered both environmental and health risks to humans a total of 34 groundwater samples were collected in the akoko area of ondo state nigeria for 222rn activity concentration determination the water samples were collected using standard techniques rad7 solid state detector was utilized for the 222rn measurements the results

purposes industrial utilizations and agricultural practices bewick et al 2003 groundwater contamination has become one of the most critical environmental issues in developed as well as in developing nations natural radionuclides are among the major pollutants contaminating groundwater sources apart from natural processes human activities such as fertilizer application in agriculture mining and ore processing industrial activities etc release radionuclides into the environment when released into the environment due to their long half lives they remain in the environment for a long time and leach into groundwater causing contamination consumption of contaminated water may lead to deleterious health challenges such as cancer naturally occurring radionuclides such as 222rn are the major precursors of lung and other types of cancers in human according to estimates smoking and radon 222rn exposure are the two leading causes of lung cancer fatalities in the united states usepa 2003 in europe radon 222rn exposures account for approximately 9 15 of the annual cases of lung cancers darby et al 2005 krewski et al 2006 in most countries of the world 222rn is projected to be causing about 3 14 of lung cancers who 2021 extended exposure to radon 222rn indoor in excess of 100 bq m3 is considered as serious environmental problem while exposure in drinking water in the excess of 300 pci l is treated as radiological risk who 2008 according to world health organization who recommendations for drinking water quality the accumulated effective dose rate shouldn t exceed 100 μsv y in cases of extended exposure to radionuclides through ingestion pathways utilizing the average daily water intake by humans it was possible to determine the guidance level of most radionuclides concentrations in drinking water bem et al 2014 under natural circumstances 222rn is produced by the decay of radionuclides within the uranium chains and can be found in any soil rock air surface and groundwater garg et al 2015 when produced in the bedrocks 222rn can easily emanate through the porous media and dissolve into groundwater via water rock interaction processes due to its level of solubility in water 222rn can be incorporated to groundwater flows amiri et al 2017 the activity concentrations of 222rn available in groundwater depend on factors such as groundwater geochemistry the nature of the aquifer host rocks aquifer characteristics residence time of water in aquifer media the natural radioactivity content of the involved rock formation etc shabana and kinsara 2014 moreno et al 2014 groundwater frequently contains high levels of 222rn which typically account for 5 10 of the total radon produced by the breakdown of 238u and its immediate parent 226ra in aquifer grains kiro et al 2015 amiri et al 2017 several other factors usually influence the level of radon present in groundwater factors such as the presence of shear zone soil porosity local geology uranium mineralization hydraulic conductivity groundwater flow velocity etc can determine the activity concentrations of radon observed in groundwater in a given environment choubey et al 2001 depending on the mineral makeup of each rock type radon concentrations in various rock types might vary greatly in a given geological location idriss et al 2011 radon detected in groundwater may come from the water itself or from soil and rock formations through which the water flows rock and soil types with elevated radium concentrations would invariably show enhanced concentration of radon 222rn in soil gas and groundwater hess et al 1985 such rock formation with elevated radium content includes granitic rocks and uranium minerals in crystalline rock dominated geological formations with high uranium and radium content groundwater with increased radon 222rn concentrations is common przylibski 2000 przylibski et al 2022 in most of these areas groundwater with elevated levels of 222rn remained the only source of water for household usage and drinking direct transfer of radon 222rn from soil and rock into indoor and outdoor air is taken as the major exposure pathway radon 222rn can also degas from water into indoor air thereby constituting an important secondary exposure pathway for groundwater dependent populations radon is chemically inert odourless colourless and tasteless it is an alpha particle emitting radioactive gas there are three natural radioisotopes of radon 222rn 220rn and 219rn from uranium thorium and actinium decay series respectively of the three 222rn is the most researched due to it s stability longer half life and radiotoxicity because radon emits energetic alpha particles it is known to be a human carcinogen when radon gas is ingested or inhaled into the body it combines with water molecules to produce extremely reactive free radicals that damage dna cells in the lungs and eventually cause cancer edsfeldt 2001 jafir 2023 the consumption of radon 222rn through drinking water has been linked with cancers such as stomach cancer urinary tract cancer leukemia kidney diseases renal damage bone damage etc jafir 2023 ajiboye et al 2022 zamora et al 2009 who 2004 for radiation protection purposes and environmental health concerns it is crucial to carry out the radiotoxicity and health risks assessment of naturally occurring radionuclides such as 222rn in groundwater from granitic geological areas like the study area the current research is therefore aimed at investigating the activity concentration and radiotoxicity of 222rn in groundwater samples collected fron akoko area of ondo state nigeria in order to evaluate the radiological risks associated with the use of the sampled groundwater for drinking and other household purposes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection groundwater samples were taken from hand pumped boreholes with sealed covers in eight towns from akoko division of ondo state nigeria standard methods were used to collect and process the water samples for 222rn activity concentration determination at the collection points the taps were pumped continuously for about 3 min in order to eliminate the excess radon 222rn which might have accumulated on the cavity on top of the water level in the borehole isinkaye and ajiboye 2017 this was also done to get representative samples for analysis the samples were initially collected into 75 cl plastic bottles and sealed immediately at the collection points before being taken to the laboratory analysis was done within 3 6 days after the samples were collected further details on sampling methods have been published elsewhere isinkaye et al 2021 ajiboye et al 2022 kolo et al 2023 fig 1 shows the geographical spread of the sampling locations the entire sampling locations fall within the granitic geological area of ondo state 2 2 sample measurements for 222rn activity concentration for each measurement the groundwater sample was carefully transferred from the 75 cl bottle to a 250 ml vial supplied as parts of rad h2o accessories without turbulence samples were analyzed using rad7 detector the rad7 electronic radon detector is a product of durridge inc usa the rad7 detector s inbuilt pump produces bubbles within the sample during the initial 5 min and starts the measurement once a balance between the water air and radon progeny has been attained rahimi et al 2022 measurement is done automatically in 4 cycles of 5 min interval each the 222rn usually decay inside the detector s hemisphere chamber producing two alpha particles 212po and 214po at the hemisphere s core a solid state silicon semiconductor detector will record the generated alpha particles as electrical pulses when used with the rad7 detector the rad h2o accessory enables the quantifying of dissolved 222rn in water at concentrations ranging from 10 pci l to 400 000 pci l durridge 2011 2 3 222rn decay correction due to logistic constraints the water samples could not be analyzed for 222rn activity concentration immediately after collection it is important to perform decay correction in order to account for the reduction in the activity concentration of 222rn occasioned by the radioactive decay process and adjust the results for the decay of the sample from the time the samples were acquired to the time the samples were counted for samples that are counted within 10 days of sampling decay correction can be applied durridge 2011 after 10 days of sampling the concentration may be too weak to be detected the decay correction factor dcf has a time constant of 132 4 h and is a straightforward exponential function given as ajiboye et al 2022 adithya et al 2021 durridge 2011 1 d c f exp t 132 4 where t is the time lapse in hour between sampling and measurement 3 radiotoxicity and health risks assessment 3 1 annual effective dose to assess the effective dose due to ingestion of any radionuclides in water dose coefficient expressed as sv bq is utilized taking into account the ingestion rate and the concentration of such radionuclide the american national research council s nrc commission on life sciences recommended using the dose coefficient of 3 5 10 9 sv bq for this purpose nrc 1999 tan et al 2019 mamun and alazmi 2022 recently more realistic values of 1 10 8 sv bq 2 10 8 bq sv and 7 10 8 bq sv have been recommended to be used as the ingestion dose coefficient for adults children and infants respectively bem et al 2014 kendall and smith 2002 the ingestion dose e i n g is given as 2 e i n g μ s v y c r n d c c i n g v a where c r n is the radon concentration is drinking water dccingis the dose conversion coefficient and va is the estimated volume of drinking water consumed directly from tap annually the annual water consumption volume is taken as 730 l y for adult and children 365 l y for infant based on the assumption that adults and children will take 2 l of water per day and infants will take 1 l per day nrc 1999 isinkaye and ajiboye 2017 also the dose from inhalation e i n h of dissolved radon released into air during water usage is given as usepa 1991 tan et al 2019 3 e i n h c r n d c c i n h e f t f where c rn is the radon concentration in pci l ef is the average annual indoor occupancy factor estimated as 7000 h t is the radon transfer factor from water to air given as 0 1 l m3 f is the radon and its daughters equilibrium factor recommended to be 0 4 and dcc inh is the dose conversion coefficient given as 22 10 9 sv bq h m3 as recommended by nrc 1999 in this work the conversion factor of 1 bq 27 pci was considered in the calculations 3 2 radiogenic cancer risk assessment life time cancer risk r accompanying the intake of certain concentrations of 222rn in groundwater was used to assess the radiation risk in this study the associated life time cancer risk is expressed as the product of per capita activity intake i of 222rn and the applicable risk coefficient r as given in equation 4 4 r i r using equation 4 the national research council estimated the age and gender dependent cancer risks associated with lifetime ingestion of 222rn dissolved in drinking water at a concentration of 1 0 bq m or 27 pci l as 0 2 10 8 with stomach cancer accounting for the major risk nrc 1999 the calculation is based on the usepa 1994 assumption that water is consumed directly from the tap without agitation or heating at a consumption rate of 2 l d lifetime exposure of 70 y and that 20 of radon in groundwater collected from the tap is released in the process of transferring the water from tap to the stomach additionally a lifetime exposure to 222rn in water through inhalation at the same concentration of 1 0 bq m 3 was projected to cause lung cancer risk given as 1 6 10 8 these values were used as coefficients to evaluate the cancer mortality risk associated with the concentrations of 222rn in groundwater of the study area 4 results and discussion 4 1 activity concentrations of 222rn in groundwater table 1 gives the measured activity concentrations of 222rn in groundwater samples taken from selected locations in the akoko area of ondo state nigeria as given in the table the activity concentration varies from 76 23 pci l to 3593 421 pci l the mean activity concentration observed is 705 76 pci l the wide range in the distribution of the activity concentrations of 222rn may be ascribed to the variations in the geology of the local environment and the mineral composition of the rocks and soil of the study area the mean activity concentration obtained in this study is about 2 4 order of magnitude higher than the 300 pci l suggested as the permissible concentration of 222rn for safe drinking water by the world health organization who 2004 the geometric mean of the activity concentration obtained is 431 pci l which is also higher than the permissible level about 61 4 of the total samples have their activity concentrations above the recommended permissible level most of the high activity concentration of radon in groundwater are found in the supare akungba ikare and iwaro oka axes these areas are predominantly granitic in lithology for example supare akoko is well known for granitic rock for the production of dimension stones granite for local and foreign markets ibitoye and ajibade 2017 the spatial distribution of 222rn activity concentration in groundwater of the study are is presented in fig 2 high concentration of 222rn is observed in the southern to central regions of the study area spatial variability of radon concentration in the groundwater samples from akoko area of ondo state decrease outward from the akungba and supare axes as shown in the figure higher percentage of the groundwater from the study area present 222rn concentration in excess of the 300 pci l which the who recommended maximum contaminant level for drinking water the spatial distribution of 222rn as shown in fig 3 reveals a highly varied activity concentration which is comparable to distributions obtained in other locations around the world e g jamir et al 2023 haroon and muhammad 2022 kumar et al 2021 khan et al 2021 abu khader et al 2018 4 2 annual effective dose for ingestion and inhalation of 222rn the annual effective dose due to ingestion of 222rn in drinking water from underground sources from the study area ranged from 20 5 to 970 4 μsv y 41 1 1943 μsv y and 71 9 3340 μsv y respectively for adults children and infants in the study area table 1 the lowest annual effective doses are found in arigidi area while the highest values are found in akungba area the mean values obtained are as follows 190 5 381 0 and 667 4 μsv y for adults children and infants these values are of great concern because they are in the excess of the 100 μsv y action level recommended by icrp 1991 in addition to the forgoing the highest values are obtained in a university town which inhabits thousands of young adults with many living in the environment between four to ten years uninterruptedly the inhalation dose incurred from the activity concentrations of 222rn due to groundwater usage in the study ranged from 17 3 to 819 μsv y with an average value of 160 8 μsv y the mean value is higher than the recommended dose value of 100 μsv y icrp 1991 it is obvious from the results that the dose impacted on an adult dweller of the study area is more from ingestion than from inhalation pathway the values of ingestion and inhalation doses incur by an adult in the study area due to 222rn exposure from groundwater usage is higher than those incur by adults in some selected areas of pakistan armenia india malaysia palestine ghana and some parts of nigeria as shown in table 2 4 3 radiogenic cancer risk assessment due to 222rn in groundwater the estimated lifetime risks associated with ingestion and inhalation of dissolve 222rn in groundwater are presented in table 1 the results indicate that the risk due to ingestion varies as 0 6 10 5 and 26 6 10 5 with average value of 5 2 10 5 while the risk due to inhalation of 222rn in the groundwater samples varies between 0 3 10 4 and 16 0 10 4 with average value of 3 1 10 4 the average values of risks due to ingestion and inhalation of radon in water fall outside the range suggested as the safe limit which is given as 1 10 6 and 1 10 4 usepa 1991 these results shows that on the average 5 out of 100 000 population has the possibility of acquiring stomach cancer in a lifetime while 3 out of 10 000 population may suffer lung cancer in their lifetime in the study area the risk associated with inhalation is higher than the risk associated with ingestion pathway even though the dose impacted from the latter is higher 4 4 multivariate statistical analysis in order to get more interesting and statistically significant information from obtained data basic statistical analysis was performed first it was verified whether the distributions of the radon 222rn concentration and the heavy metals content in the studied ground water samples are normal distributions this is the first procedure one needs to follow see veazie 2015 das and imon 2016 if the distribution is normal the subsequent statistical tests are parametric such as t test anova etc if the distribution is not normal the subsequent tests are non parametric like wilcoxon mann whitney test etc in our case all collected data of radon concentration 34 samples constitute a set with non normal distribution p value of the order of 10 5 thus extremely lower than assumed significance level α 0 05 table 3 nonetheless the distributions within the individual groups i e 222rn concentration at a given location are normal because the calculated p values of the shapiro wilk tests are greater than α 0 05 thus one could not reject the null hypothesis of normality see again table 3 which also collects information on arithmetic and weighted means of 222rn concentration of all results and the results at a given location the arithmetic mean is not always the quantity which bests reflects the collected data on average if each measurement possess different uncertainty the better value is the weighted mean i e the mean with the uncertainty sd in this case being the weight iso 2008 this leads to significant difference between both means if the high measurements have relatively low uncertainty in such a case these values will enter the weighted mean with higher weight and one ends up with higher mean just like in table 3 especially for mean radon concentration in akungba town 2230 630 weighted mean versus 1450 580 arithmetic mean also for ikaramu ikare and supare locations because of relatively large dispersion of measurement values the deviations of both means remain quite high though a bit lower for the weighted deviation after verifying the normality of radon concentration at all locations now one is able to check if there is any statistically significant difference between the locations it is clearly visible that the highest values were reported in akungba and supare also in ikare and oka towns though in a smaller extent but the question remains whether the reported difference is statistically significant one way anova is the kind of test which answers the question at an accepted significance level α veazie 2015 applying this to 222rn concentration reveals that there is a significant difference between locations since the calculated p value reads 0 0358 when p value is less than α typically one assumes 0 05 then the null hypothesis of no difference between the groups must be rejected albeit it is worth noting that no better probability can be accepted e g 97 or 98 however to determine which locations differs from the others one has to perform pairwise tests since radon concentration at each of the studied locations has normal distribution one can use pairwise t tests the results are given in tables 4 and 5 at the accepted significance level α 0 05 one is able to determine that akungba is the location at which the concentration of radon is significantly higher from that at arigidi erusu and ikaramu moreover with lower probability namely about 90 one can also deduce that the concentration in arigidi is higher than concentration at ikare and oka table 4 applying the alternative hypothesis as being greater reveals additionally that with quite low probability less than 83 also concentration in supare is greater than at the following locations arigidi erusu and ikaramu table 5 therefore the conclusion from the analysis so far is as follows with about 90 probability the concentration of radon in akungba with weighted average 2230 630 is higher than at other locations besides supare while at supare with 1440 280 by average is higher but with only about 83 probability the tests does not verify at which locations the concentration of radon is the lowest to meet the concern about this fact let one has a look at fig 3 which presents the density distribution of lifetime cancer risk due to radon ingestion actually histograms with extrapolated polynomial function called density the lifetime cancer risk is calculated via eq 3 from radon concentration values thus conclusions for both variables are the same to sum up the distribution of lifetime cancer risk due to ingestion of radon in groundwater depends on location at which the samples were taken there is a big difficulty in verifying where the concentration is unambiguously the highest or the lowest only for akungba town it is quite clearly visible elevated values and especially much higher than in erusu arigidi and ikaramu this facts are reflected in statistical tests as well see tables 4 and 5 and description above the higher concentration of radon at given locations akungba and supare transfers to elevated ingestion and inhalation doses they again depend on the location however because of eq 3 they depend on age as well fig 4 presents statistics of the ingestion dose by the age of consumer and location only in arigidi erusu and ikaramu locations the ingestion dose remains at low level for all age intervals moreover concerning is the fact of large dispersion of the results at the other locations this implicates that one estimates the average ingestion doses with large uncertainty large range of possible values fortunately the values are not extremely high 4 5 monte carlos method of risk analysis a mathematical method called monte carlo simulation is used to assess the likely outcomes of any uncertain event this technique is the most widely used approach that accommodates the uncertainties ambiguities and variabilities linked with many risk related problems particularly the ones that affect human safety and the ecosystem saghi et al 2019 mohammed et al 2022 usikalu et al 2023 this is due to the fact that it offers additional information for decision making related to human health and environmental protection and presents a quantitative approach to evaluate the probability distributions for health risks within the legitimacy of the risk assessment model orosun et al 2020 usikalu et al 2023 the risk of cancer inducement of any kind by an individual after exposure to 222rn is usually assessed via the deterministic cancer risk assessment model provided by equation 3 this deterministic cancer risk assessment provides the incremental likelihood of the exposed human developing cancer over a given period say lifetime because of the 222rn in the water sources the monte carlo simulations in this work were carried out using oracle crystal ball software version 11 1 2 4 850 this oracle crystal ball software version 11 1 2 4 850 has the advantage of running the simulations up to 10 000 trials and spontaneously select the distribution that best fits the risk probability density ranked by goodness of fit statistic omeje et al 2021 the distribution of the output can be used to calculate the level of risk that represents i the 95th percentile ii mean and iii 5th percentile or any other level of probability of interest the most probable risk represented by the mean and the best and worst case scenarios represented by the 5th and 95th percentiles of the radiogenic cancer risk distribution were evaluated the outcomes of the mcs for the radiogenic cancer risk are provided in table 6 and fig 5 a h the mean p 5 and p 95 cumulative probabilities for the radiogenic cancer risk follow the order akungba supare isua oka ikare ikaramu erusu arigidi the best case scenario depicted by the 5th percentile of the probability density reveals that 6 persons are likely to be affected in a population of 1 000 000 in akungba maximum and about 4 in 10 000 000 in arigidi minimum the worst case scenario depicted by the 95th percentile of the probability density reveals on other hand reveals that about 7 people are going to be affected in a population of 100 000 in akungba maximum and about 3 people would be affected in a population of 1 000 000 in arigidi minimum most importantly the most probable risk represented by the mean 50th percentile reveals that 3 people would be affected in a population of 100 000 in akungba and about 2 people would be affected in a population of 1 000 000 in arigidi respectively nonetheless all the estimated values of the cancer risks are within the recommended range of 10 4 and 10 6 5 conclusion groundwater samples collected mainly from manually operated hand pumped wells from akoko area of ondo state southwest nigeria have been analyzed for 222rn activity concentration in this study radiogenic health risks have been estimated using statistical and monte carlo simulation approaches the results show that some locations contain 222rn concentrations far higher than the recommended safe level of 300 pci l for drinking water there exists a strong probability for carcinogenic health risk to occur in the population of the study area as a result of high

include naturally occurring radioactive materials norm heavy and potentially toxic metals which are ubiquitous in the environment naturally occurring radionuclides such as 222rn are the major precursors of lung and other types of cancer in humans exposure to radon in drinking water in excess of 300 pci l is treated as a radiological risk while toxic metals in excess of the world health organization who maximum permissible levels in drinking water are considered both environmental and health risks to humans a total of 34 groundwater samples were collected in the akoko area of ondo state nigeria for 222rn activity concentration determination the water samples were collected using standard techniques rad7 solid state detector was utilized for the 222rn measurements the results show the activity concentration of 222rn ranging from 76 pci l to 3593 pci l with a mean value of 705 76 pci l inhalation and ingestion doses from 222rn dissolved in groundwater were evaluated for the infants children and adult populations in the study area radiological risks were evaluated through statistical and monte carlos simulation methods it can be concluded from this study that there exists

purposes industrial utilizations and agricultural practices bewick et al 2003 groundwater contamination has become one of the most critical environmental issues in developed as well as in developing nations natural radionuclides are among the major pollutants contaminating groundwater sources apart from natural processes human activities such as fertilizer application in agriculture mining and ore processing industrial activities etc release radionuclides into the environment when released into the environment due to their long half lives they remain in the environment for a long time and leach into groundwater causing contamination consumption of contaminated water may lead to deleterious health challenges such as cancer naturally occurring radionuclides such as 222rn are the major precursors of lung and other types of cancers in human according to estimates smoking and radon 222rn exposure are the two leading causes of lung cancer fatalities in the united states usepa 2003 in europe radon 222rn exposures account for approximately 9 15 of the annual cases of lung cancers darby et al 2005 krewski et al 2006 in most countries of the world 222rn is projected to be causing about 3 14 of lung cancers who 2021 extended exposure to radon 222rn indoor in excess of 100 bq m3 is considered as serious environmental problem while exposure in drinking water in the excess of 300 pci l is treated as radiological risk who 2008 according to world health organization who recommendations for drinking water quality the accumulated effective dose rate shouldn t exceed 100 μsv y in cases of extended exposure to radionuclides through ingestion pathways utilizing the average daily water intake by humans it was possible to determine the guidance level of most radionuclides concentrations in drinking water bem et al 2014 under natural circumstances 222rn is produced by the decay of radionuclides within the uranium chains and can be found in any soil rock air surface and groundwater garg et al 2015 when produced in the bedrocks 222rn can easily emanate through the porous media and dissolve into groundwater via water rock interaction processes due to its level of solubility in water 222rn can be incorporated to groundwater flows amiri et al 2017 the activity concentrations of 222rn available in groundwater depend on factors such as groundwater geochemistry the nature of the aquifer host rocks aquifer characteristics residence time of water in aquifer media the natural radioactivity content of the involved rock formation etc shabana and kinsara 2014 moreno et al 2014 groundwater frequently contains high levels of 222rn which typically account for 5 10 of the total radon produced by the breakdown of 238u and its immediate parent 226ra in aquifer grains kiro et al 2015 amiri et al 2017 several other factors usually influence the level of radon present in groundwater factors such as the presence of shear zone soil porosity local geology uranium mineralization hydraulic conductivity groundwater flow velocity etc can determine the activity concentrations of radon observed in groundwater in a given environment choubey et al 2001 depending on the mineral makeup of each rock type radon concentrations in various rock types might vary greatly in a given geological location idriss et al 2011 radon detected in groundwater may come from the water itself or from soil and rock formations through which the water flows rock and soil types with elevated radium concentrations would invariably show enhanced concentration of radon 222rn in soil gas and groundwater hess et al 1985 such rock formation with elevated radium content includes granitic rocks and uranium minerals in crystalline rock dominated geological formations with high uranium and radium content groundwater with increased radon 222rn concentrations is common przylibski 2000 przylibski et al 2022 in most of these areas groundwater with elevated levels of 222rn remained the only source of water for household usage and drinking direct transfer of radon 222rn from soil and rock into indoor and outdoor air is taken as the major exposure pathway radon 222rn can also degas from water into indoor air thereby constituting an important secondary exposure pathway for groundwater dependent populations radon is chemically inert odourless colourless and tasteless it is an alpha particle emitting radioactive gas there are three natural radioisotopes of radon 222rn 220rn and 219rn from uranium thorium and actinium decay series respectively of the three 222rn is the most researched due to it s stability longer half life and radiotoxicity because radon emits energetic alpha particles it is known to be a human carcinogen when radon gas is ingested or inhaled into the body it combines with water molecules to produce extremely reactive free radicals that damage dna cells in the lungs and eventually cause cancer edsfeldt 2001 jafir 2023 the consumption of radon 222rn through drinking water has been linked with cancers such as stomach cancer urinary tract cancer leukemia kidney diseases renal damage bone damage etc jafir 2023 ajiboye et al 2022 zamora et al 2009 who 2004 for radiation protection purposes and environmental health concerns it is crucial to carry out the radiotoxicity and health risks assessment of naturally occurring radionuclides such as 222rn in groundwater from granitic geological areas like the study area the current research is therefore aimed at investigating the activity concentration and radiotoxicity of 222rn in groundwater samples collected fron akoko area of ondo state nigeria in order to evaluate the radiological risks associated with the use of the sampled groundwater for drinking and other household purposes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection groundwater samples were taken from hand pumped boreholes with sealed covers in eight towns from akoko division of ondo state nigeria standard methods were used to collect and process the water samples for 222rn activity concentration determination at the collection points the taps were pumped continuously for about 3 min in order to eliminate the excess radon 222rn which might have accumulated on the cavity on top of the water level in the borehole isinkaye and ajiboye 2017 this was also done to get representative samples for analysis the samples were initially collected into 75 cl plastic bottles and sealed immediately at the collection points before being taken to the laboratory analysis was done within 3 6 days after the samples were collected further details on sampling methods have been published elsewhere isinkaye et al 2021 ajiboye et al 2022 kolo et al 2023 fig 1 shows the geographical spread of the sampling locations the entire sampling locations fall within the granitic geological area of ondo state 2 2 sample measurements for 222rn activity concentration for each measurement the groundwater sample was carefully transferred from the 75 cl bottle to a 250 ml vial supplied as parts of rad h2o accessories without turbulence samples were analyzed using rad7 detector the rad7 electronic radon detector is a product of durridge inc usa the rad7 detector s inbuilt pump produces bubbles within the sample during the initial 5 min and starts the measurement once a balance between the water air and radon progeny has been attained rahimi et al 2022 measurement is done automatically in 4 cycles of 5 min interval each the 222rn usually decay inside the detector s hemisphere chamber producing two alpha particles 212po and 214po at the hemisphere s core a solid state silicon semiconductor detector will record the generated alpha particles as electrical pulses when used with the rad7 detector the rad h2o accessory enables the quantifying of dissolved 222rn in water at concentrations ranging from 10 pci l to 400 000 pci l durridge 2011 2 3 222rn decay correction due to logistic constraints the water samples could not be analyzed for 222rn activity concentration immediately after collection it is important to perform decay correction in order to account for the reduction in the activity concentration of 222rn occasioned by the radioactive decay process and adjust the results for the decay of the sample from the time the samples were acquired to the time the samples were counted for samples that are counted within 10 days of sampling decay correction can be applied durridge 2011 after 10 days of sampling the concentration may be too weak to be detected the decay correction factor dcf has a time constant of 132 4 h and is a straightforward exponential function given as ajiboye et al 2022 adithya et al 2021 durridge 2011 1 d c f exp t 132 4 where t is the time lapse in hour between sampling and measurement 3 radiotoxicity and health risks assessment 3 1 annual effective dose to assess the effective dose due to ingestion of any radionuclides in water dose coefficient expressed as sv bq is utilized taking into account the ingestion rate and the concentration of such radionuclide the american national research council s nrc commission on life sciences recommended using the dose coefficient of 3 5 10 9 sv bq for this purpose nrc 1999 tan et al 2019 mamun and alazmi 2022 recently more realistic values of 1 10 8 sv bq 2 10 8 bq sv and 7 10 8 bq sv have been recommended to be used as the ingestion dose coefficient for adults children and infants respectively bem et al 2014 kendall and smith 2002 the ingestion dose e i n g is given as 2 e i n g μ s v y c r n d c c i n g v a where c r n is the radon concentration is drinking water dccingis the dose conversion coefficient and va is the estimated volume of drinking water consumed directly from tap annually the annual water consumption volume is taken as 730 l y for adult and children 365 l y for infant based on the assumption that adults and children will take 2 l of water per day and infants will take 1 l per day nrc 1999 isinkaye and ajiboye 2017 also the dose from inhalation e i n h of dissolved radon released into air during water usage is given as usepa 1991 tan et al 2019 3 e i n h c r n d c c i n h e f t f where c rn is the radon concentration in pci l ef is the average annual indoor occupancy factor estimated as 7000 h t is the radon transfer factor from water to air given as 0 1 l m3 f is the radon and its daughters equilibrium factor recommended to be 0 4 and dcc inh is the dose conversion coefficient given as 22 10 9 sv bq h m3 as recommended by nrc 1999 in this work the conversion factor of 1 bq 27 pci was considered in the calculations 3 2 radiogenic cancer risk assessment life time cancer risk r accompanying the intake of certain concentrations of 222rn in groundwater was used to assess the radiation risk in this study the associated life time cancer risk is expressed as the product of per capita activity intake i of 222rn and the applicable risk coefficient r as given in equation 4 4 r i r using equation 4 the national research council estimated the age and gender dependent cancer risks associated with lifetime ingestion of 222rn dissolved in drinking water at a concentration of 1 0 bq m or 27 pci l as 0 2 10 8 with stomach cancer accounting for the major risk nrc 1999 the calculation is based on the usepa 1994 assumption that water is consumed directly from the tap without agitation or heating at a consumption rate of 2 l d lifetime exposure of 70 y and that 20 of radon in groundwater collected from the tap is released in the process of transferring the water from tap to the stomach additionally a lifetime exposure to 222rn in water through inhalation at the same concentration of 1 0 bq m 3 was projected to cause lung cancer risk given as 1 6 10 8 these values were used as coefficients to evaluate the cancer mortality risk associated with the concentrations of 222rn in groundwater of the study area 4 results and discussion 4 1 activity concentrations of 222rn in groundwater table 1 gives the measured activity concentrations of 222rn in groundwater samples taken from selected locations in the akoko area of ondo state nigeria as given in the table the activity concentration varies from 76 23 pci l to 3593 421 pci l the mean activity concentration observed is 705 76 pci l the wide range in the distribution of the activity concentrations of 222rn may be ascribed to the variations in the geology of the local environment and the mineral composition of the rocks and soil of the study area the mean activity concentration obtained in this study is about 2 4 order of magnitude higher than the 300 pci l suggested as the permissible concentration of 222rn for safe drinking water by the world health organization who 2004 the geometric mean of the activity concentration obtained is 431 pci l which is also higher than the permissible level about 61 4 of the total samples have their activity concentrations above the recommended permissible level most of the high activity concentration of radon in groundwater are found in the supare akungba ikare and iwaro oka axes these areas are predominantly granitic in lithology for example supare akoko is well known for granitic rock for the production of dimension stones granite for local and foreign markets ibitoye and ajibade 2017 the spatial distribution of 222rn activity concentration in groundwater of the study are is presented in fig 2 high concentration of 222rn is observed in the southern to central regions of the study area spatial variability of radon concentration in the groundwater samples from akoko area of ondo state decrease outward from the akungba and supare axes as shown in the figure higher percentage of the groundwater from the study area present 222rn concentration in excess of the 300 pci l which the who recommended maximum contaminant level for drinking water the spatial distribution of 222rn as shown in fig 3 reveals a highly varied activity concentration which is comparable to distributions obtained in other locations around the world e g jamir et al 2023 haroon and muhammad 2022 kumar et al 2021 khan et al 2021 abu khader et al 2018 4 2 annual effective dose for ingestion and inhalation of 222rn the annual effective dose due to ingestion of 222rn in drinking water from underground sources from the study area ranged from 20 5 to 970 4 μsv y 41 1 1943 μsv y and 71 9 3340 μsv y respectively for adults children and infants in the study area table 1 the lowest annual effective doses are found in arigidi area while the highest values are found in akungba area the mean values obtained are as follows 190 5 381 0 and 667 4 μsv y for adults children and infants these values are of great concern because they are in the excess of the 100 μsv y action level recommended by icrp 1991 in addition to the forgoing the highest values are obtained in a university town which inhabits thousands of young adults with many living in the environment between four to ten years uninterruptedly the inhalation dose incurred from the activity concentrations of 222rn due to groundwater usage in the study ranged from 17 3 to 819 μsv y with an average value of 160 8 μsv y the mean value is higher than the recommended dose value of 100 μsv y icrp 1991 it is obvious from the results that the dose impacted on an adult dweller of the study area is more from ingestion than from inhalation pathway the values of ingestion and inhalation doses incur by an adult in the study area due to 222rn exposure from groundwater usage is higher than those incur by adults in some selected areas of pakistan armenia india malaysia palestine ghana and some parts of nigeria as shown in table 2 4 3 radiogenic cancer risk assessment due to 222rn in groundwater the estimated lifetime risks associated with ingestion and inhalation of dissolve 222rn in groundwater are presented in table 1 the results indicate that the risk due to ingestion varies as 0 6 10 5 and 26 6 10 5 with average value of 5 2 10 5 while the risk due to inhalation of 222rn in the groundwater samples varies between 0 3 10 4 and 16 0 10 4 with average value of 3 1 10 4 the average values of risks due to ingestion and inhalation of radon in water fall outside the range suggested as the safe limit which is given as 1 10 6 and 1 10 4 usepa 1991 these results shows that on the average 5 out of 100 000 population has the possibility of acquiring stomach cancer in a lifetime while 3 out of 10 000 population may suffer lung cancer in their lifetime in the study area the risk associated with inhalation is higher than the risk associated with ingestion pathway even though the dose impacted from the latter is higher 4 4 multivariate statistical analysis in order to get more interesting and statistically significant information from obtained data basic statistical analysis was performed first it was verified whether the distributions of the radon 222rn concentration and the heavy metals content in the studied ground water samples are normal distributions this is the first procedure one needs to follow see veazie 2015 das and imon 2016 if the distribution is normal the subsequent statistical tests are parametric such as t test anova etc if the distribution is not normal the subsequent tests are non parametric like wilcoxon mann whitney test etc in our case all collected data of radon concentration 34 samples constitute a set with non normal distribution p value of the order of 10 5 thus extremely lower than assumed significance level α 0 05 table 3 nonetheless the distributions within the individual groups i e 222rn concentration at a given location are normal because the calculated p values of the shapiro wilk tests are greater than α 0 05 thus one could not reject the null hypothesis of normality see again table 3 which also collects information on arithmetic and weighted means of 222rn concentration of all results and the results at a given location the arithmetic mean is not always the quantity which bests reflects the collected data on average if each measurement possess different uncertainty the better value is the weighted mean i e the mean with the uncertainty sd in this case being the weight iso 2008 this leads to significant difference between both means if the high measurements have relatively low uncertainty in such a case these values will enter the weighted mean with higher weight and one ends up with higher mean just like in table 3 especially for mean radon concentration in akungba town 2230 630 weighted mean versus 1450 580 arithmetic mean also for ikaramu ikare and supare locations because of relatively large dispersion of measurement values the deviations of both means remain quite high though a bit lower for the weighted deviation after verifying the normality of radon concentration at all locations now one is able to check if there is any statistically significant difference between the locations it is clearly visible that the highest values were reported in akungba and supare also in ikare and oka towns though in a smaller extent but the question remains whether the reported difference is statistically significant one way anova is the kind of test which answers the question at an accepted significance level α veazie 2015 applying this to 222rn concentration reveals that there is a significant difference between locations since the calculated p value reads 0 0358 when p value is less than α typically one assumes 0 05 then the null hypothesis of no difference between the groups must be rejected albeit it is worth noting that no better probability can be accepted e g 97 or 98 however to determine which locations differs from the others one has to perform pairwise tests since radon concentration at each of the studied locations has normal distribution one can use pairwise t tests the results are given in tables 4 and 5 at the accepted significance level α 0 05 one is able to determine that akungba is the location at which the concentration of radon is significantly higher from that at arigidi erusu and ikaramu moreover with lower probability namely about 90 one can also deduce that the concentration in arigidi is higher than concentration at ikare and oka table 4 applying the alternative hypothesis as being greater reveals additionally that with quite low probability less than 83 also concentration in supare is greater than at the following locations arigidi erusu and ikaramu table 5 therefore the conclusion from the analysis so far is as follows with about 90 probability the concentration of radon in akungba with weighted average 2230 630 is higher than at other locations besides supare while at supare with 1440 280 by average is higher but with only about 83 probability the tests does not verify at which locations the concentration of radon is the lowest to meet the concern about this fact let one has a look at fig 3 which presents the density distribution of lifetime cancer risk due to radon ingestion actually histograms with extrapolated polynomial function called density the lifetime cancer risk is calculated via eq 3 from radon concentration values thus conclusions for both variables are the same to sum up the distribution of lifetime cancer risk due to ingestion of radon in groundwater depends on location at which the samples were taken there is a big difficulty in verifying where the concentration is unambiguously the highest or the lowest only for akungba town it is quite clearly visible elevated values and especially much higher than in erusu arigidi and ikaramu this facts are reflected in statistical tests as well see tables 4 and 5 and description above the higher concentration of radon at given

11674,this study uses classical solute geothermometry analysis to estimate the temperature and circulation depth of the geothermal reservoir around mount meru five springs affected by magmatic gases

five springs investigated in this study two hydrothermal springs s42 and s43 around the ash cone and three springs s18 s19 and stp6 at the base of the mountain the mountain which is a steep stratovolcano dominates the topography of the area while numerous parasitic cones are prominent features bennett et al 2021 the study area has three distinct seasons a dry season from june to october and two rainy seasons long rains from february to may and short rains from november to january on the windward sides i e the eastern and southern flanks there is a mean of 960 mm of precipitation per year and thus a subtropical highland climate on the leeward sides i e the northern and western flanks 770 mm of precipitation falls per year and thus a semi arid climate prevails bennett et al 2021

flanks it is semi confined consisting of weathered fractured lava and on the south western flank it is unconfined consisting several layers of pyroclastics and fractured lava with varying degrees of weathering bennett et al 2022b 2 2 water sampling and laboratory analysis the five springs were sampled in 2017 and 2018 two hydrothermal springs s42 and s43 were sampled once in september 2018 while springs s18 and s19 were sampled three times september 2017 august 2018 and september 2018 and spring stp6 was sampled twice september 2017 and september 2018 thus a total of ten 10 water samples were collected and analysed for this study the water samples were collected in high density polyethylene bottles of 250 ml capacity the bottles were thoroughly pre washed with the spring water to be sampled an icebox cooler was used to store and transport samples in the field prior to refrigeration several analytical methods were used to determine the concentration of various hydrochemical parameters a portable ph meter hach sension 1 was used to measure ph while a portable electronic ec meter hach sension 5 was used to measure electrical conductivity before analysis samples for cation analysis were filtered with a 0 45 μm filter and then brought to a ph of about 2 by the addition of ultra pure nitric acid the cations which were measured are calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k manganese mn2 iron fe2 fe³ and ammonium nh4 silica sio2 is an important species in water samples in this study it was measured as silicon si4 in the water samples then si4 was converted to silica sio2 concentration which is the important parameter for estimating temperatures of geothermal reservoir a varian zeeman spectra aa 400 applying flame atomic absorption spectroscopy faas was used to determine the concentrations of ca2 mg2 na k mn2 fe2 fe³ and si4 in a dilute solution while the molecular absorption spectrophotometer uv vis shimadzu uv mini 1240 was used to measure nh4 concentration for the measurement of na and k faas flame atomic absorption spectroscopy technology was used because it has a high degree of sensitivity is free from interference by other metals present and is easy to operate the molecular absorption spectrophotometer uv vis shimadzu uv mini 1240 was also used to determine the concentrations of the following anions sulphate so4 2 chloride cl nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 measurement of sulphate was done turbidimetrically by precipitating baso4 through adding bacl2 and measurement of absorbance value at wavelength of 420 nm while measurement of chloride was done using spectroquant chloride test cat no 1 14897 and measurement of absorbance value at wavelength of 400 nm measurement of nitrate was done using spectroquant nitrate test cat no 1 14773 0001 and measurement of absorbance value at wavelength of 422 nm while measurement of nitrite was done using sulphanilamide and ned reagent n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride and measurement of absorbance value at wavelength of 543 nm bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 were obtained by titration with dilute hcl acid using a digital titrator model no 16900 from the hach company however during the analysis the tipping point at ph 8 2 was not determined with sufficient analytical precision indicating that the distribution of hco3 and co3 2 in the samples varies greatly with ph so that it was impossible to measure them accurately with ph as a criterion thus total alkalinity ta which is the sum of hco3 and co3 2 is expressed in mg l of hco3 an ion selective electrode ise hach intellical electrode was used to measure concentration of fluoride f in water samples tisab solution was added to the sample it is a buffer solution that increases the ionic strength of a solution to a relatively high level it is important for ion selective electrodes because it measures activity rather than concentration thus increasing the accuracy of the measurement the detection limit of the method was 0 01 mg l ise technology was preferred to uv vis spectrometry because it is accurate fast economical and sensitive during the water sample analysis quality control and assurance were maintained by checking the measurement system of specific equipment i e test reagents measurement device and handling and the mode of working dilute standard solutions were used for each parameter for faas and for molecular spectrophotometry a set of standards was constructed using deionised water and commercial analytical chemical standards resulting in standards with different concentrations in the range of the sample or the sample was diluted to fit into that range this was done to ensure analytical quality control and quality assurance equipment calibration was performed by analysing a range of standards and calibrating the equipment directly from the measured ion concentrations the quantitative analysis of the samples considered the calibration curve which provides good linearity to measure the samples up to the required detection limits to check the quality of the data it was verified that the results were within the detection limits the samples whose measured values exceeded the detection limits were diluted with distilled water the ph meter and the ec meter were also checked for accuracy by measuring standards with known ph and ec concentrations after each measurement the ph and ec meter were washed thoroughly with distilled water after completion of the analyses the ionic balance was calculated because of electroneutrality the sum of cation charges must equal the sum of anion charges an error on the ionic balance up to 5 was accepted the tds mg l was calculated as the sum of all solutes and compared to ec μs cm analytical methodologies

water works association awwa the water environment federation wef and the american public health association apha apha 2017 2 3 data processing and analysis the concentration of silicon si4 in mg l was converted to sio2 by dividing by 0 4674 the conversion factor the ionic balance error for the analysis was used as a criterion to check the quality control and quality assurance of the laboratory analysis the maximum allowable percent error of 5 was used the phreeqc software was used to calculate the saturation index si for different mineral phases to analyse the equilibrium state of groundwater parkhurst and appelo 2013 while the spreadsheet of liquid analysis v3 by powell and cumming 2010 was used to create geoindicator plots 2 4 classical solute geothermometry in this study classical solute geothermometers are applied to evaluate the temperature of the hydrothermal system since only water chemistry data are available for the springs the most commonly applied classical solute geothermometers are na k ca fournier and truesdell 1973 na k fournier 1979 giggenbach 1988 silica fournier and potter 1982 and k mg giggenbach 1988 for decades these geothermometers have been successfully applied in estimating temperatures of deep hydrothermal reservoirs by analysing relationships between temperature and fluid chemical composition based on temperature dependent mineral ﬂuid equilibria xu et al 2016 hsu and yeh 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical composition and mineral saturation states of spring samples table 1 shows the main physicochemical parameters of the magmatic gas affected springs in the study area the main water type of the spring samples is f rich nahco3 with a mean ph 8 3 i e alkaline groundwater the error in ionic balance for the analysis ranges from 0 3 to 4 5 mean value 2 5 the range is less than 5 which is the maximum allowable percent error the physicochemical parameters for s18 s19 and stp6 in table 1 are the mean values of the parameters of the analysed samples taken during the two field campaigns these springs were sampled more than once refer section 2 2 the samples show ph values between 8 1 and 8 5 with a mean of 8 3 their ec values range from 3320 μs cm at reference temperature of 25 c to 4590 μs cm with a mean of 3709 μs cm while their tds values range from 2885 to 4214 mg l with a mean of 3261 mg l the tds values of these springs are similar to the tds values of water samples from low enthalpy reservoirs of the dholera geothermal field in india range of tds 3968 4205 mg l however their sio2 concentrations range 22 0 60 5 mg l mean 35 3 mg l are higher than the sio2 concentrations of samples from the dholera geothermal field range 10 0 16 9 mg l mean 13 0 mg l shah et al 2021 this indicates a possibility of slightly higher estimated temperatures for a geothermal reservoir around mount meru compared to the estimated reservoir temperatures from dholera geothermal field the results of the saturation indices si for various mineral phases table 2 indicate that spring samples exhibit all three saturation conditions i e undersaturated equilibrium and oversaturated for chalcedony and oversaturated for quartz and calcite oversaturation with respect to quartz in groundwater is common this is because quartz precipitation is kinetically suppressed in low temperature systems such as groundwater however it is true that the temperature at depth will be greater than in normal groundwater 3 2 solute geothermometry 3 2 1 geoindicator plots fig 2 a shows that the samples are in the field of peripheral waters with high bicarbonate content this type of water does not give more reliable cation results giggenbach 1992 shah et al 2021 fig 2b shows that three samples including the two hydrothermal springs are in the field of partially equilibrated waters however close to the field of immature waters while the other two springs are on the boundary between the fields of immature and partially equilibrated waters so the temperature approximation by cation geothermometers may yield results with high uncertainty under this condition the reliable geothermometers to be used are silica giggenbach 1988 fan et al 2019 hsu and yeh 2020 shah et al 2021 moreover fig 3 shows that the samples are very far from the equilibrium line again this indicates the unreliability of using cation geothermometers therefore only silica geothermometers are used for this study 3 2 2 reservoir temperature circulation depth and geothermal potential table 3 shows that the two quartz geothermometers equations 1 and 2 fournier and potter 1982 give similar temperature results range 67 111 c which are higher than the results from the chalcedony geothermometers range 35 82 c equation 3 fournier and potter 1982 1 t 1309 5 91 log s i o 2 273 15 q u a r t z c o n d u c t i v e 2 t 1522 5 75 log s i o 2 273 15 q u a r t z a d i a b a t i c 3 t 1032 4 69 log s i

t where z is depth of circulation km t is the temperature of reservoir c i e 35 111 c for this study t 0 is the annual mean temperature of the study area c i e 25 c in this study t gradient is the geothermal gradient c km which is assumed to be 45 c km reﬂecting the geothermal change per 1 km below the ground surface the si in table 2 is for the spring water temperature measured in situ table 4 shows what the si would be of spring waters at higher temperatures 70 and 110 c to imply conditions of water equilibration at depth solubility increases with increasing temperature at 70 c the spring samples are oversaturated with respect to calcite and somewhat in equilibrium with quartz compared to chalcedony suggesting that the equilibrium of silica at 70 c is determined primarily by quartz i e the quartz geothermometer is more reliable for estimates of reservoir temperature and groundwater system depth than the chalcedony geothermometer although again 70 c is not sufficient to induce chemical equilibrium with quartz by precipitation thus when the results of the two quartz geothermometers in table 3 are considered the estimated temperatures of geothermal reservoir range from 70 to 110 c with a mean temperature value of 85 c consistent with temperatures of low temperature hydrothermal systems reed 1983 higher temperatures are expected on active volcanoes for example mount meru the estimated low temperatures are attributed to the mixing of hydrothermal and cold recharge waters the value of geothermal gradient used in this study 45 c km is an estimate based on the values reported by other studies conducted in the part of east african rift system near the study area a value of 42 5 c km has been reported as the current geothermal gradient in turkana in kenya boone et al 2018 while values of 30 60 c km have been reported for the central kenya rift wheildon et al 1994 therefore by considering the quartz geothermometer results the estimated circulation depth of the hydrothermal reservoir using the mean temperature values in table 3 ranges from 1 3 to 1 4 km the applied geothermal gradient assumes this gradual increase in temperature with rock depth however we are dealing here with groundwater and not with groundwater flowing slowly through a porous medium which can be assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the rocks through which it flows but with groundwater flowing through fractures which can be expected to flow faster and be warmer than its surroundings otherwise it would not be warmer in the springs compared to the ground temperature at the springs so the estimated depth 1 3 1 4 km of the warm reservoir which we cannot really call hot is exaggerated it is shallower since groundwaters moves along the fractures at a higher speed making the circulation depth shallower and the time of interaction between water and rock shorter thus it is possible to find low temperature geothermal energy resources around mount meru especially on its eastern flank in a similar geological setting tectonic region in songwe area in south western part of tanzania asnin et al 2021 used na k ca mg correction and k mg geothermometers to analyse the songwe thermal springs na hco3 type of water with discharge temperatures ranging from 37 to 85 c and estimated that the reservoir temperatures of the songwe geothermal system range from 125 to 148 c at a circulation depth of 2 5 km indicating a medium temperature geothermal system the estimated reservoir temperatures and circulation depth of the songwe geothermal system are higher than the estimated reservoir temperatures and circulation depths of a low temperature hydrothermal system analysed in this study around mount meru 70 110 c and 1 3 1 4 km respectively moreover in other similar geological setting tectonic region in chaves geothermal area in northern part of portugal results of k2 mg and silica geothermometers for chaves s hot na hco3 co2 rich spring and borehole groundwaters show that the mean geothermal reservoir temperature is about 120 c similar to the maximum estimated reservoir temperature of this study i e 110 c assuming geothermal gradients of 30 c km in the crust the estimated circulation depth for the chaves hot waters is about 3 5 km the discharge temperatures range from 48 to 76 c aires barros et al 1998 duque et al 1998 marques et al 1999 2006 2019 furthermore compared to another similar geological environment tectonic region in the dholera geothermal field in india the estimated reservoir temperatures of a projected low temperature hydrothermal system around mount meru range 70 110 c are slightly higher than the estimated reservoir temperatures of dholera geothermal field range 60 80 c shah et al 2021 the results of classical geothermometers in this study are based on the solubility of a few minerals or semi empirical correlations therefore multicomponent geothermometry which requires detailed aqueous chemistry and mineralogical data has the advantage of complete fluid analyses and numerical calculations that have a thermodynamic basis spycher et al 2016 which can be used in future studies in the area to complement the results of this study fig 4 shows a preliminary conceptual model of the hydrothermal reservoir around mount meru the model indicates that rainwaters i e meteoric waters that recharges from the mountain high altitude comes into contact with a deep magmatic heat source after which some of the waters return to the surface via fractures faults that connect a deep heat source to the ground surface where the hydrothermal springs discharge bennett et al 2022a the hydrothermal springs contain the most highly mineralised groundwater in the study area mean tds and f values of 3640 mg l and 198 mg l respectively and they are warmer mean temperature 20 c than the surrounding springs mean temperature 13 c bennett et al 2021 in addition ghiglieri et al 2012 found that one of the hydrothermal springs had a temperature of about 22 4 c and the results of isotopic analyses indicated depleted 3h content for this spring suggesting deep circulating groundwater furthermore lugodisha et al 2020 used water isotope tracers and suggested that the recharge areas for the arusha aquifer are located between 1800 and 3500 m a s l elevation on the slopes of mount meru 4 conclusions and recommendations the use of classical solute geothermometry on groundwater samples from two hydrothermal springs and three other springs on the slopes of mount meru contributed to a preliminary approximation of geothermal reservoir temperatures and circulation depths of the hydrothermal springs using silica geothermometers the results show that the estimated temperatures of geothermal reservoir range from 70 to 110 c with a mean temperature of 85 c consistent with the temperatures of low temperature geothermal systems the estimated circulation depths of this geothermal system range from 1 3 to 1 4 km deep however may be shallower due to the influence of fractures faults therefore depending on current results it is possible to find a low temperature geothermal energy resources on the eastern flank of mount meru a simplified preliminary conceptual model of the hydrothermal reservoir for mount meru indicates that cold meteoric waters rainwaters recharging at high altitude meet a magmatic heat source at great depth and that some of the waters return to the surface via fractures faults i e where the hydrothermal springs discharge furthermore the study recommends that possible future studies apply techniques such as multicomponent geothermometry stable isotopes fracture analysis and piezometric mapping which could be used to create a much more robust model of the hydrothermal reservoir in the area author

values exceeded the detection limits were diluted with distilled water the ph meter and the ec meter were also checked for accuracy by measuring standards with known ph and ec concentrations after each measurement the ph and ec meter were washed thoroughly with distilled water after completion of the analyses the ionic balance was calculated because of electroneutrality the sum of cation charges must equal the sum of anion charges an error on the ionic balance up to 5 was accepted the tds mg l was calculated as the sum of all solutes and compared to ec μs cm analytical methodologies

water works association awwa the water environment federation wef and the american public health association apha apha 2017 2 3 data processing and analysis the concentration of silicon si4 in mg l was converted to sio2 by dividing by 0 4674 the conversion factor the ionic balance error for the analysis was used as a criterion to check the quality control and quality assurance of the laboratory analysis the maximum allowable percent error of 5 was used the phreeqc software was used to calculate the saturation index si for different mineral phases to analyse the equilibrium state of groundwater parkhurst and appelo 2013 while the spreadsheet of liquid analysis v3 by powell and cumming 2010 was used to create geoindicator plots 2 4 classical solute geothermometry in this study classical solute geothermometers are applied to evaluate the temperature of the hydrothermal system since only water chemistry data are available for the springs the most commonly applied classical solute geothermometers are na k ca fournier and truesdell 1973 na k fournier 1979 giggenbach 1988 silica fournier and potter 1982 and k mg giggenbach 1988 for decades these geothermometers have been successfully applied in estimating temperatures of deep hydrothermal reservoirs by analysing relationships between temperature and fluid chemical composition based on temperature dependent mineral ﬂuid equilibria xu et al 2016 hsu and yeh 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical composition and mineral saturation states of spring samples table 1 shows the main physicochemical parameters of the magmatic gas affected springs in the study area the main water type of the spring samples is f rich nahco3 with a mean ph 8 3 i e alkaline groundwater the error in ionic balance for the analysis ranges from 0 3 to 4 5 mean value 2 5 the range is less than 5 which is the maximum allowable percent error the physicochemical parameters for s18 s19 and stp6 in table 1 are the mean values of the parameters of the analysed samples taken during the two field campaigns these springs were sampled more than once refer section 2 2 the samples show ph values between 8 1 and 8 5 with a mean of 8 3 their ec values range from 3320 μs cm at reference temperature of 25 c to 4590 μs cm with a mean of 3709 μs cm while their tds values range from 2885 to 4214 mg l with a mean of 3261 mg l the tds values of these springs are similar to the tds values of water samples from low enthalpy reservoirs of the dholera geothermal field in india range of tds 3968 4205 mg l however their sio2 concentrations range 22 0 60 5 mg l mean 35 3 mg l are higher than the sio2 concentrations of samples from the dholera geothermal field range 10 0 16 9 mg l mean 13 0 mg l shah et al 2021 this indicates a possibility of slightly higher estimated temperatures for a geothermal reservoir around mount meru compared to the estimated reservoir temperatures from dholera geothermal field the results of the saturation indices si for various mineral phases table 2 indicate that spring samples exhibit all three saturation conditions i e undersaturated equilibrium and oversaturated for chalcedony and oversaturated for quartz and calcite oversaturation with respect to quartz in groundwater is common this is because quartz precipitation is kinetically suppressed in low temperature systems such as groundwater however it is true that the temperature at depth will be greater than in normal groundwater 3 2 solute geothermometry 3 2 1 geoindicator plots fig 2 a shows that the samples are in the field of peripheral waters with high bicarbonate content this type of water does not give more reliable cation results giggenbach 1992 shah et al 2021 fig 2b shows that three samples including the two hydrothermal springs are in the field of partially equilibrated waters however close to the field of immature waters while the other two springs are on the boundary between the fields of immature and partially equilibrated waters so the temperature approximation by cation geothermometers may yield results with high uncertainty under this condition the reliable geothermometers to be used are silica giggenbach 1988 fan et al 2019 hsu and yeh 2020 shah et al 2021 moreover fig 3 shows that the samples are very far from the equilibrium line again this indicates the unreliability of using cation geothermometers therefore only silica geothermometers are used for this study 3 2 2 reservoir temperature circulation depth and geothermal potential table 3 shows that the two quartz geothermometers equations 1 and 2 fournier and potter 1982 give similar temperature results range 67 111 c which are higher than the results from the chalcedony geothermometers range 35 82 c equation 3 fournier and potter 1982 1 t 1309 5 91 log s i o 2 273 15 q u a r t z c o n d u c t i v e 2 t 1522 5 75 log s i o 2 273 15 q u a r t z a d i a b a t i c 3 t 1032 4 69 log s i

t where z is depth of circulation km t is the temperature of reservoir c i e 35 111 c for this study t 0 is the annual mean temperature of the study area c i e 25 c in this study t gradient is the geothermal gradient c km which is assumed to be 45 c km reﬂecting the geothermal change per 1 km below the ground surface the si in table 2 is for the spring water temperature measured in situ table 4 shows what the si would be of spring waters at higher temperatures 70 and 110 c to imply conditions of water equilibration at depth solubility increases with increasing temperature at 70 c the spring samples are oversaturated with respect to calcite and somewhat in equilibrium with quartz compared to chalcedony suggesting that the equilibrium of silica at 70 c is determined primarily by quartz i e the quartz geothermometer is more reliable for estimates of reservoir temperature and groundwater system depth than the chalcedony geothermometer although again 70 c is not sufficient to induce chemical equilibrium with quartz by precipitation thus when the results of the two quartz geothermometers in table 3 are considered the estimated temperatures of geothermal reservoir range from 70 to 110 c with a mean temperature value of 85 c consistent with temperatures of low temperature hydrothermal systems reed 1983 higher temperatures are expected on active volcanoes for example mount meru the estimated low temperatures are attributed to the mixing of hydrothermal and cold recharge waters the value of geothermal gradient used in this study 45 c km is an estimate based on the values reported by other studies conducted in the part of east african rift system near the study area a value of 42 5 c km has been reported as the current geothermal gradient in turkana in kenya boone et al 2018 while values of 30 60 c km have been reported for the central kenya rift wheildon et al 1994 therefore by considering the quartz geothermometer results the estimated circulation depth of the hydrothermal reservoir using the mean temperature values in table 3 ranges from 1 3 to 1 4 km the applied geothermal gradient assumes this gradual increase in temperature with rock depth however we are dealing here with groundwater and not with groundwater flowing slowly through a porous medium which can be assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the rocks through which it flows but with groundwater flowing through fractures which can be expected to flow faster and be warmer than its surroundings otherwise it would not be warmer in the springs compared to the ground temperature at the springs so the estimated depth 1 3 1 4 km of the warm reservoir which we cannot really call hot is exaggerated it is shallower since groundwaters moves along the fractures at a higher speed making the circulation depth shallower and the time of interaction between water and rock shorter thus it is possible to find low temperature geothermal energy resources around mount meru especially on its eastern flank in a similar geological setting tectonic region in songwe area in south western part of tanzania asnin et al 2021 used na k ca mg correction and k mg geothermometers to analyse the songwe thermal springs na hco3 type of water with discharge temperatures ranging from 37 to 85 c and estimated that the reservoir temperatures of the songwe geothermal system range from 125 to 148 c at a circulation depth of 2 5 km indicating a medium temperature geothermal system the estimated reservoir temperatures and circulation depth of the songwe geothermal system are higher than the estimated reservoir temperatures and circulation depths of a low temperature hydrothermal system analysed in this study around mount meru 70 110 c and 1 3 1 4 km respectively moreover in other similar geological setting tectonic region in chaves geothermal area in northern part of portugal results of k2 mg and silica geothermometers for chaves s hot na hco3 co2 rich spring and borehole groundwaters show that the mean geothermal reservoir temperature is about 120 c similar to the maximum estimated reservoir temperature of this study i e 110 c assuming geothermal gradients of 30 c km in the crust the estimated circulation depth for the chaves hot waters is about 3 5 km the discharge temperatures range from 48 to 76 c aires barros et al 1998 duque et al 1998 marques et al 1999 2006 2019 furthermore compared to another similar geological environment tectonic region in the dholera geothermal field in india the estimated reservoir temperatures of a projected low temperature hydrothermal system around mount meru range 70 110 c are slightly higher than the estimated reservoir temperatures of dholera geothermal field range 60 80 c shah et al 2021 the results of classical geothermometers in this study are based on the solubility of a few minerals or semi empirical correlations therefore multicomponent geothermometry which requires detailed aqueous chemistry and mineralogical data has the advantage of complete fluid analyses and numerical calculations that have a thermodynamic basis spycher et al 2016 which can be used in future studies in the area to complement the results of this study fig 4 shows a preliminary conceptual model of the hydrothermal reservoir around mount meru the model indicates that rainwaters i e meteoric waters that recharges from the mountain high altitude comes into contact with a deep magmatic heat source after which some of the waters return to the surface via fractures faults that connect a deep heat source to the ground surface where the hydrothermal springs discharge bennett et al 2022a the hydrothermal springs contain the most highly mineralised groundwater in the study area mean tds and f values of 3640 mg l and 198 mg l respectively and they are warmer mean temperature 20 c than the surrounding springs mean temperature 13 c bennett et al 2021 in addition ghiglieri et al 2012 found that one of the hydrothermal springs had a temperature of about 22 4 c and the results of isotopic analyses indicated depleted 3h content for this spring suggesting deep circulating groundwater furthermore lugodisha et al 2020 used water isotope tracers and suggested that the recharge areas for the arusha aquifer are located between 1800 and 3500 m a s l elevation on the slopes of mount meru 4 conclusions and recommendations the use of classical solute geothermometry on groundwater samples from two hydrothermal springs and three other springs on the slopes of mount meru contributed to a preliminary approximation of geothermal reservoir temperatures and circulation depths of the hydrothermal springs using silica geothermometers the results show that the estimated temperatures of geothermal reservoir range from 70 to 110 c with a mean temperature of 85 c consistent with the temperatures of low temperature geothermal systems the estimated circulation depths of this geothermal system range from 1 3 to 1 4 km deep however may be shallower due to the influence of fractures faults therefore depending on current results it is possible to find a low temperature geothermal energy resources on the eastern flank of mount meru a simplified preliminary conceptual model of the hydrothermal reservoir for mount meru indicates that cold meteoric waters rainwaters recharging at high altitude meet a magmatic heat source at great depth and that some of the waters return to the surface via fractures faults i e where the hydrothermal springs discharge furthermore the study recommends that possible future studies apply techniques such as multicomponent geothermometry stable isotopes fracture analysis and piezometric mapping which could be used to create a much more robust model of the hydrothermal reservoir in the area author
