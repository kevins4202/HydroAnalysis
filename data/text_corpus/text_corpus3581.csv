17905,the effect of extracellular polysaccharides on the structural stability of granular sludge is widely recognized and determining their mechanism of action on the stability of granules remains challenging herein enzymatic experiments were used to systematically study the stability changes and internal mechanisms of anammox granular sludge following hydrolysis of extracellular proteins and polysaccharides ps the results revealed that the selective hydrolysis of the proteins hardly affected the stability of the granules while the hydrolysis of the ps branched chains caused the granules to disintegrate the hydrolysis of the ps chains in the eps matrix decreased the degree of branching width and height via nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy afm and these parameters are closely related to granular stability moreover scanning electron microscopy sem showed a large number of pores and cracks on the granules bacterial adhesion decreased and the eps adhered to the surface of the granules dissolved the changes in the gel characteristics of the granules were studied by rheology and the mechanical strength and viscosity of the granular sludge decreased for the surface characteristics of granules the zeta potential and hydrophobicity both decreased revealing that changes in the branched chain configuration of the ps and the degree of branching caused granular disintegration spectral analysis showed that the hydrolysis of the branch points and the branched glycosides of ps led to a higher proportion of hydrophilic and electronegative groups in the eps matrix which hindered bacterial aggregation and reduced anammox granule stability this investigation clarifies the impact of the branched chain configuration of the ps and their degree of branching on anammox granule stability which will promote the further application of anammox granules graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox granular sludge stability exopolysaccharide branched chain 1 introduction anammox granular sludge received more attention from scholars for its excellent biomass retention and settleability fux et al 2002 lin and wang 2017 under the condition of high cell density information exchange and cooperation among anammox bacteria would also be enhanced resulting in an increase in bacterial metabolism and activity kartal et al 2011 most importantly these advantages of anammox granular sludge are based on the structural stability substrate shock zhang et al 2016 low ambient temperature and high calcium concentration xing et al 2015 have a negative influence on granular stability and thus could disintegrate resulting in significant biomass decrease and ultimately system deterioration or even failure therefore elucidating the mechanism of anammox granular stability to promote the anammox process is of great significance it is well known that extracellular polymers eps play an important role in granular stability zhang et al 2019a and studies on the concentration of eps affecting the stability of anammox granules have been widely reported feng et al 2019 lotti et al 2019b lu et al 2012 although many studies on the proteins pn in eps for biological wastewater treatment have been conducted boleij et al 2019 fang et al 2018 lotti et al 2019a silva et al 2012 relatively few studies on polysaccharides ps have been reported in recent years some scholars pointed out that ps was conducive during the formation of anammox granules nia et al 2015 and higher ps contents can promote cell to cell adhesion and strengthen microbial structures by forming polymer matrices punal et al 2003 tay et al 2001 in addition α d glucopyranose and α linked polysaccharides may form the skeleton of anammox granules as their presence greatly enhances the strength of these granules caudan et al 2014 lin and wang 2017 β linked ps in the skeleton can help maintain the structure of the eps matrix and the stability of the granules adav et al 2008 wang et al 2005 in conclusion the previous studies on the role of ps in granular stability mainly focused on ps content and the category of glycosidic bonds it was reported that hydrogels made of cross linking of ps chains are important factors in the formation of granules seviour et al 2012 ps can form stable interchain cross links and bridges through hydrogen bonding and ca2 to form so called egg box models that hold cells together christensen et al 1990 sajjad and kim 2015 seviour et al 2012 artificial hydrogels formation by cross linking alginate with ca2 has been used for anammox immobilization zhang and okabe 2017 and polymeric alginate chains can provide the groups that bind to the calcium to enhance the gel strength maleki et al 2020 according to these reports the cross link structure of ps and its ability to form a gel network may be the key feature explaining the mechanical stability of the granules however in terms of the function of ps the key to controlling the mechanical stability of the granules is unknown ps is a polymer with a long backbone and many branches and these side chains provide numerous flocculent binding sites yuan et al 2011 it is a pity that there are no or few studies on the effect of ps chain structure on the stability of anammox granular sludge therefore clarifying the mechanism of anammox granular stability from the perspective of ps chain structure will be a challenging and interesting exploration process amylase has been well studied for wastewater treatment and in other fields adav et al 2008 andersson et al 2002 bonilla et al 2015 lin and wang 2017 lynn and stark 1992 α amylase randomly shears hydrolyses α 1 4 glycosidic bonds β amylase hydrolyses α 1 4 glycosidic bonds from nonreducing termini and isoamylase hydrolyses α 1 6 glycoside bonds at branch points functionally speaking α amylase randomly breaks ps chains β amylase only destroys side chain structures and isoamylase hydrolyses chains at their branch points a schematic of ps hydrolysis by amylases is shown in fig 1 therefore selective enzymatic hydrolysis experiments can be used to effectively investigate the effects of different ps chain structure on the granular stability afm and nmr can be used to determine the ps branched chains configuration and the degree of branching conformational changes in ps polymers can be visualized with afm by comparing native granules to those exposed to different enzymes seviour et al 2010 wang et al 2019 1h nmr spectroscopy can be used to determine the positions of protons on the carbon chains providing important information on α 1 4 glycosidic and α 1 6 glycosidic bonds and this technique allows the quantitative analysis of the degree of branching of complex ps while afm analysis does not ciric and loos 2013 in this study glycosidic bonds were enzymatically hydrolysed to investigate the importance of ps branched chains and their degree of branching on the maintenance of anammox granular sludge stability the results can provide theoretical evidence for the mechanism of anammox granular stabilization and the promotion and further application of the anammox process 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of sludge the anammox granules were sampled from a lab scale anammox expanded granular sludge bed reactor the influent and reflux water were pumped to the bottom of the reactor by a peristaltic pump to maintain a reflux ratio of 25 1 and an upward flow velocity of 4 42 m h the nh4 n and no2 n concentrations in the influent in the reactor were approximately 180 mg l and 190 mg l respectively and the total nitrogen load was 2 39 kg m3 d nitrogen in the form of ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen was provided by nh4cl and nano2 respectively khco3 was added in a hco3 to nh4 molar ratio of 2 1 the reactor temperature was maintained at 32 1 c and the influent ph was 7 8 8 0 other main components of the influent included 0 025 g l 1 kh2po4 0 2 g l 1 cacl2 2h2o 0 2 g l 1 mgso4 7h2o and 1 25 ml l 1 trace elements i and ii van de graaf et al 1996 during the sampling of the granular sludge the average removal efficiencies for ammonia nitrogen nitrite nitrogen and total nitrogen in the reactor were 94 3 1 2 97 5 1 7 and 87 2 2 1 respectively during the stable operation of the reactor the molar ratio among ammonia nitrogen removed nitrite nitrogen removed and nitrate nitrogen produced nh4 n no2 n no3 n ration was 1 1 116 0 115 this value is close to the stoichiometric value of 1 1 146 0 161 reported by lotti et al 2014 which indicates that anammox was the dominant nitrogen removal pathway in the reactor in this study the sample granules were selected by an 8 12 mesh sieve to ensure that the granule size was approximately 2 0 mm and then the abnormal and broken granules were removed with tweezers photographs of the anammox granular samples are shown in fig a1a the microbial community composition of the genus of anammox granules is shown in fig a2 and the genus abundance of anammox bacteria was 48 95 the method of high throughput sequencing is described in the supplementary data sequence data were deposited in the ncbi database accession numbers srx7899962 2 2 experimental scheme group 1 was the control and granules in groups 2 5 were hydrolysed by α amylase β amylase isoamylase and proteinase k to investigate the stability changes and mechanism of anammox granule sludge stability the experimental details of the enzymatic hydrolysis reactions are shown in table 1 adav et al 2008 seviour et al 2009 three replicates were conducted for each enzyme experiment and control each enzyme solution was prepared in a 100 ml conical flask working volume of 25 ml each pure water was used for the control then 70 0 g wet granules were randomly divided into five equal groups each group 14 0 g and each group was added to the conical flasks containing water or enzyme solution all conical flasks were incubated at 37 c in a water bath with shaking for 1 h 50 rpm the granules were washed with 0 1 m pbs immediately after hydrolysis and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 20 min the washing and centrifugation were repeated 5 times for the removal of any remaining enzyme 2 3 characteristion and morphology of the granular sludge 2 3 1 degree of granular sludge disintegration and stability fine particles discharged from disintegrating granules contribute to the increase in sample turbidity wu et al 2017b so the turbidity values can be used to characterize the degree of granular disintegration dg the ratio of the turbidity value of each experimental group to the maximum disintegration group was used to determine the relative degree of granular stability ds smaller ds values correspond to higher stability the turbidity was measured by a turbidimeter hach 2100q usa wet granular sludge 10 0 g was randomly and equally divided into five groups each group 2 0 g and then hydrolysed washed and centrifuged as described in section 2 2 the samples were placed into the glass bottle of the turbidimeter with 10 ml pure water to determine turbidity each sample was measured three times at room temperature after turbidity tests the samples were used for rheological measurements 2 3 2 morphology of the granular sludge the visible morphology of the hydrolysed anammox granules was photographed with a digital camera and image pro plus version 6 0 software was used to analyse the particle size distribution of the granules in fig a1b the microscopic morphology of the granules was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy jsm 7800f japan and the granules were pretreated according to a previously reported procedure adav et al 2008 2 3 3 the rheological properties of anammox granules rheological measurements were performed using a controlled stress and strain rheometer anton paar mcr 302 austria with a cone plate geometry 25 mm diameter with a 1 5 mm gap between the upper and lower plates prior to rheological testing 2 0 g granules after the turbidity test were filtered with filter paper for 10 min then the lower plate surface was covered with granules with no gaps oscillatory amplitude scans were performed on the granules at a fixed frequency ω of 5 rad s ranging from 0 01 to 100 strain γ the storage modulus g the loss modulus g and the complex viscosity η were calculated according to a reference lin and wang 2017 2 3 4 zeta potential and hydrophobicity of granules a 0 5 g portion of granules was ground and dispersed into 10 ml of 0 1 m nacl solution and the od at 546 nm was adjusted to 0 1 by adding 0 1 m nacl solution with an uv vis spectrophotometer persee tu 1900 china for zeta potential and contact angle tests the zeta potential of the sludge suspension at 25 c was measured using a zeta potential analyser zetasizer nano zs90 british the reported data were obtained by calculating the average of three measurements the sludge layer was filtered by 150 ml sludge suspension through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane for contact angle tests of each sample the contact angle between each sample and water was measured by the sessile drop technique and the measurements were carried out using a contact angle analyzer sindin sdc 1000 china the operation was performed according to the method described by liu et al 2010 and the reported data were obtained by calculating the average value of 10 parallel measurements hydrophobicity was determined from the contact angles between the samples and water 2 4 eps extraction and testing 2 4 1 eps extraction and analysis the eps was extracted using cation exchange resin frolund et al 1996 a 10 0 g portion of granules was ground into a suspension and transferred to a conical flask approximately 70 g g vss cation exchange resin was added to the suspension and the mixture was shaken at 150 rpm for 2 h at 4 c then the suspension was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 20 min at 4 c then the suspension was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 20 min at 4 c the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane to obtain the eps solution ps was determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method based on glucose masuko et al 2005 and protein was determined by the bca method ras et al 2008 2 4 2 ftir and xps spectra the eps solution was freeze dried at 45 c to afford a powder 10 mg powder were mixed with kbr at a ratio of 1 200 for each sample and the samples were analysed with an ftir spectrometer tensor 27 germany to determine the functional groups present in the eps all spectra were normalized after acquisition to a maximum emission of 1 0 for comparative purposes eps powder 20 mg was analysed with an x ray photoelectron spectrometer thermo fisher scientific escalab250xi to determine the c o bond containing functional groups thermo avantage software version 5 976 was used to assess the contributions of these components by deconvolution deconvolution of those functional groups of the xps spectra was performed according to a reference hou et al 2015 2 5 ps purification and testing 2 5 1 ps separation and purification the ps was purified as described in the reference zhang et al 2015 2 5 2 degree of branching of the ps chain the degree of branching of the ps chain was determined by 1h nmr spectroscopy because the protons of the α 1 4 and α 1 6 glycosidic bonds give distinct signals the degree of branching can be determined from the ratio between the integrals of these signals ciric and loos 2013 the reaction parameters were as follows 10 0 mg of the ps sample was precisely weighed in an ep tube the hydroxyl protons of the ps were exchanged in d2o with heating at 80 c overnight the samples were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was transferred into an nmr tube for automated detection the instruments and parameters used in this detection were as follows bruker biospin gmbh temperature 60 c number of scans 32 resonance rf 500 23 mhz the data were analysed using mestrenova software and the degree of branching was calculated using the formula db i1 6 i1 6 i1 4 100 where db is the degree of branching i1 6 is the relative content of α 1 6 bonds and i1 4 represents the relative content of α 1 4 bonds 2 5 3 ps molecular conformation the ps powder was dissolved in pure water to a concentration of 100 μg ml and diluted to 2 5 μg ml before imaging by afm two microliters of ps solution were directly dropped onto a clean mica sheet and those samples were air dried 12 h in a dust free enclosure imaging was performed with an atomic force microscope dimension edge bruker rtesp 300 probe in scanasyst imaging mode with a scan range of 2 μm 2 μm the images were processed using nanoscope analysis software 3 results 3 1 stability of the granular sludge 3 1 1 surface characteristics of the granular sludge fig a1b shows the changes in the anammox granules after exposure to enzymes according to the particle size distribution in fig a3 in the control group the particle size was mainly approximately 2 0 mm after treatment with amylase the granules swelled and disintegrated to varying degrees while the granules treated with proteinase k changed little compared with the α amylase treatment group granules exposure to β amylase and isoamylase showed more obvious morphological changes and disintegrated flocs were observed most granules of β amylase and isoamylase treatment groups swelled and some even reached approximately 4 0 mm fig 2 shows the sem images of the granules in each group at different scales the low magnification images of the granules are exhibited in fig 2 a and b c d and e compared with the control group the granules hydrolysed by protease changed little and appeared as compact and firm granules with a smooth surface in contrast the appearance and structure of the granules exposed to amylase changed significantly the surface of the granules treated with α amylase became rough the granules hydrolysed by β amylase disintegrated into mud sheets and the granules treated with isoamylase showed a weak compactness and scaly surface fig 2 f and g h i and j further demonstrates the differences between the groups at a microscopic level similarly there was very little difference between the protease treated sample and the control sample the degree of aggregation of bacteria was good and no obvious pores or cracks were observed α amylase treatment decreased the surface smoothness of the granules and the bacteria were fully exposed following β amylase treatment settled cocci and bacilli could hardly be seen on the surface of the sludge and a large number of pores and cracks had formed in the isoamylase treated group the surfaces of granules seemed corroded and bacterial adhesion had decreased therefore the granules exhibited different degrees of swelling and disintegration after exposure to amylases but no significant changes were observed following protease treatment these results suggest that ps is an important factor affecting the structural stability of anammox granular sludge furthermore hydrolysis experiments using β amylase and isoamylase showed that the stability of the anammox granular sludge decreased upon hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds in the branched chains or at the branch points in the eps 3 1 2 degree of granular sludge disintegration and stability fig 3 shows the degree of granular disintegration dg and relative stability ds after 1 h hydrolysis of the granular sludge compared with the control group the granules subjected to protease treatment had an extremely low degree of disintegration while the granules exposed to amylase exhibited an obvious disintegration in the three amylase treated groups the degree of granular disintegration dg in the β amylase and isoamylase treated groups was notably higher than that in the α amylase treated group combined with the action mechanism of amylase it can be confirmed that the branched chains and branching degree of exopolysaccharides affect the stability of anammox granular sludge 3 2 branched chains and degree of branching of ps the afm images of ps appearing as a chain of yellow dots on mica plates are shown in fig 4 and the 3d diagrams display the 3d structure of the ps units as mountains the peak height could be considered a reflection of the height of the ps chain indicating the length of the branched chains and the peak width reflects the intermolecular aggregation behaviour of these molecules seviour et al 2010 tao and zhang 2006 wang et al 2019 table 2 shows the details of the width and height of the ps samples the chain height of the control group is close to that reported by lin lin et al 2015 the differences in the ps chain peak heights between the control group and the protease treated group were not significant p 0 05 table a1 indicating that the ps branched chains were hardly cleaved by protease treatment however there was a significant difference in the ps heights on mica following β amylase and isoamylase treatments indicating that the ps branched chains were hydrolysed in addition the ps chains in the control and protease treatments were aggregated into wider clumps the α amylase treatment group showed the second highest degree of ps chain aggregation appearing as a mixture of clumps and nets the ps chains in the β amylase and isoamylase treated groups were relatively distinct and their widths were relatively narrow the high aggregation behavior of ps chains is related to their type and length goodfellow and wilson 1990 combined with the results of the degree of granular stability discussed in section 3 1 2 it can be seen that when the average height of the ps chains was approximately 19 7 nm and the average width was approximately 203 nm the granules showed high stability after exposure to amylase the granular stability decreased with the reduced height and width of the ps chains the results of the degree of ps branching after hydrolysis are presented in table 2 and the degrees of branching decreased in the following order protease treatment control group α amylase treatment isoamylase treatment and β amylase treatment when the degree of branching was approximately 85 0 the granules presented high stability and the granular stability decreased as the degree of branching decreased after hydrolysis the results in fig a4 demonstrate that the stabilities of the anammox granules after hydrolysis were significantly correlated with the characteristics of the ps chains including the average chain height n 5 r 0 980 p 0 01 average chain width n 5 r 0 970 p 0 01 and degree of branching n 5 r 0 991 p 0 01 it appears that the branched chains of ps and their branching degree are the key factors affecting the stability of the granules 3 3 the rheological properties of anammox granules the stability of granules is a key factor in maintaining long term system efficiency the storage modulus g and yield point in rheology can characterize the mechanical strength and strain resistance capability of materials and a higher g and yield strength indicate a stronger structure seviour et al 2009 as shown in fig 5 the g value exceeded g after γ 98 indicating that the anammox granules exhibited an intrinsic yield point before the yield point the anammox granules had a constant storage modulus g and the values decreased in the following order control group protease treatment isoamylase treatment α amylase treatment and β amylase treatment the results showed that the mechanical strength of the granules deteriorated upon hydrolysis of the ps branched chains the results shown in fig 5 indicate that the control group and the protease treated granules have higher storage modulus g values at the yield point compared with those of the amylase treatment groups which means that the control and protease treated granules can resist a higher input deformation energy in other words the control and protease treated granules offer more cross linked polymers with dynamic mechanical properties that are stronger and more elastic this result reveals the importance of the ps branching structure in maintaining the high mechanical strength and gel forming properties of anammox granules the anammox granule storage modulus g was not below zero at a low strain constant fig 5 instead the value was relatively constant which suggested that the anammox granules have a viscoelastic regime which is in accordance with the dynamic mechanical behaviour of the gel laurer et al 1998 the complex viscosity η values in the constant region before the yield point decreased in the following order control group protease treatment β amylase treatment isoamylase treatment and α amylase treatment the differences in viscosity are probably due to the changes in the properties of the hydrogels caused by the destruction of the branched chains of the exopolysaccharides 3 4 zeta potential and hydrophobicity of the granular sludge generally bacterial cells have negative zeta potentials and lower values correspond to stronger repulsive forces which decrease bacterial aggregation morgan et al 1990 fig 6 shows that after hydrolysis of the ps the zeta potentials of the bacterial suspensions decreased the repulsion increased and the zeta potential changed little after proteolysis the zeta potentials increased in the following order isoamylase treatment β amylase treatment α amylase treatment protease treatment and the control group hydrophobicity can trigger biological granulation liu et al 2004 and is a key factor in promoting bacterial aggregation ali et al 2018 the hydrophobicity of the samples was determined from the contact angle between the sample and water treatment with α amylase β amylase and isoamylase decreased the hydrophobicity of the bacteria while proteinase treatment slightly enhanced the hydrophobicity and this phenomenon may be related to changes in the eps components and chemical structure upon hydrolysis 3 5 eps content and spectral analysis 3 5 1 protein and polysaccharide contents eps plays an important role in biological granulation and improvement of long term system efficiency forster 1991 schmidt and ahring 1994 as shown in fig 7 compared with the control group the ps contents in the α amylase and β amylase treated groups were reduced by 50 1 and 30 9 respectively both the ps and pn contents in the isoamylase treated group remained almost unchanged and the protein content was reduced by 31 4 by protease treatment interestingly the α amylase β amylase and protease treated groups were each treated with a single enzyme with strict specificity while both pn and ps contents were sharply reduced for protease treated group this phenomenaon may be due to the hydrolysis of proteoglycans which comprise glycosaminoglycan gag covalently linked to the protein backbone with a ps content of 95 or higher they are commonly present in the bacterial extracellular matrices mende et al 2016 in the α amylase and β amylase treated groups the hydrolysis of glycoproteins may result in a decrease in both ps and pn content it has been reported that the pn attach to the branch chains of backbone ps yuan et al 2011 in addition according to the action mechanism of amylase ps exposed to α amylase and β amylase were decomposed into glucose maltose and dextrin which are soluble in water resulting in a decrease in content however isoamylase only hydrolysed branching points and the mild destruction did not change the solubility of ps resulting in little loss of ps meanwhile the pn that bound to the ps were minimally affected notably the protein and ps contents decreased sharply upon protease treatment but the stability of the granules hardly changed indicating that the total amount of protein and ps in eps is not a determinant of anammox granular stability 3 5 2 ftir and xps spectra although changes in the hydrophobicity and zeta potential upon disruption of the ps branched chains and degree of branching are the main reasons for the disintegration of the granules further explorations are still needed ftir and xps spectra are essential for analysing the changes in the functional groups of eps after hydrolysis of the granules ftir spectra are shown in fig a5 and we found that the ratio of many functional groups in the eps were remarkably altered by hydrolysis the absorption peak of the c h bending vibration derived from polysaccharides appeared near 980 cm 1 su et al 2019 and compared with the control group the proportion of this peak was notably enhanced in the protease treated group the peak at 1057 cm 1 can be attributed to c o c stretching and c h in plane bending in polysaccharides lotti et al 2019a which largely exist in ps chains and the spectra indicated that the proportion of this peak was notably enhanced in the protease treated group the band near 1400 cm 1 is the bending vibration of ch2 guo et al 2016 and the ratio of this peak was notably reduced in the α amylase β amylase and protease treated groups the band near 1580 cm 1 is from the amide ii c n stretching band and the n h deformation in co nh badireddy et al 2010 wang et al 2018 yuan et al 2011 the proportion of this peak was notably reduced in α amylase β amylase and proteinase treated groups these peaks are derived from hydrophobic functional groups huang et al 2018 however the peak at 3276 cm 1 reflects the presence of oh which is hydrophilic and the proportion of this peak was enhanced in all the hydrolysed groups the peak near 858 cm 1 mainly reflects the presence of α d glucose which may function as backbones to support and maintain the stereoscopic morphology of anammox granules lin and wang 2017 nia et al 2015 and the ratio of this peak was markedly enhanced in proteinase treated group carbon are the main elements of eps huang et al 2018 the combination functional groups of c and o were scanned by high resolution xps and the contribution of each component was evaluated by deconvolution of the c1s spectrum as shown in fig a6 and table 3 the carbon peaks were deconvolved into four spectral regions lin et al 2016 ojeda et al 2008 omoike and chorover 2004 ① aliphatic c c and c h bonds ② c o n bonds in proteins and alcohols ③ amides carbonyls carboxylates esters acetals or hemiacetals combined with oxygen with double bonds carbon c o and ④ carboxylic acid carbons with three bonds o c o mainly derived from uronic acid c c h groups are the most abundant hydrophobic functional groups of eps while c o n and c o are the main hydrophilic components hou et al 2015 as shown in table 3 the c c h percentages of eps in each treatment decreased in the following order control group protease treatment α amylase treatment β amylase treatment and isoamylase treatment the percentages of carboxylic acid carbons o c o decreased in the following order β amylase treatment isoamylase treatment α amylase treatment control group and protease treatment the presence of uronic acids hydroxyl groups and carboxylic groups was detected by ftir and xps techniques and these groups are responsible for the electronegativity and hydrophilicity of eps de jesus et al 2019 lin et al 2016 the above functional groups were significantly more abundant in the eps treated with amylase than in the control group while the ratio of hydrophobic groups was reduced in amylase treated groups resulting in the observed increase in the zeta potential and hydrophilicity the changes in these functional groups further elucidate the cause of the instability of the granular sludge 4 discussion notably this study confirmed that the stability of anammox granular sludge is well correlated with the degree and configuration of ps branching the anammox granular stability was affected by changes in the granular gel characteristics the granular viscosity the eps hydrophobic groups the eps electronegative groups and the degree of aggregation of the ps spatial structure fig 8 shows a schematic of the granular disintegration mechanism after hydrolysis of the ps branched chains we found that the ps branched chains have an important effect on the stability of anammox granular sludge granular sludge can be considered as hydrogel lin and wang 2017 seviour et al 2009 hydrogel is stabilized by physical forces such as hydrogen bonds hydrophobic interactions and chain intertwining pal and banerjee 2018 yan et al 2019 firstly ps is an amphiphilic polymer lin et al 2015 and the high degree of branching in ps leads to a much more well ordered water structure by inserting the hydrophobic functional groups into hydrophilic groups grossutti and dutcher 2016 which could enhance the mechanical strength of the hydrogel secondly the disruption of the ps branched chains can certainly affect the hydrogen bonds hydrophobic interactions and chain intertwining in turn changing the property of the hydrogel resulting in a decrease in mechanical strength in addition viscosity is an important index of hydrogel properties and more branched chains and a higher molecular weight lead to the higher viscosity of the hydrogel nachtigall et al 2019 the destruction of the branched chains resulted in a decrease in the viscoelasticity of the hydrogel and affected the stability of granular sludge therefore ps with a high degree of branching can enhance the mechanical strength and viscoelasticity of granular sludge via hydrogen bonds hydrophobic bonds and chain intertwining to understand the changes in the electronegativity and hydrophobicity of granular sludge after the hydrolysis of ps branched chains both the composition and chemical structure of eps were investigated after the disruption of the ps branched chains and their degree of branching the zeta potential decreased due to the increase in the proportion of functional groups such as o c o c o and oh which are responsible for the electronegativity of eps these polar groups also cause a decrease in hydrophobicity in addition the spatial distribution of functional groups influences their role play wu et al 2017a after the hydrolysis of the branched chains the ps structures became looser fig 4 and resulted in the exposure of the hiding electronegative and hydrophilic groups thus the branched chains of ps played a key role by affecting the content and spatial distribution of electronegative and hydrophilic groups interestingly we observed that both pn and ps contents were sharply reduced in the α amylase β amylase and protease treated groups and the granular stability was reduced in α amylase and β amylase treated groups but not in the protease treated group as mentioned in 3 5 1 section in the α amylase and β amylase treated groups pn and ps contents sharply reduced which may be due to the hydrolysis of glycoproteins that have been proven to be abundant in eps boleij et al 2018 lin et al 2018 it has been reported that the pn attach to the branch chains of backbone ps yuan et al 2011 the deterioration of granular stability was mainly affected by the hydrolysis of the branched ps while the stability of the granules was not notably changed in protease treated group this result may be due to the hydrolysis of proteoglycan a special glycoprotein that is composed of glycosaminoglycan gag covalently linked to the protein backbone mende et al 2016 gags are unbranched long chain polymers hence the hydrolysis of gags may have little effect on the characteristics of the eps and the stability of the anammox granular sludge therefore the hydrolysis of proteoglycans may lead to the interesting phenomenon that both pn and ps content sharply decreased in the protease treated group but the stability of granules barely changed undoubtedly the mentioned above phenomenon is needed to further clarify in the near future due to the complexity and diversity of glycoprotein structures in previous studies the functions of ps and pn have been widely concerned in granular sludge formation and structural stability some of the findings are consistent with our study yin et al 2015 indicated that branched ps can be expected to enhance cell aggregation because the side chains and the long carbon backbone are able to provide sufficient binding sites to ensure interaction of cells with cell adav et al 2008 reported that selective enzymatic hydrolysis of pn had little effect upon the structural integrity and ps formed the backbone of granules whereas some of the findings are not consistent with ours lin and wang 2017 argued that the exposure of anammox granules to amylase and proteinase k both resulted in significant decrease of granular stability differently the anammox granules in lin s experiment exposed to proteinase k for 48 h as we know extracellular proteins consist of enzymes and structural proteins zhang et al 2019b and the collapse of granules may be due to the hydrolysis of enzymes which maintain normal metabolism of bacteria after too long exposure to protease hou et al 2015 reported that pn has an important contribution to anammox sludge flocculation by flocculation experiment in which eps was treated by different enzymes after extraction and then returned to sludge as flocculant differently in the present work the granular sludge was hydrolysed and we focused primarily on in situ characterizations for the stability of anammox granular sludge after the hydrolysis thus we originally revealed the stability mechanism of anammox sludge from the perspective of ps chain structure the presence of highly branched ps can significantly improve granular stability in reality we have learned from literatures in other fields that the configuration of ps chain varies with temperature ionic strength ph and shear rate matsuda et al 2009 nilsson and bergenståhl 2006 rochefort and middleman 2000 wang et al 2019 and reasonable regulation of these parameters could be used to cultivate granules with greater stability the configuration of the ps chains is derived from their primary structure which is easier to modify and regulate than their higher order structures thus controlling anammox granule stability is easier to realize and these research results could be used for process improvement 5 conclusion through elegant enzymatic hydrolysis experiments on anammox granular sludge it was shown that the key parameter for maintaining the stability of anammox sludge is not the total protein and ps contents in the eps instead strong evidence suggests that the presence of ps has a vital impact on the stability of the granules further studies showed that the properties of the ps chains such as the degree of branching and the width and height of the chains were related to the granular stability the specific enzymatic hydrolysis of the branched chain configuration and the branching points of the ps led to decreases in the zeta potential and hydrophobicity and triggered a change in the rheological properties of granules and the chemical composition of eps revealing the intrinsic reason for the deterioration of granular stability after hydrolysis of ps branched chains the anammox granular stability was affected by a series of changes such as the granular gel characteristics granular viscosity eps hydrophobic groups eps electronegative groups and the degree of aggregation of the ps spatial structure in addition to elucidating the importance of the branched chains of exopolysaccharides and their degree of branching for the stability of anammox granular sludge further applications of the anammox process can be developed declaration of competing interest the authors

17905,the effect of extracellular polysaccharides on the structural stability of granular sludge is widely recognized and determining their mechanism of action on the stability of granules remains challenging herein enzymatic experiments were used to systematically study the stability changes and internal mechanisms of anammox granular sludge following hydrolysis of extracellular proteins and polysaccharides ps the results revealed that the selective hydrolysis of the proteins hardly affected the stability of the granules while the hydrolysis of the ps branched chains caused the granules to disintegrate the hydrolysis of the ps chains in the eps matrix decreased the degree of branching width and height via nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy afm and these parameters are closely related to granular stability moreover scanning electron microscopy sem showed a large number of pores and cracks on the granules bacterial adhesion decreased and the eps adhered to the surface of the granules dissolved the changes in the gel characteristics of the granules were studied by rheology and the mechanical strength and viscosity of the granular sludge decreased for the surface characteristics of granules the zeta potential and hydrophobicity both decreased revealing that changes in the branched chain configuration of the ps and the degree of branching caused granular disintegration spectral analysis showed that the hydrolysis of the branch points and the branched glycosides of ps led to a higher proportion of hydrophilic and electronegative groups in the eps matrix which hindered bacterial aggregation and reduced anammox granule stability this investigation clarifies the impact of the branched chain configuration of the ps and their degree of branching on anammox granule stability which will promote the further application of anammox granules graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox granular sludge stability exopolysaccharide branched chain 1 introduction anammox granular sludge received more attention from scholars for its excellent biomass retention and settleability fux et al 2002 lin and wang 2017 under the condition of high cell density information exchange and cooperation among anammox bacteria would also be enhanced resulting in an increase in bacterial metabolism and activity kartal et al 2011 most importantly these advantages of anammox granular sludge are based on the structural stability substrate shock zhang et al 2016 low ambient temperature and high calcium concentration xing et al 2015 have a negative influence on granular stability and thus could disintegrate resulting in significant biomass decrease and ultimately system deterioration or even failure therefore elucidating the mechanism of anammox granular stability to promote the anammox process is of great significance it is well known that extracellular polymers eps play an important role in granular stability zhang et al 2019a and studies on the concentration of eps affecting the stability of anammox granules have been widely reported feng et al 2019 lotti et al 2019b lu et al 2012 although many studies on the proteins pn in eps for biological wastewater treatment have been conducted boleij et al 2019 fang et al 2018 lotti et al 2019a silva et al 2012 relatively few studies on polysaccharides ps have been reported in recent years some scholars pointed out that ps was conducive during the formation of anammox granules nia et al 2015 and higher ps contents can promote cell to cell adhesion and strengthen microbial structures by forming polymer matrices punal et al 2003 tay et al 2001 in addition α d glucopyranose and α linked polysaccharides may form the skeleton of anammox granules as their presence greatly enhances the strength of these granules caudan et al 2014 lin and wang 2017 β linked ps in the skeleton can help maintain the structure of the eps matrix and the stability of the granules adav et al 2008 wang et al 2005 in conclusion the previous studies on the role of ps in granular stability mainly focused on ps content and the category of glycosidic bonds it was reported that hydrogels made of cross linking of ps chains are important factors in the formation of granules seviour et al 2012 ps can form stable interchain cross links and bridges through hydrogen bonding and ca2 to form so called egg box models that hold cells together christensen et al 1990 sajjad and kim 2015 seviour et al 2012 artificial hydrogels formation by cross linking alginate with ca2 has been used for anammox immobilization zhang and okabe 2017 and polymeric alginate chains can provide the groups that bind to the calcium to enhance the gel strength maleki et al 2020 according to these reports the cross link structure of ps and its ability to form a gel network may be the key feature explaining the mechanical stability of the granules however in terms of the function of ps the key to controlling the mechanical stability of the granules is unknown ps is a polymer with a long backbone and many branches and these side chains provide numerous flocculent binding sites yuan et al 2011 it is a pity that there are no or few studies on the effect of ps chain structure on the stability of anammox granular sludge therefore clarifying the mechanism of anammox granular stability from the perspective of ps chain structure will be a challenging and interesting exploration process amylase has been well studied for wastewater treatment and in other fields adav et al 2008 andersson et al 2002 bonilla et al 2015 lin and wang 2017 lynn and stark 1992 α amylase randomly shears hydrolyses α 1 4 glycosidic bonds β amylase hydrolyses α 1 4 glycosidic bonds from nonreducing termini and isoamylase hydrolyses α 1 6 glycoside bonds at branch points functionally speaking α amylase randomly breaks ps chains β amylase only destroys side chain structures and isoamylase hydrolyses chains at their branch points a schematic of ps hydrolysis by amylases is shown in fig 1 therefore selective enzymatic hydrolysis experiments can be used to effectively investigate the effects of different ps chain structure on the granular stability afm and nmr can be used to determine the ps branched chains configuration and the degree of branching conformational changes in ps polymers can be visualized with afm by comparing native granules to those exposed to different enzymes seviour et al 2010 wang et al 2019 1h nmr spectroscopy can be used to determine the positions of protons on the carbon chains providing important information on α 1 4 glycosidic and α 1 6 glycosidic bonds and this technique allows the quantitative analysis of the degree of branching of complex ps while afm analysis does not ciric and loos 2013 in this study glycosidic bonds were enzymatically hydrolysed to investigate the importance of ps branched chains and their degree of branching on the maintenance of anammox granular sludge stability the results can provide theoretical evidence for the mechanism of anammox granular stabilization and the promotion and further application of the anammox process 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of sludge the anammox granules were sampled from a lab scale anammox expanded granular sludge bed reactor the influent and reflux water were pumped to the bottom of the reactor by a peristaltic pump to maintain a reflux ratio of 25 1 and an upward flow velocity of 4 42 m h the nh4 n and no2 n concentrations in the influent in the reactor were approximately 180 mg l and 190 mg l respectively and the total nitrogen load was 2 39 kg m3 d nitrogen in the form of ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen was provided by nh4cl and nano2 respectively khco3 was added in a hco3 to nh4 molar ratio of 2 1 the reactor temperature was maintained at 32 1 c and the influent ph was 7 8 8 0 other main components of the influent included 0 025 g l 1 kh2po4 0 2 g l 1 cacl2 2h2o 0 2 g l 1 mgso4 7h2o and 1 25 ml l 1 trace elements i and ii van de graaf et al 1996 during the sampling of the granular sludge the average removal efficiencies for ammonia nitrogen nitrite nitrogen and total nitrogen in the reactor were 94 3 1 2 97 5 1 7 and 87 2 2 1 respectively during the stable operation of the reactor the molar ratio among ammonia nitrogen removed nitrite nitrogen removed and nitrate nitrogen produced nh4 n no2 n no3 n ration was 1 1 116 0 115 this value is close to the stoichiometric value of 1 1 146 0 161 reported by lotti et al 2014 which indicates that anammox was the dominant nitrogen removal pathway in the reactor in this study the sample granules were selected by an 8 12 mesh sieve to ensure that the granule size was approximately 2 0 mm and then the abnormal and broken granules were removed with tweezers photographs of the anammox granular samples are shown in fig a1a the microbial community composition of the genus of anammox granules is shown in fig a2 and the genus abundance of anammox bacteria was 48 95 the method of high throughput sequencing is described in the supplementary data sequence data were deposited in the ncbi database accession numbers srx7899962 2 2 experimental scheme group 1 was the control and granules in groups 2 5 were hydrolysed by α amylase β amylase isoamylase and proteinase k to investigate the stability changes and mechanism of anammox granule sludge stability the experimental details of the enzymatic hydrolysis reactions are shown in table 1 adav et al 2008 seviour et al 2009 three replicates were conducted for each enzyme experiment and control each enzyme solution was prepared in a 100 ml conical flask working volume of 25 ml each pure water was used for the control then 70 0 g wet granules were randomly divided into five equal groups each group 14 0 g and each group was added to the conical flasks containing water or enzyme solution all conical flasks were incubated at 37 c in a water bath with shaking for 1 h 50 rpm the granules were washed with 0 1 m pbs immediately after hydrolysis and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 20 min the washing and centrifugation were repeated 5 times for the removal of any remaining enzyme 2 3 characteristion and morphology of the granular sludge 2 3 1 degree of granular sludge disintegration and stability fine particles discharged from disintegrating granules contribute to the increase in sample turbidity wu et al 2017b so the turbidity values can be used to characterize the degree of granular disintegration dg the ratio of the turbidity value of each experimental group to the maximum disintegration group was used to determine the relative degree of granular stability ds smaller ds values correspond to higher stability the turbidity was measured by a turbidimeter hach 2100q usa wet granular sludge 10 0 g was randomly and equally divided into five groups each group 2 0 g and then hydrolysed washed and centrifuged as described in section 2 2 the samples were placed into the glass bottle of the turbidimeter with 10 ml pure water to determine turbidity each sample was measured three times at room temperature after turbidity tests the samples were used for rheological measurements 2 3 2 morphology of the granular sludge the visible morphology of the hydrolysed anammox granules was photographed with a digital camera and image pro plus version 6 0 software was used to analyse the particle size distribution of the granules in fig a1b the microscopic morphology of the granules was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy jsm 7800f japan and the granules were pretreated according to a previously reported procedure adav et al 2008 2 3 3 the rheological properties of anammox granules rheological measurements were performed using a controlled stress and strain rheometer anton paar mcr 302 austria with a cone plate geometry 25 mm diameter with a 1 5 mm gap between the upper and lower plates prior to rheological testing 2 0 g granules after the turbidity test were filtered with filter paper for 10 min then the lower plate surface was covered with granules with no gaps oscillatory amplitude scans were performed on the granules at a fixed frequency ω of 5 rad s ranging from 0 01 to 100 strain γ the storage modulus g the loss modulus g and the complex viscosity η were calculated according to a reference lin and wang 2017 2 3 4 zeta potential and hydrophobicity of granules a 0 5 g portion of granules was ground and dispersed into 10 ml of 0 1 m nacl solution and the od at 546 nm was adjusted to 0 1 by adding 0 1 m nacl solution with an uv vis spectrophotometer persee tu 1900 china for zeta potential and contact angle tests the zeta potential of the sludge suspension at 25 c was measured using a zeta potential analyser zetasizer nano zs90 british the reported data were obtained by calculating the average of three measurements the sludge layer was filtered by 150 ml sludge suspension through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane for contact angle tests of each sample the contact angle between each sample and water was measured by the sessile drop technique and the measurements were carried out using a contact angle analyzer sindin sdc 1000 china the operation was performed according to the method described by liu et al 2010 and the reported data were obtained by calculating the average value of 10 parallel measurements hydrophobicity was determined from the contact angles between the samples and water 2 4 eps extraction and testing 2 4 1 eps extraction and analysis the eps was extracted using cation exchange resin frolund et al 1996 a 10 0 g portion of granules was ground into a suspension and transferred to a conical flask approximately 70 g g vss cation exchange resin was added to the suspension and the mixture was shaken at 150 rpm for 2 h at 4 c then the suspension was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 20 min at 4 c then the suspension was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 20 min at 4 c the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane to obtain the eps solution ps was determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method based on glucose masuko et al 2005 and protein was determined by the bca method ras et al 2008 2 4 2 ftir and xps spectra the eps solution was freeze dried at 45 c to afford a powder 10 mg powder were mixed with kbr at a ratio of 1 200 for each sample and the samples were analysed with an ftir spectrometer tensor 27 germany to determine the functional groups present in the eps all spectra were normalized after acquisition to a maximum emission of 1 0 for comparative purposes eps powder 20 mg was analysed with an x ray photoelectron spectrometer thermo fisher scientific escalab250xi to determine the c o bond containing functional groups thermo avantage software version 5 976 was used to assess the contributions of these components by deconvolution deconvolution of those functional groups of the xps spectra was performed according to a reference hou et al 2015 2 5 ps purification and testing 2 5 1 ps separation and purification the ps was purified as described in the reference zhang et al 2015 2 5 2 degree of branching of the ps chain the degree of branching of the ps chain was determined by 1h nmr spectroscopy because the protons of the α 1 4 and α 1 6 glycosidic bonds give distinct signals the degree of branching can be determined from the ratio between the integrals of these signals ciric and loos 2013 the reaction parameters were as follows 10 0 mg of the ps sample was precisely weighed in an ep tube the hydroxyl protons of the ps were exchanged in d2o with heating at 80 c overnight the samples were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was transferred into an nmr tube for automated detection the instruments and parameters used in this detection were as follows bruker biospin gmbh temperature 60 c number of scans 32 resonance rf 500 23 mhz the data were analysed using mestrenova software and the degree of branching was calculated using the formula db i1 6 i1 6 i1 4 100 where db is the degree of branching i1 6 is the relative content of α 1 6 bonds and i1 4 represents the relative content of α 1 4 bonds 2 5 3 ps molecular conformation the ps powder was dissolved in pure water to a concentration of 100 μg ml and diluted to 2 5 μg ml before imaging by afm two microliters of ps solution were directly dropped onto a clean mica sheet and those samples were air dried 12 h in a dust free enclosure imaging was performed with an atomic force microscope dimension edge bruker rtesp 300 probe in scanasyst imaging mode with a scan range of 2 μm 2 μm the images were processed using nanoscope analysis software 3 results 3 1 stability of the granular sludge 3 1 1 surface characteristics of the granular sludge fig a1b shows the changes in the anammox granules after exposure to enzymes according to the particle size distribution in fig a3 in the control group the particle size was mainly approximately 2 0 mm after treatment with amylase the granules swelled and disintegrated to varying degrees while the granules treated with proteinase k changed little compared with the α amylase treatment group granules exposure to β amylase and isoamylase showed more obvious morphological changes and disintegrated flocs were observed most granules of β amylase and isoamylase treatment groups swelled and some even reached approximately 4 0 mm fig 2 shows the sem images of the granules in each group at different scales the low magnification images of the granules are exhibited in fig 2 a and b c d and e compared with the control group the granules hydrolysed by protease changed little and appeared as compact and firm granules with a smooth surface in contrast the appearance and structure of the granules exposed to amylase changed significantly the surface of the granules treated with α amylase became rough the granules hydrolysed by β amylase disintegrated into mud sheets and the granules treated with isoamylase showed a weak compactness and scaly surface fig 2 f and g h i and j further demonstrates the differences between the groups at a microscopic level similarly there was very little difference between the protease treated sample and the control sample the degree of aggregation of bacteria was good and no obvious pores or cracks were observed α amylase treatment decreased the surface smoothness of the granules and the bacteria were fully exposed following β amylase treatment settled cocci and bacilli could hardly be seen on the surface of the sludge and a large number of pores and cracks had formed in the isoamylase treated group the surfaces of granules seemed corroded and bacterial adhesion had decreased therefore the granules exhibited different degrees of swelling and disintegration after exposure to amylases but no significant changes were observed following protease treatment these results suggest that ps is an important factor affecting the structural stability of anammox granular sludge furthermore hydrolysis experiments using β amylase and isoamylase showed that the stability of the anammox granular sludge decreased upon hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds in the branched chains or at the branch points in the eps 3 1 2 degree of granular sludge disintegration and stability fig 3 shows the degree of granular disintegration dg and relative stability ds after 1 h hydrolysis of the granular sludge compared with the control group the granules subjected to protease treatment had an extremely low degree of disintegration while the granules exposed to amylase exhibited an obvious disintegration in the three amylase treated groups the degree of granular disintegration dg in the β amylase and isoamylase treated groups was notably higher than that in the α amylase treated group combined with the action mechanism of amylase it can be confirmed that the branched chains and branching degree of exopolysaccharides affect the stability of anammox granular sludge 3 2 branched chains and degree of branching of ps the afm images of ps appearing as a chain of yellow dots on mica plates are shown in fig 4 and the 3d diagrams display the 3d structure of the ps units as mountains the peak height could be considered a reflection of the height of the ps chain indicating the length of the branched chains and the peak width reflects the intermolecular aggregation behaviour of these molecules seviour et al 2010 tao and zhang 2006 wang et al 2019 table 2 shows the details of the width and height of the ps samples the chain height of the control group is close to that reported by lin lin et al 2015 the differences in the ps chain peak heights between the control group and the protease treated group were not significant p 0 05 table a1 indicating that the ps branched chains were hardly cleaved by protease treatment however there was a significant difference in the ps heights on mica following β amylase and isoamylase treatments indicating that the ps branched chains were hydrolysed in addition the ps chains in the control and protease treatments were aggregated into wider clumps the α amylase treatment group showed the second highest degree of ps chain aggregation appearing as a mixture of clumps and nets the ps chains in the β amylase and isoamylase treated groups were relatively distinct and their widths were relatively narrow the high aggregation behavior of ps chains is related to their type and length goodfellow and wilson 1990 combined with the results of the degree of granular stability discussed in section 3 1 2 it can be seen that when the average height of the ps chains was approximately 19 7 nm and the average width was approximately 203 nm the granules showed high stability after exposure to amylase the granular stability decreased with the reduced height and width of the ps chains the results of the degree of ps branching after hydrolysis are presented in table 2 and the degrees of branching decreased in the following order protease treatment control group α amylase treatment isoamylase treatment and β amylase treatment when the degree of branching was approximately 85 0 the granules presented high stability and the granular stability decreased as the degree of branching decreased after hydrolysis the results in fig a4 demonstrate that the stabilities of the anammox granules after hydrolysis were significantly correlated with the characteristics of the ps chains including the average chain height n 5 r 0 980 p 0 01 average chain width n 5 r 0 970 p 0 01 and degree of branching n 5 r 0 991 p 0 01 it appears that the branched chains of ps and their branching degree are the key factors affecting the stability of the granules 3 3 the rheological properties of anammox granules the stability of granules is a key factor in maintaining long term system efficiency the storage modulus g and yield point in rheology can characterize the mechanical strength and strain resistance capability of materials and a higher g and yield strength indicate a stronger structure seviour et al 2009 as shown in fig 5 the g value exceeded g after γ 98 indicating that the anammox granules exhibited an intrinsic yield point before the yield point the anammox granules had a constant storage modulus g and the values decreased in the following order control group protease treatment isoamylase treatment α amylase treatment and β amylase treatment the results showed that the mechanical strength of the granules deteriorated upon hydrolysis of the ps branched chains the results shown in fig 5 indicate that the control group and the protease treated granules have higher storage modulus g values at the yield point compared with those of the amylase treatment groups which means that the control and protease treated granules can resist a higher input deformation energy in other words the control and protease treated granules offer more cross linked polymers with dynamic mechanical properties that are stronger and more elastic this result reveals the importance of the ps branching structure in maintaining the high mechanical strength and gel forming properties of anammox granules the anammox granule storage modulus g was not below zero at a low strain constant fig 5 instead the value was relatively constant which suggested that the anammox granules have a viscoelastic regime which is in accordance with the dynamic mechanical behaviour of the gel laurer et al 1998 the complex viscosity η values in the constant region before the yield point decreased in the following order control group protease treatment β amylase treatment isoamylase treatment and α amylase treatment the differences in viscosity are probably due to the changes in the properties of the hydrogels caused by the destruction of the branched chains of the exopolysaccharides 3 4 zeta potential and hydrophobicity of the granular sludge generally bacterial cells have negative zeta potentials and lower values correspond to stronger repulsive forces which decrease bacterial aggregation morgan et al 1990 fig 6 shows that after hydrolysis of the ps the zeta potentials of the bacterial suspensions decreased the repulsion increased and the zeta potential changed little after proteolysis the zeta potentials increased in the following order isoamylase treatment β amylase treatment α amylase treatment protease treatment and the control group hydrophobicity can trigger biological granulation liu et al 2004 and is a key factor in promoting bacterial aggregation ali et al 2018 the hydrophobicity of the samples was determined from the contact angle between the sample and water treatment with α amylase β amylase and isoamylase decreased the hydrophobicity of the bacteria while proteinase treatment slightly enhanced the hydrophobicity and this phenomenon may be related to changes in the eps components and chemical structure upon hydrolysis 3 5 eps content and spectral analysis 3 5 1 protein and polysaccharide contents eps plays an important role in biological granulation and improvement of long term system efficiency forster 1991 schmidt and ahring 1994 as shown in fig 7 compared with the control group the ps contents in the α amylase and β amylase treated groups were reduced by 50 1 and 30 9 respectively both the ps and pn contents in the isoamylase treated group remained almost unchanged and the protein content was reduced by 31 4 by protease treatment interestingly the α amylase β amylase and protease treated groups were each treated with a single enzyme with strict specificity while both pn and ps contents were sharply reduced for protease treated group this phenomenaon may be due to the hydrolysis of proteoglycans which comprise glycosaminoglycan gag covalently linked to the protein backbone with a ps content of 95 or higher they are commonly present in the bacterial extracellular matrices mende et al 2016 in the α amylase and β amylase treated groups the hydrolysis of glycoproteins may result in a decrease in both ps and pn content it has been reported that the pn attach to the branch chains of backbone ps yuan et al 2011 in addition according to the action mechanism of amylase ps exposed to α amylase and β amylase were decomposed into glucose maltose and dextrin which are soluble in water resulting in a decrease in content however isoamylase only hydrolysed branching points and the mild destruction did not change the solubility of ps resulting in little loss of ps meanwhile the pn that bound to the ps were minimally affected notably the protein and ps contents decreased sharply upon protease treatment but the stability of the granules hardly changed indicating that the total amount of protein and ps in eps is not a determinant of anammox granular stability 3 5 2 ftir and xps spectra although changes in the hydrophobicity and zeta potential upon disruption of the ps branched chains and degree of branching are the main reasons for the disintegration of the granules further explorations are still needed ftir and xps spectra are essential for analysing the changes in the functional groups of eps after hydrolysis of the granules ftir spectra are shown in fig a5 and we found that the ratio of many functional groups in the eps were remarkably altered by hydrolysis the absorption peak of the c h bending vibration derived from polysaccharides appeared near 980 cm 1 su et al 2019 and compared with the control group the proportion of this peak was notably enhanced in the protease treated group the peak at 1057 cm 1 can be attributed to c o c stretching and c h in plane bending in polysaccharides lotti et al 2019a which largely exist in ps chains and the spectra indicated that the proportion of this peak was notably enhanced in the protease treated group the band near 1400 cm 1 is the bending vibration of ch2 guo et al 2016 and the ratio of this peak was notably reduced in the α amylase β amylase and protease treated groups the band near 1580 cm 1 is from the amide ii c n stretching band and the n h deformation in co nh badireddy et al 2010 wang et al 2018 yuan et al 2011 the proportion of this peak was notably reduced in α amylase β amylase and proteinase treated groups these peaks are derived from hydrophobic functional groups huang et al 2018 however the peak at 3276 cm 1 reflects the presence of oh which is hydrophilic and the proportion of this peak was enhanced in all the hydrolysed groups the peak near 858 cm 1 mainly reflects the presence of α d glucose which may function as backbones to support and maintain the stereoscopic morphology of anammox granules lin and wang 2017 nia et al 2015 and the ratio of this peak was markedly enhanced in proteinase treated group carbon are the main elements of eps huang et al 2018 the combination functional groups of c and o were scanned by high resolution xps and the contribution of each component was evaluated by deconvolution of the c1s spectrum as shown in fig a6 and table 3 the carbon peaks were deconvolved into four spectral regions lin et al 2016 ojeda et al 2008 omoike and chorover 2004 ① aliphatic c c and c h bonds ② c o n bonds in proteins and alcohols ③ amides carbonyls carboxylates esters acetals or hemiacetals combined with oxygen with double bonds carbon c o and ④ carboxylic acid carbons with three bonds o c o mainly derived from uronic acid c c h groups are the most abundant hydrophobic functional groups of eps while c o n and c o are the main hydrophilic components hou et al 2015 as shown in table 3 the c c h percentages of eps in each treatment decreased in the following order control group protease treatment α amylase treatment β amylase treatment and isoamylase treatment the percentages of carboxylic acid carbons o c o decreased in the following order β amylase treatment isoamylase treatment α amylase treatment control group and protease treatment the presence of uronic acids hydroxyl groups and carboxylic groups was detected by ftir and xps techniques and these groups are responsible for the electronegativity and hydrophilicity of eps de jesus et al 2019 lin et al 2016 the above functional groups were significantly more abundant in the eps treated with amylase than in the control group while the ratio of hydrophobic groups was reduced in amylase treated groups resulting in the observed increase in the zeta potential and hydrophilicity the changes in these functional groups further elucidate the cause of the instability of the granular sludge 4 discussion notably this study confirmed that the stability of anammox granular sludge is well correlated with the degree and configuration of ps branching the anammox granular stability was affected by changes in the granular gel characteristics the granular viscosity the eps hydrophobic groups the eps electronegative groups and the degree of aggregation of the ps spatial structure fig 8 shows a schematic of the granular disintegration mechanism after hydrolysis of the ps branched chains we found that the ps branched chains have an important effect on the stability of anammox granular sludge granular sludge can be considered as hydrogel lin and wang 2017 seviour et al 2009 hydrogel is stabilized by physical forces such as hydrogen bonds hydrophobic interactions and chain intertwining pal and banerjee 2018 yan et al 2019 firstly ps is an amphiphilic polymer lin et al 2015 and the high degree of branching in ps leads to a much more well ordered water structure by inserting the hydrophobic functional groups into hydrophilic groups grossutti and dutcher 2016 which could enhance the mechanical strength of the hydrogel secondly the disruption of the ps branched chains can certainly affect the hydrogen bonds hydrophobic interactions and chain intertwining in turn changing the property of the hydrogel resulting in a decrease in mechanical strength in addition viscosity is an important index of hydrogel properties and more branched chains and a higher molecular weight lead to the higher viscosity of the hydrogel nachtigall et al 2019 the destruction of the branched chains resulted in a decrease in the viscoelasticity of the hydrogel and affected the stability of granular sludge therefore ps with a high degree of branching can enhance the mechanical strength and viscoelasticity of granular sludge via hydrogen bonds hydrophobic bonds and chain intertwining to understand the changes in the electronegativity and hydrophobicity of granular sludge after the hydrolysis of ps branched chains both the composition and chemical structure of eps were investigated after the disruption of the ps branched chains and their degree of branching the zeta potential decreased due to the increase in the proportion of functional groups such as o c o c o and oh which are responsible for the electronegativity of eps these polar groups also cause a decrease in hydrophobicity in addition the spatial distribution of functional groups influences their role play wu et al 2017a after the hydrolysis of the branched chains the ps structures became looser fig 4 and resulted in the exposure of the hiding electronegative and hydrophilic groups thus the branched chains of ps played a key role by affecting the content and spatial distribution of electronegative and hydrophilic groups interestingly we observed that both pn and ps contents were sharply reduced in the α amylase β amylase and protease treated groups and the granular stability was reduced in α amylase and β amylase treated groups but not in the protease treated group as mentioned in 3 5 1 section in the α amylase and β amylase treated groups pn and ps contents sharply reduced which may be due to the hydrolysis of glycoproteins that have been proven to be abundant in eps boleij et al 2018 lin et al 2018 it has been reported that the pn attach to the branch chains of backbone ps yuan et al 2011 the deterioration of granular stability was mainly affected by the hydrolysis of the branched ps while the stability of the granules was not notably changed in protease treated group this result may be due to the hydrolysis of proteoglycan a special glycoprotein that is composed of glycosaminoglycan gag covalently linked to the protein backbone mende et al 2016 gags are unbranched long chain polymers hence the hydrolysis of gags may have little effect on the characteristics of the eps and the stability of the anammox granular sludge therefore the hydrolysis of proteoglycans may lead to the interesting phenomenon that both pn and ps content sharply decreased in the protease treated group but the stability of granules barely changed undoubtedly the mentioned above phenomenon is needed to further clarify in the near future due to the complexity and diversity of glycoprotein structures in previous studies the functions of ps and pn have been widely concerned in granular sludge formation and structural stability some of the findings are consistent with our study yin et al 2015 indicated that branched ps can be expected to enhance cell aggregation because the side chains and the long carbon backbone are able to provide sufficient binding sites to ensure interaction of cells with cell adav et al 2008 reported that selective enzymatic hydrolysis of pn had little effect upon the structural integrity and ps formed the backbone of granules whereas some of the findings are not consistent with ours lin and wang 2017 argued that the exposure of anammox granules to amylase and proteinase k both resulted in significant decrease of granular stability differently the anammox granules in lin s experiment exposed to proteinase k for 48 h as we know extracellular proteins consist of enzymes and structural proteins zhang et al 2019b and the collapse of granules may be due to the hydrolysis of enzymes which maintain normal metabolism of bacteria after too long exposure to protease hou et al 2015 reported that pn has an important contribution to anammox sludge flocculation by flocculation experiment in which eps was treated by different enzymes after extraction and then returned to sludge as flocculant differently in the present work the granular sludge was hydrolysed and we focused primarily on in situ characterizations for the stability of anammox granular sludge after the hydrolysis thus we originally revealed the stability mechanism of anammox sludge from the perspective of ps chain structure the presence of highly branched ps can significantly improve granular stability in reality we have learned from literatures in other fields that the configuration of ps chain varies with temperature ionic strength ph and shear rate matsuda et al 2009 nilsson and bergenståhl 2006 rochefort and middleman 2000 wang et al 2019 and reasonable regulation of these parameters could be used to cultivate granules with greater stability the configuration of the ps chains is derived from their primary structure which is easier to modify and regulate than their higher order structures thus controlling anammox granule stability is easier to realize and these research results could be used for process improvement 5 conclusion through elegant enzymatic hydrolysis experiments on anammox granular sludge it was shown that the key parameter for maintaining the stability of anammox sludge is not the total protein and ps contents in the eps instead strong evidence suggests that the presence of ps has a vital impact on the stability of the granules further studies showed that the properties of the ps chains such as the degree of branching and the width and height of the chains were related to the granular stability the specific enzymatic hydrolysis of the branched chain configuration and the branching points of the ps led to decreases in the zeta potential and hydrophobicity and triggered a change in the rheological properties of granules and the chemical composition of eps revealing the intrinsic reason for the deterioration of granular stability after hydrolysis of ps branched chains the anammox granular stability was affected by a series of changes such as the granular gel characteristics granular viscosity eps hydrophobic groups eps electronegative groups and the degree of aggregation of the ps spatial structure in addition to elucidating the importance of the branched chains of exopolysaccharides and their degree of branching for the stability of anammox granular sludge further applications of the anammox process can be developed declaration of competing interest the authors

17906,in this study we investigate opportunities for reducing arsenic as to low levels below 1 μg l in produced drinking water from artificially infiltrated groundwater we observe that rapid sand filtration is the most important treatment step for the oxidation and removal of as at water treatment plants which use artificially recharged groundwater as source removal of as is mainly due to as co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides which shows higher efficiency in rapid sand filter beds compared to aeration and supernatant storage this is due to an accelerated oxidation of as iii to as v in the filter bed which may be caused by the manganese oxides and or as iii oxidizing bacteria as both are found in the coating of rapid sand filter media grains by chemical analysis and taxonomic profiling of the bacterial communities arsenic removal does not take place in treatment steps such as granular activated carbon filtration ultrafiltration or slow sand filtration due to a lack of hydrolyzing iron in their influent and a lack of adsorption affinity between as and the filtration surfaces further we found that as reduction to below 1 μg l can be effectively achieved at water treatment plants either by treating the influent of rapid sand filters by dosing potassium permanganate in combination with ferric chloride or by treating the effluent of rapid sand filters with ferric chloride dosing only finally we observe that reducing the ph is an effective measure for increasing as co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides but only when the oxidized arsenic as v is the predominant species in water keywords arsenic drinking water co precipitation fe iii oxyhydr oxides rapid sand filtration 1 introduction artificial recharge of groundwater with surface water is a widely used approach for drinking water production infiltration of the surface water into underground aquifers often leads to an improved chemical and or microbiological quality de moel et al 2006 after retention in the underground aquifers the infiltrated water is recovered and further purified at water treatment plants wtps to meet drinking water quality criteria before supply to consumer houses arsenic as concentrations in surface water are generally low bhattacharya et al 2002 2007 nriagu et al 2007 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 however high concentrations of as can be introduced into the recharged water from aquifer matrix fakhreddine et al 2015 neil et al 2012 the extent of as release into water is controlled by numerous geochemical mechanisms for example injection of oxygenated water into anoxic aquifers has been reported to mobilize as due to redox related dissolution of as bearing pyrite minerals darling 2016 dillon et al 2019 jones and pichler 2007 stuyfzand 1998 arsenic release due to exchange with competitive ligands e g phosphate available in infiltration water has been reported biswas et al 2014 guo et al 2008 vanderzalm et al 2011 additionally ph changes in the aquifer can also result in as desorption during artificial recharge aullón alcaine et al 2020 mcnab et al 2009 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 2016 in the netherlands trace level release of as into the recharged water in coastal dunes has been observed which results in elevated as levels in the recovered water ahmad et al 2015 stuyfzand et al 2008 although the as levels in the recovered water are well below the who guideline of 10 μg l recent studies indicate that human health might be affected by as concentrations below the who guideline of 10 μg l ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 kozisek 2017 saint jacques et al 2018 schmidt 2014 therefore as a precautionary measure dutch drinking water sector aims to supply drinking water with 1 μg l as ahmad et al 2020 van der wens et al 2016 the removal of as from natural anaerobic groundwater in addition to fe ii mn ii and nh4 removal has been extensively investigated in previous studies ahmad et al 2018 gude et al 2016 jessen et al 2005 lytle et al 2005 2007 the treatment of natural groundwater is generally simple consisting of aeration followed by rapid sand filtration whereby as is mainly removed by co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides which are formed due to oxidation of native fe ii and subsequent hydrolysis gude et al 2016 mcneill and edwards 1995 the treatment of artificially recharged water on the other hand often requires more treatment steps than that of natural groundwater for example granular activated carbon gac filtration is often used to remove color improve the taste of the water and additional disinfection steps may be required to achieve microbiological stability of water e g by ultrafiltration uf or ultraviolet uv treatment a complete understanding of the fate of as at low levels during the treatment of artificially recharged dune water is not yet fully obtained nevertheless this knowledge is required to identify the water quality and operational parameters that can improve as removal at dune water treatment plants in order to achieve very low as concentration 1 μg l in drinking water in this study we develop a detailed understanding of as removal during dune water treatment and investigate opportunities to reduce as levels in the recharged water to even lower levels below 1 μg l in produced drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 water treatment plants two water treatment plants wtps in the netherlands ouddorp wtp 1 and katwijk wtp 2 which rely on artificially recharged dune water for drinking water production were chosen for this study for both wtps the treatment schemes are shown in fig 1 the influent and effluent quality is provided in table 1 design and operational details are given in table 2 2 2 sampling campaigns 2 2 1 water samples to understand the removal of as sampling campaigns were carried out at both wtps which included collection of water samples before and after each treatment step and analysis of the samples for a range of water quality parameters table 3 and fig 1 approximately 24 h before sampling rotation of the dune water abstraction wells was stopped and the filters were backwashed to ensure a stable water quality during the sampling campaign for sampling each sampling point was flushed for at least 5 min and subsequently 2 l of water was collected in an acid soaked 0 1 m oxalic acid soaking for 20 min and ultrapure water washed glass beaker from that primary 2 l sample volume 200 ml of water was directly preserved for analysis and another 200 ml was filtered through 0 45 μm filters before preservation see section 2 6 for preservation and analysis details the residual sample volume 1 6 l was used for the measurements of ph temperature and dissolved oxygen using a potable multi meter hach hq30d53101301 for the sampling of dune water care was taken to avoid aeration of the samples during collection the pore water over the height of the rapid sand filters rsfs was sampled using the available sampling points at least 10 cm apart in the full scale filters at an approximate flow rate of 50 ml min 2 2 2 sampling of rapid sand filter material to determine the chemical composition of the coating on the rsf media microbial community analysis and to perform batch experiments aimed to gain insights into as adsorption filter material from the full scale rsfs of both wtps were analyzed for these purposes approximately 5 kg of the filter material from the upper 10 cm of each filter bed was collected with a stainless steel spade directly after backwash and stored in a closed bucket 2 3 batch experiments a number of batch experiments with influent supernatant and effluent water of the rsfs see fig 1 for sample points were performed to elucidate the effect of different water quality and operational parameters on as removal approximately 10 min before each batch experiment 20 l of water was collected from the relevant sample point in the full scale wtp using a jerry can fig 1 further details about the experiments are provided in the following sections 2 3 1 supernatant water experiments arsenic removal as a function of residence time in rsf supernatant water storage above rsf was studied with supernatant water samples from both wtps using a standard jar test apparatus which has been described previously ahmad et al 2018 the supernatant water sample was poured in 4 jars 2 l each jar of the jar test apparatus this was considered t 0 i e start of the experiment unfiltered and 0 45 μm filtered samples of the initial solution were collected and preserved for analysis see section 2 6 for preservation and analysis details these jars were then stirred at 100 rpm for 60 min unfiltered and 0 45 μm filtered samples were collected at t 15 30 45 and 60 min using a sterile syringe while the jars were continuously mixed collection of the 60 min samples marked the end of the jar test 2 3 2 experiments with influent and effluent of rapid sand filters batch experiments were performed with the influent and effluent of rsfs to investigate options for achieving a reduction in as concentration to 1 μg l in the experiments with the rsf influent the impact of 0 5 5 mg l fe iii doses achieved by fecl3 dosing alone or after potassium permanganate 0 66 mg l kmno4 pre treatment was studied the required kmno4 dosing was determined by preliminary experiments to achieve complete as iii oxidation for the rsf effluent we investigated only the effect of different fe iii doses because of the absence of as iii in rsf effluent to investigate the effect of ph on as removal experiments were performed at natural ph unamended ph ph 7 8 for wtp 1 and ph 8 2 for wtp 2 and at an experimentally lowered ph of 7 0 achieved by 0 1 m hcl dosing first the jars were filled with the influent or the effluent of the rsfs from both wtps subsequently a predetermined aliquot of kmno4 and or fecl3 was dosed in each jar while the solutions were mixed at 100 rpm in the kmno4 fecl3 dosing experiments the interval between kmno4 and fecl3 doses was kept constant at 2 min this interval was chosen to ensure that complete oxidation of as iii to as v had occurred before fe iii was dosed ahmad et al 2018 for the ph adjustment 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh was used before the addition of kmno4 and or fecl3 finally unfiltered and 0 45 μm filtered water samples were collected from the jars at t 30 min using a sterile syringe while the jars were continuously mixed the samples were analyzed for as and fe concentrations see section 2 6 for preservation and analysis details 2 3 3 experiments with rapid sand filter material adsorption and desorption of as by rsf media was studied as a function of ph 7 0 9 0 as concentration and as speciation as iii or as v the rsf effluent of each wtp was used as the initial solution in the experiments with rsf media of that wtp before experiments the filter media samples were washed at least 5 times with ultrapure water to remove loose precipitates and afterwards air dried for 24 h at room temperature the solid solution ratio used in the batch experiments was 250 g l all the suspensions were agitated by back and forth strokes at a rate of 120 min 1 sample aliquots of 100 ml were collected using a sterile syringe with a 30 cm teflon tube on the tip were taken at t 0 i e directly after solid addition and intermittently until t 24 h 2 3 4 chemical characterization of rapid sand filter material the rsf media grains from both wtps were characterized for the chemical composition of the coating to investigate as iii oxidation in rsfs for each sample the coating of 4 0 g of the filter material was dissolved in 50 ml ultrapure water and 6 3 ml concentrated hno3 65 followed by heating the suspension at 105 c for 24 h after cooling down the solution was filtered through whatman 589 1 paper filter and analyzed for as ca fe mg mn si and p concentrations see section 2 6 for preservation and analysis details 2 4 microbial community analysis on rapid sand filter material to further investigate as iii oxidation in rsfs insights into the microbial community in rsfs were obtained by dna extraction and 16s rrna taxonomic profiling using next generation sequencing ngs to perform the analysis 40 ml of ultrapure water invitrogen thermofisher scientific was added to 7 0 g of freshly collected filter material from each wtp high energy sonication was used to release the biomass from the filter material as described previously magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 the suspended biomass was subsequently concentrated on polycarbonate track etched membrane filters having a pore size of 0 2 μm sartorius the powerbiofilm kit qiagen was used for dna extraction using the protocol described by the manufacturer the v4 variable region of the 16s rrna genes was amplified using the 515f 806r primer pair amplicons were barcoded and the size and concentration was checked on an agilent bioanalyser dna concentrations were determined using the qubit fluorescent measurement fisher scientific equimolar amplicon concentrations were pooled and sequenced using the miseq v2 2 250 bp reagents illumina on an illumina miseq platform subsequent processing of sequence data was performed using the mothur pipeline schloss et al 2009 in short raw paired end sequence reads were assembled aligned against the silva alignment database version 132 quast et al 2013 and potential chimeric sequences were removed finally operational taxonomic units otus with 97 sequence identity were predicted and taxonomic identification of the otus to genus level was performed against the silva taxonomic database only prokaryote otus were retained pca including the proportion of the 34 most abundant genera and a selection of water geochemical parameters from table 1 was carried out using the xlstat 2019 version 3 2 2 5 chemicals and other apparatus all chemicals were reagent grade kmno4 was dosed using a 0 03 m kmno4 3 6 g l mno4 stock solution it was prepared by

samples for the determination of arsenic as iron fe manganese mn phosphorous p calcium ca magnesium mg and silicon si were preserved immediately after sampling by adding 2 ml of 50 v v nitric acid hno3 per 100 ml of water sample the analysis of these samples was carried out by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo fisher scientific icap rq having prepfast 2 sc 4dx autosampler the aerosol sample was ionized atomized in an argon plasma and mass spectrometry using a qcell collision reaction cell for mass charge ratio detection and optical emission spectrometry

blue solution extinction of this solution at 660 nm was used for analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 arsenic removal during dune water treatment table 3 presents results of the sampling campaigns that were carried out at wtp 1 and wtp 2 to gain insights into as removal during dune water treatment a fraction of as and fe concentrations in raw dune water was removed by 0 45 μm filtration at both wtps which shows that some portion of as and fe is already co precipitated in the raw dune water at both wtps during treatment of dune water as removal is strongly correlated with fe removal at both wtps attributed to further co precipitation of as with fe iii oxyhydr oxides that are formed due to the oxidative hydrolysis of natural and dosed fe in water latter only at wtp 1 fig 1 at wtp 1 the effluent of rsf is treated by gac filtration and uf fig 1b and at wtp 2 the effluent of rsf is treated by ssf to produce drinking water fig 1c we observe that the as concentrations in rsf effluent were not reduced further by any of these treatment steps table 3 this can be attributed to the absence of as adsorbing fe iii oxyhydr oxides in the rsf effluent at both wtps and low adsorption affinity between as v the predominant as species in rsf effluent and the negatively charged surfaces of activated carbon media newcombe et al 1993 uf membranes floris et al 2016 li et al 2011 and ssf media śmiech et al 2018 complete mn removal is observed in the rsf bed at both wtps table 3 the direct oxidation of mn ii to form solid mnox with oxygen in the relevant ph range is a kinetically slow process and can explain the occurrence of dissolved mn in the supernatant storage at both wtps diem and stumm 1984 knocke et al 1991 søgaard and madsen 2013 van benschoten et al 1992 the mn removal in rsfs is attributed to bacteria and surface catalysts on the filter media grains which are known to mediate the mn ii transformation to insoluble mnox bruins et al 2015 katsoyiannis et al 2008 the removal of nh4 at both wtps also occurs in the filter bed attributed to the biological oxidation nitrification executed by different bacterial species in the filter bed de moel et al 2006 de vet 2011 arsenic in the raw dune water at both wtps occurs as a combination of as iii and as v table 1 this observation is consistent with previous studies which indicate that as mobilization in dunes could be due to reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides with local input from oxidation of as bearing pyrite minerals ahmad et al 2015 2020 stuyfzand et al 2008 no significant differences are observed between the concentrations of aqueous as iii in the raw dune water and rsf supernatant at both wtps this shows that aeration is not effective for as iii oxidation to as v a similar slow oxidation kinetics of as iii in oxygen systems has been reported by previous studies frank and clifford 1986 ghurye and clifford 2001 irrespective of as speciation in the rsf influent as v is the predominant species of residual as in the effluent of rsfs at both wtps which can be attributed to oxidation of aqueous as iii in rsfs at wtp 1 the difference between aqueous as and fe concentrations in the supernatant and the rsf effluent indicates an uptake of 9 7 μg as per mg of the precipitated fe during rapid sand filtration this is much higher than the as uptake by fe iii precipitates during aeration and supernatant storage 1 3 μg as per mg fe the higher as uptake by fe iii precipitates in the filter bed can be explained by the oxidation of aqueous as iii due to either mnox and or as oxidizing bacteria which have been observed both on rsf media grains see section 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 for further discussion at wtp 2 as concentration in the effluent of rsf is similar to the aqueous as in the supernatant this can be explained by the fact that in the supernatant of wtp 2 fe is already precipitated and therefore further fe iii oxyhydr oxide precipitation and corresponding as co precipitation is not possible in rsf bed at wtp 2 thus it can be concluded that a higher as co precipitation efficiency is achieved when a higher proportion of fe is precipitated in rsf bed where at the same time as iii is oxidized into as v in summary the sampling campaigns reveal that during dune water treatment rapid sand filtration is the most important treatment step for the oxidation and removal of as the efficiency of as co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides is higher in rsf bed compared to aeration and supernatant storage because of the rapid oxidation of as iii to as v in the rsf bed therefore as removal can be increased by ensuring that more of the fe is precipitated in the rsf bed after the rsf no further as removal is observed due to the low affinity between as v and the negatively charged filtration surfaces of subsequent treatment steps 3 2 oxidation and removal of arsenic over filter bed height the oxidation and removal of as during rapid sand filtration was further studied by collecting pore water samples over the rsf beds at both wtps the results show that removal of as fe mn and nh4 predominantly occurs in the upper region 0 5 m and 0 7 m for wtp 1 and wtp 2 respectively of the filter bed at both wtps fig 2 a and fig 2d simultaneously the oxidation of dissolved as iii into as v also occurs in the upper 0 7 m region of rsfs fig 2c and f nevertheless clear differences are observed between wtp 1 and wtp 2 for as and fe co precipitation profiles at wtp 1 as and fe co precipitation increases with filter depth until 0 5 m below the filter bed surface arsenic is not removed from the solution further because no fe iii oxyhydr oxides are formed below 0 5 m onto which as could adsorb fig 2b on the other hand at wtp 2 no further as co precipitation in the filter bed occurs fig 2e because all fe is already oxidized and precipitated in the supernatant thus though removal and oxidation of as is concentrated in the upper part of the rsfs at both wtps as iii oxidation appears to be independent of fe oxidation and precipitation 3 3 rapid sand filter media surface coating the rsf media at both wtps have been used for over a decade to further understand the mechanism of as iii oxidation in rsfs the brown black filter media coating was analyzed to determine the chemical composition fig 3 and table 4 besides other elements such as ca mg si p and as significant concentrations of fe and mn are found in the coating of both filter media table 4 fig s1 indicating the presence of fe and mn oxides in the filter material coating bruins et al 2015 gude et al 2016 2017 jessen et al 2005 sharma 2001 while the oxidation of as iii by fe iii oxides is known to be slow oscarson et al 1981 the mnox on the filter media grains can rapidly oxidize as iii into as v driehaus et al 1995 gude et al 2017 lafferty et al 2010 moore et al 1990 oscarson et al 1983 and therefore the mnox may be responsible for the observed rapid oxidation of as iii in the rsfs however several recent studies argue that as iii oxidation in rsfs is microbiologically mediated crognale et al 2019 gude et al 2018a b therefore microbial communities in rsfs of both wtps were analyzed to investigate the presence of as oxidizing bacteria 3 4 taxonomic community profiling of 16s rrna sequences taxonomic profiling of the bacterial communities was performed on the filter media grains obtained from both wtps the overview of the relative proportions of the different bacterial taxa at family and genus level in the microbial communities shows only minor differences between the duplicate samples from each wtp this demonstrates that representative samples were analyzed from both wtps fig 4 family level taxonomic profiling indicates that though much less abundant than the other genera like nitrospira or methyloglobulus bacterial sequences related to xanthobacteraceae and burkholderiaceae are present on both the filter media some strains in these bacterial families carry aioa genes encoding for as iii oxidase and are thus able to rapidly oxidize as iii heinrich salmeron et al 2011 therefore we hypothesize that as iii oxidation in rapid sand filters during dune water treatment is biologically mediated by as iii oxidizing bacteria the pca of both geochemical and taxonomic data fig s4 underlines the separation of two geochemical signatures genera associated to nitrogen and as biogeochemical cycles are associated with both water types i e wtp 1 and wtp 2 however a correlation between the most abundant genus nitrospira and nh4 concentration is observed 3 5 arsenic adsorption onto rapid sand filter material the chemical characterization of filter media coating table 4 shows that fe iii oxyhydr oxides are present on filter media grains which may contribute to as removal in rsfs to investigate this we performed batch experiments with rsf media and rsf effluent samples of both wtps under different conditions of ph initial as concentration and as speciation the adsorption desorption distribution coefficient kd under different conditions is presented in fig 5 and fig 6 we observe that at natural ph and as concentrations kd value after a long equilibration time of 1440 min 24 h is very low kd 0 for both wtps fig 5a and b indicating absence of any adsorption of as onto rsf media coating even after a prolonged contact of 24 h the contact time in rsfs is 17 min and 10 min for wtp 1 and wtp 2 respectively table 2 these results show that the adsorption sites on the fe iii oxyhydr oxides present in filter media coating are already in equilibrium with the as concentration in water and therefore no further as adsorption takes place moreover this result confirms that co precipitation of as with freshly formed fe iii oxyhydr oxides is the main as removal mechanism at both wtps and filter media coating does not contribute to as removal at a ph of 7 0 a positive kd is observed for both wtps indicating adsorption of as onto the rsf media coating on the other hand when ph is increased to 9 0 a negative kd is observed for both wtps indicating desorption of as from the rsf media coating the observed adsorption desorption of as as a function of ph can be explained by the fact that the number of adsorption sites for as v which is a deprotonated oxyanion on fe iii oxyhydr oxides increases with a decrease in ph dixit and hering 2003 kanematsu et al 2013 manning et al 1998 meng et al 2000 pierce and moore 1982 thus from these results it can be concluded that filter media coating does not contribute to as removal and that a reduction in ph is required to adsorb more as onto the fe iii oxyhydr oxides at natural ph the adsorption of as onto filter media occurs only in the experiments with higher as concentration 100 μg l as iii or as v spike fig 6a and b which can be explained by the fact that the equilibrium loading of an adsorbent increases with an increase in adsorbate adsorbent ratio until adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is reached raven et al 1998 wilkie and hering 1996 we also observe that the adsorption of as is similar when as iii or as v is the initial as species fig 6a and b this can be attributed to the oxidation of aqueous as iii to as v before adsorption fig s2 thus again confirming the accelerating effect of filter media grains on as iii oxidation 3 6 impact of extended residence time in supernatant jar tests were performed with the supernatant water samples from the rsfs of both wtps to investigate whether increasing residence time of water in the supernatant storage could increase as removal for wtp 1 as and fe removal is 30 and 70 respectively at t 0 fig 7 a t 0 refers to the occasion of supernatant sample collection which corresponds to the residence time in the supernatant table 2 arsenic and fe removal increases to 35 and 85 respectively at t 15 min and 40 and 100 at t 30 min fig 7a no further increase in as removal occurs after 30 min because of the absence of freshly formed additional fe iii precipitates the achieved as removal efficiency in this case is much lower compared to as removal at wtp 1 40 compared to 75 which can be due to the fact that as iii was not oxidized in the absence of rsf media fig 7c thus it can be concluded that the extended residence time in the supernatant storage is ineffective for increasing as removal during dune water treatment in contrast to wtp 1 no considerable increase in as removal is observed with extended residence time in jar tests with supernatant water of wtp 2 fig 7b which can be attributed to the absence of fresh formation of fe iii precipitates we also monitored removal of p and si as a function of extended residence time in the supernatant the results show that p is better removed than as e g for wtp 1 removal of p is 60 at t 0 which increases to 75 and 85 at t 15 min and 30 min respectively fig 7a the relatively lower removal of as compared to p can be attributed to the lower as concentration in the initial solution and the presence of a major proportion 80 85 of aqueous as in the form of as iii fig 7c which is generally outcompeted by p for the adsorption sites on fe iii precipitates due to lower affinity of as iii than p dixit and hering 2003 jain and loeppert 2000 stachowicz et al 2008 the removal of si remains low 5 in all the cases which can be attributed to the uncharged nature of si species at the given ph kanematsu et al 2013 roberts et al 2004 swedlund and webster 1999 3 7 arsenic reduction to below 1 μg l at dune water treatment plants 3 7 1 kmno4 fecl3 dosing in rsf influent the sampling campaigns show that as removal during dune water treatment depends on as speciation ph and amount of freshly precipitated fe iii oxyhydr oxides in water to explore opportunities for as reduction to very low levels 1 μg l we studied as co precipitation efficiency in rsf influent as a function of fe iii dosing and ph with and without pre treatment with kmno4 at natural ph of rsf influent the as co precipitation efficiency increases with fe iii dosing for both wtps fig 8 a and fig 8c attributed to the availability of a higher amount of fe iii precipitates in water that adsorb more as dixit and hering 2003 hering et al 1996 qiao et al 2012 su and puls 2001 wilkie and hering 1996 youngran et al 2007 we further observe that as co precipitation efficiency corresponding to a residual as concentration of significantly lower than 1 μg l is achieved only in case of wtp 2 at 3 mg l fe iii and the increase in as co precipitation is steeper for wtp 2 than wtp 1 this can be explained by the fact that in the rsf influent of wtp 2 the proportion of as v is higher than wtp 1 table 3 interestingly in case of wtp 1 when the ph is lowered to 7 0 the as removal efficiency remains similar to ph 7 8 fig 8a although the amount of precipitated fe is slightly lower at ph 7 0 compared to results obtained at ph 7 8 due to the slower oxidation of natural fe ii at ph 7 0 vries et al 2017 we attribute the insignificant impact of ph on as co precipitation to the presence of a large proportion of as in the form of as iii at wtp 1 fig s3 whose adsorption onto fe iii oxyhydr oxides is known to remain unaffected over a ph range of 4 9 dixit and hering 2003 kanematsu et al 2013 stachowicz et al 2006 2008 when the co precipitation of as in rsf influent is studied with kmno4 pre treatment 0 66 mg l kmno4 which facilitates the oxidation of as iii to as v the as removal efficiency drastically improves for both wtps fig 8b and d for wtp 1 fig 8b the residual as concentration of 1 μg l 90 is achieved with fe iii dose of only 1 5 mg l similarly for wtp 2 the residual as concentration of 0 9 μg l as 80 removal is achieved with only 0 7 mg l fe iii dose fig 8d thus as reduction to 1 μg l can be achieved at a much lower fe iii dose if kmno4 pre treatment is applied oxidizing as iii to as v by dosing a strong oxidant such as kmno4 has also been previously shown to increase as co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides ahmad et al 2018 bissen and frimmel 2003 sorlini and gialdini 2010 because as v adsorbs to fe iii precipitates more readily compared to as iii hering et al 1996 hsu et al 2008 lakshmanan et al 2008 lytle et al 2005 qiao et al 2012 for wtp 1 at the reduced ph 7 0 a residual as concentration of 0 8 μg l 93 removal with fe iii dose of only 0 9 mg l is achieved which can be explained by the availability of higher number of adsorption sites for as v of fe iii precipitates at lower ph from these results it can be concluded that the presence of as iii restricts the efficiency of as co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides even with ph adjustment to lower values when as iii is oxidized to as v by a strong oxidant kmno4 not only the as uptake by fe iii precipitates increases but also as co precipitation efficiency can be further increased by lowering the ph thus kmno4 fecl3 dosing in the influent of rsfs is an effective approach for as reduction to 1 μg l 3 7 2 fecl3 dosing in rsf effluent the sampling campaigns have revealed that as iii oxidizes completely into as v during rapid sand filtration we investigated if as reduction to 1 μg l can be achieved by fecl3 dosing in rsf effluent of wtp 1 the results show that as removal of 70 is achieved reduction from 2 3 μg l to 0 7 μg l at an fe iii dose of 0 75 mg l for wtp 1 fig 9 compared to the rsf influent of wtp 1 in which as reduction to 1 μg l was not achieved even at an fe iii dose of 5 mg l fig 8a the as co precipitation efficiency with fe iii oxyhydr oxides in rsf effluent is much higher due to the fact that in rsf effluent as is predominantly present in the form of as v which has a higher affinity for fe iii precipitates than as iii from this we conclude that the use of kmno4 in dune water treatment can be avoided by treating the rsf effluent by fecl3 for as v removal instead of treating the rsf influent for as iii removal by kmno4 fecl3 dosing 4 conclusions and implications for water treatment from this study we conclude that rapid sand filtration is the most important treatment step for oxidation and removal of as during treatment of artificially recharged groundwater removal of as is mainly due to as co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides and the efficiency of as co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides is much higher in rapid sand filter beds compared to the preceding aeration and supernatant storage steps this is due to an accelerated oxidation of as iii to as v in the filter beds which may be caused by the manganese oxides and or as iii oxidizing bacteria as both exist in the coating of rapid sand filter media grains while more research is needed to unravel the actual as iii oxidation mechanism we conclude that a higher as co precipitation efficiency can be achieved during rapid sand filtration by allowing precipitation of fe iii oxyhydr oxides to take place inside rapid sand filter bed arsenic removal does not take place in treatment steps such as granular activated carbon filtration ultrafiltration or slow sand filtration due to a lack of hydrolyzing fe in their influent and a lack of adsorption affinity between as and the filtration surfaces in this study we also investigated opportunities to reduce as levels in produced drinking water we conclude that as reduction to very low levels 1 μg l at dune water treatment plants can be achieved either by treating the influent or the effluent of rapid sand filters oxidizing as iii in the rapid sand filter influent by a strong oxidant kmno4 results in a significant increase in the amount of as co precipitated with fe and therefore leads to a reduction in the amount of fe iii coagulant required to reduce as to 1 μg l on the other hand the occurrence of as in the form of as v in the rsf effluent can eliminate the need to dose kmno4 and as reduction to 1 μg l can be achieved by low fecl3 dosing alone based on these results treating the rsf effluent for as removal is expected to be more cost effective than treating the rsf influent for example estimates of chemical quantity and energy requirement for full scale implementation at wtp 1 table s1 show that dosing of kmno4 and fecl3 in rsf influent will result in an increase of drinking water production cost by 0 017 m3 on the other hand treating the rsf effluent by fecl3 dosing will result in an increase of drinking water production cost by only 0 005 m3 we also found in this study that a slight ph reduction is an effective approach to improve as v co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides but it is relatively ineffective for as iii co precipitation therefore we suggest ph reduction only when as v is the predominant as species e g in rapid

17906,in this study we investigate opportunities for reducing arsenic as to low levels below 1 μg l in produced drinking water from artificially infiltrated groundwater we observe that rapid sand filtration is the most important treatment step for the oxidation and removal of as at water treatment plants which use artificially recharged groundwater as source removal of as is mainly due to as co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides which shows higher efficiency in rapid sand filter beds compared to aeration and supernatant storage this is due to an accelerated oxidation of as iii to as v in the filter bed which may be caused by the manganese oxides and or as iii oxidizing bacteria as both are found in the coating of rapid sand filter media grains by chemical analysis and taxonomic profiling of the bacterial communities arsenic removal does not take place in treatment steps such as granular activated carbon filtration ultrafiltration or slow sand filtration due to a lack of hydrolyzing iron in their influent and a lack of adsorption affinity between as and the filtration surfaces further we found that as reduction to below 1 μg l can be effectively achieved at water treatment plants either by treating the influent of rapid sand filters by dosing potassium permanganate in combination with ferric chloride or by treating the effluent of rapid sand filters with ferric chloride dosing only finally we observe that reducing the ph is an effective measure for increasing as co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides but only when the oxidized arsenic as v is the predominant species in water keywords arsenic drinking water co precipitation fe iii oxyhydr oxides rapid sand filtration 1 introduction artificial recharge of groundwater with surface water is a widely used approach for drinking water production infiltration of the surface water into underground aquifers often leads to an improved chemical and or microbiological quality de moel et al 2006 after retention in the underground aquifers the infiltrated water is recovered and further purified at water treatment plants wtps to meet drinking water quality criteria before supply to consumer houses arsenic as concentrations in surface water are generally low bhattacharya et al 2002 2007 nriagu et al 2007 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 however high concentrations of as can be introduced into the recharged water from aquifer matrix fakhreddine et al 2015 neil et al 2012 the extent of as release into water is controlled by numerous geochemical mechanisms for example injection of oxygenated water into anoxic aquifers has been reported to mobilize as due to redox related dissolution of as bearing pyrite minerals darling 2016 dillon et al 2019 jones and pichler 2007 stuyfzand 1998 arsenic release due to exchange with competitive ligands e g phosphate available in infiltration water has been reported biswas et al 2014 guo et al 2008 vanderzalm et al 2011 additionally ph changes in the aquifer can also result in as desorption during artificial recharge aullón alcaine et al 2020 mcnab et al 2009 ormachea muñoz et al 2013 2016 in the netherlands trace level release of as into the recharged water in coastal dunes has been observed which results in elevated as levels in the recovered water ahmad et al 2015 stuyfzand et al 2008 although the as levels in the recovered water are well below the who guideline of 10 μg l recent studies indicate that human health might be affected by as concentrations below the who guideline of 10 μg l ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 kozisek 2017 saint jacques et al 2018 schmidt 2014 therefore as a precautionary measure dutch drinking water sector aims to supply drinking water with 1 μg l as ahmad et al 2020 van der wens et al 2016 the removal of as from natural anaerobic groundwater in addition to fe ii mn ii and nh4 removal has been extensively investigated in previous studies ahmad et al 2018 gude et al 2016 jessen et al 2005 lytle et al 2005 2007 the treatment of natural groundwater is generally simple consisting of aeration followed by rapid sand filtration whereby as is mainly removed by co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides which are formed due to oxidation of native fe ii and subsequent hydrolysis gude et al 2016 mcneill and edwards 1995 the treatment of artificially recharged water on the other hand often requires more treatment steps than that of natural groundwater for example granular activated carbon gac filtration is often used to remove color improve the taste of the water and additional disinfection steps may be required to achieve microbiological stability of water e g by ultrafiltration uf or ultraviolet uv treatment a complete understanding of the fate of as at low levels during the treatment of artificially recharged dune water is not yet fully obtained nevertheless this knowledge is required to identify the water quality and operational parameters that can improve as removal at dune water treatment plants in order to achieve very low as concentration 1 μg l in drinking water in this study we develop a detailed understanding of as removal during dune water treatment and investigate opportunities to reduce as levels in the recharged water to even lower levels below 1 μg l in produced drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 water treatment plants two water treatment plants wtps in the netherlands ouddorp wtp 1 and katwijk wtp 2 which rely on artificially recharged dune water for drinking water production were chosen for this study for both wtps the treatment schemes are shown in fig 1 the influent and effluent quality is provided in table 1 design and operational details are given in table 2 2 2 sampling campaigns 2 2 1 water samples to understand the removal of as sampling campaigns were carried out at both wtps which included collection of water samples before and after each treatment step and analysis of the samples for a range of water quality parameters table 3 and fig 1 approximately 24 h before sampling rotation of the dune water abstraction wells was stopped and the filters were backwashed to ensure a stable water quality during the sampling campaign for sampling each sampling point was flushed for at least 5 min and subsequently 2 l of water was collected in an acid soaked 0 1 m oxalic acid soaking for 20 min and ultrapure water washed glass beaker from that primary 2 l sample volume 200 ml of water was directly preserved for analysis and another 200 ml was filtered through 0 45 μm filters before preservation see section 2 6 for preservation and analysis details the residual sample volume 1 6 l was used for the measurements of ph temperature and dissolved oxygen using a potable multi meter hach hq30d53101301 for the sampling of dune water care was taken to avoid aeration of the samples during collection the pore water over the height of the rapid sand filters rsfs was sampled using the available sampling points at least 10 cm apart in the full scale filters at an approximate flow rate of 50 ml min 2 2 2 sampling of rapid sand filter material to determine the chemical composition of the coating on the rsf media microbial community analysis and to perform batch experiments aimed to gain insights into as adsorption filter material from the full scale rsfs of both wtps were analyzed for these purposes approximately 5 kg of the filter material from the upper 10 cm of each filter bed was collected with a stainless steel spade directly after backwash and stored in a closed bucket 2 3 batch experiments a number of batch experiments with influent supernatant and effluent water of the rsfs see fig 1 for sample points were performed to elucidate the effect of different water quality and operational parameters on as removal approximately 10 min before each batch experiment 20 l of water was collected from the relevant sample point in the full scale wtp using a jerry can fig 1 further details about the experiments are provided in the following sections 2 3 1 supernatant water experiments arsenic removal as a function of residence time in rsf supernatant water storage above rsf was studied with supernatant water samples from both wtps using a standard jar test apparatus which has been described previously ahmad et al 2018 the supernatant water sample was poured in 4 jars 2 l each jar of the jar test apparatus this was considered t 0 i e start of the experiment unfiltered and 0 45 μm filtered samples of the initial solution were collected and preserved for analysis see section 2 6 for preservation and analysis details these jars were then stirred at 100 rpm for 60 min unfiltered and 0 45 μm filtered samples were collected at t 15 30 45 and 60 min using a sterile syringe while the jars were continuously mixed collection of the 60 min samples marked the end of the jar test 2 3 2 experiments with influent and effluent of rapid sand filters batch experiments were performed with the influent and effluent of rsfs to investigate options for achieving a reduction in as concentration to 1 μg l in the experiments with the rsf influent the impact of 0 5 5 mg l fe iii doses achieved by fecl3 dosing alone or after potassium permanganate 0 66 mg l kmno4 pre treatment was studied the required kmno4 dosing was determined by preliminary experiments to achieve complete as iii oxidation for the rsf effluent we investigated only the effect of different fe iii doses because of the absence of as iii in rsf effluent to investigate the effect of ph on as removal experiments were performed at natural ph unamended ph ph 7 8 for wtp 1 and ph 8 2 for wtp 2 and at an experimentally lowered ph of 7 0 achieved by 0 1 m hcl dosing first the jars were filled with the influent or the effluent of the rsfs from both wtps subsequently a predetermined aliquot of kmno4 and or fecl3 was dosed in each jar while the solutions were mixed at 100 rpm in the kmno4 fecl3 dosing experiments the interval between kmno4 and fecl3 doses was kept constant at 2 min this interval was chosen to ensure that complete oxidation of as iii to as v had occurred before fe iii was dosed ahmad et al 2018 for the ph adjustment 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh was used before the addition of kmno4 and or fecl3 finally unfiltered and 0 45 μm filtered water samples were collected from the jars at t 30 min using a sterile syringe while the jars were continuously mixed the samples were analyzed for as and fe concentrations see section 2 6 for preservation and analysis details 2 3 3 experiments with rapid sand filter material adsorption and desorption of as by rsf media was studied as a function of ph 7 0 9 0 as concentration and as speciation as iii or as v the rsf effluent of each wtp was used as the initial solution in the experiments with rsf media of that wtp before experiments the filter media samples were washed at least 5 times with ultrapure water to remove loose precipitates and afterwards air dried for 24 h at room temperature the solid solution ratio used in the batch experiments was 250 g l all the suspensions were agitated by back and forth strokes at a rate of 120 min 1 sample aliquots of 100 ml were collected using a sterile syringe with a 30 cm teflon tube on the tip were taken at t 0 i e directly after solid addition and intermittently until t 24 h 2 3 4 chemical characterization of rapid sand filter material the rsf media grains from both wtps were characterized for the chemical composition of the coating to investigate as iii oxidation in rsfs for each sample the coating of 4 0 g of the filter material was dissolved in 50 ml ultrapure water and 6 3 ml concentrated hno3 65 followed by heating the suspension at 105 c for 24 h after cooling down the solution was filtered through whatman 589 1 paper filter and analyzed for as ca fe mg mn si and p concentrations see section 2 6 for preservation and analysis details 2 4 microbial community analysis on rapid sand filter material to further investigate as iii oxidation in rsfs insights into the microbial community in rsfs were obtained by dna extraction and 16s rrna taxonomic profiling using next generation sequencing ngs to perform the analysis 40 ml of ultrapure water invitrogen thermofisher scientific was added to 7 0 g of freshly collected filter material from each wtp high energy sonication was used to release the biomass from the filter material as described previously magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 the suspended biomass was subsequently concentrated on polycarbonate track etched membrane filters having a pore size of 0 2 μm sartorius the powerbiofilm kit qiagen was used for dna extraction using the protocol described by the manufacturer the v4 variable region of the 16s rrna genes was amplified using the 515f 806r primer pair amplicons were barcoded and the size and concentration was checked on an agilent bioanalyser dna concentrations were determined using the qubit fluorescent measurement fisher scientific equimolar amplicon concentrations were pooled and sequenced using the miseq v2 2 250 bp reagents illumina on an illumina miseq platform subsequent processing of sequence data was performed using the mothur pipeline schloss et al 2009 in short raw paired end sequence reads were assembled aligned against the silva alignment database version 132 quast et al 2013 and potential chimeric sequences were removed finally operational taxonomic units otus with 97 sequence identity were predicted and taxonomic identification of the otus to genus level was performed against the silva taxonomic database only prokaryote otus were retained pca including the proportion of the 34 most abundant genera and a selection of water geochemical parameters from table 1 was carried out using the xlstat 2019 version 3 2 2 5 chemicals and other apparatus all chemicals were reagent grade kmno4 was dosed using a 0 03 m kmno4 3 6 g l mno4 stock solution it was prepared by dissolving 948 mg of solid kmno4 cairox carus corporation in 200 ml ultrapure water directly before the start of batch experiments a fecl3 solution 2 0 g fe iii l was used to dose fe iii in water it was prepared by dissolving 1936 mg solid fecl3 6h2o j t baker in 200 ml ultrapure water directly before the start of the batch experiments for as iii and as v spike certified solutions 1000 mg as iii and as v l inorganic ventures set in hcl and h2o matrices respectively were used without any dilution for ph control during the experiments 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl solutions were used the pp pe 50 ml sterile syringes sigma aldrich were used for the filtration of water samples to obtain 0 45 μm filtered samples ge s gd xp disposable syringe filters were used 2 6 preservation and analysis of water samples all samples were analyzed at aqualab zuid which is an independent accredited water analysis laboratory in the netherlands all samples were preserved and stored at 4 c before analysis the samples for the determination of arsenic as iron fe manganese mn phosphorous p calcium ca magnesium mg and silicon si were preserved immediately after sampling by adding 2 ml of 50 v v nitric acid hno3 per 100 ml of water sample the analysis of these samples was carried out by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo fisher scientific icap rq having prepfast 2 sc 4dx autosampler the aerosol sample was ionized atomized in an argon plasma and mass spectrometry using a qcell collision reaction cell for mass charge ratio detection and optical emission spectrometry using an echelle spectrometer equipped with two scd detectors combined range 165 782 nm were used to derive element specific information the samples for total organic carbon toc analysis were

blue solution extinction of this solution at 660 nm was used for analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 arsenic removal during dune water treatment table 3 presents results of the sampling campaigns that were carried out at wtp 1 and wtp 2 to gain insights into as removal during dune water treatment a fraction of as and fe concentrations in raw dune water was removed by 0 45 μm filtration at both wtps which shows that some portion of as and fe is already co precipitated in the raw dune water at both wtps during treatment of dune water as removal is strongly correlated with fe removal at both wtps attributed to further co precipitation of as with fe iii oxyhydr oxides that are formed due to the oxidative hydrolysis of natural and dosed fe in water latter only at wtp 1 fig 1 at wtp 1 the effluent of rsf is treated by gac filtration and uf fig 1b and at wtp 2 the effluent of rsf is treated by ssf to produce drinking water fig 1c we observe that the as concentrations in rsf effluent were not reduced further by any of these treatment steps table 3 this can be attributed to the absence of as adsorbing fe iii oxyhydr oxides in the rsf effluent at both wtps and low adsorption affinity between as v the predominant as species in rsf effluent and the negatively charged surfaces of activated carbon media newcombe et al 1993 uf membranes floris et al 2016 li et al 2011 and ssf media śmiech et al 2018 complete mn removal is observed in the rsf bed at both wtps table 3 the direct oxidation of mn ii to form solid mnox with oxygen in the relevant ph range is a kinetically slow process and can explain the occurrence of dissolved mn in the supernatant storage at both wtps diem and stumm 1984 knocke et al 1991 søgaard and madsen 2013 van benschoten et al 1992 the mn removal in rsfs is attributed to bacteria and surface catalysts on the filter media grains which are known to mediate the mn ii transformation to insoluble mnox bruins et al 2015 katsoyiannis et al 2008 the removal of nh4 at both wtps also occurs in the filter bed attributed to the biological oxidation nitrification executed by different bacterial species in the filter bed de moel et al 2006 de vet 2011 arsenic in the raw dune water at both wtps occurs as a combination of as iii and as v table 1 this observation is consistent with previous studies which indicate that as mobilization in dunes could be due to reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydr oxides with local input from oxidation of as bearing pyrite minerals ahmad et al 2015 2020 stuyfzand et al 2008 no significant differences are observed between the concentrations of aqueous as iii in the raw dune water and rsf supernatant at both wtps this shows that aeration is not effective for as iii oxidation to as v a similar slow oxidation kinetics of as iii in oxygen systems has been reported by previous studies frank and clifford 1986 ghurye and clifford 2001 irrespective of as speciation in the rsf influent as v is the predominant species of residual as in the effluent of rsfs at both wtps which can be attributed to oxidation of aqueous as iii in rsfs at wtp 1 the difference between aqueous as and fe concentrations in the supernatant and the rsf effluent indicates an uptake of 9 7 μg as per mg of the precipitated fe during rapid sand filtration this is much higher than the as uptake by fe iii precipitates during aeration and supernatant storage 1 3 μg as per mg fe the higher as uptake by fe iii precipitates in the filter bed can be explained by the oxidation of aqueous as iii due to either mnox and or as oxidizing bacteria which have been observed both on rsf media grains see section 3 2 3 3 and 3 4 for further discussion at wtp 2 as concentration in the effluent of rsf is similar to the aqueous as in the supernatant this can be explained by the fact that in the supernatant of wtp 2 fe is already precipitated and therefore further fe iii oxyhydr oxide precipitation and corresponding as co precipitation is not possible in rsf bed at wtp 2 thus it can be concluded that a higher as co precipitation efficiency is achieved when a higher proportion of fe is precipitated in rsf bed where at the same time as iii is oxidized into as v in summary the sampling campaigns reveal that during dune water treatment rapid sand filtration is the most important treatment step for the oxidation and removal of as the efficiency of as co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides is higher in rsf bed compared to aeration and supernatant storage because of the rapid oxidation of as iii to as v in the rsf bed therefore as removal can be increased by ensuring that more of the fe is precipitated in the rsf bed after the rsf no further as removal is observed due to the low affinity between as v and the negatively charged filtration surfaces of subsequent treatment steps 3 2 oxidation and removal of arsenic over filter bed height the oxidation and removal of as during rapid sand filtration was further studied by collecting pore water samples over the rsf beds at both wtps the results show that removal of as fe mn and nh4 predominantly occurs in the upper region 0 5 m and 0 7 m for wtp 1 and wtp 2 respectively of the filter bed at both wtps fig 2 a and fig 2d simultaneously the oxidation of dissolved as iii into as v also occurs in the upper 0 7 m region of rsfs fig 2c and f nevertheless clear differences are observed between wtp 1 and wtp 2 for as and fe co precipitation profiles at wtp 1 as and fe co precipitation increases with filter depth until 0 5 m below the filter bed surface arsenic is not removed from the solution further because no fe iii oxyhydr oxides are formed below 0 5 m onto which as could adsorb fig 2b on the other hand at wtp 2 no further as co precipitation in the filter bed occurs fig 2e because all fe is already oxidized and precipitated in the supernatant thus though removal and oxidation of as is concentrated in the upper part of the rsfs at both wtps as iii oxidation appears to be independent of fe oxidation and precipitation 3 3 rapid sand filter media surface coating the rsf media at both wtps have been used for over a decade to further understand the mechanism of as iii oxidation in rsfs the brown black filter media coating was analyzed to determine the chemical composition fig 3 and table 4 besides other elements such as ca mg si p and as significant concentrations of fe and mn are found in the coating of both filter media table 4 fig s1 indicating the presence of fe and mn oxides in the filter material coating bruins et al 2015 gude et al 2016 2017 jessen et al 2005 sharma 2001 while the oxidation of as iii by fe iii oxides is known to be slow oscarson et al 1981 the mnox on the filter media grains can rapidly oxidize as iii into as v driehaus et al 1995 gude et al 2017 lafferty et al 2010 moore et al 1990 oscarson et al 1983 and therefore the mnox may be responsible for the observed rapid oxidation of as iii in the rsfs however several recent studies argue that as iii oxidation in rsfs is microbiologically mediated crognale et al 2019 gude et al 2018a b therefore microbial communities in rsfs of both wtps were analyzed to investigate the presence of as oxidizing bacteria 3 4 taxonomic community profiling of 16s rrna sequences taxonomic profiling of the bacterial communities was performed on the filter media grains obtained from both wtps the overview of the relative proportions of the different bacterial taxa at family and genus level in the microbial communities shows only minor differences between the duplicate samples from each wtp this demonstrates that representative samples were analyzed from both wtps fig 4 family level taxonomic profiling indicates that though much less abundant than the other genera like nitrospira or methyloglobulus bacterial sequences related to xanthobacteraceae and burkholderiaceae are present on both the filter media some strains in these bacterial families carry aioa genes encoding for as iii oxidase and are thus able to rapidly oxidize as iii heinrich salmeron et al 2011 therefore we hypothesize that as iii oxidation in rapid sand filters during dune water treatment is biologically mediated by as iii oxidizing bacteria the pca of both geochemical and taxonomic data fig s4 underlines the separation of two geochemical signatures genera associated to nitrogen and as biogeochemical cycles are associated with both water types i e wtp 1 and wtp 2 however a correlation between the most abundant genus nitrospira and nh4 concentration is observed 3 5 arsenic adsorption onto rapid sand filter material the chemical characterization of filter media coating table 4 shows that fe iii oxyhydr oxides are present on filter media grains which may contribute to as removal in rsfs to investigate this we performed batch experiments with rsf media and rsf effluent samples of both wtps under different conditions of ph initial as concentration and as speciation the adsorption desorption distribution coefficient kd under different conditions is presented in fig 5 and fig 6 we observe that at natural ph and as concentrations kd value after a long equilibration time of 1440 min 24 h is very low kd 0 for both wtps fig 5a and b indicating absence of any adsorption of as onto rsf media coating even after a prolonged contact of 24 h the contact time in rsfs is 17 min and 10 min for wtp 1 and wtp 2 respectively table 2 these results show that the adsorption sites on the fe iii oxyhydr oxides present in filter media coating are already in equilibrium with the as concentration in water and therefore no further as adsorption takes place moreover this result confirms that co precipitation of as with freshly formed fe iii oxyhydr oxides is the main as removal mechanism at both wtps and filter media coating does not contribute to as removal at a ph of 7 0 a positive kd is observed for both wtps indicating adsorption of as onto the rsf media coating on the other hand when ph is increased to 9 0 a negative kd is observed for both wtps indicating desorption of as from the rsf media coating the observed adsorption desorption of as as a function of ph can be explained by the fact that the number of adsorption sites for as v which is a deprotonated oxyanion on fe iii oxyhydr oxides increases with a decrease in ph dixit and hering 2003 kanematsu et al 2013 manning et al 1998 meng et al 2000 pierce and moore 1982 thus from these results it can be concluded that filter media coating does not contribute to as removal and that a reduction in ph is required to adsorb more as onto the fe iii oxyhydr oxides at natural ph the adsorption of as onto filter media occurs only in the experiments with higher as concentration 100 μg l as iii or as v spike fig 6a and b which can be explained by the fact that the equilibrium loading of an adsorbent increases with an increase in adsorbate adsorbent ratio until adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is reached raven et al 1998 wilkie and hering 1996 we also observe that the adsorption of as is similar when as iii or as v is the initial as species fig 6a and b this can be attributed to the oxidation of aqueous as iii to as v before adsorption fig s2 thus again confirming the accelerating effect of filter media grains on as iii oxidation 3 6 impact of extended residence time in supernatant jar tests were performed with the supernatant water samples from the rsfs of both wtps to investigate whether increasing residence time of water in the supernatant storage could increase as removal for wtp 1 as and fe removal is 30 and 70 respectively at t 0 fig 7 a t 0 refers to the occasion of supernatant sample collection which corresponds to the residence time in the supernatant table 2 arsenic and fe removal increases to 35 and 85 respectively at t 15 min and 40 and 100 at t 30 min fig 7a no further increase in as removal occurs after 30 min because of the absence of freshly formed additional fe iii precipitates the achieved as removal efficiency in this case is much lower compared to as removal at wtp 1 40 compared to 75 which can be due to the fact that as iii was not oxidized in the absence of rsf media fig 7c thus it can be concluded that the extended residence time in the supernatant storage is ineffective for increasing as removal during dune water treatment in contrast to wtp 1 no considerable increase in as removal is observed with extended residence time in jar tests with supernatant water of wtp 2 fig 7b which can be attributed to the absence of fresh formation of fe iii precipitates we also monitored removal of p and si as a function of extended residence time in the supernatant the results show that p is better removed than as e g for wtp 1 removal of p is 60 at t 0 which increases to 75 and 85 at t 15 min and 30 min respectively fig 7a the relatively lower removal of as compared to p can be attributed to the lower as concentration in the initial solution and the presence of a major proportion 80 85 of aqueous as in the form of as iii fig 7c which is generally outcompeted by p for the adsorption sites on fe iii precipitates due to lower affinity of as iii than p dixit and hering 2003 jain and loeppert 2000 stachowicz et al 2008 the removal of si remains low 5 in all the cases which can be attributed to the uncharged nature of si species at the given ph kanematsu et al 2013 roberts et al 2004 swedlund and webster 1999 3 7 arsenic reduction to below 1 μg l at dune water treatment plants 3 7 1 kmno4 fecl3 dosing in rsf influent the sampling campaigns show that as removal during dune water treatment depends on as speciation ph and amount of freshly precipitated fe iii oxyhydr oxides in water to explore opportunities for as reduction to very low levels 1 μg l we studied as co precipitation efficiency in rsf influent as a function of fe iii dosing and ph with and without pre treatment with kmno4 at natural ph of rsf influent the as co precipitation efficiency increases with fe iii dosing for both wtps fig 8 a and fig 8c attributed to the availability of a higher amount of fe iii precipitates in water that adsorb more as dixit and hering 2003 hering et al 1996 qiao et al 2012 su and puls 2001 wilkie and hering 1996 youngran et al 2007 we further observe that as co precipitation efficiency corresponding to a residual as concentration of significantly lower than 1 μg l is achieved only in case of wtp 2 at 3 mg l fe iii and the increase in as co precipitation is steeper for wtp 2 than wtp 1 this can be explained by the fact that in the rsf influent of wtp 2 the proportion of as v is higher than wtp 1 table 3 interestingly in case of wtp 1 when the ph is lowered to 7 0 the as removal efficiency remains similar to ph 7 8 fig 8a although the amount of precipitated fe is slightly lower at ph 7 0 compared to results obtained at ph 7 8 due to the slower oxidation of natural fe ii at ph 7 0 vries et al 2017 we attribute the insignificant impact of ph on as co precipitation to the presence of a large proportion of as in the form of as iii at wtp 1 fig s3 whose adsorption onto fe iii oxyhydr oxides is known to remain unaffected over a ph range of 4 9 dixit and hering 2003 kanematsu et al 2013 stachowicz et al 2006 2008 when the co precipitation of as in rsf influent is studied with kmno4 pre treatment 0 66 mg l kmno4 which facilitates the oxidation of as iii to as v the as removal efficiency drastically improves for both wtps fig 8b and d for wtp 1 fig 8b the residual as concentration of 1 μg l 90 is achieved with fe iii dose of only 1 5 mg l similarly for wtp 2 the residual as concentration of 0 9 μg l as 80 removal is achieved with only 0 7 mg l fe iii dose fig 8d thus as reduction to 1 μg l can be achieved at a much lower fe iii dose if kmno4 pre treatment is applied oxidizing as iii to as v by dosing a strong oxidant such as kmno4 has also been previously shown to increase as co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides ahmad et al 2018 bissen and frimmel 2003 sorlini and gialdini 2010 because as v adsorbs to fe iii precipitates more readily compared to as iii hering et al 1996 hsu et al 2008 lakshmanan et al 2008 lytle et al 2005 qiao et al 2012 for wtp 1 at the reduced ph 7 0 a residual as concentration of 0 8 μg l 93 removal with fe iii dose of only 0 9 mg l is achieved which can be explained by the availability of higher number of adsorption sites for as v of fe iii precipitates at lower ph from these results it can be concluded that the presence of as iii restricts the efficiency of as co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides even with ph adjustment to lower values when as iii is oxidized to as v by a strong oxidant kmno4 not only the as uptake by fe iii precipitates increases but also as co precipitation efficiency can be further increased by lowering the ph thus kmno4 fecl3 dosing in the influent of rsfs is an effective approach for as reduction to 1 μg l 3 7 2 fecl3 dosing in rsf effluent the sampling campaigns have revealed that as iii oxidizes completely into as v during rapid sand filtration we investigated if as reduction to 1 μg l can be achieved by fecl3 dosing in rsf effluent of wtp 1 the results show that as removal of 70 is achieved reduction from 2 3 μg l to 0 7 μg l at an fe iii dose of 0 75 mg l for wtp 1 fig 9 compared to the rsf influent of wtp 1 in which as reduction to 1 μg l was not achieved even at an fe iii dose of 5 mg l fig 8a the as co precipitation efficiency with fe iii oxyhydr oxides in rsf effluent is much higher due to the fact that in rsf effluent as is predominantly present in the form of as v which has a higher affinity for fe iii precipitates than as iii from this we conclude that the use of kmno4 in dune water treatment can be avoided by treating the rsf effluent by fecl3 for as v removal instead of treating the rsf influent for as iii removal by kmno4 fecl3 dosing 4 conclusions and implications for water treatment from this study we conclude that rapid sand filtration is the most important treatment step for oxidation and removal of as during treatment of artificially recharged groundwater removal of as is mainly due to as co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides and the efficiency of as co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides is much higher in rapid sand filter beds compared to the preceding aeration and supernatant storage steps this is due to an accelerated oxidation of as iii to as v in the filter beds which may be caused by the manganese oxides and or as iii oxidizing bacteria as both exist in the coating of rapid sand filter media grains while more research is needed to unravel the actual as iii oxidation mechanism we conclude that a higher as co precipitation efficiency can be achieved during rapid sand filtration by allowing precipitation of fe iii oxyhydr oxides to take place inside rapid sand filter bed arsenic removal does not take place in treatment steps such as granular activated carbon filtration ultrafiltration or slow sand filtration due to a lack of hydrolyzing fe in their influent and a lack of adsorption affinity between as and the filtration surfaces in this study we also investigated opportunities to reduce as levels in produced drinking water we conclude that as reduction to very low levels 1 μg l at dune water treatment plants can be achieved either by treating the influent or the effluent of rapid sand filters oxidizing as iii in the rapid sand filter influent by a strong oxidant kmno4 results in a significant increase in the amount of as co precipitated with fe and therefore leads to a reduction in the amount of fe iii coagulant required to reduce as to 1 μg l on the other hand the occurrence of as in the form of as v in the rsf effluent can eliminate the need to dose kmno4 and as reduction to 1 μg l can be achieved by low fecl3 dosing alone based on these results treating the rsf effluent for as removal is expected to be more cost effective than treating the rsf influent for example estimates of chemical quantity and energy requirement for full scale implementation at wtp 1 table s1 show that dosing of kmno4 and fecl3 in rsf influent will result in an increase of drinking water production cost by 0 017 m3 on the other hand treating the rsf effluent by fecl3 dosing will result in an increase of drinking water production cost by only 0 005 m3 we also found in this study that a slight ph reduction is an effective approach to improve as v co precipitation with fe iii oxyhydr oxides but it is relatively ineffective for as iii co precipitation therefore we suggest ph reduction only when as v is the predominant as species e g in rapid sand filter influent which has been pre treated with kmno4 or in rapid sand filter effluent declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

17907,here we studied seasonal variation of effluent organic matter efom based on molecular weight distribution and fluorescent components during the traditional anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o wastewater treatment processes microbial community structure and effect of temperature on some isolated pure strains were analyzed to explain the related mechanism results showed that the anaerobic process played a key role in efom removal by removing building blocks low molecular weight lmw neutrals biopolymers and protein related substances c4 and c5 thus determining the fate of efom during the a2o processes on the other hand humic substances lmw neutrals large molecular sized hydrophobic humic like compounds c3 and aromatic proteins c4 were generated during the anoxic process in summer and winter proteobacteria gamma beta and alpha proteobacteria and bacteroidetes constituted over 50 of the sludge community temperature was found to be positively correlated with the generation of soluble microbial products smp based on the performance of the mixture of isolated herbaspirillum sp beta proteobacteria and pseudomonas sp gamma proteobacteria through comprehensive analysis of the co action of proteobacteria and temperature we proposed the synergetic effect of temperature and proteobacteria as a possible mechanism of the seasonal variation of efom these findings are important for understanding the fate of efom during the wastewater treatment processes and therefore be helpful for better efom control graphical abstract image 1 keywords effluent organic matter soluble microbial products temperature fluorescent components proteobacteria 1 introduction effluent organic matter efom is the organic matter present in the effluent after each step of the wastewater treatment processes comprising soluble microbial products smp natural organic matter nom trace synthetic organic components and their intermediates chen et al 2017 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 michael kordatou et al 2015 o connor et al 2019 quantitatively efom was largely affected by the smp produced by activated sludge the quality and quantity of the mixture could represent affect the performance of the wastewater treatment systems aquino et al 2009 liang et al 2007 wang and zhang 2010a and or tertiary treatment processes bingjie and hanqing 2012 lei et al 2007 xie et al 2019 different fractions of efom require varied amounts of attention in the subsequent treatment processes for instance the large molecular fractions biopolymers made up mostly by macro polysaccharide like and protein like molecules greatly influence the effluent filterability during ultrafiltration zheng et al 2009 2010a 2014 and therefore they must be addressed in the tertiary membrane filtration process zhou et al 2017 the smaller sized components of efom especially those containing organic nitrogen could be the major precursors of nitrogenous disinfection by products dbp chen et al 2009 which limits the utilization of disinfection methods and the toxicity of dbp must be monitored strictly zhang et al 2019 therefore tracking the variation of the different fractions of efom during the treatment processes is necessary to understand the fate of efom better and deliver more efficient and suitable methods to control efom formation this is particularly applicable in the traditional wastewater treatment processes that are predominantly utilized in municipal wastewater treatment gallego schmid and tarpani 2019 piao et al 2016 however to date the variation of efom during the traditional wastewater treatment processes has been rarely investigated meng et al 2011 reported the fate of both biomacromolecules bmm and lmw compounds smaller than 5 kda using membrane bioreactor mbr systems and demonstrated the function of a membrane in separating the different fractions using a sequencing batch reactor sbr ni et al 2010 reported that the utilization associated products uap in efom were utilized by the activated sludge while the biomass associated products bap accumulated in efom suggesting that the fate of bap must be addressed in detail due to their dominant contribution to efom the variation of efom fractions is affected by temperature it was reported that the efom in secondary effluent increased by 10 while its biopolymer content increased by 70 at temperatures below 12 c jacquin et al 2017 our previous study confirmed that the concentration of biopolymers in winter was higher than that in summer zheng et al 2010b while other studies reported the obvious increment in the polysaccharide content under such conditions demonstrating the important effects of temperature van den brink et al 2011 hu et al 2019 identified that the fraction of lmw nitrogenous organics in secondary effluent increased with a decrease in temperature this fraction demonstrated lower bio stability which might lead to a negative impact on the water bodies that received the effluent these findings indicated that temperature affected the variation of different fractions of efom thus understanding the effects of temperature on the fate of efom to investigate the variation of efom in frequent extreme climate conditions is necessary for research walther et al 2002 recently advanced analytical methods have been developed and applied to better quantify and qualify organic complexes in environment and thus to be helpful in understanding the variation of efom huber et al 2010 improved the performance of size exclusion chromatography in combination with organic carbon detection sec ocd to refine the fraction assignation process stedmon et al stedmon and markager 2005 stedmon et al 2003 used fluorescence excitation emission spectroscopy to characterize dissolved organic matter dom and developed the fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem combined with the parallel factor parafac analysis to track the fate of dom in an aquatic environment the combination of such effective tools could provide more detailed information in qualification and quantification of the organic complexes cai and liu 2018 ly et al 2018 in this study we investigated the variation of efom onsite during the a2o wastewater treatment processes for 12 months using the sec ocd and feem parafac methods the seasonal change in the microbial community structure was analyzed the effect of

measurement of the molecular weight distribution of efom sec ocd sec ocd system model 8 doc labor germany was used to quantify the molecular weight distribution of efom expressed in mg c l for this measurement efom was divided into five fractions including biopolymers 20 kda humic substances 1 kda building blocks 0 3 0 5 kda lmw neutrals and lmw acids 0 35 kda based on the molecular size huber et al 2010 according to the manufacturer building blocks were used to reflect lmw humic like substances huber et al 2010 and therefore in this study building blocks and humic substances were described as humic related substances for the convenience of discussion similarly lmw neutrals and lmw acids were described as lwm substances the relative reduction or increment in the efom fractions during the

represent the concentrations of efom or certain fractions of efom in s1 s2 s3 and s4 respectively 2 4 measurements of feem and parafac analysis prior to the measurement of feem wastewater samples were diluted with deionized di water to minimize the inner filtering effects kothawala et al 2013 ohno 2002 and ph was adjusted to about 7 0 coble et al 2014 yu et al 2015 feem was then measured with a

threshold set at 0 8 1 0 to obtain their information at different taxonomic levels the alpha diversity indexes including the chao1 ace shannon and simpson indexes were analyzed using the qiime v1 9 1 caporaso et al 2010 2 6 separation of the pure strains and investigation of the effect of temperature sludge microorganisms were separated using the streak plate method on luria bertani lb agar medium sinopharm co ltd china after 24 h of cultivation single colonies were separated and identified by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing based on the results of the microbial community structures of the sludge samples two pure bacterial strains herbaspirillum sp beta proteobacteria and pseudomonas sp gamma proteobacteria were selected for further analysis because they belong to the two dominant classes in the sludge community these two pure strains were cultivated using the media recommended by the china center of industrial cultivation collection pre experiments were performed to determine the appropriate number of cultivation hours and the number of cultivation hours was decided as 24 h for both strains based on the bacterial density when the corresponding od600 value was about 1 6 the strains were cultivated in conical flasks with the liquid medium 100 ml which had been sterilized at 121 c for 30 min and cooled in a shaker qyc 200 cimo medical instrument china at 180 rpm at 28 c for 24 h the cells were then harvested in sterile centrifuge tubes corning us by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 3 min and washed with phosphate buffered saline pbs ingredients of pbs included 8 g l nacl 0 2 g l kcl 1 44 g l na2hpo4 and 0 24 g l kh2po4 and ph was adjusted using hcl to around 7 thrice to remove the residual medium three groups of biomass of the pure stains herbaspirillum sp pseudomonas sp and 50 herbaspirillum sp 50 pseudomonas sp were collected in three sterilized centrifuge tubes then the sterilized synthetic wastewater 50 ml ingredients were selected based on previous literatures ly et al 2018 wang and zhang 2010b xie et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 and details are shown in table 1 was added to each of the centrifuge tubes and mixed well with the microorganisms four sets of pure strain groups 3 4 12 samples were placed under different temperature conditions to evaluate the effect of a series of temperatures on the secretion of smp specifically 5 c and 15 c were the simulated temperatures in two refrigerators yc 300l zhongke meiling cryogenics co ltd china and 25 c and 35 c were the simulated temperatures in two water baths dk 8d shanghai yiheng technical co ltd china after 24 h of cultivation with synthetic wastewater at different temperatures the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was collected by passing the mixture through a 0 45 μm pes filter membrane jinglong china by comparing the characteristics of the supernatant bacterial strain treated wastewater and original synthetic wastewater using sec ocd we evaluated the role of a specific bacterial strain and the combined effects of different strains under different temperatures three parallels were used for each sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of doc and nutrients during the 12 month monitoring period fig 1 a shows the variation of doc during the influent anaerobic anoxic oxic secondary effluent process performed each month from sept 2018 to aug 2019 it could be noticed that the level of influent doc was comparatively stable at 16 6 2 6 mg l after the anaerobic process doc decreased to 11 7 2 7 mg l demonstrating the important role of the anaerobic tank in doc reduction slight further reduction of doc was observed during the anoxic oxic and secondary sedimentation processes the statistical data collected during each season were analyzed and similar results were identified fig 1 b in general the results showed that the anaerobic process played a key role 28 9 reduction on average in doc removal in all seasons while the anoxic and oxic processes showed a lesser effect on doc elimination 2 0 and 5 1 reduction on average respectively based on the statistical data collected during different seasons it was further noticed that doc concentration during the a2o processes fluctuated more in summer and winter than in autumn and spring standard deviation in winter and summer was 2 9 and 3 5 mg l respectively and in autumn and spring was 1 2 and 0 7 mg l respectively suggesting that the colder and warmer seasons resulted in lower 16 5 c and higher 25 8 c water temperatures fig 1 shaded area detailed information is listed in s tab 3 could affect the stability of doc removal during the biological treatment processes fig 2 shows the change in the nh4 n level during the different treatment processes in a year results of monthly variation fig 2 a showed that the influent nh4 n level periodically varied every three months in a year it was higher in winter and summer 27 9 5 4 mg l than in autumn and spring 15 3 2 6 mg l for the removal of nh4 n it was found that the concentration of nh4 n decreased to 4 0 1 4 mg l after anoxic process however the reduction was unstable during the anaerobic process with minimum removal at 34 4 in november and maximum removal at 79 7 in december based on seasonal variation fig 2 b it was observed that the fluctuation of nh4 n level during each process was more moderate in autumn and spring than in winter and summer indicating that higher and lower temperatures affected the efficiency of nh4 n removal by the microorganisms as shown in s fig 2 no clear pattern of variation of the tp level during the a2o processes was observed the efficiency of the processes in removing tp varied more vigorously than that of the processes in removing nh4 n 3 2 variation of the molecular weight distribution of the efom fractions fig 3 shows the variation of the relative reduction or increment in efom during the biological processes the fractioned efom here represented the content of measurable components after sec separation and quantification using ocd accounting for the hydrophilic organics it was found that the anaerobic process played a key role in the removal of efom with average reduction at 25 6 the anoxic process was more likely to generate efom than remove it especially in winter and summer this result accounted for the lower hydrophobicity of efom in winter and summer s tab 4 indicating that lower and higher temperatures caused variation of the hydrophobicity of efom zietzschmann et al 2014 reduction in efom during the oxic process fluctuated from 2 4 to 16 8 interestingly the total removal of efom by the anaerobic and oxic processes in autumn and spring was stable at 33 2 4 4 however the anaerobic process removed more efom than the oxic process in autumn while this situation was reversed in spring in winter and summer significant fluctuation of the performance of efom removal during all three biological processes was observed and this variation was consistent with that of doc removal as shown in fig 1 a significant increment in efom during the anoxic process was identified in summer suggesting that temperature affected the metabolism of the microorganisms in sludge to understand the reduction or increment of the efom fractions during the anaerobic anoxic and oxic processes in detail the variation of fractioned efom was quantified and the result is presented in fig 4 data on monthly variation fig 4 a showed that efom reduction occurred during the anaerobic process while its increment occurred during the anoxic process especially in winter and summer a further discussion on the co effects of temperature and the microbial community structure on the seasonal variation of efom would be presented later sections 3 4 and 3 5 to provide more practical information in revealing the intrinsic reasons on this basis an analysis over average seasonal reduction or increment in the efom fractions could be meaningful and significant as shown in fig 4 b higher reduction of efom occurred during the anaerobic process mainly due to the removal of building blocks and lmw neutrals a significant amount of humic substances was also removed during the anaerobic process in autumn while these organics were generated during the anaerobic process in winter the anaerobic process also played a key role in the removal of biopolymers 3 4 on average more efom was generated than removed during the anoxic process in winter and summer and this was consistent with the results shown in figs 3 and 4 a the increment of efom during this process occurred due to the generation of lmw neutrals in winter and humic substances in summer in autumn and spring the amounts of removed and generated efom during the anoxic process were nearly equivalent resulting in no change in the efom level though the variation of efom during the oxic process in different months was similar fig 3 differences in the efom fractions could be observed the oxic process mainly showed removal of humic substances and lmw neutrals in autumn and lmw neutrals and building blocks in winter lmw neutrals building blocks and humic substances were removed to a similar extent in spring while more humic substances were removed in summer 3 3 variation of fluorescent components of efom with the parafac analysis five fluorescent components were divided from all the samples measured using feems fig 5 and table 2 and they were identified as fulvic acid like compounds c1 humic or fulvic acid like compounds c2 large molecular sized hydrophobic humic like compounds c3 aromatic proteins c4 and tryptophan and protein like soluble microbial by product like compounds c5 based on previous literatures it could be noticed that c1 c2 and c3 were humic related substances while c4 and c5 were protein related substances fig 6 shows the variation of these five components during the different treatment processes in different seasons below and the treatment efficiency of the corresponding a2o processes above the humic related substances c1 c2 and c3 showed stronger fluorescence response than the protein related substances c4 and c5 the contents evaluated by fmax of c1 and c2 were comparatively stable irrespective of change in season or treatment procedure this did not correspond to the decrement in humic substances and building blocks during the a2o processes as shown in fig 4 this phenomenon might account for the quenching effect caused by metal ions in the wastewater yamashita and jaffé 2008 since the metal ions were removed during the treatment the diminished quenching effect causing an increment in fmax was counterbalanced by the effect of organic removal causing a decrement in fmax leading to minimal change in the fmax values of c1 and c2 variation of fmax of c3 in winter confirmed such a quenching effect because even though it was not generated during the anoxic process fig 4 the fmax was increased the contents of c3 c4 and c5 especially those of the protein related substances fluctuated more in different seasons and during different treatment processes as for the treatment efficiency it s observed that almost all the fluorescent components were eliminated during the anaerobic process confirming the importance of the anaerobic process in the removal of efom figs 3 and 4 especially for the protein related substances the anaerobic process caused 22 4 4 6 reduction in the c4 content and 27 7 5 7 reduction in the c5 content the anoxic process had less effect on the c1 and c2 contents but caused generation of c3 and c4 in winter and summer supporting that c3 and c4 might be related to lmw neutrals and humic substances as shown in fig 4 this also indicated that temperature could affect the degradation or generation of humic related substances c3 and protein related substances c4 during the anoxic process the oxic process caused the removal of c3 15 1 2 3 and c4 9 2 0 5 in winter and summer however the elimination effect on c1 c2 and c5 during the oxic process was limited 2 6 on average 3 4 seasonal variation of the microbial community structure to determine the possible explanations for the variation of efom during the a2o processes in different seasons we analyzed the microbiological properties of the monthly collected activated sludge samples the total number of observed species in different seasons or treatment tanks did not vary much s tab 5 however s fig 3 shows that at the phylum level in the microbial community structure proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the absolute dominants gamma beta and alpha proteobacteria were the three most dominant classes of the proteobacteria phylum accounting for 21 52 of the top 10 identified classes fig 7 this result was in agreement with those of previous studies wang and zhang 2010b at the class level no significant difference was found in the community structures during the anaerobic anoxic and oxic processes but seasonal variation of the structure was obvious from autumn to spring the aggregated contribution of gamma beta and alpha proteobacteria particularly gamma proteobacteria showed an increasing trend from 35 2 to 48 4 however in summer the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased drastically to 27 5 anaerolineae appeared as a major class and the difference in the structures during the anaerobic and anoxic oxic processes was greater than in any other season these findings indicated that higher in summer temperatures influenced the microbial community structure more than lower in winter or mild in autumn and spring temperatures the differences in the microbial structure implied that apart from temperature the constitution of the dominants could cause variance in the removal or generation of efom during the a2o processes figs 4 and 6 a detailed discussion on the effects of temperature and microorganisms was presented later in section 3 5 turn to the alpha diversity of the microbial community fig 8 a shows that the community diversity represented by the shannon index in spring and summer was lower than that in autumn and winter the shannon index of microbial community of anaerobic process varied significantly in spring from 6 5 to 8 5 and summer from 6 0 to 8 2 indicating the seasonal variation of the microbial community structure during the same process this finding might be associated with the unique relative abundance of the top 10 classes in the microbial structure during the anaerobic process in spring and summer fig 7 as for the community richness represented by the chao1 index fig 8 b it s found that was the highest in autumn on average 2212 in autumn and 1810 in winter spring and summer the chao1 index of the anoxic process was higher in value than that of the anaerobic and oxic processes in autumn and spring autumn 2100 in the anaerobic tank 2400 in the anoxic tank 2140 in the oxic tank spring 1770 in the anaerobic tank 1860 in the anoxic tank 1828 in the oxic tank this situation was reversed in winter and spring these results suggested that efom generation during the anoxic process in winter and spring might be positively correlated with lower community richness it was also noticeable that in summer the chao1 index in summer varied more vigorously than that in other seasons during the same process implying that higher temperatures affected both community diversity and richness and confirming that the impact of temperature is significant and must be addressed to understand the fate of efom 3 5 effects of temperature on the secretion of smp determined using pure bacterial strains since smp are the major contributors to efom it is necessary to determine the effects of temperature on the performance of secretion of smp by the microorganisms in the present work the impact of temperatures varying from 5 c to 35 c based on the statistical data of the influent temperature monitored in a year s tab 5 on the microorganisms isolated from the sludge was investigated fig 9 shows that the synthetic wastewater was composed of lmw acids 25 8 mg c l lmw neutrals 0 7 mg c l and building blocks 0 7 mg c l and this composition was consistent with its ingredients shown in table 1 therefore it was clear that the larger molecular sized fractions such as the biopolymers and humic substances were generated due to the metabolism of the microorganisms fig 9 a shows that with the increase in temperature biopolymers generated by herbaspirillum sp gradually increased from 0 9 mg c l at 5 c to 2 0 mg c l at 35 c however fewer biopolymers 0 4 mg c l on average were generated by pseudomonas sp at lower temperatures 5 c and 15 c while many biopolymers more than nine times 3 6 mg c l were generated at higher temperatures 25 and 35 c a trigger temperature between 15 c and 25 c encouraging the pseudomonas sp to generate biopolymers might exist when these two strains were mixed together the amount of biopolymers gradually increased with the increment in temperature a similar phenomenon was observed when other smp fractions were investigated herbaspirillum sp seemed to consume building blocks and humic substances fig 9 a below while pseudomonas sp generated them herbaspirillum sp reduced the building blocks from 46 8 to 65 5 and generated humic substances 0 1 mg c l at lower temperatures compared to 25 c however at 35 c the removal effect was reduced to only 8 1 while humic substances were increased to 0 2 mg c l pseudomonas sp generated more building blocks 2 6 1 0 mg c l than humic substances 1 1 0 3 mg c l at temperatures lower than 25 c while this situation was reversed at 35 c the effect of the mixed strains was likely to be a compromise of the effects caused by these two strains separately the concentration of humic related substances increased with the increment in temperature but the extent of increase from 1 4 mg c l to 1 9 mg c l seemed to be a compromised effect of the mixture of herbaspirillum sp and pseudomonas sp as for the lmw neutrals and acids it s noticeable that herbaspirillum sp significantly removed lmw substances 88 3 0 9 at all tested temperatures as shown in fig 9 b this result suggested that herbaspirillum sp beta proteobacteria played an important role in the removal of uaps during the wastewater treatment processes in comparison pseudomonas sp utilized lesser lmw acids and generated more lmw neutrals especially at lower temperatures 5 c and 15 c pseudomonas sp consumed only 81 3 of lmw acids herbaspirillum sp consumed nearly 100 but generated 9 4 mg c l of lmw neutrals herbaspirillum sp generated 3 5 mg c l when these two strains were mixed together the overall effect was that the generation of lwm substances increased with the increase in temperature in general when the two pure strains were mixed the overall effect was that all five fractions of smp increased with the increase in temperature this result confirmed that higher temperatures stimulated smp generation however this was not consistent with the results of actual observation of increment in efom during the anoxic process not only in summer but also in winter fig 4 this could partly be attributed to the lower efficiency of the biological treatment at lower temperatures gao et al 2014 langenhoff and stuckey 2000 in addition the limited pure strains used in this study might not be strongly indicative of the entire microbial system therefore a more comprehensive study considering more bacterial strains must be conducted 3 6 setp mechanism the above findings indicated that temperature and proteobacteria influenced the seasonal variation of efom during the a2o processes greatly and this was re confirmed by the results of the correlation coefficient shown in s tab 6 the potential mechanism based on the correlation of temperature and proteobacteria with the variation of efom fig 10 temperature and proteobacteria abundance are the two variables and the level of increment or decrement in efom is represented by color was presented as the setp mechanism which suggested that the anaerobic process caused more reduction in efom than the other two processes mild temperature and moderate proteobacteria abundance during this process resulted in greater removal of efom during the anoxic process higher temperature and lower relative abundance of proteobacteria or lower temperature and higher relative abundance of proteobacteria increased the efom content temperature influenced the variation of efom more than the relative abundance of proteobacteria interestingly the removal efficiency of the oxic process was not affected by these two variables much 4 conclusions the fate of efom during the a2o processes was evaluated by continuous measurement and analysis of the dynamics of the different molecular sized fractions and fluorescent components of efom for 12 months seasonal variation of microbial community structure and effects of temperature on the dominant pure strains isolated from the activated sludge in the a2o tanks were investigated one possible mechanism based on the co action of temperature and proteobacteria described as setp was suggested to understand the seasonal variation of efom main findings of this study were 1 the anaerobic process played a key role in the reduction in efom by causing removal of the building blocks lmw neutrals biopolymers and protein related substances c4 and c5 fluctuation in temperature affected the efficiency of the a2o processes in removing these organics 2 more humic substances lmw neutrals large molecular sized hydrophobic humic like compounds c3 and aromatic proteins c4 were generated than consumed during the anoxic process especially in summer and winter the oxic process caused efom removal in all seasons but with lower efficiency than that of the anaerobic process 3 gamma beta alpha proteobacteria and bacteroidia were the most dominant classes in the community of the activated sludge the community structures in different tanks were similar but varied in different seasons 4 the mixed pure strains herbaspirillum sp and pseudomonas sp generated more smp and encouraged the secretion of biopolymers building blocks and lmw neutrals at higher temperatures 5 setp mechanism indicated that the generation of efom during the anoxic process was positively correlated to the relative abundance of proteobacteria and the increment in temperature and higher temperature influenced variation of efom more than the abundance of

17907,here we studied seasonal variation of effluent organic matter efom based on molecular weight distribution and fluorescent components during the traditional anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o wastewater treatment processes microbial community structure and effect of temperature on some isolated pure strains were analyzed to explain the related mechanism results showed that the anaerobic process played a key role in efom removal by removing building blocks low molecular weight lmw neutrals biopolymers and protein related substances c4 and c5 thus determining the fate of efom during the a2o processes on the other hand humic substances lmw neutrals large molecular sized hydrophobic humic like compounds c3 and aromatic proteins c4 were generated during the anoxic process in summer and winter proteobacteria gamma beta and alpha proteobacteria and bacteroidetes constituted over 50 of the sludge community temperature was found to be positively correlated with the generation of soluble microbial products smp based on the performance of the mixture of isolated herbaspirillum sp beta proteobacteria and pseudomonas sp gamma proteobacteria through comprehensive analysis of the co action of proteobacteria and temperature we proposed the synergetic effect of temperature and proteobacteria as a possible mechanism of the seasonal variation of efom these findings are important for understanding the fate of efom during the wastewater treatment processes and therefore be helpful for better efom control graphical abstract image 1 keywords effluent organic matter soluble microbial products temperature fluorescent components proteobacteria 1 introduction effluent organic matter efom is the organic matter present in the effluent after each step of the wastewater treatment processes comprising soluble microbial products smp natural organic matter nom trace synthetic organic components and their intermediates chen et al 2017 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 michael kordatou et al 2015 o connor et al 2019 quantitatively efom was largely affected by the smp produced by activated sludge the quality and quantity of the mixture could represent affect the performance of the wastewater treatment systems aquino et al 2009 liang et al 2007 wang and zhang 2010a and or tertiary treatment processes bingjie and hanqing 2012 lei et al 2007 xie et al 2019 different fractions of efom require varied amounts of attention in the subsequent treatment processes for instance the large molecular fractions biopolymers made up mostly by macro polysaccharide like and protein like molecules greatly influence the effluent filterability during ultrafiltration zheng et al 2009 2010a 2014 and therefore they must be addressed in the tertiary membrane filtration process zhou et al 2017 the smaller sized components of efom especially those containing organic nitrogen could be the major precursors of nitrogenous disinfection by products dbp chen et al 2009 which limits the utilization of disinfection methods and the toxicity of dbp must be monitored strictly zhang et al 2019 therefore tracking the variation of the different fractions of efom during the treatment processes is necessary to understand the fate of efom better and deliver more efficient and suitable methods to control efom formation this is particularly applicable in the traditional wastewater treatment processes that are predominantly utilized in municipal wastewater treatment gallego schmid and tarpani 2019 piao et al 2016 however to date the variation of efom during the traditional wastewater treatment processes has been rarely investigated meng et al 2011 reported the fate of both biomacromolecules bmm and lmw compounds smaller than 5 kda using membrane bioreactor mbr systems and demonstrated the function of a membrane in separating the different fractions using a sequencing batch reactor sbr ni et al 2010 reported that the utilization associated products uap in efom were utilized by the activated sludge while the biomass associated products bap accumulated in efom suggesting that the fate of bap must be addressed in detail due to their dominant contribution to efom the variation of efom fractions is affected by temperature it was reported that the efom in secondary effluent increased by 10 while its biopolymer content increased by 70 at temperatures below 12 c jacquin et al 2017 our previous study confirmed that the concentration of biopolymers in winter was higher than that in summer zheng et al 2010b while other studies reported the obvious increment in the polysaccharide content under such conditions demonstrating the important effects of temperature van den brink et al 2011 hu et al 2019 identified that the fraction of lmw nitrogenous organics in secondary effluent increased with a decrease in temperature this fraction demonstrated lower bio stability which might lead to a negative impact on the water bodies that received the effluent these findings indicated that temperature affected the variation of different fractions of efom thus understanding the effects of temperature on the fate of efom to investigate the variation of efom in frequent extreme climate conditions is necessary for research walther et al 2002 recently advanced analytical methods have been developed and applied to better quantify and qualify organic complexes in environment and thus to be helpful in understanding the variation of efom huber et al 2010 improved the performance of size exclusion chromatography in combination with organic carbon detection sec ocd to refine the fraction assignation process stedmon et al stedmon and markager 2005 stedmon et al 2003 used fluorescence excitation emission spectroscopy to characterize dissolved organic matter dom and developed the fluorescence excitation emission matrix feem combined with the parallel factor parafac analysis to track the fate of dom in an aquatic environment the combination of such effective tools could provide more detailed information in qualification and quantification of the organic complexes cai and liu 2018 ly et al 2018 in this study we investigated the variation of efom onsite during the a2o wastewater treatment processes for 12 months using the sec ocd and feem parafac methods the seasonal change in the microbial community structure was analyzed the effect of temperature on the secretion of smp was studied using pure strains separated from the activated sludge we aimed to 1 provide a complete report on the fate of efom during the a2o processes 2 present the roles of the a2o processes in the reduction and generation of efom 3 identify the possible connection between the microorganisms microbial community structure in each process and their effects on efom 4 understand the effect of temperature on the reduction or generation of efom by pure strains and 5 propose a synergetic effect of temperature and proteobacteria setp mechanism to explain the fate of efom during the a2o processes 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling of wastewater and activated sludge wastewater samples including the effluent from the primary sedimentation tank described as

measurement of the molecular weight distribution of efom sec ocd sec ocd system model 8 doc labor germany was used to quantify the molecular weight distribution of efom expressed in mg c l for this measurement efom was divided into five fractions including biopolymers 20 kda humic substances 1 kda building blocks 0 3 0 5 kda lmw neutrals and lmw acids 0 35 kda based on the molecular size huber et al 2010 according to the manufacturer building blocks were used to reflect lmw humic like substances huber et al 2010 and therefore in this study building blocks and humic substances were described as humic related substances for the convenience of discussion similarly lmw neutrals and lmw acids were described as lwm substances the relative reduction or increment in the efom fractions during the a2o processes was calculated using the following equations for the anaerobic process eq 1 r e d u c t i o n o r i n c r e m e n t o f e f o m c s 1 c s 2 c s 1 100 for the anoxic process eq 2 r e d u

represent the concentrations of efom or certain fractions of efom in s1 s2 s3 and s4 respectively 2 4 measurements of feem and parafac analysis prior to the measurement of feem wastewater samples were diluted with deionized di water to minimize the inner filtering effects kothawala et al 2013 ohno 2002 and ph was adjusted to about 7 0 coble et al 2014 yu et al 2015 feem was then measured with a spectrofluorometer fluoromax 4 horiba scientific japan which used a xenon lamp as the excitation source during the scanning the excitation wavelength was set from 200 nm to 400 nm with 2 nm intervals while the emission wavelength was set from 290 nm to 550 nm with 4 nm intervals the slits for both excitation and emission were adjusted at 5 nm feem of di water was measured each time and feems of the wastewater samples were deducted from it to remove the raman scatter peaks yu et al 2015 parafac analysis was conducted with a toolbox domfluor v 1 7 colin a stedmon and rasmus bro denmark in

and residual analyses were applied to validate the model and identified components the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax was used to evaluate the relative contents of the identified components the peaks of their emission and excitation loadings were used to identify their characteristics in comparison with those of previous literatures chen et al 2003 henderson et al 2009 ishii and boyer 2012 murphy et al 2011 the relative reduction or increment in the efom fluorescent components during the a2o processes was calculated using the following equations for the anaerobic process eq 4 r e d u c

threshold set at 0 8 1 0 to obtain their information at different taxonomic levels the alpha diversity indexes including the chao1 ace shannon and simpson indexes were analyzed using the qiime v1 9 1 caporaso et al 2010 2 6 separation of the pure strains and investigation of the effect of temperature sludge microorganisms were separated using the streak plate method on luria bertani lb agar medium sinopharm co ltd china after 24 h of cultivation single colonies were separated and identified by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing based on the results of the microbial community structures of the sludge samples two pure bacterial strains herbaspirillum sp beta proteobacteria and pseudomonas sp gamma proteobacteria were selected for further analysis because they belong to the two dominant classes in the sludge community these two pure strains were cultivated using the media recommended by the china center of industrial cultivation collection pre experiments were performed to determine the appropriate number of cultivation hours and the number of cultivation hours was decided as 24 h for both strains based on the bacterial density when the corresponding od600 value was about 1 6 the strains were cultivated in conical flasks with the liquid medium 100 ml which had been sterilized at 121 c for 30 min and cooled in a shaker qyc 200 cimo medical instrument china at 180 rpm at 28 c for 24 h the cells were then harvested in sterile centrifuge tubes corning us by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 3 min and washed with phosphate buffered saline pbs ingredients of pbs included 8 g l nacl 0 2 g l kcl 1 44 g l na2hpo4 and 0 24 g l kh2po4 and ph was adjusted using hcl to around 7 thrice to remove the residual medium three groups of biomass of the pure stains herbaspirillum sp pseudomonas sp and 50 herbaspirillum sp 50 pseudomonas sp were collected in three sterilized centrifuge tubes then the sterilized synthetic wastewater 50 ml ingredients were selected based on previous literatures ly et al 2018 wang and zhang 2010b xie et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 and details are shown in table 1 was added to each of the centrifuge tubes and mixed well with the microorganisms four sets of pure strain groups 3 4 12 samples were placed under different temperature conditions to evaluate the effect of a series of temperatures on the secretion of smp specifically 5 c and 15 c were the simulated temperatures in two refrigerators yc 300l zhongke meiling cryogenics co ltd china and 25 c and 35 c were the simulated temperatures in two water baths dk 8d shanghai yiheng technical co ltd china after 24 h of cultivation with synthetic wastewater at different temperatures the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant was collected by passing the mixture through a 0 45 μm pes filter membrane jinglong china by comparing the characteristics of the supernatant bacterial strain treated wastewater and original synthetic wastewater using sec ocd we evaluated the role of a specific bacterial strain and the combined effects of different strains under different temperatures three parallels were used for each sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of doc and nutrients during the 12 month monitoring period fig 1 a shows the variation of doc during the influent anaerobic anoxic oxic secondary effluent process performed each month from sept 2018 to aug 2019 it could be noticed that the level of influent doc was comparatively stable at 16 6 2 6 mg l after the anaerobic process doc decreased to 11 7 2 7 mg l demonstrating the important role of the anaerobic tank in doc reduction slight further reduction of doc was observed during the anoxic oxic and secondary sedimentation processes the statistical data collected during each season were analyzed and similar results were identified fig 1 b in general the results showed that the anaerobic process played a key role 28 9 reduction on average in doc removal in all seasons while the anoxic and oxic processes showed a lesser effect on doc elimination 2 0 and 5 1 reduction on average respectively based on the statistical data collected during different seasons it was further noticed that doc concentration during the a2o processes fluctuated more in summer and winter than in autumn and spring standard deviation in winter and summer was 2 9 and 3 5 mg l respectively and in autumn and spring was 1 2 and 0 7 mg l respectively suggesting that the colder and warmer seasons resulted in lower 16 5 c and higher 25 8 c water temperatures fig 1 shaded area detailed information is listed in s tab 3 could affect the stability of doc removal during the biological treatment processes fig 2 shows the change in the nh4 n level during the different treatment processes in a year results of monthly variation fig 2 a showed that the influent nh4 n level periodically varied every three months in a year it was higher in winter and summer 27 9 5 4 mg l than in autumn and spring 15 3 2 6 mg l for the removal of nh4 n it was found that the concentration of nh4 n decreased to 4 0 1 4 mg l after anoxic process however the reduction was unstable during the anaerobic process with minimum removal at 34 4 in november and maximum removal at 79 7 in december based on seasonal variation fig 2 b it was observed that the fluctuation of nh4 n level during each process was more moderate in autumn and spring than in winter and summer indicating that higher and lower temperatures affected the efficiency of nh4 n removal by the microorganisms as shown in s fig 2 no clear pattern of variation of the tp level during the a2o processes was observed the efficiency of the processes in removing tp varied more vigorously than that of the processes in removing nh4 n 3 2 variation of the molecular weight distribution of the efom fractions fig 3 shows the variation of the relative reduction or increment in efom during the biological processes the fractioned efom here represented the content of measurable components after sec separation and quantification using ocd accounting for the hydrophilic organics it was found that the anaerobic process played a key role in the removal of efom with average reduction at 25 6 the anoxic process was more likely to generate efom than remove it especially in winter and summer this result accounted for the lower hydrophobicity of efom in winter and summer s tab 4 indicating that lower and higher temperatures caused variation of the hydrophobicity of efom zietzschmann et al 2014 reduction in efom during the oxic process fluctuated from 2 4 to 16 8 interestingly the total removal of efom by the anaerobic and oxic processes in autumn and spring was stable at 33 2 4 4 however the anaerobic process removed more efom than the oxic process in autumn while this situation was reversed in spring in winter and summer significant fluctuation of the performance of efom removal during all three biological processes was observed and this variation was consistent with that of doc removal as shown in fig 1 a significant increment in efom during the anoxic process was identified in summer suggesting that temperature affected the metabolism of the microorganisms in sludge to understand the reduction or increment of the efom fractions during the anaerobic anoxic and oxic processes in detail the variation of fractioned efom was quantified and the result is presented in fig 4 data on monthly variation fig 4 a showed that efom reduction occurred during the anaerobic process while its increment occurred during the anoxic process especially in winter and summer a further discussion on the co effects of temperature and the microbial community structure on the seasonal variation of efom would be presented later sections 3 4 and 3 5 to provide more practical information in revealing the intrinsic reasons on this basis an analysis over average seasonal reduction or increment in the efom fractions could be meaningful and significant as shown in fig 4 b higher reduction of efom occurred during the anaerobic process mainly due to the removal of building blocks and lmw neutrals a significant amount of humic substances was also removed during the anaerobic process in autumn while these organics were generated during the anaerobic process in winter the anaerobic process also played a key role in the removal of biopolymers 3 4 on average more efom was generated than removed during the anoxic process in winter and summer and this was consistent with the results shown in figs 3 and 4 a the increment of efom during this process occurred due to the generation of lmw neutrals in winter and humic substances in summer in autumn and spring the amounts of removed and generated efom during the anoxic process were nearly equivalent resulting in no change in the efom level though the variation of efom during the oxic process in different months was similar fig 3 differences in the efom fractions could be observed the oxic process mainly showed removal of humic substances and lmw neutrals in autumn and lmw neutrals and building blocks in winter lmw neutrals building blocks and humic substances were removed to a similar extent in spring while more humic substances were removed in summer 3 3 variation of fluorescent components of efom with the parafac analysis five fluorescent components were divided from all the samples measured using feems fig 5 and table 2 and they were identified as fulvic acid like compounds c1 humic or fulvic acid like compounds c2 large molecular sized hydrophobic humic like compounds c3 aromatic proteins c4 and tryptophan and protein like soluble microbial by product like compounds c5 based on previous literatures it could be noticed that c1 c2 and c3 were humic related substances while c4 and c5 were protein related substances fig 6 shows the variation of these five components during the different treatment processes in different seasons below and the treatment efficiency of the corresponding a2o processes above the humic related substances c1 c2 and c3 showed stronger fluorescence response than the protein related substances c4 and c5 the contents evaluated by fmax of c1 and c2 were comparatively stable irrespective of change in season or treatment procedure this did not correspond to the decrement in humic substances and building blocks during the a2o processes as shown in fig 4 this phenomenon might account for the quenching effect caused by metal ions in the wastewater yamashita and jaffé 2008 since the metal ions were removed during the treatment the diminished quenching effect causing an increment in fmax was counterbalanced by the effect of organic removal causing a decrement in fmax leading to minimal change in the fmax values of c1 and c2 variation of fmax of c3 in winter confirmed such a quenching effect because even though it was not generated during the anoxic process fig 4 the fmax was increased the contents of c3 c4 and c5 especially those of the protein related substances fluctuated more in different seasons and during different treatment processes as for the treatment efficiency it s observed that almost all the fluorescent components were eliminated during the anaerobic process confirming the importance of the anaerobic process in the removal of efom figs 3 and 4 especially for the protein related substances the anaerobic process caused 22 4 4 6 reduction in the c4 content and 27 7 5 7 reduction in the c5 content the anoxic process had less effect on the c1 and c2 contents but caused generation of c3 and c4 in winter and summer supporting that c3 and c4 might be related to lmw neutrals and humic substances as shown in fig 4 this also indicated that temperature could affect the degradation or generation of humic related substances c3 and protein related substances c4 during the anoxic process the oxic process caused the removal of c3 15 1 2 3 and c4 9 2 0 5 in winter and summer however the elimination effect on c1 c2 and c5 during the oxic process was limited 2 6 on average 3 4 seasonal variation of the microbial community structure to determine the possible explanations for the variation of efom during the a2o processes in different seasons we analyzed the microbiological properties of the monthly collected activated sludge samples the total number of observed species in different seasons or treatment tanks did not vary much s tab 5 however s fig 3 shows that at the phylum level in the microbial community structure proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the absolute dominants gamma beta and alpha proteobacteria were the three most dominant classes of the proteobacteria phylum accounting for 21 52 of the top 10 identified classes fig 7 this result was in agreement with those of previous studies wang and zhang 2010b at the class level no significant difference was found in the community structures during the anaerobic anoxic and oxic processes but seasonal variation of the structure was obvious from autumn to spring the aggregated contribution of gamma beta and alpha proteobacteria particularly gamma proteobacteria showed an increasing trend from 35 2 to 48 4 however in summer the relative abundance of proteobacteria decreased drastically to 27 5 anaerolineae appeared as a major class and the difference in the structures during the anaerobic and anoxic oxic processes was greater than in any other season these findings indicated that higher in summer temperatures influenced the microbial community structure more than lower in winter or mild in autumn and spring temperatures the differences in the microbial structure implied that apart from temperature the constitution of the dominants could cause variance in the removal or generation of efom during the a2o processes figs 4 and 6 a detailed discussion on the effects of temperature and microorganisms was presented later in section 3 5 turn to the alpha diversity of the microbial community fig 8 a shows that the community diversity represented by the shannon index in spring and summer was lower than that in autumn and winter the shannon index of microbial community of anaerobic process varied significantly in spring from 6 5 to 8 5 and summer from 6 0 to 8 2 indicating the seasonal variation of the microbial community structure during the same process this finding might be associated with the unique relative abundance of the top 10 classes in the microbial structure during the anaerobic process in spring and summer fig 7 as for the community richness represented by the chao1 index fig 8 b it s found that was the highest in autumn on average 2212 in autumn and 1810 in winter spring and summer the chao1 index of the anoxic process was higher in value than that of the anaerobic and oxic processes in autumn and spring autumn 2100 in the anaerobic tank 2400 in the anoxic tank 2140 in the oxic tank spring 1770 in the anaerobic tank 1860 in the anoxic tank 1828 in the oxic tank this situation was reversed in winter and spring these results suggested that efom generation during the anoxic process in winter and spring might be positively correlated with lower community richness it was also noticeable that in summer the chao1 index in summer varied more vigorously than that in other seasons during the same process implying that higher temperatures affected both community diversity and richness and confirming that the impact of temperature is significant and must be addressed to understand the fate of efom 3 5 effects of temperature on the secretion of smp determined using pure bacterial strains since smp are the major contributors to efom it is necessary to determine the effects of temperature on the performance of secretion of smp by the microorganisms in the present work the impact of temperatures varying from 5 c to 35 c based on the statistical data of the influent temperature monitored in a year s tab 5 on the microorganisms isolated from the sludge was investigated fig 9 shows that the synthetic wastewater was composed of lmw acids 25 8 mg c l lmw neutrals 0 7 mg c l and building blocks 0 7 mg c l and this composition was consistent with its ingredients shown in table 1 therefore it was clear that the larger molecular sized fractions such as the biopolymers and humic substances were generated due to the metabolism of the microorganisms fig 9 a shows that with the increase in temperature biopolymers generated by herbaspirillum sp gradually increased from 0 9 mg c l at 5 c to 2 0 mg c l at 35 c however fewer biopolymers 0 4 mg c l on average were generated by pseudomonas sp at lower temperatures 5 c and 15 c while many biopolymers more than nine times 3 6 mg c l were generated at higher temperatures 25 and 35 c a trigger temperature between 15 c and 25 c encouraging the pseudomonas sp to generate biopolymers might exist when these two strains were mixed together the amount of biopolymers gradually increased with the increment in temperature a similar phenomenon was observed when other smp fractions were investigated herbaspirillum sp seemed to consume building blocks and humic substances fig 9 a below while pseudomonas sp generated them herbaspirillum sp reduced the building blocks from 46 8 to 65 5 and generated humic substances 0 1 mg c l at lower temperatures compared to 25 c however at 35 c the removal effect was reduced to only 8 1 while humic substances were increased to 0 2 mg c l pseudomonas sp generated more building blocks 2 6 1 0 mg c l than humic substances 1 1 0 3 mg c l at temperatures lower than 25 c while this situation was reversed at 35 c the effect of the mixed strains was likely to be a compromise of the effects caused by these two strains separately the concentration of humic related substances increased with the increment in temperature but the extent of increase from 1 4 mg c l to 1 9 mg c l seemed to be a compromised effect of the mixture of herbaspirillum sp and pseudomonas sp as for the lmw neutrals and acids it s noticeable that herbaspirillum sp significantly removed lmw substances 88 3 0 9 at all tested temperatures as shown in fig 9 b this result suggested that herbaspirillum sp beta proteobacteria played an important role in the removal of uaps during the wastewater treatment processes in comparison pseudomonas sp utilized lesser lmw acids and generated more lmw neutrals especially at lower temperatures 5 c and 15 c pseudomonas sp consumed only 81 3 of lmw acids herbaspirillum sp consumed nearly 100 but generated 9 4 mg c l of lmw neutrals herbaspirillum sp generated 3 5 mg c l when these two strains were mixed together the overall effect was that the generation of lwm substances increased with the increase in temperature in general when the two pure strains were mixed the overall effect was that all five fractions of smp increased with the increase in temperature this result confirmed that higher temperatures stimulated smp generation however this was not consistent with the results of actual observation of increment in efom during the anoxic process not only in summer but also in winter fig 4 this could partly be attributed to the lower efficiency of the biological treatment at lower temperatures gao et al 2014 langenhoff and stuckey 2000 in addition the limited pure strains used in this study might not be strongly indicative of the entire microbial system therefore a more comprehensive study considering more bacterial strains must be conducted 3 6 setp mechanism the above findings indicated that temperature and proteobacteria influenced the seasonal variation of efom during the a2o processes greatly and this was re confirmed by the results of the correlation coefficient shown in s tab 6 the potential mechanism based on the correlation of temperature and proteobacteria with the variation of efom fig 10 temperature and proteobacteria abundance are the two variables and the level of increment or decrement in efom is represented by color was presented as the setp mechanism which suggested that the anaerobic process caused more reduction in efom than the other two processes mild temperature and moderate proteobacteria abundance during this process resulted in greater removal of efom during the anoxic process higher temperature and lower relative abundance of proteobacteria or lower temperature and higher relative abundance of proteobacteria increased the efom content temperature influenced the variation of efom more than the relative abundance of proteobacteria interestingly the removal efficiency of the oxic process was not affected by these two variables much 4 conclusions the fate of efom during the a2o processes was evaluated by continuous measurement and analysis of the dynamics of the different molecular sized fractions and fluorescent components of efom for 12 months seasonal variation of microbial community structure and effects of temperature on the dominant pure strains isolated from the activated sludge in the a2o tanks were investigated one possible mechanism based on the co action of temperature and proteobacteria described as setp was suggested to understand the seasonal variation of efom main findings of this study were 1 the anaerobic process played a key role in the reduction in efom by causing removal of the building blocks lmw neutrals biopolymers and protein related substances c4 and c5 fluctuation in temperature affected the efficiency of the a2o processes in removing these organics 2 more humic substances lmw neutrals large molecular sized hydrophobic humic like compounds c3 and aromatic proteins c4 were generated than consumed during the anoxic process especially in summer and winter the oxic process caused efom removal in all seasons but with lower efficiency than that of the anaerobic process 3 gamma beta alpha proteobacteria and bacteroidia were the most dominant classes in the community of the activated sludge the community structures in different tanks were similar but varied in different seasons 4 the mixed pure strains herbaspirillum sp and pseudomonas sp generated more smp and encouraged the secretion of biopolymers building blocks and lmw neutrals at higher temperatures 5 setp mechanism indicated that the generation of efom during the anoxic process was positively correlated to the relative abundance of proteobacteria and the increment in temperature and higher temperature influenced variation of efom more than the abundance of

17908,selenium pollution has become an increasingly serious global concern methane fed selenate reduction has proven to be of great interest for the bioremediation of selenate contaminated waters even with the coexistence of nitrate and dissolved oxygen however it is unclear if the common concurrent sulfate anion affects selenate removal to address this question we first introduced selenate seo4 2 as the sole influent electron acceptor in a ch4 fed membrane biofilm reactor ch4 mbfr then we added different concentrations of sulfate so4 2 the initial selenate removal efficiency 90 was decreased by 50 in the presence of 15 6 μm of sulfate and completely inhibited after loading with 171 9 μm of sulfate 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that the selenate reducing bacteria decreased after the addition of sulfate metagenomic sequencing showed that the abundance of genes encoding molybdenum mo dependent selenate reductase reduced by 50 when exposed to high concentrations of sulfate furthermore the decrease in the total genes encoding all mo oxidoreductases was much greater than that of the genes encoding molybdate transporters suggesting that the inhibition of selenate reduction by sulfate was most likely via the direct competition with molybdate for the transport system leading to a lack of available mo for mo dependent selenate reductases and thus reducing their activities this result was confirmed by a batch test wherein the supplementation of molybdate mitigated the sulfate effect overall this study shed light on the underlying mechanism of sulfate inhibition on selenate reduction and laid the foundation for applying the technology to practical wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords selenate reduction sulfate competitive inhibition molybdate transport molybdenum dependent selenate reductase 1 introduction selenium se pollution is caused by its excessive release due to both the natural and anthropogenic activities natural processes including weathering and leaching of seleniferous rocks lead to low concentrations of selenium ranging from 0 01 to 2 mg kg 1 in most soils and 0 1 100 μg l in water tan et al 2016 comparatively human activities such as metal refinery power generation and electronics manufacturing discharge large amounts of selenium into the environment and can induce severe contamination and thus are considered the major pollutant contributors nancharaiah and lens 2015 although se is a vital trace element for living organisms its range of safe concentrations is typically narrow with recommended and fatal dosages of 55 μg and 5 mg per day for adults boyd 2011 the noxious effects of se overdose support the maximum contaminant level mcl of 50 μg se l for drinking water and 5 μg se l for se laden effluent discharge us epa 2015 santos et al 2015 se can exist as selenate seo4 2 selenite seo3 2 elemental selenium se0 and selenide se2 and the first two are most commonly found form dissolved in wastewaters due to the insolubility of se0 the bioreduction of se oxyanions is an environmentally friendly and cost effective technology for removing selenium contamination many groups of microorganisms can reduce seo4 2 to se0 using organics as the electron donor fujita et al 1997 losi and frankenberger 1997 rech and macy 1992 various proteins including specific selenate reductases e g ser srd ridley et al 2006 schroder et al 1997 and other enzymes such as some variants of nitrate reductases sabaty et al 2001 turner et al 1998 have been identified able to reduce selenate all of them belong to the dimethyl sulfoxide reductase dmsor superfamily requiring molybdenum mo in the form of molybdopterin as their cofactor grimaldi et al 2013 compared to traditional organics inexpensive gaseous hydrogen h2 and methane ch4 can be applied as alternative electron donors for driving selenate reduction without any potentially secondary pollution chung et al 2006 lai et al 2014 2016 recently lai et al 2014 2016 achieved simultaneous selenate and nitrate reduction using h2 or ch4 as the sole electron donor and they found a low concentration of nitrate i e 0 36 mm had minimal effects on selenate reduction in addition to nitrate in most industrial waste streams sulfate so4 2 has been reported to be co present with selenium oxyanions but in concentrations 100 to 1000 fold in excess tan et al 2016 for example the scrubber liquids in flue gas desulfurization contain 6 3 25 3 μm of selenium and 25 5 147 8 mm of sulfate lenz et al 2008 staicu et al 2017 mining impacted wastewaters include a low se concentration of 0 0 2 mm but much higher sulfate content up to 72 mm tan et al 2018b this concomitant anion may enhance or inhibit biological selenate reduction but no consensus of its role has yet been achieved the concurrent high concentration of sulfate e g s se of 2 60 103 or sulfate concentration 1 mm can decrease the selenate removal efficiency probably due to the competition with sulfate as an alternative electron acceptor lenz et al 2008 zehr and oremland 1987 conversely selenate reduction can be enhanced in many cases when sulfate is simultaneously reduced tan et al 2018a 2018b this phenomenon may be explained by the abiotic reactions between selenite reduction product of selenate and sulfide reduction product of sulfate tan et al 2018b or by the evolution of the microbial community ontiveros valencia et al 2016 tan et al 2018c on the other hand since selenate belongs to the same group and is chemically similar with sulfate it is able to inhibit the sulfate metabolic pathway and thus inhibit its reduction hockin and gadd 2006 the partial or complete inhibition of sulfate reduction by the presence of selenate has been observed with ratios of sulfate selenate s se between 1 and 50 chung et al 2006 postgate 1952 zehr and oremland 1987 previously a methane based membrane biofilm reactor ch4 mbfr has been confirmed to be able to efficiently remove selenate contamination in the presence of nitrate or dissolved oxygen do lai et al 2016 shi et al 2019a given the very common coexistence of se and s we first kept the ch4 mbfr at a stable selenate removal efficiency and introduced different concentrations of sulfate i e 15 6 and 171 9 μm to test the sulfate effect on selenate reduction then we performed amplicon and metagenomic sequencing of the biosamples from different stages to investigate the evolution of the community structure and interpret the sulfate effect thus this study elucidates the overlooked influence of coexisting sulfate on selenate reduction and provided insights for treating complex wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbfr operation our previous study tested the effect of different concentrations of do on selenate reduction shi et al 2019a thus in the final stage i e the aerobic stage of that study the influent was not degassed leading to a do concentration at 0 19 0 22 mm this work is the continuation of that study but the influent was degassed first with argon for 30 min after which the do concentration was measured to be 6 25 μm using a do probe starter model 300d ohaus instruments company germany the medium consisting of the same constituents and 12 7 μm of selenate was introduced at a feeding rate of 0 4 ml min hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 7 h until the selenate removal efficiency was steady stage 1 then 15 6 μm of sulfate was added to the influent in stage 2 and 171 9 μm of sulfate was added in stage 3 the ph of the influent was maintained at 7 2 0 2 using 1 m hcl and naoh the effluent ph was measured in the same range using a ph meter seven easy mettlertoledo switzerland throughout the whole experiment the reactor was operated at a temperature of 35 1 c 2 2 chemical analysis we used 10 ml gastight syringes to sample the liquid and immediately filtered the samples using 0 22 μm membranes selenate selenite and sulfate were simultaneously measured by ion chromatography dionex ics 1000 thermofisher scientific with an as 11 column and ag 11 guard column the eluent koh concentration was 15 mm the flow rate was set to 1 ml min perchlorate was measured using ion chromatography

electron spectroscopy biofilm was collected from the fibers by vortexing washing and centrifuging following the protocol described by zhao et al 2011 microbial dna was extracted from a part of

annotated with the ssurrna database in the silva project using the rdp classifier quast et al 2013 wang et al 2007 all the 16s rrna gene sequencing data were deposited into the ncbi national center

dna was used for shotgun metagenomic sequencing 2 150 bp by illumina hiseq x ten approximately 28 29 and 26 paired end reads were generated for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively the low quality bases of the reads were trimmed using trimmomatic version 0 36 with the default parameters bolger et al 2014 after trimming all the reads were assembled with megahit v1 1 1 li et al 2016 the assembled contigs

fibers were fixed with glutaraldehyde at 4 c overnight washed with phosphate buffer and dehydrated using gradient concentrations of ethanol the lyophilized pellets were ready for scanning electron microscope sem for transmission electron microscope tem analysis the biopellets were cut into sections 70 90 nm thick 2 7 activity test in serum bottles and sequencing batch reactor approximately 10 ml of the enriched culture consisting of a similar community structure as the mbfr from a ch4 fed selenate reducing bioreactor shi et al 2019b was inoculated in 60 ml serum bottles with 30 ml of the medium above leading to the volume of the headspace at 20 ml then 10 ml of ch4 was injected into the bottles as the sole electron donor for one group 110 μm of selenate was added as the sole electron acceptor for the other group 110 μm of selenate and sulfate were simultaneously added in the beginning and 1 1 mm of molybdate was then added on day 14 s mo 0 1 both groups were analyzed in triplicate additionally a similar ch4 based batch reactor reported in our previous study was operated to test the sulfate effect on perchlorate reduction lv et al 2019 approximately 400 μm of perchlorate was initially added as the sole electron acceptor and on day 30 3 3 mm of sulfate was added the procedures for sampling and measurement were the same as described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 selenate bioreduction inhibited by sulfate after 20 days of operation the ch4 mbfr achieved a stable selenate removal efficiency of 90 fig 1 selenate reduction was inhibited by 50 after the medium was amended with approximately 15 6 μm of sulfate in stage 2 achieving a s se ratio of 1 25 selenate reduction was completely inhibited in stage 3 when the concentration of sulfate was increased to 171 9 μm i e s se ratio 13 5 sulfate reduction was not observed selenite concentrations in the effluent were at the limit of detection during the entire experiment suggesting that elemental selenium as the final product of selenate reduction this was confirmed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis of the precipitates fig s1 in which only the obvious peak of elemental selenium was detected sulfate reduction inhibited by its chemical homologue selenate has been reported in both pure culture and mixed communities there are two possible explanations 1 selenate at a certain concentration can be toxic to sulfate respiring bacteria srb such as through the depletion of adenosine triphosphate lenz et al 2008 taylor and oremland 1979 which is defined as noncompetitive inhibition and 2 selenate can outcompete sulfate for utilization given the thermodynamically favorable gibbs free energy of selenate reduction milucka et al 2012 shi et al 2019a which is defined as competitive inhibition chung et al 2006 in this case selenate reduction also ceased when the influent sulfate was 171 9 μm making the competitive inhibition of sulfate reduction impossible thus this obervation was more likely due to noncompetitive inhibition because of the se toxicity to srb at the s se ratios of 1 25 stage 2 and 13 5 stage 3 since a much higher value i e s se 5 20 102 has been reported as inhibitory lenz et al 2008 this phenomenon was also observed in the measurement of in situ sulfate and selenate reduction in sediments where sulfate reduction occurred only when selenate dropped to a very low concentration oremland et al 1990 on the other hand selenate reduction was partially stage 2 or completely stage 3 inhibited by the different concentrations of sulfate a s se ratio of 3 00 102 was previously demonstrated to reduce selenate removal efficiency while a higher value of 2 60 103 dramatically impacted selenate reduction probably attributed to the competition for electron donors lenz et al 2008 tan et al 2018b in this study the theoretical ch4 flux was much higher than the actual demand and the concurrent sulfate was not reduced in every stage table s1 indicating a sufficient electron donor and unlikely for sulfate to compete with selenate for electron donors additionally selenate might be reduced by a completely sulfate independent respiration oremland et al 1989 thus the apparent inhibition of selenate reduction by sulfate needed to be further supported by the development of the community structure and microbial genes in the following sections 3 2 shift of microbial communities in response to sulfate to reveal the microbial community response to the added sulfate 16s rrna gene based sequencing was performed on the biosamples from the end of stages 1 2 and 3 in general the bacterial diversity was not very high as indicated by shannon s and simpson s indexes table s2 it might be because of the long term acclimatization by the consecutive feeding with selenate shi et al 2019a as shown in fig 2 meiothermus and thermomonas increased steadily from stage 1 to stage 3 from 32 2 to 59 2 and 3 8 4 7 respectively suggesting that they could survive the sulfate containing condition even though they were unable to reduce it this result was consistent with previous in situ observations where meiothermus and thermomonas dominated the microbial community at sulfate concentrations of 0 3 0 4 mm rempfert et al 2017 safonov et al 2018 conversely other predominant members including denitratisoma pseudoxanthomonas azospira methylosinus and methylophilus decreased sharply after sulfate addition the first three identified as nitrate or selenate reducers fahrbach et al 2006 hunter et al 2007 meng et al 2015 might perform selenate reduction here the decline of these groups could explain the decreased removal efficiency of selenate when introducing sulfate the last two bacteria are methanotrophic or methylotrophic bacteria jenkins et al 1987 stein et al 2010 and 171 9 μm of sulfate should not be directly toxic to them as ch4 oxidation could couple with sulfate reduction to enhance their growth lv et al 2018 the decrease in these two members was more likely explained by the inhibition of selenate reduction which indirectly decreased the methanotroph activity since selenate was the only active electron acceptor for methane oxidation here 3 3 changes of functional genes in response to sulfate compared to microbial community analysis gene level analysis can provide more information on the sulfate influence and reveal deeper reasons for the declining selenate reduction a total of 22 high quality mags were recovered from the metagenomic sequencing of the same biosamples accounting for 78 of extracted dna sequences table 1 fig s2 we first searched possible selenate reductases against all the assembled genes based on the kegg database table s3 bebien et al 2002 guymer et al 2009 sabaty et al 2001 schroder et al 1997 turner et al 1998 and then constructed a phylogenetic tree belonging to the dmsor family to further evaluate their roles since the identified selenate reductases contain a molybdopterin cofactor fig 3 a it was obvious that some proteins annotated as selenate chlorate reductase ko number k17050 such as bin16 mix 158 119 were indeed more like respiratory nitrate reductases this clade together with that belonging to the unknown function subfamily did not cluster with any confirmed selenate reductases in red font in fig 3a bebien et al 2002 kuroda et al 2011 schroder et al 1997 theisen and yee 2014 and were thus excluded for selenate reduction in contrast four proteins recovered from bin13 bin27 bin48 bin83 and one from bin13 located most closely to those validated selenate reducing enzymes indicating that they probably had a similar function and thus were very likely responsible for selenate reduction in our experiment grouped in gray and blue shade in fig 3a these proteins of interest belonged to periplasmic nitrate reductase and dmsor subfamilies encoded by genes napa and ynfe respectively fig 3b and 3c the napa encoding protein always regarded as nitrate reductase can also catalyze selenate reduction in some bacteria sabaty et al 2001 turner et al 1998 the gene product of ynfe was a mo binding protein which is able to reduce selenate in the absence of oxygen theisen and yee 2014 this result together with the close phylogeny supported the notion that the clustered proteins were highly correlated to selenate reduction considering that 1 the mo dependent enzymes in dmsor family always contribute to bioenergetics grimaldi et al 2013 and 2 diverse bacteria can respire selenate losi and frankenberger 1997 rech and macy 1992 it was very conceivable that the selenate reduction here could also occur via a respiratory pathway after introducing sulfate the abundances of both total napa and those belonging to bin13 bin27 and bin48 decreased by 50 fig 3b suggesting that the growth of this gene was inhibited by sulfate among the recovered mags only bin13 had ynfe occupying the major portion of total ynfe between 65 and 90 in all the stages fig 3c the tpm values of total ynfe and this gene in bin13 decreased remarkably from 37 2 to 33 2 to 15 8 and 10 4 respectively upon the addition of sulfate implying that sulfate also had a negative effect on its production these dramatic decreases in the genes encoding selenate reductases including both napa and ynfe could explain why apparent selenate reduction decreased or even ceased at the end of stage 3 in addition sulfate adenylyltransferase encoded by sat the enzyme involved in the first step was used as an indicator to inspect the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway ruckert 2016 in addition to bin13 only three low abundant mags i e bin68 bin74 and bin84 had the gene coding sat fig s3 the total abundance of sat decreased by 50 implying that this gene could not bear the selenate laden condition even though sulfate was present these results were consistent with no apparent reduction of sulfate in the biofilm overall the changes in functional genes gave more insights into the effects of the added sulfate on selenate reduction 3 4 underlying mechanisms of sulfate inhibition on selenate reduction based on the analysis described above selenate reducers seemed non adaptive to the excess sulfate laden condition inspiring us to directly capture the shift in bacterial shapes in the selenate reducing environment microorganism showed intact shapes and smooth surfaces with no precipitates figs s4a c which was consistent with previous observations shi et al 2019a after the addition of 15 6 μm of sulfate in stage 2 the microorganisms exhibited appearances similar to those in stage 1 figs s4d f implying they did not suffer the sulfate stress when increasing the sulfate concentration to 171 9 μm in stage 3 large amounts of precipitates were induced and deposited on cell surfaces figs s4g i implying that certain microbes underwent severe stress in this condition this result agreed with the complete inhibition of apparent selenate reduction nevertheless some bacteria could benefit from the addition of sulfate though sulfate reduction was not apparent fig 4 shows that genes in some mags were increased from stage 1 3 enriched group while others were decreased during the operation reduced group bin20 bin21 and bin40 were the most enriched as all their genes were located above and distant from the diagonal line indicating their abundance in stage 3 was much higher than that in stage 1 in contrast bin13 bin24 and bin36 were most inhibited because their genes distributed opposite from those in the enriched group we compared the ratios of metabolic pathways between the reduced group represented by bin13 bin24 and bin36 and enriched group represented by bin20 bin21 and bin40 shown in fig 5 the key house keeping metabolisms including carbohydrate amino acid and nucleotide metabolisms accounted for a greater percent in the enriched group than in the reduced group carbohydrate metabolism provides energy for cells amino acid metabolism is not only responsible for protein biosynthesis but also offers precursors for the synthesis of many signaling molecules such as purines and pyrimidines nucleotide metabolism produces building blocks of nucleic acids generally these metabolisms play essential roles in maintaining bacteria physiological activity and thus their distinctions might explain why certain bacteria could weaken the inhibition and maintain active growth after sulfate introduction in addition to key metabolisms the enriched group possessed a higher ratio of membrane transport systems fig 5 delta abundance membrane transport always affects microorganisms in two ways the first way is by conferring stress resistance for example microorganisms can detoxify heavy metals e g as cd cu by pumping them from the cytoplasm as a defense mechanism aguilar barajas et al 2011 the second way is transporting essential substrates such as na and k the dissimilarity of membrane transport systems implied the possible influence of sulfate on substrate transporting given the requirement for molybdenum mo by selenate reductases it was most likely that the transport of molybdate was severely affected by sulfate thus resulting in inhibition of selenate reduction as a structural analog of sulfate molybdate requires abc type transporters for entrance into cells rech et al 1995 sirko et al 1990 notably sulfate can be an alternative substrate for molybdate transporters sirko et al 1990 suggesting the possibility of its competition with molybdate indeed sulfate has been reported to be able to inhibit molybdate transport cole et al 1986 and significant inhibition has been observed at a sulfate to molybdate ratio s mo as low as 2 4 elliott and mortenson 1975 in our medium this ratio ranged from 15 to 150 making it likely that there was competitive inhibition between sulfate and molybdate thus we compared the abundance of both molybdate transporters represented by the gene moda and mo containing oxidoreductase genes before and after the addition of sulfate fig 6 demonstrates that moda slightly decreased by 10 while genes encoding mo containing oxidoreductases significantly decreased by 25 mainly because of a substitution of sulfate for molybdate leading to a lack of available mo inversely the single copy gene rpob an indicator of total bacterial abundance increased during the operation indicating that some bacteria could still maintain their activities these bacteria possess a higher ratio of membrane transport pathways fig 5 and may help to alleviate the deficiency of available mo taken together we proposed a competitive inhibition mechanism that sulfate inhibited the activity of mo dependent selenate reductases via the direct competition with molybdate transport and indirectly inhibited the apparent selenate reduction fig 7 a although selenate reduction always occurs in the periplasm selenate reductase needs to be assembled in the cytoplasm and translocated to the periplasmic space theisen and yee 2014 when only selenate was present could molybdate be taken up by bacteria as a vital co factor and assembled into mo dependent selenate reductases however when sulfate was also present sulfate outcompeted molybdate for transporters leading to a lack of mo for selenate reductase activity and thus an inhibition of selenate reduction this phenomenon was further confirmed by a batch test wherein the supplement of molybdate successfully alleviated the sulfate effect fig 7b a similar culture enriched in the ch4 fed selenate reducing condition shi et al 2019b was inoculated in serum bottles with only selenate or the same concentrations of both selenate and sulfate i e both at 110 μm the addition of sulfate almost completely inhibited selenate reduction as expected two tail t test p 0 001 while selenate could be continuously reduced at an average rate of 4 5 μm day in the absence of sulfate on day 14 1 1 mm of molybdate was supplemented at a ratio of s mo at 0 1 interestingly selenate reduction resumed at a rate comparable with that achieved in the case of no sulfate in the subsequent 24 days two tail t test p 0 292 this result revealed the vital role of molybdenum in selenate reduction and validated the proposed competitive inhibition mechanism by sulfate fig 7 we also added sulfate to perchlorate reduction to explore its effect on other dmsor subfamily proteins within 30 days in a batch reactor perchlorate was reduced from 400 μm to 300 μm with an average rate of 3 3 μm day fig s5 after the addition of 3 0 mm of sulfate on day 30 perchlorate reduction was completely inhibited and no sulfate reduction occurred similar to selenate perchlorate reductase belonging to a subfamily of dmsor requires mo as its catalytic core kengen et al 1999 this effect suggested that sulfate might have a more widespread inhibition on dmsor family proteins than previously recognized conversely chromate reductase does not need mo for its activity including in the form of cytochrome kanmani et al 2012 thus chromate reduction was not fatally repressed as expected in the presence of similar or even higher concentrations of sulfate lv et al 2018 these dissimilarities strongly supported the proposed mechanism of competitive inhibition of sulfate on molybdate transport fig 7 the reverse effects have also been reported where molybdate inhibited sulfate reduction via the competition for the transport system patidar and tare 2005 the underlying mechanism revealed here provided more fundamental understanding of the competitive transport pathway of coexisting anions 3 5 practical implications selenate pollution has become a global issue in terms of wastewaters from se laden industries and even more serious when co contaminated with a high concentration of sulfate using a ch4 fed mbfr here we found that sulfate could indirectly inhibit selenate reduction via the direct competition for the transport system with molybdate since selenate reductases required mo as their catalytic core this negative impact illustrates that the pre removal of sulfate from the practical wastewater should be considerable before selenate bio reduction another possible way is to supplement the influent with molybdate at a proper concentration for mitigating the competitive transport by sulfate as indicated in a batch test fig 7b notably possessing a higher ratio of membrane transport pathways fig 5 may help microorganisms to alleviate the deficiency of available mo this may explain why sometimes selenate reduction can still occur though in the presence of sulfate lenz et al 2008 tan et al 2018c 4 conclusions in the present study using a ch4 mbfr we found that the presence of 15 6 μm of sulfate i e at a s se ratio of 1 25 partially inhibited selenate reduction by 50 while 171 9 μm of sulfate i e at a s se ratio of 13 5 completely inhibited selenate reduction with no apparent sulfate reduction the selenate reducing bacteria and genes encoding mo dependent selenate and sulfate reductases both decreased dramatically after sulfate addition however the decrement of the genes encoding molybdate transporters was much less than that of the genes encoding all mo oxidoreductases suggesting that sulfate competed with molybdate for the transport system instead of competing for electron donors leading to a lack of available mo for mo dependent selenate reductase and thus indirectly inhibiting selenate reduction this hypothesis was further confirmed by a batch test where the supplementation of molybdate efficiently mitigated the sulfate effect however bacteria which possess high ratios of key metabolic pathways including carbohydrate amino acid nucleotide metabolisms and membrane transport could alleviate the competitive inhibition of sulfate this observation may explain why the threshold concentration of sulfate inhibition is very different among different microorganisms harboring mo containing proteins overall our study reveals the underlying mechanism of sulfate inhibition on selenate reductase belonging to the dmsor family and increased the understanding of the competition for membrane transporters by concomitant structurally similar

17908,selenium pollution has become an increasingly serious global concern methane fed selenate reduction has proven to be of great interest for the bioremediation of selenate contaminated waters even with the coexistence of nitrate and dissolved oxygen however it is unclear if the common concurrent sulfate anion affects selenate removal to address this question we first introduced selenate seo4 2 as the sole influent electron acceptor in a ch4 fed membrane biofilm reactor ch4 mbfr then we added different concentrations of sulfate so4 2 the initial selenate removal efficiency 90 was decreased by 50 in the presence of 15 6 μm of sulfate and completely inhibited after loading with 171 9 μm of sulfate 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that the selenate reducing bacteria decreased after the addition of sulfate metagenomic sequencing showed that the abundance of genes encoding molybdenum mo dependent selenate reductase reduced by 50 when exposed to high concentrations of sulfate furthermore the decrease in the total genes encoding all mo oxidoreductases was much greater than that of the genes encoding molybdate transporters suggesting that the inhibition of selenate reduction by sulfate was most likely via the direct competition with molybdate for the transport system leading to a lack of available mo for mo dependent selenate reductases and thus reducing their activities this result was confirmed by a batch test wherein the supplementation of molybdate mitigated the sulfate effect overall this study shed light on the underlying mechanism of sulfate inhibition on selenate reduction and laid the foundation for applying the technology to practical wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords selenate reduction sulfate competitive inhibition molybdate transport molybdenum dependent selenate reductase 1 introduction selenium se pollution is caused by its excessive release due to both the natural and anthropogenic activities natural processes including weathering and leaching of seleniferous rocks lead to low concentrations of selenium ranging from 0 01 to 2 mg kg 1 in most soils and 0 1 100 μg l in water tan et al 2016 comparatively human activities such as metal refinery power generation and electronics manufacturing discharge large amounts of selenium into the environment and can induce severe contamination and thus are considered the major pollutant contributors nancharaiah and lens 2015 although se is a vital trace element for living organisms its range of safe concentrations is typically narrow with recommended and fatal dosages of 55 μg and 5 mg per day for adults boyd 2011 the noxious effects of se overdose support the maximum contaminant level mcl of 50 μg se l for drinking water and 5 μg se l for se laden effluent discharge us epa 2015 santos et al 2015 se can exist as selenate seo4 2 selenite seo3 2 elemental selenium se0 and selenide se2 and the first two are most commonly found form dissolved in wastewaters due to the insolubility of se0 the bioreduction of se oxyanions is an environmentally friendly and cost effective technology for removing selenium contamination many groups of microorganisms can reduce seo4 2 to se0 using organics as the electron donor fujita et al 1997 losi and frankenberger 1997 rech and macy 1992 various proteins including specific selenate reductases e g ser srd ridley et al 2006 schroder et al 1997 and other enzymes such as some variants of nitrate reductases sabaty et al 2001 turner et al 1998 have been identified able to reduce selenate all of them belong to the dimethyl sulfoxide reductase dmsor superfamily requiring molybdenum mo in the form of molybdopterin as their cofactor grimaldi et al 2013 compared to traditional organics inexpensive gaseous hydrogen h2 and methane ch4 can be applied as alternative electron donors for driving selenate reduction without any potentially secondary pollution chung et al 2006 lai et al 2014 2016 recently lai et al 2014 2016 achieved simultaneous selenate and nitrate reduction using h2 or ch4 as the sole electron donor and they found a low concentration of nitrate i e 0 36 mm had minimal effects on selenate reduction in addition to nitrate in most industrial waste streams sulfate so4 2 has been reported to be co present with selenium oxyanions but in concentrations 100 to 1000 fold in excess tan et al 2016 for example the scrubber liquids in flue gas desulfurization contain 6 3 25 3 μm of selenium and 25 5 147 8 mm of sulfate lenz et al 2008 staicu et al 2017 mining impacted wastewaters include a low se concentration of 0 0 2 mm but much higher sulfate content up to 72 mm tan et al 2018b this concomitant anion may enhance or inhibit biological selenate reduction but no consensus of its role has yet been achieved the concurrent high concentration of sulfate e g s se of 2 60 103 or sulfate concentration 1 mm can decrease the selenate removal efficiency probably due to the competition with sulfate as an alternative electron acceptor lenz et al 2008 zehr and oremland 1987 conversely selenate reduction can be enhanced in many cases when sulfate is simultaneously reduced tan et al 2018a 2018b this phenomenon may be explained by the abiotic reactions between selenite reduction product of selenate and sulfide reduction product of sulfate tan et al 2018b or by the evolution of the microbial community ontiveros valencia et al 2016 tan et al 2018c on the other hand since selenate belongs to the same group and is chemically similar with sulfate it is able to inhibit the sulfate metabolic pathway and thus inhibit its reduction hockin and gadd 2006 the partial or complete inhibition of sulfate reduction by the presence of selenate has been observed with ratios of sulfate selenate s se between 1 and 50 chung et al 2006 postgate 1952 zehr and oremland 1987 previously a methane based membrane biofilm reactor ch4 mbfr has been confirmed to be able to efficiently remove selenate contamination in the presence of nitrate or dissolved oxygen do lai et al 2016 shi et al 2019a given the very common coexistence of se and s we first kept the ch4 mbfr at a stable selenate removal efficiency and introduced different concentrations of sulfate i e 15 6 and 171 9 μm to test the sulfate effect on selenate reduction then we performed amplicon and metagenomic sequencing of the biosamples from different stages to investigate the evolution of the community structure and interpret the sulfate effect thus this study elucidates the overlooked influence of coexisting sulfate on selenate reduction and provided insights for treating complex wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbfr operation our previous study tested the effect of different concentrations of do on selenate reduction shi et al 2019a thus in the final stage i e the aerobic stage of that study the influent was not degassed leading to a do concentration at 0 19 0 22 mm this work is the continuation of that study but the influent was degassed first with argon for 30 min after which the do concentration was measured to be 6 25 μm using a do probe starter model 300d ohaus instruments company germany the medium consisting of the same constituents and 12 7 μm of selenate was introduced at a feeding rate of 0 4 ml min hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 7 h until the selenate removal efficiency was steady stage 1 then 15 6 μm of sulfate was added to the influent in stage 2 and 171 9 μm of sulfate was added in stage 3 the ph of the influent was maintained at 7 2 0 2 using 1 m hcl and naoh the effluent ph was measured in the same range using a ph meter seven easy mettlertoledo switzerland throughout the whole experiment the reactor was operated at a temperature of 35 1 c 2 2 chemical analysis we used 10 ml gastight syringes to sample the liquid and immediately filtered the samples using 0 22 μm membranes selenate selenite and sulfate were simultaneously measured by ion chromatography dionex ics 1000 thermofisher scientific with an as 11 column and ag 11 guard column the eluent koh concentration was 15 mm the flow rate was set to 1 ml min perchlorate was measured using ion chromatography

electron spectroscopy biofilm was collected from the fibers by vortexing washing and centrifuging following the protocol described by zhao et al 2011 microbial dna was extracted from a part of

dna was used for shotgun metagenomic sequencing 2 150 bp by illumina hiseq x ten approximately 28 29 and 26 paired end reads were generated for stage 1 2 and 3 respectively the low quality bases of the reads were trimmed using trimmomatic version 0 36 with the default parameters bolger et al 2014 after trimming all the reads were assembled with megahit v1 1 1 li et al 2016 the assembled contigs

redundant using the cd hit suite version 4 6 5 huang et al 2010 and the longest coding sequence was left to represent the corresponding catalogue despite the metagenomic sequencing we used a

fibers were fixed with glutaraldehyde at 4 c overnight washed with phosphate buffer and dehydrated using gradient concentrations of ethanol the lyophilized pellets were ready for scanning electron microscope sem for transmission electron microscope tem analysis the biopellets were cut into sections 70 90 nm thick 2 7 activity test in serum bottles and sequencing batch reactor approximately 10 ml of the enriched culture consisting of a similar community structure as the mbfr from a ch4 fed selenate reducing bioreactor shi et al 2019b was inoculated in 60 ml serum bottles with 30 ml of the medium above leading to the volume of the headspace at 20 ml then 10 ml of ch4 was injected into the bottles as the sole electron donor for one group 110 μm of selenate was added as the sole electron acceptor for the other group 110 μm of selenate and sulfate were simultaneously added in the beginning and 1 1 mm of molybdate was then added on day 14 s mo 0 1 both groups were analyzed in triplicate additionally a similar ch4 based batch reactor reported in our previous study was operated to test the sulfate effect on perchlorate reduction lv et al 2019 approximately 400 μm of perchlorate was initially added as the sole electron acceptor and on day 30 3 3 mm of sulfate was added the procedures for sampling and measurement were the same as described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 selenate bioreduction inhibited by sulfate after 20 days of operation the ch4 mbfr achieved a stable selenate removal efficiency of 90 fig 1 selenate reduction was inhibited by 50 after the medium was amended with approximately 15 6 μm of sulfate in stage 2 achieving a s se ratio of 1 25 selenate reduction was completely inhibited in stage 3 when the concentration of sulfate was increased to 171 9 μm i e s se ratio 13 5 sulfate reduction was not observed selenite concentrations in the effluent were at the limit of detection during the entire experiment suggesting that elemental selenium as the final product of selenate reduction this was confirmed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis of the precipitates fig s1 in which only the obvious peak of elemental selenium was detected sulfate reduction inhibited by its chemical homologue selenate has been reported in both pure culture and mixed communities there are two possible explanations 1 selenate at a certain concentration can be toxic to sulfate respiring bacteria srb such as through the depletion of adenosine triphosphate lenz et al 2008 taylor and oremland 1979 which is defined as noncompetitive inhibition and 2 selenate can outcompete sulfate for utilization given the thermodynamically favorable gibbs free energy of selenate reduction milucka et al 2012 shi et al 2019a which is defined as competitive inhibition chung et al 2006 in this case selenate reduction also ceased when the influent sulfate was 171 9 μm making the competitive inhibition of sulfate reduction impossible thus this obervation was more likely due to noncompetitive inhibition because of the se toxicity to srb at the s se ratios of 1 25 stage 2 and 13 5 stage 3 since a much higher value i e s se 5 20 102 has been reported as inhibitory lenz et al 2008 this phenomenon was also observed in the measurement of in situ sulfate and selenate reduction in sediments where sulfate reduction occurred only when selenate dropped to a very low concentration oremland et al 1990 on the other hand selenate reduction was partially stage 2 or completely stage 3 inhibited by the different concentrations of sulfate a s se ratio of 3 00 102 was previously demonstrated to reduce selenate removal efficiency while a higher value of 2 60 103 dramatically impacted selenate reduction probably attributed to the competition for electron donors lenz et al 2008 tan et al 2018b in this study the theoretical ch4 flux was much higher than the actual demand and the concurrent sulfate was not reduced in every stage table s1 indicating a sufficient electron donor and unlikely for sulfate to compete with selenate for electron donors additionally selenate might be reduced by a completely sulfate independent respiration oremland et al 1989 thus the apparent inhibition of selenate reduction by sulfate needed to be further supported by the development of the community structure and microbial genes in the following sections 3 2 shift of microbial communities in response to sulfate to reveal the microbial community response to the added sulfate 16s rrna gene based sequencing was performed on the biosamples from the end of stages 1 2 and 3 in general the bacterial diversity was not very high as indicated by shannon s and simpson s indexes table s2 it might be because of the long term acclimatization by the consecutive feeding with selenate shi et al 2019a as shown in fig 2 meiothermus and thermomonas increased steadily from stage 1 to stage 3 from 32 2 to 59 2 and 3 8 4 7 respectively suggesting that they could survive the sulfate containing condition even though they were unable to reduce it this result was consistent with previous in situ observations where meiothermus and thermomonas dominated the microbial community at sulfate concentrations of 0 3 0 4 mm rempfert et al 2017 safonov et al 2018 conversely other predominant members including denitratisoma pseudoxanthomonas azospira methylosinus and methylophilus decreased sharply after sulfate addition the first three identified as nitrate or selenate reducers fahrbach et al 2006 hunter et al 2007 meng et al 2015 might perform selenate reduction here the decline of these groups could explain the decreased removal efficiency of selenate when introducing sulfate the last two bacteria are methanotrophic or methylotrophic bacteria jenkins et al 1987 stein et al 2010 and 171 9 μm of sulfate should not be directly toxic to them as ch4 oxidation could couple with sulfate reduction to enhance their growth lv et al 2018 the decrease in these two members was more likely explained by the inhibition of selenate reduction which indirectly decreased the methanotroph activity since selenate was the only active electron acceptor for methane oxidation here 3 3 changes of functional genes in response to sulfate compared to microbial community analysis gene level analysis can provide more information on the sulfate influence and reveal deeper reasons for the declining selenate reduction a total of 22 high quality mags were recovered from the metagenomic sequencing of the same biosamples accounting for 78 of extracted dna sequences table 1 fig s2 we first searched possible selenate reductases against all the assembled genes based on the kegg database table s3 bebien et al 2002 guymer et al 2009 sabaty et al 2001 schroder et al 1997 turner et al 1998 and then constructed a phylogenetic tree belonging to the dmsor family to further evaluate their roles since the identified selenate reductases contain a molybdopterin cofactor fig 3 a it was obvious that some proteins annotated as selenate chlorate reductase ko number k17050 such as bin16 mix 158 119 were indeed more like respiratory nitrate reductases this clade together with that belonging to the unknown function subfamily did not cluster with any confirmed selenate reductases in red font in fig 3a bebien et al 2002 kuroda et al 2011 schroder et al 1997 theisen and yee 2014 and were thus excluded for selenate reduction in contrast four proteins recovered from bin13 bin27 bin48 bin83 and one from bin13 located most closely to those validated selenate reducing enzymes indicating that they probably had a similar function and thus were very likely responsible for selenate reduction in our experiment grouped in gray and blue shade in fig 3a these proteins of interest belonged to periplasmic nitrate reductase and dmsor subfamilies encoded by genes napa and ynfe respectively fig 3b and 3c the napa encoding protein always regarded as nitrate reductase can also catalyze selenate reduction in some bacteria sabaty et al 2001 turner et al 1998 the gene product of ynfe was a mo binding protein which is able to reduce selenate in the absence of oxygen theisen and yee 2014 this result together with the close phylogeny supported the notion that the clustered proteins were highly correlated to selenate reduction considering that 1 the mo dependent enzymes in dmsor family always contribute to bioenergetics grimaldi et al 2013 and 2 diverse bacteria can respire selenate losi and frankenberger 1997 rech and macy 1992 it was very conceivable that the selenate reduction here could also occur via a respiratory pathway after introducing sulfate the abundances of both total napa and those belonging to bin13 bin27 and bin48 decreased by 50 fig 3b suggesting that the growth of this gene was inhibited by sulfate among the recovered mags only bin13 had ynfe occupying the major portion of total ynfe between 65 and 90 in all the stages fig 3c the tpm values of total ynfe and this gene in bin13 decreased remarkably from 37 2 to 33 2 to 15 8 and 10 4 respectively upon the addition of sulfate implying that sulfate also had a negative effect on its production these dramatic decreases in the genes encoding selenate reductases including both napa and ynfe could explain why apparent selenate reduction decreased or even ceased at the end of stage 3 in addition sulfate adenylyltransferase encoded by sat the enzyme involved in the first step was used as an indicator to inspect the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway ruckert 2016 in addition to bin13 only three low abundant mags i e bin68 bin74 and bin84 had the gene coding sat fig s3 the total abundance of sat decreased by 50 implying that this gene could not bear the selenate laden condition even though sulfate was present these results were consistent with no apparent reduction of sulfate in the biofilm overall the changes in functional genes gave more insights into the effects of the added sulfate on selenate reduction 3 4 underlying mechanisms of sulfate inhibition on selenate reduction based on the analysis described above selenate reducers seemed non adaptive to the excess sulfate laden condition inspiring us to directly capture the shift in bacterial shapes in the selenate reducing environment microorganism showed intact shapes and smooth surfaces with no precipitates figs s4a c which was consistent with previous observations shi et al 2019a after the addition of 15 6 μm of sulfate in stage 2 the microorganisms exhibited appearances similar to those in stage 1 figs s4d f implying they did not suffer the sulfate stress when increasing the sulfate concentration to 171 9 μm in stage 3 large amounts of precipitates were induced and deposited on cell surfaces figs s4g i implying that certain microbes underwent severe stress in this condition this result agreed with the complete inhibition of apparent selenate reduction nevertheless some bacteria could benefit from the addition of sulfate though sulfate reduction was not apparent fig 4 shows that genes in some mags were increased from stage 1 3 enriched group while others were decreased during the operation reduced group bin20 bin21 and bin40 were the most enriched as all their genes were located above and distant from the diagonal line indicating their abundance in stage 3 was much higher than that in stage 1 in contrast bin13 bin24 and bin36 were most inhibited because their genes distributed opposite from those in the enriched group we compared the ratios of metabolic pathways between the reduced group represented by bin13 bin24 and bin36 and enriched group represented by bin20 bin21 and bin40 shown in fig 5 the key house keeping metabolisms including carbohydrate amino acid and nucleotide metabolisms accounted for a greater percent in the enriched group than in the reduced group carbohydrate metabolism provides energy for cells amino acid metabolism is not only responsible for protein biosynthesis but also offers precursors for the synthesis of many signaling molecules such as purines and pyrimidines nucleotide metabolism produces building blocks of nucleic acids generally these metabolisms play essential roles in maintaining bacteria physiological activity and thus their distinctions might explain why certain bacteria could weaken the inhibition and maintain active growth after sulfate introduction in addition to key metabolisms the enriched group possessed a higher ratio of membrane transport systems fig 5 delta abundance membrane transport always affects microorganisms in two ways the first way is by conferring stress resistance for example microorganisms can detoxify heavy metals e g as cd cu by pumping them from the cytoplasm as a defense mechanism aguilar barajas et al 2011 the second way is transporting essential substrates such as na and k the dissimilarity of membrane transport systems implied the possible influence of sulfate on substrate transporting given the requirement for molybdenum mo by selenate reductases it was most likely that the transport of molybdate was severely affected by sulfate thus resulting in inhibition of selenate reduction as a structural analog of sulfate molybdate requires abc type transporters for entrance into cells rech et al 1995 sirko et al 1990 notably sulfate can be an alternative substrate for molybdate transporters sirko et al 1990 suggesting the possibility of its competition with molybdate indeed sulfate has been reported to be able to inhibit molybdate transport cole et al 1986 and significant inhibition has been observed at a sulfate to molybdate ratio s mo as low as 2 4 elliott and mortenson 1975 in our medium this ratio ranged from 15 to 150 making it likely that there was competitive inhibition between sulfate and molybdate thus we compared the abundance of both molybdate transporters represented by the gene moda and mo containing oxidoreductase genes before and after the addition of sulfate fig 6 demonstrates that moda slightly decreased by 10 while genes encoding mo containing oxidoreductases significantly decreased by 25 mainly because of a substitution of sulfate for molybdate leading to a lack of available mo inversely the single copy gene rpob an indicator of total bacterial abundance increased during the operation indicating that some bacteria could still maintain their activities these bacteria possess a higher ratio of membrane transport pathways fig 5 and may help to alleviate the deficiency of available mo taken together we proposed a competitive inhibition mechanism that sulfate inhibited the activity of mo dependent selenate reductases via the direct competition with molybdate transport and indirectly inhibited the apparent selenate reduction fig 7 a although selenate reduction always occurs in the periplasm selenate reductase needs to be assembled in the cytoplasm and translocated to the periplasmic space theisen and yee 2014 when only selenate was present could molybdate be taken up by bacteria as a vital co factor and assembled into mo dependent selenate reductases however when sulfate was also present sulfate outcompeted molybdate for transporters leading to a lack of mo for selenate reductase activity and thus an inhibition of selenate reduction this phenomenon was further confirmed by a batch test wherein the supplement of molybdate successfully alleviated the sulfate effect fig 7b a similar culture enriched in the ch4 fed selenate reducing condition shi et al 2019b was inoculated in serum bottles with only selenate or the same concentrations of both selenate and sulfate i e both at 110 μm the addition of sulfate almost completely inhibited selenate reduction as expected two tail t test p 0 001 while selenate could be continuously reduced at an average rate of 4 5 μm day in the absence of sulfate on day 14 1 1 mm of molybdate was supplemented at a ratio of s mo at 0 1 interestingly selenate reduction resumed at a rate comparable with that achieved in the case of no sulfate in the subsequent 24 days two tail t test p 0 292 this result revealed the vital role of molybdenum in selenate reduction and validated the proposed competitive inhibition mechanism by sulfate fig 7 we also added sulfate to perchlorate reduction to explore its effect on other dmsor subfamily proteins within 30 days in a batch reactor perchlorate was reduced from 400 μm to 300 μm with an average rate of 3 3 μm day fig s5 after the addition of 3 0 mm of sulfate on day 30 perchlorate reduction was completely inhibited and no sulfate reduction occurred similar to selenate perchlorate reductase belonging to a subfamily of dmsor requires mo as its catalytic core kengen et al 1999 this effect suggested that sulfate might have a more widespread inhibition on dmsor family proteins than previously recognized conversely chromate reductase does not need mo for its activity including in the form of cytochrome kanmani et al 2012 thus chromate reduction was not fatally repressed as expected in the presence of similar or even higher concentrations of sulfate lv et al 2018 these dissimilarities strongly supported the proposed mechanism of competitive inhibition of sulfate on molybdate transport fig 7 the reverse effects have also been reported where molybdate inhibited sulfate reduction via the competition for the transport system patidar and tare 2005 the underlying mechanism revealed here provided more fundamental understanding of the competitive transport pathway of coexisting anions 3 5 practical implications selenate pollution has become a global issue in terms of wastewaters from se laden industries and even more serious when co contaminated with a high concentration of sulfate using a ch4 fed mbfr here we found that sulfate could indirectly inhibit selenate reduction via the direct competition for the transport system with molybdate since selenate reductases required mo as their catalytic core this negative impact illustrates that the pre removal of sulfate from the practical wastewater should be considerable before selenate bio reduction another possible way is to supplement the influent with molybdate at a proper concentration for mitigating the competitive transport by sulfate as indicated in a batch test fig 7b notably possessing a higher ratio of membrane transport pathways fig 5 may help microorganisms to alleviate the deficiency of available mo this may explain why sometimes selenate reduction can still occur though in the presence of sulfate lenz et al 2008 tan et al 2018c 4 conclusions in the present study using a ch4 mbfr we found that the presence of 15 6 μm of sulfate i e at a s se ratio of 1 25 partially inhibited selenate reduction by 50 while 171 9 μm of sulfate i e at a s se ratio of 13 5 completely inhibited selenate reduction with no apparent sulfate reduction the selenate reducing bacteria and genes encoding mo dependent selenate and sulfate reductases both decreased dramatically after sulfate addition however the decrement of the genes encoding molybdate transporters was much less than that of the genes encoding all mo oxidoreductases suggesting that sulfate competed with molybdate for the transport system instead of competing for electron donors leading to a lack of available mo for mo dependent selenate reductase and thus indirectly inhibiting selenate reduction this hypothesis was further confirmed by a batch test where the supplementation of molybdate efficiently mitigated the sulfate effect however bacteria which possess high ratios of key metabolic pathways including carbohydrate amino acid nucleotide metabolisms and membrane transport could alleviate the competitive inhibition of sulfate this observation may explain why the threshold concentration of sulfate inhibition is very different among different microorganisms harboring mo containing proteins overall our study reveals the underlying mechanism of sulfate inhibition on selenate reductase belonging to the dmsor family and increased the understanding of the competition for membrane transporters by concomitant structurally similar

17909,bioactivity and settleability of activated sludge are essential for the operation of activated sludge systems in wastewater treatment in this work the fractal dimension of sludge image is proposed as a tool to evaluate these two factors the specific endogenous respiration rate soure and the specific quasi endogenous respiration rate sourq are found to be more dependent on the 3d structure of sludge than the specific total respiration rate sourt the relationship between the fractal structure and bioactivity suggests that the bioactivity governs the acceptable upper bound of the fractal dimension df as at its theoretical maximum of 2 0 the non porous compact flocs are predominant the settleability or the biomass concentration determines the acceptable lower bound of df as at its theoretical minimum of 1 0 the free swimming microbes are predominant our data reveal that the activated sludge has an acceptable fractal dimension df in a range of 1 07 1 68 in practice the fractal dimension should be controlled at a reasonable value as there is a trade off between the bioactivity and physical structure to achieve better performance a decrease or increase in the fractal dimension can serve as a signal for the change of the operational status and this is further elucidated from the perspective of settling tanks using state point analysis compared with respirogram measurement measuring fractal dimension is a complex process and its online implementation is challenging also the measured value varies with the methods used in addition the difference in their theoretical values depends on the homogeneity of the sludge structure since the fractal dimension df reflects both bioactivity and settleability of the sludge but is difficult to measure in this work a relationship between df and the easily measurable respirogram is established and a method using the respirogram as a proxy of df is proposed to control the bioactivity and settleability simultaneously this respiration based method is able to simultaneously control aeration and settling tanks and could serve as an efficient tool for the management of wastewater treatment plants

growth rate wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction bioactivity and settleability are two important factors reflecting the performance of activated sludge and engineers in wastewater treatment plants wwtps tune their operation according to the variations of these parameters high bioactivity is desired in aeration tanks for efficient removal of pollutants and compact structure is favorable for obtaining excellent separation in settling tanks however the design or the operation of the aeration tanks and settling tanks are based on considerably different types of parameters for example the organic loading rate olr and solids retention time srt are important parameters for aeration tanks xu et al 2018 but they are not directly used for the design and operation of settling tanks the biological parameters such as aeration rate tang et al 2016 srt valigore et al 2012 olr liu and tay 2002 and dissolved oxygen do level li et al 2018a liao et al 2011 have been extensively studied for running aeration tanks to meet effluent standards van de moortel et al 2017 but these studies rarely extended to the subsequent settling tanks the physical settleability is essential for the design and operation of settling tanks the flux theory based state point analysis spa method has been widely used for evaluating settling tanks li and stenstrom 2014a 2014b as it is a convenient visual way to determine the operating conditions of settling tanks and expressed graphically which composed of a settling curve and two operation lines the state point or the operating point of spa is the point where the underflow rate line and the surface overflow rate line intersect the spa graph could be used to judge what occurs in the settling tanks but the key factors affecting spa are determined in the upstream aeration tanks the operational controlling factors for settling tanks e g the settleability which depend on the biological characteristics of the whole system amanatidou et al 2015 jassby et al 2014 patziger et al 2012 affect the sludge concentration of settling tanks and return sludge flow rate therefore a relationship between settling and aeration tanks can be established by the spa method in this sense the word state in state point can be understood as the biological status however frequent actions directly taken for operational tuning or failure recovery of settling tanks are mostly based only on physical or chemical aspects ye et al 2016 though it is possible to simultaneously control the bioactivity and physical structure as the state point in spa is related with aeration and settling tanks one successful example of such a link between settling and aeration tanks is controlling filamentous bacteria using biological approaches to suppress their growth and avoid the deteriorated settleability meunier et al 2016 however direct operation of settling tanks from the biological perspective is rarely reported the settleability of sludge is frequently described by physical properties including particle size fractal dimension and sludge volume index svi fractal dimension is an important parameter of activated sludge representing its physical properties including shape spatial structure self similarity and size distributions fan et al 2017 grijspeerdt and verstraete 1997 jiang and logan 1991 wang et al 2018 and thus offers wide applications fractal dimension can be used to study the settleability of activated sludge which has a negative correlation with svi jin et al 2003 and to predict the settling velocity of flocs chakraborti et al 2000 vahedi and gorczyca 2012 wang and zheng 2017 it can also show the dewatering performance of activated sludge including dewaterability zhang et al 2018a b capillary suction time jin et al 2004 and bound water content turchiuli and fargues 2004 it can also be used to quantify the interfacial interactions between a randomly rough sludge floc and membrane surface zhang et al 2017 in addition extracellular polymeric substances eps and fractal dimension are also correlated yuan et al 2014 however the relationship between fractal dimension and sludge activity remains unrevealed respiration rate which is described by the oxygen uptake rate our is an important biological feature of activated sludge the our has been successfully used for evaluating the inhibition of toxicity vasiliadou et al 2018 biosorption rahman et al 2017 proliferation and adaptation of microbes under severe starvation conditions friedrich and takács 2013 and the shock and inhibition by nanoparticles zhang et al 2016 the respirogram space whose coordinates are ours measured under different conditions has been found to provide much more information than considering each our individually the ratio between the endogenous and maximum respirations can describe the maximum specific growth rate μmax friedrich et al 2015 and the recovery potential index ri under shock loadings li et al 2018a the robustness of an activated sludge system can be evaluated by a hybrid usage of the ri and the respiration with calcium dosage li et al 2018b the res t index ratio of the in situ respiration rate to the maximum respiration rate is reported to be able to alarm the violence of effluents from activated sludge systems li et al 2018c however the relationship between the respirogram characteristics and structural properties of activated sludge has not been established yet the main aim of this work is to use the fractal dimension concept to establish a clear relationship between bioactivity and physical structure of activated sludge sludge samples collected from various sources from flocs to granules from frequently used anoxic oxic a o configuration to step feeding a o configuration as well as under temperature shocking were selected to examine the correlations among fractal dimension physical performance parameters and respirogram the results from this work could lay groundwork for developing a new method or index to simultaneously control aeration and settling tanks thus provide a promising tool for the management of wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up sludge samples collected from floc and granular systems were examined in this work for the floc sludge system a o and step feeding a o processes run 1 were chosen due to their wide applications in china along with the most concerned impact of temperature shocking run 2 for the granular sludge system difference in organic loading rate olr run 3 was considered because olr crucially affects the characteristics of granular sludge each run included 2 or 3 reactors that were operated with different configurations or influent concentrations to create significantly different sludge structures table 1 run 1 r1 with the two reactors r1 a and r1 b was applied to simulate the a o and the step feeding a o configurations that are widely used in china wang et al 2012 respectively run 2 r2 also with the two reactors r2 a and r2 b was used to evaluate the effect of temperature variation gao et al 2012 li et al 2018b run 3 r3 with the three reactors r3 a r3 b and r3 c was operated for aerobic granulation with different olrs the operational conditions are listed in table 1 all of the reactors were fed with synthetic wastewaters and operated as a sequence batch reactor sbr and the operating cycles varied with the reactors the compositions of the synthetic wastewaters varied with reactors as follows carbon sources r1 a and r1 b soluble starch 200 mg cod l ch3coona 200 mg cod l r2 a and r2 b ch3coona 400 mg cod l r3 a

reactors r1 a and r1 b had a 6 h operating cycle including 10 min feeding 120 min anaerobic mixing 180 min aeration 30 min settling 15 min withdrawing and 5 min idle phase after day 30 a change of the step feeding of reactor r1 b was accomplished by dividing the entire cycle into three equal parts and each part of 120 min had feeding anoxic mixing and aeration phases during days 30 45 the feeding anoxic mixing and aeration phases were 84 min 24 min and 12 min respectively during days 46 60 these phases were 36 min 48min and 36 min respectively and after day 61 they were changed to 48 min 48 min and 24 min respectively the samples were taken on the day 75 from reactor r1 b the operating cycle of r2 a and r2 b was set at 6 h including 5 min feeding 120 min anaerobic mixing 180 min aeration 40 min settling and 15 min withdrawing reactors r3 a r3 b and r3 c had a 4 h operating cycle including 5 min feeding 200 min aeration 15 min settling 5 min withdrawing and 15 min idle phase the operating temperatures of the above reactor were controlled at 20 1 c with exception of a temperature shock with slow and rapid decreasing speeds in the operation of r2 a and the ph was controlled at approximately 7 2 activated sludge was collected from seven reactors at the end of the aerobic phases for immediate analyses or stored at 4 c for future use 2 2 determination of fractal dimension and theoretical calculations photographs taken by digital camera were first processed using imagej software then the area a and perimeter p of the flocs were measured based on fractal theory the two dimensional fractal dimension df of activated sludge flocs can be obtained by fitting ln a to ln p with the following perimeter area fractal dimension equation mandelbrot 1983 and at least 40 flocs from the image were analyzed for each df calculation 1 a p d f for inorganic flocs such as aluminum kaolinite flocs the relationship between settling velocity and fractal dimension can be expressed as eq 2 which was initially named as tambo s floc density function tambo and watanabe 1979 and further evaluated from the perspective of fractal dimension adachi and tanaka 1997 2 v d d f 3 d 1 where v is the settling velocity of flocs d is the diameter of flocs and df 3d is the 3d based fractal dimension of flocs assuming that the porosity and density were homogeneously distributed in the population of sludge flocs the relationship of settling velocity and diameter of sludge flocs could also be expressed using eq 2 johnson et al 1996 the 3d based fractal dimension df 3d can be obtained by regression analysis of the logarithm of settling velocity versus the logarithm of diameter and d f 3 d d v and d f 3 d d v were thus calculated using the diameter of dv and d50 respectively 2 3

reactor a do probe visi ferm do 120 hamilton switzerland a ph probe polilyte plus h arc 120 hamilton switzerland a plc control system a dosing system and a software analysis system the measurement of respirogram requires four steps and takes approximately 5 h li et al 2018a 2018b 2018c the workstation continuously collected do and ph data online and provided the oxygen consumption rate of the activated sludge accordingly the specific oxygen consumption rate sour was also calculated sour our mlss several important sour values of the activated sludge were obtained from the respirogram li et

total respiration rate that was measured with sufficient substrate sourn represents the maximum respiration rate stimulated with ammonia nitrogen 2 4 measurement of settleability and adsorption the sludge volume in a 100 ml cylinder was recorded at different times during the 30 min settling period the 5 min sludge settling volume sv5 30 min sludge settling volume sv30 and svi were then calculated based on the recorded data activated sludge of 5 ml was mixed with 20 ml methylene blue mb solution with different concentrations of 50 100 200 400 800 1200 1600 2400 mg l the ph of the mixture was maintained at 6 8 0 1 and the flask was shaken at a constant temperature of 25 c in a water bath vibrator for 2 h to achieve adsorption equilibrium finally the mb concentration measured by the uv vwas spectrophotometer was used to calculate the amount of adsorbed mb qe according to eq 3 li et al 2018b 3 q e c 0 c e v m m g g where c0 and ce represent the initial and adsorption equilibrium concentrations of mb mg l respectively v represents the total volume of the mixture during adsorption l and m represents the mass of activated sludge used as adsorbent g the maximum

5 analytical methods the cod ammonium nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n total nitrogen tn phosphate tp and mlss were measured by the standard methods apha 1995 the ph in the adsorption capacity measurement process was measured by a portable ph meter hq40d hach usa the microscopic morphology of activated sludge was observed and photographed by a biological microscope nikon 50i nikon co japan the particle size of activated sludge was determined with a laser particle size distribution analyzer ls230 svm beckman coulter inc usa and the results were expressed in the form of particle size distribution data tables distribution curves dv dmode d10 d50 and d90 etc 3 results and discussion 3 1 relationship between respirogram characteristics and sludge diameter the average diameters of the activated sludge based on the corresponding volume and number of flocs dv and d50 which corresponded to different reactors were compared fig 1 a in this case dv can be recognized as the 3d based average i e dv was calculated via the weighting where the diameter of each particle is weighted by its volume and d50 can be regarded as the 1d based average where the diameter of each particle has equal weighting generally the 3d based average dv was larger than the 1d based average d50 the relationship between the diameters of flocs and their bioactivity was revealed by the clear correlation between various specific respiration rates soure sourq sourt and the diameters of dv and d50 respectively fig 1b and 1c larger flocs in terms of dv and d50 resulted in lower specific respiration rates suggesting that the floc area was the main control factor for the bioactivity as small flocs contributed more surface areas though other factors such as intra floc effects the profile of oxygen concentration within a floc and the effects of substrate diffusion also contribute to the bioactivity daigger et al 2007 additionally when the measured data were fitted using an exponential function of diameters the soure and sourq fit better with dv than with d50 and the sourt fit better with d50 than with dv fig 1b and 1c these results suggest that soure and sourq depended more on the higher dimensional structure than sourt because 3d based average diameter dv was based on floc volume higher dimension and 1d based average diameter d50 was based on floc number distribution lower dimension 3 2 relationship between respirogram and structure related properties of sludge the adsorption capacity in terms of qmax and the settleability in terms of svi was selected as the typical structure related properties of activated sludge generally larger flocs exhibited a lower adsorption capacity fig 2 a this might be ascribed to the larger surface area for small flocs given the same total weight of flocs with an assumption that the porosity or density of flocs was not substantially affected by the diameter it should be noted that density may drop as size increases andreadakis 1993 liao et al 2006 since the operational conditions such as srt and olr of the seven reactors in this work varied within a narrow range table 1 the above assumption regarding density was reasonable however a decrease in density as a result of size may offset the large surface of small flocs andreadakis 1993 the outlier of point r2 a fig 2a was ascribed to the temperature shocking the adsorption capacity qmax was linearly correlated with both soure and sourq fig 2b additionally a smaller soure resulted in a better settleability i e a smaller svi value fig 2c it is reported that a higher svi resulting from loose flocs brings about a higher adsorption capacity andreadakis 1993 and a loose structure of flocs results in a higher sourq li et al 2018b which is in agreement with the results in this work fig 2 all of these results demonstrate that the soure sourq and qmax are more accurately predicted by the high dimensional structure of flocs thus a higher dimensional description index dv rather than d50 should be used for describing the diameter of sludge when establishing the relationship between the fractal dimension and the structure related coordinates of the respirogram 3 3 effects of fractal dimension on respirogram and structure related properties of sludge to examine the relationship between the respiration rate and fractal dimension the respiration rate was fitted as a function of df fig 3 a with an increase in df the adsorption capacity decreased fig 3b while the settleability improved fig 3c the theoretical upper and lower bounds of respiration rates qmax and svi could be calculated by extrapolation using the fitting formula with df values as 1 and 2 respectively as shown in table 2 when df was 2 both soure and sourt were negative and when df was 1 the svi reached 1 08 107 ml g resulting in the suspended solid concentration of approximately 0 1 mg l not all of these values are reasonable the results indicate that the acceptable bioactivity governed the acceptable upper bound of df while the acceptable settleability svi or the biomass concentration determines the acceptable lower bound of df our fitting formulas are reasonable only within this acceptable range of df a higher fractal dimension implies a greater activated sludge density which usually stands for the sludge with added chemicals ca2 al3 etc and a low mlvss mlss ratio hussain et al 2013 jin et al 2003 moussas and zouboulis 2009 such sludge contains more inorganic component than the biological one and has low bioactivity in addition the non porous compact flocs are predominant and microbes grow on the floc surface only at the theoretical maximum df of 2 0 in this case a big bio reactor volume is required to achieve effective treatment thus the sludge with low bioactivity high fractal dimension is not desired despite of its good settleability in this sense the acceptable bioactivity in aeration tanks governs the upper bound of the desired fractal dimension similarly loose flocs with a low fractal dimension free swimming floc with df 1 have high bioactivity but such sludge has a poor settleability and presents challenge for the operation of settling tank in particular it is difficult to maintain a sufficient high sludge concentration which ultimately results in a decline in overall bioactivity in this sense the acceptable settleability of sludge in settling tank governs the lower bound of the desired fractal dimension as for the bioactivity when sourt equaled soure i e no external respiration occurred the most compact structure of activated sludge was obtained in this case the df value was calculated as 1 68 resulting in an svi of 11 56 ml g it should be noted that no intersection point was plotted in fig 3a at df of 1 68 as the scales for soure and sourt in fig 3a were different the svi values were reported in the range of 15 550 ml g table s1 and a lower svi generally existed in the granular sludge system especially for anaerobic granular sludge dosed with substantial metal components for example the lowest reported svi value was 15 ml g with influent concentrations of cacl2 feso4 7h2o and mgso4 7h2o at 150 mg l 30 mg l and 33 75 mg l respectively long et al 2014 the second lowest reported svi value was 19 6 ml g with influent concentrations of ca2 and mg2 at 300 and 100 mg l respectively resulting in a low ratio of mlvss to mlss at 0 45 as more inorganic matters might be precipitated in the sludge in this case inorganic materials were the dominant component of sludge li et al 2014 resulting in improved settleability but reduced bioactivity therefore the upper bound value of df was rarely achieved in real activated sludge systems except when additional chemical doses were applied because dosing chemicals such as al3 ca2 and fe2 could significantly improve the compactness of the flocs yao et al 2015 relatively higher svi values of 550 and 548 2 ml g were detected for the activated sludge process operated at a short srt of 10 d and a do level of 1 5 mg l with filamentous sludge bulking fan et al 2017 in such deteriorated settleability cases the biomass concentration was 1733 mg l only much lower than those under other conditions 2565 5546 mg l and the fractal dimension df was also lower fan et al 2017 therefore the lower bound of df was determined by the lowest acceptable settleability of sludge as a higher svi resulted in a lower biomass concentration that made the performance very inefficient the fractal dimensions of the sludge were reported in the range of 1 07 1 73 wang et al 2009 zheng et al 2011 and the corresponding extrapolated values of the soure sourt svi and qmax were calculated with the equations shown in fig 3a and 3b and are listed in table 2 the extrapolated value of the svi was 2 61 106 ml g with df of 1 07 using the equation in fig 3c this result indicates that the sludge concentration was approximately 0 38 mg l and such a low concentration implies that the microbes grew in a free swimming status which rarely occurred in a real wwtp however with such a low biomass concentration the extrapolated sourt value was 351 mg gss h this value could be considered as the maximum potential of the respiration rate as explained above the sourt depends more on the 1d average structure however the smaller particles may be artificially ignored when measuring df through image analysis which may overestimate the df values such an overestimation might be the reason why the reported df value of 1 73 was larger than the calculated upper bound of 1 68 table 2 3 4 descriptions of bioactivity and settleability of sludge with fractal dimension biodegradation in reaction tanks and solid liquid separation in settling tanks are two essential aspects of wwtps these two types of units are operated independently based on different parameters the bioactivity of sludge is the key factor for reaction tanks while the physical structure including diameter and density of the sludge is the crucial factor for settling tanks our work shows that the fractal dimension correlated well with both factors and could thus be used for simultaneously describing bioactivity and physical structure of sludge figs 1 and 2 table 2 as such the desired settleability of activated sludge can be transformed to the desired respirogram space coordinates using the fractal dimension as an intermediate variable that connects settleability and biological activity of activated sludge for example when the svi is set in the range of 50 150 ml g soure and sourt should be controlled in the ranges of 5 83 7 53 mg gss h and 45 64 70 57 mg gss h respectively such a transformation enables wwtp operators to control the settleability in the reaction tanks rather than in the settling tanks therefore the fractal dimension df is proposed as an important intermediate variable which helps to bridge the strategies of controlling the settling tank by using the conventional methods and the bioactivity based method conventionally operators either suppressed the growth of filamentous bacteria in the aeration tanks if the deteriorated settleability was caused by filamentous bacteria or passively improve the sludge settleability by adding chemicals such as fe or al based coagulants hussain et al 2013 jin et al 2003 moussas and zouboulis 2009 especially for the plants for industrial wastewater treatment agridiotis et al 2007 jin et al 2017 however with the new transformation from settleability to respirogram space via df a proactive approach for controlling sludge settleability can be established in the reaction tank by tuning its bioactivity although filamentous bulking is also controlled in aeration tanks the method proposed here is generally effective regardless of the occurrence of filamentous bacteria the bioactivity can be successfully tuned via the srt valigore et al 2012 olr liu and tay 2002 do concentration li et al 2018a liao et al 2011 etc however a widely applicable mathematical tool for tuning bioactivity by srt olr and do is not readily available and further investigations are needed in the future generally a high respiration rate of sourt is desirable which requires a small fractal dimension or a high svi value and consequently faces the great challenge of retaining a high biomass concentration in system therefore a rational fractal dimension should represent a trade off between bioactivity and settleability it has also been reported that a high sour can be used as a signal for sludge bulking brault et al 2011 which also validates the finding of our work in addition the adsorption capacity plays an important role in the degradation or transformation of pollutants especially for those slowly biodegradable components therefore larger adsorption capacity is also desired and a small diameter fig 2a and low fractal dimension fig 4 should be maintained for such a purpose in addition the increase in the adsorption capacity was also observed with the increase in sourq fig 2b in some previous studies compact structure and high fractal dimension that improve the settleability were encouraged dai et al 2018 fan et al 2017 jin et al 2003 however the relationship between the fractal dimension and bioactivity or adsorption discovered in this work demonstrates that the desired maximum fractal dimension should be controlled at a certain level these results show the decrease or increase in the fractal dimension can be used as an alarm signal for operations of wwtps a decrease in the fractal dimension may improve the specific respiration and greater attention should then be focused on the settleability such as sludge bulking by contrast an increase in the fractal dimension is not always an optimistic signal this may indicate the increase of slowly biodegradable components as the adsorption capacity of sludge decreases and may suggest the increase in inert inorganic components in sludge 3 5 re evaluation of state point analysis using fractal dimension the spa method is frequently used for the operation of settling tanks as it helps to determine the mass balance in the settling tanks and how that will change with flow and solids loaded into the settling tanks however the influent sludge concentration sludge flow rate and settleability all depend on the upstream bioreaction tank this result suggests that controlling settling tanks from the bioactivity perspective is reasonable as such it is possible to improve the spa method by considering the fractal dimension once an optimal fractal dimension is known for a given activated sludge system operators should tune their system to this optimal value if the fractal dimension increases which results in the improvement of settleability the operation of the settling tanks is safe as the state point becomes farther away from the settling curves however such an increase in the fractal dimension is an ominous indicator for the bioreaction tanks as the bioactivity is decreasing an immediate countermeasure in such case is to increase the sludge concentration by extending the srt the state point should thus move from point o to point a fig 5 it is reported that a long srt or a high sludge concentration resulted in compact structure and better flocculating ability of sludge fan et al 2017 liao et al 2006 massé et al 2006 as the srt and the sludge concentration increase the increase in df might be stopped resulting in a new balance between sludge concentration and fractal dimension on the other hand when the df is decreasing the settling curve becomes close to the state point o for the safety of settling tanks one should decrease the sludge concentration as the bioactivity of sludge is increased because the state point moves from point o to point b with such an operation fig 5 in addition the distance between the state point and the settling curve can also be used as a reference index to design and tune the settling tank a larger distance indicates that the settling tank is under a safer state with a larger adjustable margin 3 6 limitation of fractal dimension measurement and the necessity of transformation from fractal dimension to respirogram it should be noted that several approaches are available for obtaining the fractal dimensions as listed in table s2 among them the 2d image based fractional dimension and the 3d settling based fractal dimension were analyzed in this work mass or settleability based fractal dimensions were suggested for describing the density and settleability the former describes the difference of density of flocs and the latter is considered as a geometric parameter that describes the configuration of the entire floc li and leung 2005 yuan et al 2014 wang and zheng 2017 and such fractal dimensions can be considered as 3d fractal dimensions df 3d two 3d fractal dimensions d f 3 d d v and d f 3 d d 50 were calculated with difference source of statistical diameter of dv and d50 as mentioned in the previous discussion on particle size and respiration rate higher dimensional particle size dv was more favorable for the soure sourq and adsorption while the lower dimensional particle size d50 was more favorable for the sourt fig 1 which is in agreement with the results of 3d fractal dimensions fig 4a and b therefore when the theoretical upper bound of df is calculated for evaluating total respiration rate sourt the 1d average diameter d50 is recommended otherwise the 3d average diameter dv is suggested the difference of 2d and 3d fractal dimensions of sludge from the same reactors is listed in table 3 a uniform object follows the codimension rule senesi and wilkinson 2008 5 e 3 d 2 d d f 3 d d f 1 however when the measured difference e3d 2d was less than the theoretical value of 1 the deviation of e3d 2d from 1 reflected the morphological heterogeneity non homogeneity of flocs i e the sludge with an e3d 2d of 1 was completely homogenous the observation of e3d 2d shows that granular sludge r3 a r3 b and r3 c was more homogenous than the flocs r1 a r1 b r2 a and r2 b table 3 the homogenous granules despite exhibiting a larger fractal dimension exhibited a larger respiration rate fig 6 which is inconsistent with the relationship between 2d fractal dimension df and respiration rate fig 3a such an inconsistency suggests that the respiration rates sourq soure and sourt depended on not only the fractal dimension but also the homogeneity of the sludge at a similar fractal dimension magnitude a greater homogeneity showed a higher respiration rate fig 6 these findings could be used to explain the observed outliers for example for the granular sludge r3 a r3 b and r3 c the sample in r3 b exhibited the smallest value of e3d 2d and it was the most heterogeneous sample among these three reactors r3 a r3 b and r3 c table 3 such a heterogenous structure might contribute to the lowest respiration rates of the sourq soure and sourt the outer liners in fig 1b and 1c by contrast the sample in r1 b showed less heterogeneous structure in the r1 reactors resulting in higher respiration rates of soure fig 2c sourq and sourt fig 3a for the adsorption capacity the finding is similar to the above to say the samples in reactor r2 a fig 2a 2b and 3b and reactor r3 b fig 2a simultaneously had poor adsorption capacity and low values of e3d 2d table 3 therefore the outliers in these figures fig 2a c 3a b suggest that the homogeneity significantly affected the respiration and adsorption performance of sludge it should also be mentioned that the correct estimation of 3d fractal dimension using eq 2 also relies on the homogeneity of the floc population including the density and permeability johnson 1996 since the operational conditions such as srt olr of the seven reactors in this work were within a narrow range and the sludge samples of the reactors in the same run exhibited a slight difference table 1 the effect of heterogeneity was negligible for most of the samples however the heterogeneity of flocs under more diverse operational conditions should be of great concern because the reliability of the relationship between respiration rate and dimensional fractal df depended on the heterogeneity fig 2 when the effect of heterogeneity is not negligible other approaches that eliminate the effect of heterogeneity should be applied to estimate fractal dimension therefore the conditions under which the heterogeneity of the floc structure becomes the predominant factor warrant further investigations a reasonable fractal dimension is a key parameter to simultaneously control aeration and settling tanks compared with the respirogram approach measuring fractal dimension is a complex process and its online implementation is challenging and the measured value varies with the methods used in addition the difference in their theoretical values depends on the homogeneity of sludge structure therefore direct use of fractal dimension in field operation is of great challenge in contrast respirogram has been widely applied in bioreaction tanks li et al 2018a 2018b 2018c in this work it is well demonstrated that direct operation of settling tanks from the biological perspective is possible thus a reasonable range of fractal dimension can be obtained by measuring and tuning the respirogram of the activated sludge system 4 conclusions in this work the bioactivity and structure related properties of activated sludge are investigated the soure and sourq are found to be more closely correlated with the higher dimensional mean diameter than the sourt and the fractal dimension df can be used as a surrogate index of bioactivity and physical structures of sludge once the relationship between the settleability and bioactivity is established the maximum and minimum values of respiration and df are obtained by extrapolation the maximum respiration is approximately 350 390 mg gss h and the maximum df is 1 68 to better control activated sludge systems a rational fractal dimension should be selected by the trade off between bioactivity and settleability of sludge in the operation of wwtps since df connects the settleability and biological activity of activated sludge the transformation from physical characteristics to respiration space enables the biological control of settling tanks based on respirogram using the df as an intermediate variable therefore using the readily measurable respirogram as a proxy of df simultaneous control of bioactivity and settleability can be achieved by adjusting df in a reasonable range through measuring and tuning the respirogram declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

17909,bioactivity and settleability of activated sludge are essential for the operation of activated sludge systems in wastewater treatment in this work the fractal dimension of sludge image is proposed as a tool to evaluate these two factors the specific endogenous respiration rate soure and the specific quasi endogenous respiration rate sourq are found to be more dependent on the 3d structure of sludge than the specific total respiration rate sourt the relationship between the fractal structure and bioactivity suggests that the bioactivity governs the acceptable upper bound of the fractal dimension df as at its theoretical maximum of 2 0 the non porous compact flocs are predominant the settleability or the biomass concentration determines the acceptable lower bound of df as at its theoretical minimum of 1 0 the free swimming microbes are predominant our data reveal that the activated sludge has an acceptable fractal dimension df in a range of 1 07 1 68 in practice the fractal dimension should be controlled at a reasonable value as there is a trade off between the bioactivity and physical structure to achieve better performance a decrease or increase in the fractal dimension can serve as a signal for the change of the operational status and this is further elucidated from the perspective of settling tanks using state point analysis compared with respirogram measurement measuring fractal dimension is a complex process and its online implementation is challenging also the measured value varies with the methods used in addition the difference in their theoretical values depends on the homogeneity of the sludge structure since the fractal dimension df reflects both bioactivity and settleability of the sludge but is difficult to measure in this work a relationship between df and the easily measurable respirogram is established and a method using the respirogram as a proxy of df is proposed to control the bioactivity and settleability simultaneously this respiration based method is able to simultaneously control aeration and settling tanks and could serve as an efficient tool for the management of wastewater treatment plants

growth rate wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction bioactivity and settleability are two important factors reflecting the performance of activated sludge and engineers in wastewater treatment plants wwtps tune their operation according to the variations of these parameters high bioactivity is desired in aeration tanks for efficient removal of pollutants and compact structure is favorable for obtaining excellent separation in settling tanks however the design or the operation of the aeration tanks and settling tanks are based on considerably different types of parameters for example the organic loading rate olr and solids retention time srt are important parameters for aeration tanks xu et al 2018 but they are not directly used for the design and operation of settling tanks the biological parameters such as aeration rate tang et al 2016 srt valigore et al 2012 olr liu and tay 2002 and dissolved oxygen do level li et al 2018a liao et al 2011 have been extensively studied for running aeration tanks to meet effluent standards van de moortel et al 2017 but these studies rarely extended to the subsequent settling tanks the physical settleability is essential for the design and operation of settling tanks the flux theory based state point analysis spa method has been widely used for evaluating settling tanks li and stenstrom 2014a 2014b as it is a convenient visual way to determine the operating conditions of settling tanks and expressed graphically which composed of a settling curve and two operation lines the state point or the operating point of spa is the point where the underflow rate line and the surface overflow rate line intersect the spa graph could be used to judge what occurs in the settling tanks but the key factors affecting spa are determined in the upstream aeration tanks the operational controlling factors for settling tanks e g the settleability which depend on the biological characteristics of the whole system amanatidou et al 2015 jassby et al 2014 patziger et al 2012 affect the sludge concentration of settling tanks and return sludge flow rate therefore a relationship between settling and aeration tanks can be established by the spa method in this sense the word state in state point can be understood as the biological status however frequent actions directly taken for operational tuning or failure recovery of settling tanks are mostly based only on physical or chemical aspects ye et al 2016 though it is possible to simultaneously control the bioactivity and physical structure as the state point in spa is related with aeration and settling tanks one successful example of such a link between settling and aeration tanks is controlling filamentous bacteria using biological approaches to suppress their growth and avoid the deteriorated settleability meunier et al 2016 however direct operation of settling tanks from the biological perspective is rarely reported the settleability of sludge is frequently described by physical properties including particle size fractal dimension and sludge volume index svi fractal dimension is an important parameter of activated sludge representing its physical properties including shape spatial structure self similarity and size distributions fan et al 2017 grijspeerdt and verstraete 1997 jiang and logan 1991 wang et al 2018 and thus offers wide applications fractal dimension can be used to study the settleability of activated sludge which has a negative correlation with svi jin et al 2003 and to predict the settling velocity of flocs chakraborti et al 2000 vahedi and gorczyca 2012 wang and zheng 2017 it can also show the dewatering performance of activated sludge including dewaterability zhang et al 2018a b capillary suction time jin et al 2004 and bound water content turchiuli and fargues 2004 it can also be used to quantify the interfacial interactions between a randomly rough sludge floc and membrane surface zhang et al 2017 in addition extracellular polymeric substances eps and fractal dimension are also correlated yuan et al 2014 however the relationship between fractal dimension and sludge activity remains unrevealed respiration rate which is described by the oxygen uptake rate our is an important biological feature of activated sludge the our has been successfully used for evaluating the inhibition of toxicity vasiliadou et al 2018 biosorption rahman et al 2017 proliferation and adaptation of microbes under severe starvation conditions friedrich and takács 2013 and the shock and inhibition by nanoparticles zhang et al 2016 the respirogram space whose coordinates are ours measured under different conditions has been found to provide much more information than considering each our individually the ratio between the endogenous and maximum respirations can describe the maximum specific growth rate μmax friedrich et al 2015 and the recovery potential index ri under shock loadings li et al 2018a the robustness of an activated sludge system can be evaluated by a hybrid usage of the ri and the respiration with calcium dosage li et al 2018b the res t index ratio of the in situ respiration rate to the maximum respiration rate is reported to be able to alarm the violence of effluents from activated sludge systems li et al 2018c however the relationship between the respirogram characteristics and structural properties of activated sludge has not been established yet the main aim of this work is to use the fractal dimension concept to establish a clear relationship between bioactivity and physical structure of activated sludge sludge samples collected from various sources from flocs to granules from frequently used anoxic oxic a o configuration to step feeding a o configuration as well as under temperature shocking were selected to examine the correlations among fractal dimension physical performance parameters and respirogram the results from this work could lay groundwork for developing a new method or index to simultaneously control aeration and settling tanks thus provide a promising tool for the management of wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up sludge samples collected from floc and granular systems were examined in this work for the floc sludge system a o and step feeding a o processes run 1 were chosen due to their wide applications in china along with the most concerned impact of temperature shocking run 2 for the granular sludge system difference in organic loading rate olr run 3 was considered because olr crucially affects the characteristics of granular sludge each run included 2 or 3 reactors that were operated with different configurations or influent concentrations to create significantly different sludge structures table 1 run 1 r1 with the two reactors r1 a and r1 b was applied to simulate the a o and the step feeding a o configurations that are widely used in china wang et al 2012 respectively run 2 r2 also with the two reactors r2 a and r2 b was used to evaluate the effect of temperature variation gao et al 2012 li et al 2018b run 3 r3 with the three reactors r3 a r3 b and r3 c was operated for aerobic granulation with different olrs the operational conditions are listed in table 1 all of the reactors were fed with synthetic wastewaters and operated as a sequence batch reactor sbr and the operating cycles varied with the reactors

reactors r1 a and r1 b had a 6 h operating cycle including 10 min feeding 120 min anaerobic mixing 180 min aeration 30 min settling 15 min withdrawing and 5 min idle phase after day 30 a change of the step feeding of reactor r1 b was accomplished by dividing the entire cycle into three equal parts and each part of 120 min had feeding anoxic mixing and aeration phases during days 30 45 the feeding anoxic mixing and aeration phases were 84 min 24 min and 12 min respectively during days 46 60 these phases were 36 min 48min and 36 min respectively and after day 61 they were changed to 48 min 48 min and 24 min respectively the samples were taken on the day 75 from reactor r1 b the operating cycle of r2 a and r2 b was set at 6 h including 5 min feeding 120 min anaerobic mixing 180 min aeration 40 min settling and 15 min withdrawing reactors r3 a r3 b and r3 c had a 4 h operating cycle including 5 min feeding 200 min aeration 15 min settling 5 min withdrawing and 15 min idle phase the operating temperatures of the above reactor were controlled at 20 1 c with exception of a temperature shock with slow and rapid decreasing speeds in the operation of r2 a and the ph was controlled at approximately 7 2 activated sludge was collected from seven reactors at the end of the aerobic phases for immediate analyses or stored at 4 c for future use 2 2 determination of fractal dimension and theoretical calculations photographs taken by digital camera were first processed using imagej software then the area a and perimeter p of the flocs were measured based on fractal theory the two dimensional fractal dimension df of activated sludge flocs can be obtained by fitting ln a to ln p with the following perimeter area fractal dimension equation mandelbrot 1983 and at least 40 flocs from the image were analyzed for each df calculation 1 a p d f for inorganic flocs such as aluminum kaolinite flocs the relationship between settling velocity and fractal dimension can be expressed as eq 2 which was initially named as tambo s floc density function tambo and watanabe 1979 and further evaluated from the perspective of fractal dimension adachi and tanaka 1997 2 v d d f 3 d 1 where v is the settling velocity of flocs d is the diameter of flocs and df 3d is the 3d based fractal dimension of flocs assuming that the porosity and density were homogeneously distributed in the population of sludge flocs the relationship of settling velocity and diameter of sludge flocs could also be expressed using eq 2 johnson et al 1996 the 3d based fractal dimension df 3d can be obtained by regression analysis of the logarithm of settling velocity versus the logarithm of diameter and d f 3 d d v and d f 3 d d v were thus calculated using the diameter of dv and d50 respectively 2 3

total respiration rate that was measured with sufficient substrate sourn represents the maximum respiration rate stimulated with ammonia nitrogen 2 4 measurement of settleability and adsorption the sludge volume in a 100 ml cylinder was recorded at different times during the 30 min settling period the 5 min sludge settling volume sv5 30 min sludge settling volume sv30 and svi were then calculated based on the recorded data activated sludge of 5 ml was mixed with 20 ml methylene blue mb solution with different concentrations of 50 100 200 400 800 1200 1600 2400 mg l the ph of the mixture was maintained at 6 8 0 1 and the flask was shaken at a constant temperature of 25 c in a water bath vibrator for 2 h to achieve adsorption equilibrium finally the mb concentration measured by the uv vwas spectrophotometer was used to calculate the amount of adsorbed mb qe according to eq 3 li et al 2018b 3 q e c 0 c e v m m g g where c0 and ce represent the initial and adsorption equilibrium concentrations of mb mg l respectively v represents the total volume of the mixture during adsorption l and m represents the mass of activated sludge used as adsorbent g the maximum

5 analytical methods the cod ammonium nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite no2 n total nitrogen tn phosphate tp and mlss were measured by the standard methods apha 1995 the ph in the adsorption capacity measurement process was measured by a portable ph meter hq40d hach usa the microscopic morphology of activated sludge was observed and photographed by a biological microscope nikon 50i nikon co japan the particle size of activated sludge was determined with a laser particle size distribution analyzer ls230 svm beckman coulter inc usa and the results were expressed in the form of particle size distribution data tables distribution curves dv dmode d10 d50 and d90 etc 3 results and discussion 3 1 relationship between respirogram characteristics and sludge diameter the average diameters of the activated sludge based on the corresponding volume and number of flocs dv and d50 which corresponded to different reactors were compared fig 1 a in this case dv can be recognized as the 3d based average i e dv was calculated via the weighting where the diameter of each particle is weighted by its volume and d50 can be regarded as the 1d based average where the diameter of each particle has equal weighting generally the 3d based average dv was larger than the 1d based average d50 the relationship between the diameters of flocs and their bioactivity was revealed by the clear correlation between various specific respiration rates soure sourq sourt and the diameters of dv and d50 respectively fig 1b and 1c larger flocs in terms of dv and d50 resulted in lower specific respiration rates suggesting that the floc area was the main control factor for the bioactivity as small flocs contributed more surface areas though other factors such as intra floc effects the profile of oxygen concentration within a floc and the effects of substrate diffusion also contribute to the bioactivity daigger et al 2007 additionally when the measured data were fitted using an exponential function of diameters the soure and sourq fit better with dv than with d50 and the sourt fit better with d50 than with dv fig 1b and 1c these results suggest that soure and sourq depended more on the higher dimensional structure than sourt because 3d based average diameter dv was based on floc volume higher dimension and 1d based average diameter d50 was based on floc number distribution lower dimension 3 2 relationship between respirogram and structure related properties of sludge the adsorption capacity in terms of qmax and the settleability in terms of svi was selected as the typical structure related properties of activated sludge generally larger flocs exhibited a lower adsorption capacity fig 2 a this might be ascribed to the larger surface area for small flocs given the same total weight of flocs with an assumption that the porosity or density of flocs was not substantially affected by the diameter it should be noted that density may drop as size increases andreadakis 1993 liao et al 2006 since the operational conditions such as srt and olr of the seven reactors in this work varied within a narrow range table 1 the above assumption regarding density was reasonable however a decrease in density as a result of size may offset the large surface of small flocs andreadakis 1993 the outlier of point r2 a fig 2a was ascribed to the temperature shocking the adsorption capacity qmax was linearly correlated with both soure and sourq fig 2b additionally a smaller soure resulted in a better settleability i e a smaller svi value fig 2c it is reported that a higher svi resulting from loose flocs brings about a higher adsorption capacity andreadakis 1993 and a loose structure of flocs results in a higher sourq li et al 2018b which is in agreement with the results in this work fig 2 all of these results demonstrate that the soure sourq and qmax are more accurately predicted by the high dimensional structure of flocs thus a higher dimensional description index dv rather than d50 should be used for describing the diameter of sludge when establishing the relationship between the fractal dimension and the structure related coordinates of the respirogram 3 3 effects of fractal dimension on respirogram and structure related properties of sludge to examine the relationship between the respiration rate and fractal dimension the respiration rate was fitted as a function of df fig 3 a with an increase in df the adsorption capacity decreased fig 3b while the settleability improved fig 3c the theoretical upper and lower bounds of respiration rates qmax and svi could be calculated by extrapolation using the fitting formula with df values as 1 and 2 respectively as shown in table 2 when df was 2 both soure and sourt were negative and when df was 1 the svi reached 1 08 107 ml g resulting in the suspended solid concentration of approximately 0 1 mg l not all of these values are reasonable the results indicate that the acceptable bioactivity governed the acceptable upper bound of df while the acceptable settleability svi or the biomass concentration determines the acceptable lower bound of df our fitting formulas are reasonable only within this acceptable range of df a higher fractal dimension implies a greater activated sludge density which usually stands for the sludge with added chemicals ca2 al3 etc and a low mlvss mlss ratio hussain et al 2013 jin et al 2003 moussas and zouboulis 2009 such sludge contains more inorganic component than the biological one and has low bioactivity in addition the non porous compact flocs are predominant and microbes grow on the floc surface only at the theoretical maximum df of 2 0 in this case a big bio reactor volume is required to achieve effective treatment thus the sludge with low bioactivity high fractal dimension is not desired despite of its good settleability in this sense the acceptable bioactivity in aeration tanks governs the upper bound of the desired fractal dimension similarly loose flocs with a low fractal dimension free swimming floc with df 1 have high bioactivity but such sludge has a poor settleability and presents challenge for the operation of settling tank in particular it is difficult to maintain a sufficient high sludge concentration which ultimately results in a decline in overall bioactivity in this sense the acceptable settleability of sludge in settling tank governs the lower bound of the desired fractal dimension as for the bioactivity when sourt equaled soure i e no external respiration occurred the most compact structure of activated sludge was obtained in this case the df value was calculated as 1 68 resulting in an svi of 11 56 ml g it should be noted that no intersection point was plotted in fig 3a at df of 1 68 as the scales for soure and sourt in fig 3a were different the svi values were reported in the range of 15 550 ml g table s1 and a lower svi generally existed in the granular sludge system especially for anaerobic granular sludge dosed with substantial metal components for example the lowest reported svi value was 15 ml g with influent concentrations of cacl2 feso4 7h2o and mgso4 7h2o at 150 mg l 30 mg l and 33 75 mg l respectively long et al 2014 the second lowest reported svi value was 19 6 ml g with influent concentrations of ca2 and mg2 at 300 and 100 mg l respectively resulting in a low ratio of mlvss to mlss at 0 45 as more inorganic matters might be precipitated in the sludge in this case inorganic materials were the dominant component of sludge li et al 2014 resulting in improved settleability but reduced bioactivity therefore the upper bound value of df was rarely achieved in real activated sludge systems except when additional chemical doses were applied because dosing chemicals such as al3 ca2 and fe2 could significantly improve the compactness of the flocs yao et al 2015 relatively higher svi values of 550 and 548 2 ml g were detected for the activated sludge process operated at a short srt of 10 d and a do level of 1 5 mg l with filamentous sludge bulking fan et al 2017 in such deteriorated settleability cases the biomass concentration was 1733 mg l only much lower than those under other conditions 2565 5546 mg l and the fractal dimension df was also lower fan et al 2017 therefore the lower bound of df was determined by the lowest acceptable settleability of sludge as a higher svi resulted in a lower biomass concentration that made the performance very inefficient the fractal dimensions of the sludge were reported in the range of 1 07 1 73 wang et al 2009 zheng et al 2011 and the corresponding extrapolated values of the soure sourt svi and qmax were calculated with the equations shown in fig 3a and 3b and are listed in table 2 the extrapolated value of the svi was 2 61 106 ml g with df of 1 07 using the equation in fig 3c this result indicates that the sludge concentration was approximately 0 38 mg l and such a low concentration implies that the microbes grew in a free swimming status which rarely occurred in a real wwtp however with such a low biomass concentration the extrapolated sourt value was 351 mg gss h this value could be considered as the maximum potential of the respiration rate as explained above the sourt depends more on the 1d average structure however the smaller particles may be artificially ignored when measuring df through image analysis which may overestimate the df values such an overestimation might be the reason why the reported df value of 1 73 was larger than the calculated upper bound of 1 68 table 2 3 4 descriptions of bioactivity and settleability of sludge with fractal dimension biodegradation in reaction tanks and solid liquid separation in settling tanks are two essential aspects of wwtps these two types of units are operated independently based on different parameters the bioactivity of sludge is the key factor for reaction tanks while the physical structure including diameter and density of the sludge is the crucial factor for settling tanks our work shows that the fractal dimension correlated well with both factors and could thus be used for simultaneously describing bioactivity and physical structure of sludge figs 1 and 2 table 2 as such the desired settleability of activated sludge can be transformed to the desired respirogram space coordinates using the fractal dimension as an intermediate variable that connects settleability and biological activity of activated sludge for example when the svi is set in the range of 50 150 ml g soure and sourt should be controlled in the ranges of 5 83 7 53 mg gss h and 45 64 70 57 mg gss h respectively such a transformation enables wwtp operators to control the settleability in the reaction tanks rather than in the settling tanks therefore the fractal dimension df is proposed as an important intermediate variable which helps to bridge the strategies of controlling the settling tank by using the conventional methods and the bioactivity based method conventionally operators either suppressed the growth of filamentous bacteria in the aeration tanks if the deteriorated settleability was caused by filamentous bacteria or passively improve the sludge settleability by adding chemicals such as fe or al based coagulants hussain et al 2013 jin et al 2003 moussas and zouboulis 2009 especially for the plants for industrial wastewater treatment agridiotis et al 2007 jin et al 2017 however with the new transformation from settleability to respirogram space via df a proactive approach for controlling sludge settleability can be established in the reaction tank by tuning its bioactivity although filamentous bulking is also controlled in aeration tanks the method proposed here is generally effective regardless of the occurrence of filamentous bacteria the bioactivity can be successfully tuned via the srt valigore et al 2012 olr liu and tay 2002 do concentration li et al 2018a liao et al 2011 etc however a widely applicable mathematical tool for tuning bioactivity by srt olr and do is not readily available and further investigations are needed in the future generally a high respiration rate of sourt is desirable which requires a small fractal dimension or a high svi value and consequently faces the great challenge of retaining a high biomass concentration in system therefore a rational fractal dimension should represent a trade off between bioactivity and settleability it has also been reported that a high sour can be used as a signal for sludge bulking brault et al 2011 which also validates the finding of our work in addition the adsorption capacity plays an important role in the degradation or transformation of pollutants especially for those slowly biodegradable components therefore larger adsorption capacity is also desired and a small diameter fig 2a and low fractal dimension fig 4 should be maintained for such a purpose in addition the increase in the adsorption capacity was also observed with the increase in sourq fig 2b in some previous studies compact structure and high fractal dimension that improve the settleability were encouraged dai et al 2018 fan et al 2017 jin et al 2003 however the relationship between the fractal dimension and bioactivity or adsorption discovered in this work demonstrates that the desired maximum fractal dimension should be controlled at a certain level these results show the decrease or increase in the fractal dimension can be used as an alarm signal for operations of wwtps a decrease in the fractal dimension may improve the specific respiration and greater attention should then be focused on the settleability such as sludge bulking by contrast an increase in the fractal dimension is not always an optimistic signal this may indicate the increase of slowly biodegradable components as the adsorption capacity of sludge decreases and may suggest the increase in inert inorganic components in sludge 3 5 re evaluation of state point analysis using fractal dimension the spa method is frequently used for the operation of settling tanks as it helps to determine the mass balance in the settling tanks and how that will change with flow and solids loaded into the settling tanks however the influent sludge concentration sludge flow rate and settleability all depend on the upstream bioreaction tank this result suggests that controlling settling tanks from the bioactivity perspective is reasonable as such it is possible to improve the spa method by considering the fractal dimension once an optimal fractal dimension is known for a given activated sludge system operators should tune their system to this optimal value if the fractal dimension increases which results in the improvement of settleability the operation of the settling tanks is safe as the state point becomes farther away from the settling curves however such an increase in the fractal dimension is an ominous indicator for the bioreaction tanks as the bioactivity is decreasing an immediate countermeasure in such case is to increase the sludge concentration by extending the srt the state point should thus move from point o to point a fig 5 it is reported that a long srt or a high sludge concentration resulted in compact structure and better flocculating ability of sludge fan et al 2017 liao et al 2006 massé et al 2006 as the srt and the sludge concentration increase the increase in df might be stopped resulting in a new balance between sludge concentration and fractal dimension on the other hand when the df is decreasing the settling curve becomes close to the state point o for the safety of settling tanks one should decrease the sludge concentration as the bioactivity of sludge is increased because the state point moves from point o to point b with such an operation fig 5 in addition the distance between the state point and the settling curve can also be used as a reference index to design and tune the settling tank a larger distance indicates that the settling tank is under a safer state with a larger adjustable margin 3 6 limitation of fractal dimension measurement and the necessity of transformation from fractal dimension to respirogram it should be noted that several approaches are available for obtaining the fractal dimensions as listed in table s2 among them the 2d image based fractional dimension and the 3d settling based fractal dimension were analyzed in this work mass or settleability based fractal dimensions were suggested for describing the density and settleability the former describes the difference of density of flocs and the latter is considered as a geometric parameter that describes the configuration of the entire floc li and leung 2005 yuan et al 2014 wang and zheng 2017 and such fractal dimensions can be considered as 3d fractal dimensions df 3d two 3d fractal dimensions d f 3 d d v and d f 3 d d 50 were calculated with difference source of statistical diameter of dv and d50 as mentioned in the previous discussion on particle size and respiration rate higher dimensional particle size dv was more favorable for the soure sourq and adsorption while the lower dimensional particle size d50 was more favorable for the sourt fig 1 which is in agreement with the results of 3d fractal dimensions fig 4a and b therefore when the theoretical upper bound of df is calculated for evaluating total respiration rate sourt the 1d average diameter d50 is recommended otherwise the 3d average diameter dv is suggested the difference of 2d and 3d fractal dimensions of sludge from the same reactors is listed in table 3 a uniform object follows the codimension rule senesi and wilkinson 2008 5 e 3 d 2 d d f 3 d d f 1 however when the measured difference e3d 2d was less than the theoretical value of 1 the deviation of e3d 2d from 1 reflected the morphological heterogeneity non homogeneity of flocs i e the sludge with an e3d 2d of 1 was completely homogenous the observation of e3d 2d shows that granular sludge r3 a r3 b and r3 c was more homogenous than the flocs r1 a r1 b r2 a and r2 b table 3 the homogenous granules despite exhibiting a larger fractal dimension exhibited a larger respiration rate fig 6 which is inconsistent with the relationship between 2d fractal dimension df and respiration rate fig 3a such an inconsistency suggests that the respiration rates sourq soure and sourt depended on not only the fractal dimension but also the homogeneity of the sludge at a similar fractal dimension magnitude a greater homogeneity showed a higher respiration rate fig 6 these findings could be used to explain the observed outliers for example for the granular sludge r3 a r3 b and r3 c the sample in r3 b exhibited the smallest value of e3d 2d and it was the most heterogeneous sample among these three reactors r3 a r3 b and r3 c table 3 such a heterogenous structure might contribute to the lowest respiration rates of the sourq soure and sourt the outer liners in fig 1b and 1c by contrast the sample in r1 b showed less heterogeneous structure in the r1 reactors resulting in higher respiration rates of soure fig 2c sourq and sourt fig 3a for the adsorption capacity the finding is similar to the above to say the samples in reactor r2 a fig 2a 2b and 3b and reactor r3 b fig 2a simultaneously had poor adsorption capacity and low values of e3d 2d table 3 therefore the outliers in these figures fig 2a c 3a b suggest that the homogeneity significantly affected the respiration and adsorption performance of sludge it should also be mentioned that the correct estimation of 3d fractal dimension using eq 2 also relies on the homogeneity of the floc population including the density and permeability johnson 1996 since the operational conditions such as srt olr of the seven reactors in this work were within a narrow range and the sludge samples of the reactors in the same run exhibited a slight difference table 1 the effect of heterogeneity was negligible for most of the samples however the heterogeneity of flocs under more diverse operational conditions should be of great concern because the reliability of the relationship between respiration rate and dimensional fractal df depended on the heterogeneity fig 2 when the effect of heterogeneity is not negligible other approaches that eliminate the effect of heterogeneity should be applied to estimate fractal dimension therefore the conditions under which the heterogeneity of the floc structure becomes the predominant factor warrant further investigations a reasonable fractal dimension is a key parameter to simultaneously control aeration and settling tanks compared with the respirogram approach measuring fractal dimension is a complex process and its online implementation is challenging and the measured value varies with the methods used in addition the difference in their theoretical values depends on the homogeneity of sludge structure therefore direct use of fractal dimension in field operation is of great challenge in contrast respirogram has been widely applied in bioreaction tanks li et al 2018a 2018b 2018c in this work it is well demonstrated that direct operation of settling tanks from the biological perspective is possible thus a reasonable range of fractal dimension can be obtained by measuring and tuning the respirogram of the activated sludge system 4 conclusions in this work the bioactivity and structure related properties of activated sludge are investigated the soure and sourq are found to be more closely correlated with the higher dimensional mean diameter than the sourt and the fractal dimension df can be used as a surrogate index of bioactivity and physical structures of sludge once the relationship between the settleability and bioactivity is established the maximum and minimum values of respiration and df are obtained by extrapolation the maximum respiration is approximately 350 390 mg gss h and the maximum df is 1 68 to better control activated sludge systems a rational fractal dimension should be selected by the trade off between bioactivity and settleability of sludge in the operation of wwtps since df connects the settleability and biological activity of activated sludge the transformation from physical characteristics to respiration space enables the biological control of settling tanks based on respirogram using the df as an intermediate variable therefore using the readily measurable respirogram as a proxy of df simultaneous control of bioactivity and settleability can be achieved by adjusting df in a reasonable range through measuring and tuning the respirogram declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
