10510,the concept of groundwater vulnerability is used in groundwater management and risk assessment among the parameters contributing to groundwater vulnerability are depth to groundwater net recharge rate aquifer media topography vadose zone hydraulic conductivity aquifer thickness and pumping density rate in case of over pumping groundwater is considered an important water resource in egypt hence this valuable source should be evaluated against its vulnerability to all possible pollution risks in this research three areas are selected and representing different aquifer types with different hydrogeological characteristics the first area is al minia governorate to represent the nile valley region which is underlain by the nile valley aquifer the second area is wadi al natrun to represent the nile delta fringes region which is underlain by moghra aquifer the last area is el kharga oasis to represent western desert region which is underlain by nubian sandstone aquifer a groundwater vulnerability maps for the three regions are produced using microsoft excel golden software surfer 12 and the analytical hierarchy process method ahp for rating and weighting the contributing eight parameters the main outcome of this research is the vulnerability classification for each region supported by the corresponding vulnerability map the study indicated that the highest weight is assigned to the depth to groundwater and soil media parameters while the lowest weight was assigned to the topography factor the results indicated that for al minia study area about 85 of the aquifer is classified as medium vulnerability and about 11 is low to medium and 4 is medium to high for wadi al natrun study area about 67 of the aquifer is classified as medium vulnerability and about 3 3 is low to medium and 28 7 is medium to high for el kharga oasis study area about 48 8 of the aquifer is classified as medium vulnerability and about 51 5 is low to medium keywords groundwater vulnerability al minia wadi al natrun el kharga oasis 1 introduction egypt is an arid country and water is a major constraint to the development the growing population of egypt agricultural domestic and industrial activities increase water demand due to the gap between water demand and supply the main issue is how egypt protects its water resources under growing population and fixed water budget nile river is the main water resource in egypt which represents 85 of the supply usaid 2001 other sources include precipitation treated wastewater desalination and groundwater groundwater is one of the most important water resources in egypt in egypt there are six main aquifers 1 nile aquifer nubian sandstone aquifer fissured carbonate aquifer moghra aquifer coastal aquifer and fissured hard rock aquifer numerous studies defined the vulnerability term and groundwater vulnerability assessment groundwater vulnerability concept was first discussed by margat 1968 madl szonyi and fule 1998 defined the groundwater vulnerability assessment as a groundwater management tool to assist in groundwater protection strategies harter and walker 2001 defined groundwater vulnerability as an indicator of how hard or ease surface pollution can access a productive aquifer groundwater vulnerability is considered one of the key elements in the decision making process and used in multi criteria decision making tools gogu and dassargues 2000 kholghi 2001 groundwater vulnerability assessment gwva is an indicator of groundwater sensitivity to the surrounding environments and an effective tool for planning and decision making for groundwater management strategies rahman 2008 lindstr√∂m and scharp 1995 gwva is determined by three methods 1 index and overlay methods 2 statistical analysis 3 process based computer simulations and every method can be done by different tools including drastic god and avi and sintacts in porous media and epik and pi in karstic areas there are a number of parameters that are used to assess gwva the selection among these parameters depends on available data and the characteristics of the study area the drastic aller et al 1987 method employs seven parameters for groundwater vulnerability mapping determination depth to groundwater recharge aquifer media texture type of soil media topography impact of vadose zone and aquifer hydraulic conductivity javadi et al 2011 ahmed 2009 el assar et al 2016 el osta et al 2018 masoud and el osta 2016 al rawabdeh et al 2013 used the drastic method for vulnerability assessment in different regions in iran jordon several regions in egypt sohag assuit el baharia and west nile delta respectively ahmed 2009 assessed the vulnerability of the quaternary aquifer in sohag and found that 83 of the vulnerability of the aquifer ranges from high to very high el tahlawi et al 2016 indicated that the vulnerability of the nile aquifer over assiut governorate ranges from moderate to high masoud and el osta 2016 combined the drastic method with gis to get the vulnerability map of the sandstone aquifer in elbahariya they indicated that the northeastern and western parts of nubian sandstone aquifer in el bahariya were dominated by high vulnerability classes while the northwestern and southeastern parts were characterized by medium vulnerability classes the overall objective of the study is to assess groundwater vulnerability in different aquifers three areas selected for this assessment include the nile aquifer in al minia governorate the moghra aquifer in wadi al natrun and the nubian sandstone aquifer in el kharga oasis as shown in fig 1 eight parameters are used in the vulnerability assessment including depth to groundwater aquifer hydraulic conductivity aquifer saturated thickness pumping density aquifer media topography texture of surface soil media and groundwater recharge where field investigation data were used to estimate these parameters 2 materials and methods the purpose of the research is to evaluate groundwater vulnerability for different hydrogeological conditions therefore the study is applied for three study areas that represent three types of different aquifers in egypt the nile aquifer moghra aquifer and the nubian sandstone aquifer from previous studies in this field various methods of assessment were used the most famous of which is drastic aller et al 1987 all assessment methods and drastic aller et al 1987 also depend on setting rates and weights for hydrogeological parameters that directly affect the groundwater vulnerability in this work microsoft excel and golden software surfer 12 were used for numerical rating classifying the data and generating the vulnerability maps for each area the numerical rating was determined by the classification of the baseline conditions for each parameter from the eight parameters each parameter is classified into ranges from 1 to 10 based on their relative effect on the groundwater vulnerability where 10 is the highest vulnerability and 1 refers to the lowest vulnerability the parameter rates were shown in tables 1 8 the eight parameters were mapped and classified into ranges like depth to groundwater aquifer hydraulic conductivity aquifer saturated thickness pumping density topography and groundwater recharge or into significant media types like aquifer media and soil media the weight for each parameter was determined by the analytical hierarchy process method ahp saaty 1980 then the weighted ratings are summed to calculate the vulnerability for each region and the final vulnerability map is based on the index numbers using the following equation v d r d w k r k w t h r t h w q r q w a q r a q w t w t r s w s r r r r w where v is vulnerability dr is depth to groundwater rate dw is depth to groundwater weight kr is hydraulic conductivity rate kw is hydraulic conductivity weight thr is aquifer saturated thickness rate thw is aquifer saturated thickness weight qr is pumping density rate qw is pumping density weight aqr is aquifer media rate aqw is aquifer media weight tr is topography rate tw is topography weight sr is soil media rate sw is soil media weight rr is groundwater recharge rate rw is groundwater recharge weight these eight parameters were selected because these parameters control the transport of pollutants and contaminants in the aquifer 1 depth to groundwater controls the transport of the pollutants to groundwater based on the distance of the groundwater table from the ground surface of the earth in unconfined aquifer and the level of the bottom of the confining layer in confined aquifer 2 hydraulic conductivity it controls the water and contaminants movement in the aquifer 3 aquifer thickness it refers to the available water in the aquifer it refers to the depth between the water table and the base of aquifer in unconfined aquifer and it refers to the thickness between the bottom of the confining layer and the base of aquifer in confined aquifer the higher the value of saturated thickness the less vulnerability of the aquifer 4 pumping density rate it is important in the case of over pumping it represents the abstraction from the groundwater aquifer the higher value of pumping rate the more vulnerable aquifer as a reason for overdraft pumping 5 aquifer media it controls contaminant transport according to the consolidated or unconsolidated medium 6 topography it controls the runoff of pollutant 7 soil media it controls the infiltration of the amount of recharge which is infiltrated to groundwater 8 net recharge rate because it is the quantity of water infiltrates to the aquifer and it helps to transport a contaminant to the water table vertically and within an aquifer horizontally 2 1 study areas the first study area is the nile aquifer within al minia governorate the domain extends between latitudes 30 30 00 to 31 00 00 and longitudes 27 30 00 to 29 00 00 with an area of 8200

area was selected in this research to represent the west delta region in wadi al natrun area groundwater is the only available source and it is vital to be managed in this area the aquifer system is mainly composed of two aquifers 1 pliocene aquifer which consists of sand and clay layers with a thickness ranging from 0 m to 175 m and it is underlain by moghra aquifer fekry and abd el salam 2002 2 moghra aquifer which consists of sand gravel and sandstone with clay intercalations with a thickness ranging from 50 m to 700 m the aquifer is underlain by shale fekry and abd el salam 2002 2 2 3 third area el kharga oasis el kharga oasis is located in the southern part of the western desert it is bounded on north and east by a steep escarpment many subsurface geological studies had been conducted for el kharga oasis shazly 1966 shata 1962 ezzat et al 1968 cedare 2000 el osta 2018 el osta et al 2020 the thickness of the nubian sandstone aquifer was estimated at 1400 m using the correlation of lithology and drilling results of the nine deep wells the nubian sandstone formation consists mainly of alternating beds of clay shale sand and sandstone fig 2 3 results and discussion to create a vulnerability map contour and rating maps for all parameters the surfer software was used the parameter values used in rating and weighting are as follows 3 1 depth to groundwater in these study areas depth to groundwater was obtained from direct measurement of water level in observation wells depth to groundwater is one of the parameters that determine the fate and transport of a contaminant to the aquifer and therefore it is an important parameter to determine aquifer vulnerability the higher the depth to groundwater the less sensitive the aquifer to contamination is in the nile aquifer within al minia study area the depth to groundwater varies from 1 m to 8 m in the flood plain and increases gradually until it reaches 25 m at the western fringes obtained from the data bank of rigw rigw 1992 abu bakr et al 2008 for the moghra aquifer within wadi al natrun study area the depth to groundwater varies from 0 m to 140 m obtained from the data bank of rigw rigw 1990 for nubian sandstone aquifer within el kharga oasis the depth to groundwater varies between 10 150 m obtained from the data bank of rigw rigw 1997 mahmod et al 2013 as shown in fig 3 a b and c the values of depth to groundwater were collected from 2007 to 2017 this parameter was classified into 10 classes i e from 1 to 10 according to the classification shown in table 1 where 10 refers to the highest groundwater table while 1 refers to the lowest groundwater table as shown in fig 4 a b and c there is a big difference between the values of the depth to groundwater table for the three areas based on the hydrogeology nature of each aquifer so there is a difference between the ratings for each area 3 2 hydraulic conductivity it refers to the flexibility of groundwater movement in the aquifer and therefore the transport of the contaminants in the aquifer it is determined by pumping test analysis the higher hydraulic conductivity value the higher groundwater vulnerability is for the study areas the hydraulic conductivity maps were developed using the pumping test analytical results and according to previous studies attia 1985 essam el din 1994 el kashouty et al 2012 for the nile aquifer within al minia study area the hydraulic conductivity ranges from 40 m d to 80 m d and the corresponding map was developed as per the numerical model results of abu bakr et al 2008 for the moghra aquifer within wadi al natrun area the hydraulic conductivity ranges from 5 to 26 m d fekry and abd el salam 2002 for nubian sandstone aquifer within el kharga oasis study area the hydraulic conductivity value ranges from 2 to 6 m d ezzat et al 1968 cedare 2000 abu risha 2013 younis et al 2016 el osta 2018 el osta et al 2020 the maps are shown in fig 5 a b and c this layer was classified

conductivity rates 3 3 aquifer saturated thickness it refers to the difference between the water table and the base of the aquifer the base of the aquifer was determined from geophysical electric resistivity surveys and wells lithology data obtained from the data bank of rigw it is an important parameter for vulnerability assessment the higher the value of aquifer thickness the less vulnerable the aquifer is for the nile aquifer within al minia study area the thickness of the aquifer varies from 500 m in the central part to 50 m in the desert fringes rigw 1992 for the moghra aquifer within wadi al natrun study area the aquifer thickness varies from 100 m to 600 m rigw 1990 for sandstone aquifer within el kharga oasis study area the aquifer thickness varies from 300 m to 1400 m rigw 1997

refers to the minimum saturated thickness as shown in fig 8 a b and c 3 4 pumping density the pumping rate density is the discharge rate per unit horizontal area the higher pumping rate density indicates the more vulnerable the aquifer to overdraft pumping for the three study areas the total extractions from the aquifers are 724 35 430 7 and 249 34 mm3 yr for al minia wadi al natrun and el kharga oasis study areas respectively obtained from the data bank of rigw as shown in fig 9 a b and c this parameter was classified into 10 classes from 1 to 10 according to the classification shown in table 4 where 1 refers to the lowest pumping density rate while 10 refers to the highest pumping density rate as shown in fig 10 a b and c 3 5 aquifer media it refers to the aquifer soil properties information on the aquifer soil was determined from the geological maps hydrogeological maps and wells lithology rigw 1990 1992 rigw 1997 the aquifer soil controls water movement and contaminants natural attenuation for the nile aquifer within al minia study area the aquifer consists of alluvial deposits mainly sand and gravel rigw 1992 conoco 1987 for the moghra aquifer within wadi al natrun study area the aquifer consists of graded sand and gravel rigw 1990 conoco 1987 for sandstone aquifer within el kharga oasis study area the aquifer consists of sandstone rigw 1997 conoco 1987 as shown in fig 11 a b and c this parameter was classified into 10 classes from 1 to 10 according to the classification shown in table 5 where 1 refers to the lowest hydraulic conductivity value while 10 refers to the highest hydraulic conductivity value as shown in fig 12 a b and c 3 6 topography and surface slope digital elevation model helps to obtain slope maps surface slope controls the water and contaminates runoff steep slopes allow more runoff and reduce the potential for infiltration but mild slopes reduce high runoff and increase the potential for infiltration the higher vulnerability for low slope lands and the lower vulnerability for steep slope lands in al minia the topography ranges from 30 m to 50 m in the floodplains and 150 m in the escarpment east and west areas in wadi al natrun which is located in the west delta topography reaches 10 m inside wadi al natrun depression and reaches 30 m in the direction of the nile delta and about 150 m in the south and the west south area outside the depression for el kharga area the depression is a prominent feature the level of the depression is less by100 m than that of the plateau the depression floor is between 300 and 400 m below the surrounding plateau the lowest point inside the depression is 2 0 m whereas the highest point is 500 m outside the depression as shown in fig 13 a b and c the land slope for the three study areas reaches 3 76 2 35 and 4 04 for al minia wadi al natrun and el kharga respectively this layer was classified into 10 classes from 1 to 10 according to classification shown in table 6 where 1 refers to the steepest land slope while 10 refers to the mildest land slope as shown in fig 14 a b and c 3 7 soil media groundwater recharge water infiltration contaminant transport interaction between groundwater and surface water all these parameters depend on soil media soil cover or surface soil media control infiltration and groundwater recharge when the soil is more permeable such as gravel sand and sandy gravel the aquifer is more vulnerable while the aquifer will be less vulnerable for less permeable soils such as loam rock loamy sand sandy clay silty clay clay loam and clay according to the soil map of egypt hammad 1975 soil cover in al minia is classified as the nile alluvium in the flood plain gravel sandy gravel in the fringes sand sheets and limestone plateau in the escarpment in wadi al natrun the soil media is classified into sand and brown loamy sands in the north in the south the soil is classified into sabkha and sandy gravel with brown loamy soil in el kharga oasis soil media included 1 stony loamy sand 2 shallow or stony loamy sand 3 sandy soil with stones 3 brown loamy soils 4 sand dunes and sand sheets 5 rocky escarpments of rocks 6 sand soils of sandstone as shown in fig 15 a b and c this parameter was classified into 10 classes from 1 to 10 according to the soil texture classification shown in table 7 where 10 refers to the most permeable soil while 1 refers to the least permeable soil as shown in fig 16 a b and c 3 8 groundwater recharge net recharge is defined as water quantity per unit area which infiltrates from the ground surface to the groundwater table it is an important parameter for the transport of contaminants the source of groundwater recharge is the excess irrigation water canal seepage and precipitation the higher recharge rate is the greater groundwater vulnerability is the recharge value depends on the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil which allows the water to infiltrate from ground surface to groundwater table as shown in fig 17 a b and c this parameter was classified into 10 classes from 1 to 10 according to the recharge rate shown in table 8 where 10 refers to the highest recharge rate while 1 refers to the lowest recharge rate as shown in fig 18 a b and c 3 9 vulnerability map determination to determine the groundwater vulnerability the following equation is used v d r d w k r k w t h r t h w q r q w a q r a q w t w t r s w s r r r r w where v is the groundwater vulnerability d is the depth to groundwater k is the hydraulic conductivity th is the aquifer thickness q is the pumping density aq is the aquifer media t is the topography s is the soil media and r is the net recharge rate r is the parameter rate and w is the parameter weight eight parameters were selected to assess groundwater vulnerability in the three study areas a number of methods are used to determine the weight of the parameters the analytical hierarchy process method ahp is employed in this study it is developed by saaty in the year 1980 and frequently used for multi criteria decision making it is used for analyzing complex decisions relying on mathematical models and based on making comparisons between parameters the result of this method is the estimation of weight for each parameter the higher the weight of the parameter the more important it will be in the assessment the weights of the parameters were calculated by ahp method in three steps 1 creating a comparison matrix to compute the vector of criteria weights this matrix is eight by eight matrix the diagonal element always equals one the numbers in the upper triangular matrix are determined by a comparison between the eight parameters according to the previous studies and the author s estimation the comparison matrix using saaty 1980 is as follows c o m p a r i s o n m a t r i x d d k t h q a q t s r 1 00 3 00 4 00 4 00 3 00 5 00 1 00 2 00 k t h q a q t s r 0 33 0 25 0 25 0 33 0 20 1 00 0 50 1 00

divided by the sum of its column as shown in the following reciprocal matrix r e c i p r o c a l m a t r i x d d k t h q a q t s r 0 26 0 27 0 21 0 21 0 27 0 17 0 26 0 29 k t h q a q t s r 0 09 0 06 0

matrix which means get the sum of the raw and divide it on the number of parameters the priority vector shows the relative weight for each parameter w d w k w t h w q w a q w t w s w r 0 243 0 11 0 056 0 056 0 11 0 032 0 243 0 152 4 check of consistency in this step the consistency ratio is calculated to measure how consistent the solution according to the consistency ratio cr if the consistency ratio is less than 0 1 it means that the solution is trustworthy and sufficiently consistent to check the consistency ratio of the matrix the consistency index ci is calculated it depends on the principal eigenvalue Œª and the number of parameters n principal eigenvalue Œª was calculated from the summation of parameters between each element of eigenvector the sum of the reciprocal matrix is Œª 8 4 c i Œª n n 1 0 0567 in our case study the consistency ratio is 0 0402 it indicates that the solution is trusted so the consistency is acceptable c r c i r i 0 0402 0 1 since cr 0 0402 0 1 the judgements are acceptable and the solution is trusted the results of the author s estimation indicate that the weight for each parameter according to the priority vector is depth to groundwater d is 24 3 hydraulic conductivity k is 11 aquifer thickness th is 5 6 pumping density q is 5 5 aquifer media is 11 topography t is 3 2 soil media s is 24 3 and net recharge rate r is 15 2 the results of hierarchy process method indicate that depth to groundwater and soil media are the most important parameters then recharge rate then hydraulic conductivity and aquifer media then aquifer thickness and pumping density and the less important parameter is topography the results proved that the depth to groundwater recharge aquifer media and soil media is the most effective parameters in groundwater vulnerability and the evidence for this is the high weight of these parameters in drastic method and previous studies the rates and the weights of the parameters are combined based on equation 1 to determine the vulnerability map for each study area these maps shown in fig 19 a b and c help visualize which areas are more vulnerable to groundwater contamination and groundwater overdraft the results indicate the following for the nile aquifer within al minia study area the flood plain areas are characterized by medium vulnerability classes the vulnerability rates decreased from medium to low when moving towards the fringes for the moghra aquifer within wadi al natrun study area the southern areas are classified by medium to high vulnerability classes and the northern areas are classified as medium vulnerability classes for sandstone aquifer within el kharga oasis study area the eastern areas are classified as low to medium vulnerability classes the western areas are characterized by medium vulnerability rates inside el kharga depression the vulnerability rate is classified as medium to low to verify the accuracy of the results in the first region we note that groundwater vulnerability increases in the places of the nile valley and flood plain and decreases as we go to the western fringes due to the small values of the depth to groundwater and the high values of the hydraulic conductivity and the increasing in the pumping rates in the second region we note that groundwater vulnerability increases in the places in which the groundwater table is near to the surface of the earth such as areas within the wadi al natrun depression and also increases in the northern agricultural areas where the recharge rate increases in the third region due to the presence of shale layers on the eastern parts therefore the groundwater vulnerability decreases but it increases in the western parts and central regions due to the presence of sandstone and the near groundwater table to the surface especially inside al khraga depression 4 conclusions groundwater vulnerability assessment is an effective decision making tool which should be considered in land use planning and development of groundwater resource management plans vulnerability mapping is used to help decision makers select the sites suitable for future reclamation the study focuses on the assessment of aquifer vulnerability in three areas with different hydrogeological conditions nile aquifer within al minia the moghra aquifer within wadi al natrun and sandstone aquifer within el kharga oasis to represent different aquifer types with different hydrogeological characteristics therefore the comparison is based on the hydrogeological parameters eight parameters were addressed in the assessment of groundwater vulnerability in the study areas including depth to groundwater hydraulic conductivity saturated thickness aquifer media topography pumping density soil media and groundwater recharge the rates of the eight parameters were classified based on the hydrogeological settings of each study area the results indicated that for al minia study area about 85 of the aquifer is classified as medium vulnerability and about 11 is low to medium and 4 is medium to high for wadi al natrun study area about 67 of the aquifer is classified as medium vulnerability and about 3 3 is low to medium and 28 7 is medium to high for el kharga oasis study area about 48 8 of the aquifer is classified as medium vulnerability and about 51 5 is low to medium based on the research results it is recommended that the most suitable area for the new reclamation activity should be located in low vulnerability zones including the western fringes of a minia study area the

sandstone aquifer in el bahariya were dominated by high vulnerability classes while the northwestern and southeastern parts were characterized by medium vulnerability classes the overall objective of the study is to assess groundwater vulnerability in different aquifers three areas selected for this assessment include the nile aquifer in al minia governorate the moghra aquifer in wadi al natrun and the nubian sandstone aquifer in el kharga oasis as shown in fig 1 eight parameters are used in the vulnerability assessment including depth to groundwater aquifer hydraulic conductivity aquifer saturated thickness pumping density aquifer media topography texture of surface soil media and groundwater recharge where field investigation data were used to estimate these parameters 2 materials and methods the purpose of the research is to evaluate groundwater vulnerability for different hydrogeological conditions therefore the study is applied for three study areas that represent three types of different aquifers in egypt the nile aquifer moghra aquifer and the nubian sandstone aquifer from previous studies in this field various methods of assessment were used the most famous of which is drastic aller et al 1987 all assessment methods and drastic aller et al 1987 also depend on setting rates and weights for hydrogeological parameters that directly affect the groundwater vulnerability in this work microsoft excel and golden software surfer 12 were used for numerical rating classifying the data and generating the vulnerability maps for each area the numerical rating was determined by the classification of the baseline conditions for each parameter from the eight parameters each parameter is classified into ranges from 1 to 10 based on their relative effect on the groundwater vulnerability where 10 is the highest vulnerability and 1 refers to the lowest vulnerability the parameter rates were shown in tables 1 8 the eight parameters were mapped and classified into ranges like depth to groundwater aquifer hydraulic conductivity aquifer saturated thickness pumping density topography and groundwater recharge or into significant media types like aquifer media and soil media the weight for each parameter was determined by the analytical hierarchy process method ahp saaty 1980 then the weighted ratings are summed to calculate the vulnerability for each region and the final vulnerability map is based on the index numbers using the following equation v d r d w k r k w t h r t h w q r q w a q r a q w t w t r s w s r r r r w where v is vulnerability dr is depth to groundwater rate dw is depth to groundwater weight kr is hydraulic conductivity rate kw is hydraulic conductivity weight thr is aquifer saturated thickness rate thw is aquifer saturated thickness weight qr is pumping density rate qw is pumping density weight aqr is aquifer media rate aqw is aquifer media weight tr is topography rate tw is topography weight sr is soil media rate sw is soil media weight rr is groundwater recharge rate rw is groundwater recharge weight these eight parameters were selected because these parameters control the transport of pollutants and contaminants in the aquifer 1 depth to groundwater controls the transport of the pollutants to groundwater based on the distance of the groundwater table from the ground surface of the earth in unconfined aquifer and the level of the bottom of the confining layer in confined aquifer 2 hydraulic conductivity it controls the water and contaminants movement in the aquifer 3 aquifer thickness it refers to the available water in the aquifer it refers to the depth between the water table and the base of aquifer in unconfined aquifer and it refers to the thickness between the bottom of the confining layer and the base of aquifer in confined aquifer the higher the value of saturated thickness the less vulnerability of the aquifer 4 pumping density rate it is important in the case of over pumping it represents the abstraction from the groundwater aquifer the higher value of pumping rate the more vulnerable aquifer as a reason for overdraft pumping 5 aquifer media it controls contaminant transport according to the consolidated or unconsolidated medium 6 topography it controls the runoff of pollutant 7 soil media it controls the infiltration of the amount of recharge which is infiltrated to groundwater 8 net recharge rate because it is the quantity of water infiltrates to the aquifer and it helps to transport a contaminant to the water table vertically and within an aquifer horizontally

correlation of lithology and drilling results of the nine deep wells the nubian sandstone formation consists mainly of alternating beds of clay shale sand and sandstone fig 2 3 results and discussion to create a vulnerability map contour and rating maps for all parameters the surfer software was used the parameter values used in rating and weighting are as follows 3 1 depth to groundwater in these study areas depth to groundwater was obtained from direct measurement of water level in observation wells depth to groundwater is one of the parameters that determine the fate and transport of a contaminant to the aquifer and therefore it is an important parameter to determine aquifer vulnerability the higher the depth to groundwater the less sensitive the aquifer to contamination is in the nile aquifer within al minia study area the depth to groundwater varies from 1 m to 8 m in the flood plain and increases gradually until it reaches 25 m at the western fringes obtained from the data bank of rigw rigw 1992 abu bakr et al 2008 for the moghra aquifer within wadi al natrun study area the depth to groundwater varies from 0 m to 140 m obtained from the data bank of rigw rigw 1990 for

of depth to groundwater were collected from 2007 to 2017 this parameter was classified into 10 classes i e from 1 to 10 according to the classification shown in table 1 where 10 refers to the highest groundwater table while 1 refers to the lowest groundwater table as shown in fig 4 a b and c there is a big difference between the values of the depth to groundwater table for the three areas based on the hydrogeology nature of each aquifer so there is a difference between the ratings for each area 3 2 hydraulic conductivity it refers to the flexibility of groundwater movement in the aquifer and therefore the transport of the contaminants in the aquifer it is determined by pumping test analysis the higher hydraulic conductivity value the higher groundwater vulnerability is for the study areas the hydraulic conductivity maps were developed using the pumping test analytical results and according to previous studies attia 1985 essam el din 1994 el kashouty et al 2012 for the nile aquifer

refers to the minimum saturated thickness as shown in fig 8 a b and c 3 4 pumping density the pumping rate density is the discharge rate per unit horizontal area the higher pumping rate density indicates the more vulnerable the aquifer to overdraft pumping for the three study areas the total extractions from the aquifers are 724 35 430 7 and 249 34 mm3 yr for al minia wadi al natrun and el kharga oasis study areas respectively obtained from the data bank of rigw as shown in fig 9 a b and c this parameter was classified into 10 classes from 1 to 10 according to the classification shown in table 4 where 1 refers to the lowest pumping density rate while 10 refers to the highest pumping density rate as shown in fig 10 a b and c 3 5 aquifer media it refers to the aquifer soil properties information on the aquifer soil was determined from the geological maps hydrogeological maps and wells lithology rigw 1990 1992 rigw 1997 the aquifer soil controls water movement and contaminants natural attenuation for the nile aquifer within al minia study area the aquifer consists of alluvial deposits mainly sand and gravel rigw 1992 conoco 1987 for the moghra aquifer within wadi al natrun study area the aquifer consists of graded sand and gravel rigw 1990 conoco 1987 for sandstone aquifer within el kharga oasis study area the aquifer consists of sandstone rigw 1997 conoco 1987 as shown in fig 11 a b and c this parameter was classified into 10 classes from 1 to 10 according to the classification shown in table 5 where 1 refers to the lowest hydraulic conductivity value while 10 refers to the highest hydraulic conductivity value as shown in fig 12 a b and c 3 6 topography and surface slope digital elevation model helps to obtain slope maps surface slope controls the water and contaminates runoff steep slopes allow more runoff and reduce the potential for infiltration but mild slopes reduce high runoff and increase the potential for infiltration the higher vulnerability for low slope lands and the lower vulnerability for steep slope lands in al minia the topography ranges from 30 m to 50 m in the floodplains and 150 m in the escarpment east and west areas in wadi al natrun which is located in the west delta topography reaches 10 m inside wadi al natrun depression and reaches 30 m in the direction of the nile delta and about 150 m in the south and the west south area outside the depression for el kharga area the depression is a prominent feature the level of the depression is less by100 m than that of the plateau the depression floor is between 300 and 400 m below the surrounding plateau the lowest point inside the depression is 2 0 m whereas the highest point is 500 m outside the depression as shown in fig 13 a b and c the land slope for the three study areas reaches 3 76 2 35 and 4 04 for al minia wadi al natrun and el kharga respectively this layer was classified into 10 classes from 1 to 10 according to classification shown in table 6 where 1 refers to the steepest land slope while 10 refers to the mildest land slope as shown in fig 14 a b and c 3 7 soil media groundwater recharge water infiltration contaminant transport interaction between groundwater and surface water all these parameters depend on soil media soil cover or surface soil media control infiltration and groundwater recharge when the soil is more permeable such as gravel sand and sandy gravel the aquifer is more vulnerable while the aquifer will be less vulnerable for less permeable soils such as loam rock loamy sand sandy clay silty clay clay loam and clay according to the soil map of egypt hammad 1975 soil cover in al minia is classified as the nile alluvium in the flood plain gravel sandy gravel in the fringes sand sheets and limestone plateau in the escarpment in wadi al natrun the soil media is classified into sand and brown loamy sands in the north in the south the soil is classified into sabkha and sandy gravel with brown loamy soil in el kharga oasis soil media included 1 stony loamy sand 2 shallow or stony loamy sand 3 sandy soil with stones 3 brown loamy soils 4 sand dunes and sand sheets 5 rocky escarpments of rocks 6 sand soils of sandstone as shown in fig 15 a b and c this parameter was classified into 10 classes from 1 to 10 according to the soil texture classification shown in table 7 where 10 refers to the most permeable soil while 1 refers to the least permeable soil as shown in fig 16 a b and c 3 8 groundwater recharge net recharge is defined as water quantity per unit area which infiltrates from the ground surface to the groundwater table it is an important parameter for the transport of contaminants the source of groundwater recharge is the excess irrigation water canal seepage and precipitation the higher recharge rate is the greater groundwater vulnerability is the recharge value depends on the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil which allows the water to infiltrate from ground surface to groundwater table as shown in fig 17 a b and c this parameter was classified into 10 classes from 1 to 10 according to the recharge rate shown in table 8 where 10 refers to the highest recharge rate while 1 refers to the lowest recharge rate as shown in fig 18 a b and c 3 9 vulnerability map determination to determine the groundwater vulnerability the following equation is used v d r d w k r k w t h r t h w q r q w a q r a q w t w t r s w s r r r r w where v is the groundwater vulnerability d is the depth to groundwater k is the hydraulic conductivity th is the aquifer thickness q is the pumping density aq is the aquifer media t is the topography s is the soil media and r is the net recharge rate r is the parameter rate and w is the parameter weight eight parameters were selected to assess groundwater vulnerability in the three study areas a number of methods are used to determine the weight of the parameters the analytical hierarchy process method ahp is employed in this study it is developed by saaty in the year 1980 and frequently used for multi criteria decision making it is used for analyzing complex decisions relying on mathematical models and based on making comparisons between parameters the result of this method is the estimation of weight for each parameter the higher the weight of the parameter the more important it will be in the assessment the weights of the parameters were calculated by ahp method in three steps 1 creating a comparison matrix to compute the vector of criteria weights this matrix is eight by eight matrix the diagonal element always equals one the numbers in the upper triangular matrix are determined by a comparison between the eight parameters according to the previous studies and the author s estimation the comparison matrix using saaty 1980 is as follows c o m p a r i s o n m a t r i x d d k t h q a q t s r 1 00 3 00 4 00 4 00 3 00 5 00 1 00 2 00 k t h q a q t s r 0 33 0 25 0 25 0 33 0 20 1 00 0 50 1 00

0 50 0 50 0 33 0 33 0 50 0 25 2 00 1 00 2 creating a reciprocal matrix from a comparison matrix some of each column is calculated to get the reciprocal matrix then each element of the matrix was divided by the sum of its column as shown in the following reciprocal matrix r e c i p r o c a l m a t r i x d d k t h q a q t s r 0 26 0 27 0 21 0 21 0 27 0 17 0 26 0 29 k t h q a q t s r 0 09 0 06 0

matrix which means get the sum of the raw and divide it on the number of parameters the priority vector shows the relative weight for each parameter w d w k w t h w q w a q w t w s w r 0 243 0 11 0 056 0 056 0 11 0 032 0 243 0 152 4 check of consistency in this step the consistency ratio is calculated to measure how consistent the solution according to the consistency ratio cr if the consistency ratio is less than 0 1 it means that the solution is trustworthy and sufficiently consistent to check the consistency ratio of the matrix the consistency index ci is calculated it depends on the principal eigenvalue Œª and the number of parameters n principal eigenvalue Œª was calculated from the summation of parameters between each element of eigenvector the sum of the reciprocal matrix is Œª 8 4 c i Œª n n 1 0 0567 in our case study the consistency ratio is 0 0402 it indicates that the solution is trusted so the consistency is acceptable c r c i r i 0 0402 0 1 since cr 0 0402 0 1 the judgements are acceptable and the solution is trusted the results of the author s estimation indicate that the weight for each parameter according to the priority vector is depth to groundwater d is 24 3 hydraulic conductivity k is 11 aquifer thickness th is 5 6 pumping density q is 5 5 aquifer media is 11 topography t is 3 2 soil media s is 24 3 and net recharge rate r is 15 2 the results of hierarchy process method indicate that depth to groundwater and soil media are the most important parameters then recharge rate then hydraulic conductivity and aquifer media then aquifer thickness and pumping density and the less important parameter is topography the results proved that the depth to groundwater recharge aquifer media and soil media is the most effective parameters in groundwater vulnerability and the evidence for this is the high weight of these parameters in drastic method and previous studies the rates and the weights of the parameters are combined based on equation 1 to determine the vulnerability map for each study area these maps shown in fig 19 a b and c help visualize which areas are more vulnerable to groundwater contamination and groundwater overdraft the results indicate the following for the nile aquifer within al minia study area the flood plain areas are characterized by medium vulnerability classes the vulnerability rates decreased from medium to low when moving towards the fringes for the moghra aquifer within wadi al natrun study area the southern areas are classified by medium to high vulnerability classes and the northern areas are classified as medium vulnerability classes for sandstone aquifer within el kharga oasis study area the eastern areas are classified as low to medium vulnerability classes the western areas are characterized by medium vulnerability rates inside el kharga depression the vulnerability rate is classified as medium to low to verify the accuracy of the results in the first region we note that groundwater vulnerability increases in the places of the nile valley and flood plain and decreases as we go to the western fringes due to the small values of the depth to groundwater and the high values of the hydraulic conductivity and the increasing in the pumping rates in the second region we note that groundwater vulnerability increases in the places in which the groundwater table is near to the surface of the earth such as areas within the wadi al natrun depression and also increases in the northern agricultural areas where the recharge rate increases in the third region due to the presence of shale layers on the eastern parts therefore the groundwater vulnerability decreases but it increases in the western parts and central regions due to the presence of sandstone and the near groundwater table to the surface especially inside al khraga depression 4 conclusions groundwater vulnerability assessment is an effective decision making tool which should be considered in land use planning and development of groundwater resource management plans vulnerability mapping is used to help decision makers select the sites suitable for future reclamation the study focuses on the assessment of aquifer vulnerability in three areas with different hydrogeological conditions nile aquifer within al minia the moghra aquifer within wadi al natrun and sandstone aquifer within el kharga oasis to represent different aquifer types with different hydrogeological characteristics therefore the comparison is based on the hydrogeological parameters eight parameters were addressed in the assessment of groundwater vulnerability in the study areas including depth to groundwater hydraulic conductivity saturated thickness aquifer media topography pumping density soil media and groundwater recharge the rates of the eight parameters were classified based on the hydrogeological settings of each study area the results indicated that for al minia study area about 85 of the aquifer is classified as medium vulnerability and about 11 is low to medium and 4 is medium to high for wadi al natrun study area about 67 of the aquifer is classified as medium vulnerability and about 3 3 is low to medium and 28 7 is medium to high for el kharga oasis study area about 48 8 of the aquifer is classified as medium vulnerability and about 51 5 is low to medium based on the research results it is recommended that the most suitable area for the new reclamation activity should be located in low vulnerability zones including the western fringes of a minia study area the south part of wadi al natrun study area and the east part of el kharga oasis declaration of competing interest this research paper is considered as a scientific research production of academic

10511,in iran pistachio pistachia vera l orchards are mostly irrigated by surface irrigation in this research the border surface irrigation method was compared to five different irrigation systems the research was carried out for four years at the pistachio research center of iran iprc in rafsanjan a split plot design was used with six irrigation systems with main plots surface drip subsurface porous pipe bubbler t tape and pottery cylinder and three subplots of 10 20 and 30 class a evaporation pan 685 1370 and 2055 m3 ha 1 year 1 generally seedling performance increased with level of irrigation the best results for seedling height trunk diameter leaf number and leaf area were with the pottery cylinder and drip systems and the 30 irrigation treatment the poorest results were with the surface and t tape systems and the 10 irrigation treatment the highest salinity was with the subsurface system and the 10 irrigation treatment and the t tape system with the 10 and 20 irrigation treatments the lowest salinity with the lowest irrigation treatment was with the pottery cylinder and drip system with the 20 and 30 irrigation treatments the pottery cylinder system had the highest common thin roots at 60 90 cm and the drip system had many thin roots at 30 60 cm overall the pottery cylinder and drip systems were best for pistachio seedlings keywords applied water drip irrigation system pistachio seedling soil salinity water management 1 introduction there are more than 45 7000 ha of bearing and nonbearing pistachio orchards in iran mainly in kerman province with 57 of total pistachio growing areas bureau of statistics and information technology 2017 in recent years pistachio planting has developed in other arid and semi arid regions of iran where the production of fruits and nuts is fully dependent upon irrigation naor 2010 pistachio orchards are mostly irrigated by surface irrigation method and efficiency has been reported to be 47 7 during one decade 1990 2000 in kerman province ashrefi et al 2006 development of pistachio using surface irrigation has contributed to severe decline of the groundwater table in the pistachio growing areas of iran therefore optimized use of available water resources and modern irrigation in this region is necessary for both new and mature pistachio orchards which have suitable soil and water quality for irrigation others have tested different irrigation systems in fruit orchards chopade et al 2001 in their seven year research on mature pomegranate trees reported that drip and bubbler irrigation systems increased the yield by 30 40 with lower water application 23 24 compared with surface irrigation control al amoud 2008 and abdel naby 2016 reported the suitability of bubbler irrigation system for irrigating orchards similarly sokalska et al 2009 reported highest apple yield with less frequent drip irrigation in california drip irrigation management of mature pistachio trees was studied by phene et al 1985 showing no significant difference between the quality and quantity of yield in pistachio trees treated by a 25 decrease in water application from 11 500 m3 ha 1 year 1 as control however a significant decline was reported for quality and quantity of yield with a 50 75 decrease in water application studies by arastirma 2004 on application of drip irrigation on mature pistachio trees in turkey revealed that use of drip irrigation on mature pistachio trees increased yield from 11 8 15 2 kg per tree in choosing the irrigation system the physiological properties of each plant are very effective in the resistance of the plant to shortage of water ooi et al 2005 although the pistachio nut tree has drought tolerance proper irrigation especially during summer months increases productivity iniesta et al 2008 kirnak et al 2001 mohammadi mohammadabadi et al 2008 sedaghati et al 2012 testi et al 2008 more iranian researchers have studied irrigation systems on mature pistachio trees as farmers change from surface to pressurized irrigation methods kuhestani 1996 studied the adaptability of pistachio trees to different types of subsurface irrigation reducing the amount of applied water to 20 of class a evaporation pan in sandy loam soil decreasing water applied caused a 20 decrease in yield compared to surface irrigation and he suggested the application of higher water volumes mohammadi mohammadabadi et al 2008 reported that changing the irrigation system from surface to subsurface porous pipe on mature pistachio trees is possible with applied water amounts of 4783 and 7174 m3 ha 1 year 1 also sedaghati et al 2012 compared the effects of surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems on growth and yield of mature pistachio trees they irrigated with 60 of the water requirement for surface irrigation 4398 m3 ha 1 during growth season and found that drip line buried 30 cm resulted in a 25 water saving over drip line placed on the soil surface sedaghati and fardad 2001 evaluated micro irrigation systems available in pistachio orchards of rafsanjan they stated water distribution uniformity in drip irrigation is better than the bubbler method they also found poor irrigation performance was due to improper irrigation scheduling and the lack of pressure regulation in recent years different irrigation systems in pistachio orchards have been used but have not been tested on pistachio seedlings thus in this research five irrigation systems including drip bubbler subsurface porous pipe t tape and pottery cylinder are compared with conventional or surface method on pistachio from the time of planting 2 materials and methods this research was conducted in the station of pistachio research center located in northwest of rafsanjan in kerman

through november and irrigation treatments of 10 20 and 30 of class a evaporation pan et were calculated table 4 volumes of applied water table 4 were calculated based on average of pan evaporation for 4 years table 1 average of irrigation border width 166 cm duration of the experiment 4 years and wetted area percentage 27 64 to calculate the volume of applied water in different methods the surface irrigation method was used for the other irrigation system the seedlings were irrigated weekly from april to november irrigation water was supplied from a 1000 m3 pool supplied by a well fig 1 shows layout of trees and irrigation system in the surface method the seedlings were irrigated with the traditional pistachio orchard irrigation method and an input water flow of 480 l min 1 in the drip and bubbler irrigation systems for every seedling one hole was used with the discharge flow of 6 75 and 39 l h 1 respectively lines of the pressured systems were 10 cm from the seedlings in the subsurface irrigation system a porous pipe 30 cm beneath the soil surface was offset 10 cm from the seedlings applying 6 7 l h 1 m 1 in the t tape irrigation system 3 1 l h 1 emitters were spaced 30 cm apart in the pottery cylinder irrigation system for every seedling a group of cylinders were with a height of 45 cm and 7 5 cm diameter with equally spaced 75 cm apart and placed vertically of 10 cm from the seedlings and connected by a polyethylene tube the distance between cylinder groups was 1 5 m the average permeability of each pottery cylinder was 1 91 l h 1 the average performance pressure of all systems in this research was 81 06 kpa soil leaching was not carried out among experiment every year at the end of august the number of leaves was counted and the area of 10 leaves determined using an area meter device the total area of the leaves for every seedling was calculated by multiplying the average leaf area by the number of the total leaves each year in november the vegetative growth of the seedlings and their trunk diameter was measured 3 cm above the soil surface thin root density and ece 40 cm from the seedlings at 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm were determined at the end of the experiment determination of thin root density was based on soil description method schoeneberger et al 2012 we determined the sum of very fine 1 mm diameter and fine roots 1 to 2 mm diameter for 1 cm2 to measure thin root density for each soil depth 1 cm2 areas were selected and the thin roots were counted and averaged other operations of crop management including nutrition pests and weeds control were performed on all the treatments to determine the best irrigation system and the most appropriate amount of consumed water data was statistically analyzed using sas software and means compared by duncan s multiple range test at 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 seedling height the effect of water volume and irrigation upon plant height was significant fig 2 height increased with increased water volumes the pottery cylinder had the highest 95 cm height and the surface irrigation had the lowest 56 cm height the drip irrigation ranked 2nd in height the lowest height was with 10 water and the t tape irrigation fig 2 ada and mohamed 2016 reported drip irrigation on young date palm trees gave the highest values of vegetative growth compared to conventional basin irrigation our results are similar showing the drip and pottery cylinder superior to the surface irrigation 3 2 seedling trunk diameter the effect of the irrigation system and amounts of consumed water on the diameter of pistachio the seedling trunks were significant there was a significant difference p 0 05 between the levels of consumed water 10 20 and 30 and average diameters of 21 19 and 16 mm respectively comparing the irrigation systems indicated that the highest diameter was for the pottery cylinder system 22 mm and the lowest was for the surface and t tape systems 16 and 16 4 mm the interaction between the irrigation systems and amounts of applied water showed that the pottery cylinder system had the highest diameter 26 3 mm with 30 water and the t tape and surface treatments had the lowest diameters 11 7 and 13 6 mm respectively each with 10 water fig 3 3 3 number of leaves the average number of leaves in each seedling is illustrated in fig 4 the interaction between irrigation systems and the amounts of applied water revealed increased number of leaves with increased water the pottery cylinder irrigation system with an average of 78 leaves in every seedling was better than the other methods and the highest number of leaves in the seedlings irrigated by the highest amount of water 30 in the pottery cylinder was 120 however the seedlings irrigated with the lowest amount of water 10 through the t tape method had the lowest number of leaves 21 there was a statistically significant difference p 0 05 between all the levels of applied water 10 20 and 30 so that the highest number of leaves in each seedling 71 was related to those seedlings that were watered with 30 water and the lowest number 41 was related to those that were irrigated with 10 water 3 4 leaf area results related to measuring total area of the leaves in each seedling are presented in fig 5 leaf area increased from the lowest to highest amounts of applied water there was a significant difference p 0 05 among all the amounts of applied water 10 20 and 30 so that the highest leaf area 1765 cm2 and the lowest 917 cm2 were related to those seedlings that had received 30 and 10 respectively among all the irrigation systems the highest leaf area belonged to the pottery cylinder and drip systems with an average of 1915 and 1776 cm2 respectively the t tape and surface irrigation systems had the lowest leaf areas 936 and 876 cm2 respectively the pottery cylinder stem with 30 water had the highest leaf area 3100 cm2 and the lowest leaf area belonged to the t tape and surface systems both with the amount of 10 water 3 5 thin root density thin root density was determined at the end of experiment table 5 it was the sum of very fine and fine roots with 2 mm diameter although roots volume was variable based on the amounts of water in different irrigation systems distribution of thin roots by soil depth was approximately the same for all the amounts of applied water and irrigation methods the second depth 30 60 cm had the highest density of thin roots table 5 overall the most roots were at the 30 60 cm depth the bubbler system had the most thin roots at the 0 30 cm depth the drip system had the most roots at the 30 60 cm depth and the pottery cylinder system had the most roots at the 60 90 cm depth root density affects availability of water and vice versa high root density means a reduction in average distance between roots steeper water potential gradients and steeper concentration gradients of mineral nutrients in the soil and accordingly they resulted in a greater use efficiency of water and mineral resources present in the soil volume explored by roots xiloyannis et al 2012 3 6 soil salinity fig 6 shows that soil salinity decreased by increasing the amount of applied water comparison of the irrigation systems showed that the highest salinity belonged to the subsurface and t tape systems and the lowest soil salinity was with the drip and pottery cylinder systems furthermore the maximum soil salinity was measured at depths of 0 30 cm in the subsurface irrigation systems with the 10 treatment and the t tape with 10 and 20 averaging ece 7 1 7 5 and 7 1 ds m 1 respectively in contrast the lowest soil salinity values were for the drip and pottery cylinder irrigation systems in 20 and 30 water treatment with average ece 3 2 and 3 1 ds m 1 respectively since the t tape system had water outlets 30 cm apart the depth of irrigation water at any point was probably less than that of other systems making salt accumulation greater in the subsurface porous pipe system where the pipeline was placed 30 cm deep salts significantly accumulated on the soil surface with all amounts of water 4 conclusions this study examined the four year outcome of using six irrigation systems and three irrigation levels from the time of planting of one year old seedlings upon the growth of seedlings thin root development and soil salinity pistachio seedlings had better growth in the presence of higher amounts of water and the pottery cylinder and drip treatments were better in plant height trunk diameter number of leaves and total leaf area robles et al 2016 indicated subsurface drip irrigation changed trunk daily fluctuations compared with the surface drip system in lemon trees senthilkumar 2002 observed an increased leaf area and subsequent increase in photosynthetic activity favoring yield components under system of rice intensification sri practices our results show that applying higher amounts of water can improve establishment of the seedlings similar to our work doll 2017 recommends irrigation using 10 20 30 and 40 of class a pan et in pistachio seedling for years 1 2 3 and 4 respectively also similar

10511,in iran pistachio pistachia vera l orchards are mostly irrigated by surface irrigation in this research the border surface irrigation method was compared to five different irrigation systems the research was carried out for four years at the pistachio research center of iran iprc in rafsanjan a split plot design was used with six irrigation systems with main plots surface drip subsurface porous pipe bubbler t tape and pottery cylinder and three subplots of 10 20 and 30 class a evaporation pan 685 1370 and 2055 m3 ha 1 year 1 generally seedling performance increased with level of irrigation the best results for seedling height trunk diameter leaf number and leaf area were with the pottery cylinder and drip systems and the 30 irrigation treatment the poorest results were with the surface and t tape systems and the 10 irrigation treatment the highest salinity was with the subsurface system and the 10 irrigation treatment and the t tape system with the 10 and 20 irrigation treatments the lowest salinity with the lowest irrigation treatment was with the pottery cylinder and drip system with the 20 and 30 irrigation treatments the pottery cylinder system had the highest common thin roots at 60 90 cm and the drip system had many thin roots at 30 60 cm overall the pottery cylinder and drip systems were best for pistachio seedlings keywords applied water drip irrigation system pistachio seedling soil salinity water management 1 introduction there are more than 45 7000 ha of bearing and nonbearing pistachio orchards in iran mainly in kerman province with 57 of total pistachio growing areas bureau of statistics and information technology 2017 in recent years pistachio planting has developed in other arid and semi arid regions of iran where the production of fruits and nuts is fully dependent upon irrigation naor 2010 pistachio orchards are mostly irrigated by surface irrigation method and efficiency has been reported to be 47 7 during one decade 1990 2000 in kerman province ashrefi et al 2006 development of pistachio using surface irrigation has contributed to severe decline of the groundwater table in the pistachio growing areas of iran therefore optimized use of available water resources and modern irrigation in this region is necessary for both new and mature pistachio orchards which have suitable soil and water quality for irrigation others have tested different irrigation systems in fruit orchards chopade et al 2001 in their seven year research on mature pomegranate trees reported that drip and bubbler irrigation systems increased the yield by 30 40 with lower water application 23 24 compared with surface irrigation control al amoud 2008 and abdel naby 2016 reported the suitability of bubbler irrigation system for irrigating orchards similarly sokalska et al 2009 reported highest apple yield with less frequent drip irrigation in california drip irrigation management of mature pistachio trees was studied by phene et al 1985 showing no significant difference between the quality and quantity of yield in pistachio trees treated by a 25 decrease in water application from 11 500 m3 ha 1 year 1 as control however a significant decline was reported for quality and quantity of yield with a 50 75 decrease in water application studies by arastirma 2004 on application of drip irrigation on mature pistachio trees in turkey revealed that use of drip irrigation on mature pistachio trees increased yield from 11 8 15 2 kg per tree in choosing the irrigation system the physiological properties of each plant are very effective in the resistance of the plant to shortage of water ooi et al 2005 although the pistachio nut tree has drought tolerance proper irrigation especially during summer months increases productivity iniesta et al 2008 kirnak et al 2001 mohammadi mohammadabadi et al 2008 sedaghati et al 2012 testi et al 2008 more iranian researchers have studied irrigation systems on mature pistachio trees as farmers change from surface to pressurized irrigation methods kuhestani 1996 studied the adaptability of pistachio trees to different types of subsurface irrigation reducing the amount of applied water to 20 of class a evaporation pan in sandy loam soil decreasing water applied caused a 20 decrease in yield compared to surface irrigation and he suggested the application of higher water volumes mohammadi mohammadabadi et al 2008 reported that changing the irrigation system from surface to subsurface porous pipe on mature pistachio trees is possible with applied water amounts of 4783 and 7174 m3 ha 1 year 1 also sedaghati et al 2012 compared the effects of surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems on growth and yield of mature pistachio trees they irrigated with 60 of the water requirement for surface irrigation 4398 m3 ha 1 during growth season and found that drip line buried 30 cm resulted in a 25 water saving over drip line placed on the soil surface sedaghati and fardad 2001 evaluated micro irrigation systems available in pistachio orchards of rafsanjan they stated water distribution uniformity in drip irrigation is better than the bubbler method they also found poor irrigation performance was due to improper irrigation scheduling and the lack of pressure regulation in recent years different irrigation systems in pistachio orchards have been used but have not been tested on pistachio seedlings thus in this research five irrigation systems including drip bubbler subsurface porous pipe t tape and pottery cylinder are compared with conventional or surface method on pistachio from the time of planting 2 materials and methods this research was conducted in the station of pistachio research center located in northwest of rafsanjan in kerman

10512,groundwater irrigated boro rice is produced on 83 of the net cultivable area nca in north west nw region of bangladesh falling groundwater levels in many parts of the region raised concerns about the sustainability of groundwater irrigation it is generally accepted that in the absence of a comprehensive scientific study uncontrolled groundwater use for boro rice cultivation leads to water wastage and low water productivity therefore it is crucial to know the actual field level water usage and irrigation water productivity which will help identifying options to sustain groundwater irrigation this study provides a comprehensive account of these aspects of boro rice cultivation based on field observations at 420 farmers plots in 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons across seven sites in the nw region necessary data including land type soil type rice varieties seeding and transplanting times grain and biomass yields pump discharge and irrigation amount were recorded average water productivity was 0 67 kg m 3 and 0 64 kg m 3 based on total available water rainfall plus irrigation in the fields 0 80 kg m 3 and 0 95 kg m 3 based on supplied irrigation and 1 60 kg m 3 and 1 78 kg m 3 based on estimated actual crop evapotranspiration etc during 2015 16 and 2016 17 respectively these water productivities are the highest among the major rice growing asian countries indicating limited scope for improving farmers water management practices comparison of the actual water supplied to the field and the estimated requirements shows that farmers are in general very efficient in supplying water to rice in shallow tube well stw sites water supplied by the farmers was very close to actual requirements but rice plots in dtw sites had some over application the average total amount of water available in the field to grow one kilogram of rice was 1 606 l l in 2015 16 and 1605 l in 2016 17 the average irrigation water supplied to the field was 1402 l kg 1 in 2015 16 and 1086 l kg 1 in 2016 17 however not all water supplied to the rice plots are consumed by the plants actual crop evapotranspiration is the real water use and based on that only 661 l in 2015 16 and 584 l in 2016 17 were required to grow one kilogram of rice percolation and seepage water return to the underlying aquifer as return flow so the current government policy of so called water savings by reducing pumping of groundwater is unlikely to have any major impacts on the sustainable groundwater irrigation in the nw region keywords irrigated rice water usage people s perception water productivity 1 introduction water scarcity is a serious threat to food security for millions of people particularly in the arid and semi arid regions singh et al 2006 at the global level water consumption for agriculture is forecasted to increase by 584 km3 during the period of 2000 2025 while world population is expected to grow from 6 18 billion in 2000 to 7 9 billion in 2025 shiklomanov 2000 molden et al 2007 estimated agricultural water withdrawal from natural systems to be 2664 km3 which constitutes 70 of water withdrawn for human requirements they also estimated evapotranspiration from agricultural land to be 7130 km3 which is projected to increase by 60 90 by 2050 if water productivity cannot be increased improving water productivity in agriculture will be crucial to reduce the need for additional water in irrigated systems and is a critical response to addressing water scarcity inclusive knowledge of fresh water usage and crop production systems is essential for water managers and policy makers to improve water management in areas with low water productivity immerzeel et al 2008 water productivity expresses the value or beneÔ¨Åt derived from the usage of water and includes essential aspects of water management molden and sakthivadivel 1999 molden et al 2001a droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 kijne et al 2003 singh et al 2006 its analysis can provide insights into means to improve overall agricultural water management abdullaev and molden 2004 water productivity is commonly measured as crop output per unit volume of water seckler et al 2003 the inverse of this expressed as litres of water to produce one kilogram of the crop is widely used both by researchers and policy makers in bangladesh specifically for rice rice is the predominant crop in three main crop growing seasons kharif 1 march june kharif 2 july october and rabi november february in bangladesh three types of rice aus in kharif i aman in kharif ii and boro in rabi season are cultivated both aus and aman rice cultivated in monsoon may october are mostly rainfed and often partially irrigated due to risk of floods and other natural disasters such as cyclones during the monsoon the dry season is the most productive risk free and diversified cropping season in the country consequently boro rice is the major irrigated crop in the dry season that currently contributes 55 60 of the country s total rice production mainuddin et al 2019 the total irrigated area has increased from 1 52 mha in 1983 18 of the net cultivable area nca to 5 5 mha in 2015 64 of the nca mainuddin et al 2019 due to tremendous increase in shallow tubewells stws and deep tubewells dtws for extracting groundwater the number of stw increased from 93 thousand to 1 52 million and that of dtw from 14 000 to 36 700 during the same period approximately 79 4 2 mha of the area is now irrigated by groundwater and only 21 1 25 mha is irrigated by surface water bbs bangladesh bureau of statistics 2017 the northwest nw region of bangladesh produces 34 of the country s total rice in addition to a major share of other crops like wheat maize potato and pulses despite having only 30 of the nca of the country the region has more than 40 of the total irrigated area currently 83 of the nca is irrigated in this region compared to 64 nationally mainuddin et al 2019 the nw region has the most intensive use of groundwater with 97 of the irrigated area irrigated only from groundwater while irrigated boro rice covers around 65 of the total irrigated area mainuddin et al 2015 due to higher irrigation requirements 91 of the total irrigation water is used for boro rice cultivation mainuddin et al 2014 2015 the irrigated area in the region has now plateaued revealing that groundwater irrigation may have reached the maximum limit of groundwater usage under the current bio physical and infrastructure conditions on the contrary the current 168 million population of bangladesh has been projected to increase to 202 million in 2050 united nations 2017 the country must increase food production for the additional population requiring further intensification of crop production from a land area that is declining continuously due to urbanization and industrial development considering the current trend in food production it is expected that the extra food must come from a further increase in productivity of both rainfed and irrigated agriculture mainuddin and kirby 2015 so the availability of water for irrigation remains crucial for maintaining growth in agricultural production in bangladesh however there are serious concerns about the sustainability of groundwater use in the nw region in recent years several studies e g shamsudduha et al 2009 shahid and hazarika 2010 rahman and mahbub 2012 dey et al 2013 2017 aziz et al 2015 mustafa et al 2017 mojid et al 2019 pe√±a arancibia et al 2020 show that groundwater levels are falling in many parts of the nw region groundwater levels at many areas in the region fall below the suction limit of centrifugal pumps 8 m during march to may in each year making stws that represent the majority of tubewells technically infeasible this implies that using shallow aquifers and stw s in the nw region has become unsustainable hossain and bahauddin 2013 kirby et al 2013 if current rates of groundwater usage continue groundwater levels are likely to decline continuously with a potential long term threat to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture ahmad et al 2014 the agriculture sector is being challenged to increase production using less water by improving agricultural water productivity jehangir et al 2007 djaman et al 2018 the government of bangladesh has focused on sustainable groundwater irrigation while maintaining the current growth in production in the nw region efficient water usage to attain high water productivity is considered one of the feasible steps to increase irrigated boro production with sustainable groundwater usage reliable determination of water productivity under challenging Ô¨Åeld conditions requires detailed hydrological and biophysical measurements using sophisticated and costly instrumentation such Ô¨Åeld experiments are expensive laborious and time consuming especially when they are to be spatially and temporally representative singh et al 2006 to our knowledge no detail studies on actual water usage by the farmers in rice fields and on the amount of water required to produce one kilogram of rice is available for bangladesh however most researchers and policy makers in bangladesh perceive that farmers waste substantial amounts of irrigation water rahman 2018 hoque 2018 it is frequently reported that 3 000 5 000 l of water are required to produce one kilogram of boro rice tuong 2008 reddy et al 2014 these discernments are perhaps based on surface water irrigation systems where on farm water management is generally absent or poor because of poor delivery of irrigation water mostly through highly inefficient earthen canals current responses to the declining groundwater levels observed in some areas of the country are based on a perception of the over usage of irrigation water without any detail field measurements because of the sustainability concerns of groundwater irrigation the government of bangladesh intends to reduce dependency on this water source by reducing groundwater pumping and increasing the usage of surface water for irrigation crop diversification and replacing boro rice with low water consuming non rice crops like wheat potato and maize gob government of bangladesh 2010 however despite such efforts cultivation of irrigated boro rice in the nw bangladesh shall remain crucial for the country s future food security and sustaining groundwater irrigation a clear understanding of the current state of water usage and water productivity for irrigated crops specifically for boro rice and their impacts on groundwater sustainability is essential for future planning of irrigated agriculture therefore the aim of this study was to investigate water usages and water productivities for irrigated boro rice cultivation in the nw region of bangladesh based on field measurements of hydrological and biophysical variables and to assess their possible impacts on sustainable groundwater irrigation 2 methodology 2 1 land topography and hydro climatic characteristics the nw region of bangladesh comprising 23 5 34 515 km2 of the country s total area is divided into 16 administrative districts under two administrative divisions rajshahi and rangpur fig 1 the region is characterized by two distinct landforms the barind tract and the floodplains the barind tract is a distinctive physiographic unit that comprises a series of uplifted blocks of terraced land and covers 8720 km2 in the north western bangladesh riches 2008 it covers parts of pabna rajshahi bogra and joypurhat districts of rajshahi division and some parts of dinajpur and rangpur districts of the rangpur division the nw region belongs to the dry humid zone with average annual from 1985 to 2010 rainfall varying from 1273 to 2515 mm almost 82 of the rainfall occurs during monsoon may october and only 18 occurs during dry season november april the barind area has the lowest average annual rainfall 1428 mm and rangpur area has the highest 2262 mm rainfall varies widely from year to year coefficient of variation cv 20 24 average monthly temperature ranges from 25 to 35 c in the hottest period and 9 15 c in the coolest period average monthly relative humidity varies from 62 in march to 87 in july with a mean annual value of 78 jahan et al 2010 the average reference evapotranspiration eto is 1309 mm which varies spatially and temporally cv 6 8 with the highest value of 1366 mm in ishurdi and lowest value of 1251 mm in rangpur 2 2 site selection several resolute criteria were adopted in selecting the study sites the criteria included i a good geographical spread of the sites within the nw region ii each site has several dtws and or stws covering at least 10 20 ha agricultural lands iii both diesel and electrically operated stws and dtws were considered iv irrigation is done mainly for boro rice v the selected sites cover different practicing water pricing systems e g share of crop as water charge fixed land area based water charge smart card payment system diesel fixed charge etc and vi the sites are convenient for communication based on extensive reconnaissance survey six specific sites in six districts one site in each of rajshahi pabna bogra rangpur dinajpur and thakurgaon districts fig 1 were selected in the first stage for monitoring and data collection rajshahi and thakurgaon sites were selected as dtw irrigation zones since dtw is the predominant technology for irrigation in these districts in the other four sites stw is the main mode of irrigation although both dtws and stws are used for irrigation some common characteristics of the selected sites include i selling irrigation water is considered as a business ii most of the farmers are marginal and tenants and iii irrigated rice is the main dry season crop a total of 14 stws and 3 dtws were selected in the six sites fig 1 for monitoring and data recording which commenced at the start of the dry season crop in november 2015 all plots under the command areas of the stws were monitored the command areas of the dtws are large and irrigation water is supplied through buried pipes with multiple outlets through which farmers extract water to keep the volume of data collection manageable the command areas of three outlets in each dtw site at head middle and tail end were selected the details of each stw and dtw along with their command areas are provided in table 1 considering the large volume of data collection the monitoring activities at tanore site in rajshahi and kaharol site in dinajpur were curtailed in the second year of study 2016 17 the number of stws in the other sites was also reduced in the second year however one additional site at badarganj upazilla of rangpur district table 1 stw with solar energy was selected for data collection in 2016 2017 2 3 data collection data related to water usage and water productivity of rice was recorded using pre designed accounting for farmers field activities the quantity of irrigation supplied from the source to the plots was calculated by multiplying the discharge rate of the irrigation pumps stws and dtws with irrigation duration of the irrigation event the discharge rates were measured during the initial middle and later parts of the rice growing season to account for any temporal variation of the discharges due to groundwater level fluctuation farmers decided to irrigate their rice fields based on field conditions usually irrigating when there was no standing water owing to the large number of plots within the command area of each stw and dtw table 1 application of irrigation was often delayed sometimes farmers irrigated early when the irrigation pumps were available anticipating a delay in accessing the pump if they held off other detail data on rice cultivation e g seedling age transplanting date days to different growth stages of the crop crop growth and yield etc was also recorded different inputs such as fertilizer pesticides labour cost and revenue data were also recorded but have not been reported in this paper daily historical climate data such as rainfall maximum and minimum temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity wind speed and total sunshine period were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd for six weather stations located near the monitoring sites the weather stations were at rajshahi ishurdi bogra rangpur dinajpur and sayedpur which represented tanore ishurdi sherpur mithapukur and badarganj kaharol and thakurgaon monitoring sites respectively 2 4 irrigation requirement estimation reference crop evapotranspiration eto was determined from climate data based on fao recommended modified penman monteith method using ref et software package allen 2011 the daily crop evapotranspiration etc and irrigation requirement were estimated by using a soil water balance swb simulation model which gives identical results to the fao cropwat 8 0 model http www fao org nr water infores databases cropwat html under identical conditions the main advantage of the swb model over the cropwat model is that it loops automatically through several climate regions soils crops and irrigation rules to avoid manually setting up and running many input files crop coefficient approach for estimating etc is described in allen et al 1998 and doorenbos and kassam 1979 more detail about the swb model is reported in mainuddin et al 2014 2015 the important soil properties that are input to the swb model are field capacity wilting point water holding capacity and percolation rate silt loam is the dominant soil in ishurdi sherpur kaharol and in parts of tanore some parts of tanore have clay loam mithapukur has sandy loam soil and thakurgaon has clay loam soil mainuddin et al 2014 collected the sand silt and clay fractions from soil resources development institute srdi for the three major soil series in each of the selected districts soil textural classes and other pertinent properties e g saturation point field capacity and wilting point were determined using the us soil triangle hydraulic properties calculator http www pedosphere ca resources texture triangle us cfm by utilizing these soil parameters the swb model was parameterized crop coefficients and yield response factors were adopted from the fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 the duration of the rice growing period was selected from field observation the lengths of growth stages of rice varieties were taken primarily from the fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 and adjusted based on the actual duration of rice crop in the fields percolation rate is an essential component of the water balance in the rice fields since it exerts a large impact on irrigation requirement we measured the actual percolation rate table 2 from fields at the six sites during the two experimental seasons by using the cylinder method for detail please see maniruzzaman et al 2019 crop evapotranspiration etc estimated by the swb simulation model was calibrated against remote sensing based actual evapotranspiration estimation eta described in ahmad et al 2014 for the same region that was described in detail in mainuddin et al 2015 and kirby et al 2015 after parameterizing the model using the data collected from the farmers field under this study etc was compared with long term 2000 2015 and district wise all 16 districts estimates of eta done for the same region using a recent and more reliable remote sensing based estimation method different to the one used in ahmad et al 2014 the average coefficient of determination was 0 86 and the maximum difference between the monthly average etc estimated using swb model and the eta estimated using remote sensing method was 5 4 this was described comprehensively in pe√±a arancibia et al 2020 so based on those comprehensive calibrations we are confident that etc is the reliable estimates of actual evapotranspiration for this region used in this study irrigation water requirement of rice varies due to its geographical location climate variations soil properties rice varieties and time of transplanting measured irrigation water supplied was compared with irrigation water requirements for full yield potential estimated using the swb model for boro rice at different planting dates the transplanting date of rice was distributed at a regular interval within the transplanting period for different rice varieties for the sites etc and irrigation requirements were estimated at 2 10 days interval after transplanting seedlings in the fields in estimating the irrigation requirements of rice we considered the average conveyance losses for different sites table 2 water was applied from the pumps stws and dtws to the fields through the existing buried pipes lined and earthen channels and polyethylene pipes the conveyance losses depended on the type of distribution systems their condition and the distance from the pump to the fields a single value of percolation loss of water for all plots within a site was assumed however there could be some differences in the percolation loss due to the variation in soil condition condition of the bunds and location of the plots 2 5 water productivity estimation water productivity correlates physical accounting of water with crop yield to give an indication of how much value is obtained from the usage of water molden 1997 three different types of crop water productivity physical economic and non economic are usually distinguished for different agricultural systems abdullaev and molden 2004 immerzeel et al 2008 mainuddin and kirby 2009a cai et al 2011 mainuddin et al 2012 the most popular is the physical water productivity hereafter denoted as wp defined as the mass of product per unit of consumed water or actual crop evapotranspiration etc and usually expressed in kg m 3 however for most practical purposes wp is also estimated considering the quantity of water supplied to the field irrigation and total water available in the field irrigation plus rainfall economic water productivity is the standardized gross or net value of the product or net benefit per unit of water consumed while non economic e g social or environmental water productivity indicates the net social benefits per unit of consumed water in this study we estimated the physical water productivity in terms of rice yield per unit of water available in the field rainfall plus irrigation supplied to the field irrigation and per unit of water consumed by the crop through etc 2 6 cultivated rice area mode of irrigation and rice varieties we monitored 235 plots covering 35 06 ha in 2015 16 across six sites in 2016 17 the monitoring activities were concentrated in 185 rice plots covering 24 62 ha table 1 in five of the seven sites excluding tanore and kaharol six high yielding rice varieties hybrid rice brri dhan28 brri dhan29 minikit kajallata and jirashail were cultivated in 2015 16 the growth duration from seed sowing through nursery to harvest of both hybrid rice and brri dhan29 is 160 days the growth duration of the other varieties is 140 days brri dhan28 and brri dhan29 were cultivated in half 50 2 of the total plots in 2015 16 hybrid rice minikit kajallata and jirashail were cultivated in 18 3 13 2 8 9 and 9 4 of the plots respectively in 2015 16 in 2016 17 brri dhan28 and brri dhan29 were cultivated in 86 46 plots mostly in ishurdi mithapukur thakurgaon and badarganj 3 results 3 1 rice transplanting time transplanting of boro rice started in late december and was completed by the end of february in 2015 16 with most of the plots 80 5 transplanted during 16 january to 15 february fig 2 in 2016 17 transplanting in 93 of the plots was done during this central period transplanting time is also specific to locations in most of the plots of ishurdi sherpur tanore and thakurgaon transplanting was done during 2nd half of january to 1 st half of february in 2015 16 the growth duration of brri dhan29 is 20 days longer than that of brri dhan28 so brri dhan29 needs to be transplanted earlier to harvest in time date of transplanting significantly influences potential crop evapotranspiration and the irrigation requirements discussed later date of transplanting affects the yield of rice fig s1 in supplementary materials in general there is a decreasing trend in yield with the delay in transplanting for brri dhan28 and brri dhan29 however the hybrid rice seems not affected by the transplanting time 3 2 age of rice seedlings age of seedlings influence rice yields the higher the age of seedlings the lower was the yields for brri dhan28 and brri dhan29 fig s2 in supplementary materials although the recommended age of seedlings for these rice varieties is 40 days brri bangladesh rice research institute 2018 the average age of transplanted seedlings was 64 days for brri dhan28 and 58 days for brri dhan29 in 2015 16 for the hybrid rice jirashail kajallata and minikit the average age of seedlings was 48 43 44 and 41 days respectively in 2016 17 the average age of seedlings was 59 66 60 and 54 days respectively for brri dhan28 brri dhan29 hybrid rice and minikit while over aged seedlings reduce rice yield they are also likely to reduce water requirement for rice cultivation if 40 days old seedlings were transplanted the rice fields would have required an additional 20 days of irrigation water which would have increased the cost of irrigation where the payment is based on fixed charge and or fuel the main reason for transplanting older seedlings was that land was used to cultivate one short duration non rice crop e g potato tomato pulses vegetables etc after harvesting of aman rice consequently transplanting of boro rice seedlings was delayed and older seedlings were transplanted to ensure harvest before early monsoon rainfall and hailstorms although slight yield loss occurs with older seedlings the overall benefit would improve owing to the additional crop and reduced irrigation requirement 3 3 evapotranspiration of rice estimated actual crop evapotranspiration of rice etc increased with delayed transplanting dates fig 3 and fig s3 in supplementary materials due to increase in temperature with the progress of the rice growing season boro rice starts growing in cooler and drier weather which continues up to the vegetative stage the flowering ripening and harvesting stages are associated with hot summer weather etc varied over the locations and was the highest in ishurdi and lowest in mithapukur the average etc over the locations was the highest for brri dhan29 and hybrid rice etc varied from 359 to 545 mm across the locations and transplanting dates in 2015 16 with an average of 448 mm the actual growth period of brri dhan29 and hybrid rice was 20 days longer than that of brri dhan28 and other rice varieties consequently the average etc was 385 mm for brri dhan29 and 379 mm for the other rice varieties in 2015 16 fig 3 in 2016 17 etc of brri dhan29 and hybrid rice was 254 mm for transplanting on 20 december 2016 and 497 mm for transplanting on 10 march 2017 for brri dhan28 and minikit etc was 208 mm and 424 mm respectively because of 20 days higher seedling age than the recommended age the crop was in the field for shorter duration with a consequent reduction in etc the model results showed that the estimated actual crop evapotranspiration was exactly like the potential crop evapotranspiration indicating that none of the plots was under water stress all the plots were under well watered condition 3 4 supplied versus estimated irrigation water the quantity of irrigation water supplied to the rice fields differed among the monitoring sites due to their geographical locations climatic variations soil properties rice varieties and time of transplanting fig 4 compares the applied plot averaged quantity of water supplied and estimated water requirements of rice while fig 5 provides the percentage of under application or over application of water supplied compared to the estimated water requirements for different sites the plot averaged actual water supply was 23 lower than the estimated water requirements in ishurdi in 2015 16 fig 5 in sherpur and kaharol sites the average actual water application was very close to the estimated water requirements 2 of requirement in mithapukur thakurgaon and tanore sites the actual water application was 60 37 and 36 higher respectively when compared to the estimated requirements fig 5 in 2016 17 the actual water application was close to the estimated water requirements in mithapukur 7 higher sherpur 4 higher and badarganj 3 higher water application was 36 higher in ishurdi and 57 higher in thakurgaon compared to the estimated requirements irrigation water requirements in general were lower in 2016 17 due to higher than usual rainfall during this season january to may total rainfall was 283 497 mm in 2015 16 and 304 527 mm in 2016 17 across the locations plot wise comparison of water supplied and estimated irrigation requirements are given in figs s4 and s5 in supplementary materials water supply was the highest in mithapukur 890 1601 mm and lowest in ishurdi 472 539 mm in 2015 16 season it varied from 563 to 871 mm in kaharol 615 802 mm in sherpur 768 958 mm in tanore and 889 to 1052 mm in thakurgaon fig s4 in supplementary materials in 2016 17 water application was the highest in ishurdi 565 965 mm and lowest in sherpur 460 625 mm the variation in water application to the plots at different sites was much lower 395 965 mm in 2016 17 cv 16 6 than in 2015 16 472 1601 mm cv 33 2 fig s5 in supplementary materials 3 5 water productivity the physical water productivity of boro rice based on total water available in the field rainfall plus irrigation water supplied wptotwat varied from 0 34 kg m 3 to 1 05 kg m 3 in 2015 16 and 0 39 kg m 3 to 1 01 kg m 3 in 2016 17 water productivity based on irrigation water supplied wpirrig varied from 0 37 kg m 3 to 1 47 kg m 3 in 2015 16 and 0 63 kg m 3 to 1 43 kg m 3 in 2016 17 the plot averaged wptotwat and wpirrig were 0 67 kg m 3 and 0 64 kg m 3 respectively in 2015 16 and 0 80 kg m 3 and 0 95 kg m 3 respectively in 2016 17 the plot averaged water productivity based on crop evapotranspiration etc denoted as wpetc was 1 60 kg m 3 in 2015 16 and 1 78 kg m 3 in 2016 17 the highest wpetc was 2 92 kg m 3 in 2015 16 and 3 03 kg m 3 in 2016 17 figs 6 8 illustrate significant p 0 05 variations in water productivity both wptotwat wpirrig and wpetc of rice among the sites varieties and irrigation well types the variations were due to the variations in yield of rice varieties difference in rainfall irrigation water supplied to the fields and variations in crop evapotranspiration in 2015 16 among the locations the highest average wptotwat 0 92 kg m 3 and wpirrig 1 31 kg m 3 were in ishurdi due to higher yield of rice and lower usage of water than in the other sites the lowest was in tanore 0 46 kg m 3 and 0 58 kg m 3 but in 2016 17 the highest wptotwat and wpirrig were in thakurgaon 0 88 kg m 3 and 1 19 kg m 3 and the lowest were in sherpur 0 56 kg m 3 and 0 84 kg m 3 unlike wptotwat and wpirrig wpetc was the highest in mithapukur in 2015 16 and badarganj in 2016 17 fig 8 among the varieties hybrid rice 2 13 kg m 3 and brri dhan28 2 06 kg m 3 provided the highest wpetc in 2015 16 and 2016 17 respectively in general wptotwat wpirrig and wpetc are higher for hybrid rice brri dhan29 and brri dhan28 due to their higher yield water productivities also varied due to different pump types as shown in figs 6 8 the amount of water necessary to grow one kilogram of rice generally expressed in litres of water per kilogram of rice l kg 1 is specifically used in bangladesh to indicate water consumption for rice production fig 9 illustrates amount of water available rainfall plus supplied irrigation to the rice plots under investigation for 2015 16 and 2016 17 crop seasons the amount of water available varied from 955 l kg1 to 2904 l kg 1 in 2015 16 and 988 l kg 1 to 2533 l kg 1 in 2016 17 with the corresponding average of 1606 l kg 1 and 1605 l kg 1 the average amount of water available for one kilogram of rice in 2015 16 was for 235 plots across 6 locations and the average in 2016 17 was for 184 plots there was no yield from one plot across 5 locations including 4 considered in 2015 16 surprisingly the averages are almost same for both years the quantity of supplied irrigation water varied from 670 l kg 1 to 2683 l kg 1 in 2015 16 and 701 l kg 1 to 1593 l kg 1 in 2016 17 fig 10 the average of all the plots and sites quantity of applied irrigation water was 1402 l kg 1 in 2015 16 and 1086 l kg 1 in 2016 17 fig 10 water supply was 29 higher in 2015 16 than in 2016 17 due to higher rainfall in 2016 17 as mentioned earlier out of 235 rice plots monitored in 2015 16 only two plots 0 85 used more than 2500 l kg 1 water and 17 plots 7 23 used more than 2000 l kg 1 water in 2016 17 only one plot out of 184 used more than 1500 l kg 1 water in terms of total water available in the field fig 9 only 3 8 of the plots had more than 2500 l kg 1 of water and 18 7 had more than 2000 l kg 1 of water in 2016 17 the corresponding number of plots was 0 5 and 8 1 so the general perception of overuse of water to the extent of 3 000 5 000 l to produce one kilogram of rice reddy et al 2014 tuong 2008 is nowhere near reality in the farmers fields due to high price of irrigation water reduced availability of water and good knowledge on irrigation the farmers in the region are efficient in applying irrigation water to their rice fields this is reflected in fig 9 as there was almost no difference between the average amounts of water available in the fields for two seasons in 2016 17 due to higher rainfall farmers applied less irrigation in the fields over the years the yield of rice increased almost linearly mainuddin and kirby 2015 while the actual water supply might have decreased with an increase in farmers focus on irrigation efficiency this is also a contributing factor in reduced water usage for producing unit mass of rice the amount of water used to grow rice is the actual crop evapotranspiration etc during the rice growing period fig 11 shows etc requirement to produce one kilogram of rice for the plots of all monitoring sites average etc was 661 l kg 1 in 2015 16 and 584 l kg 1 in 2016 17 these results clearly refute the general perception that water usage or water applied to the fields to grow one kilogram of rice is excessive 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of water productivity the average water productivity based on available water in the fields wptotwat was 0 67 kg m 3 in 2015 16 and 0 64 kg m 3 in 2016 17 wpirrig was 0 80 kg m 3 in 2015 16 and 0 95 kg m 3 in 2016 17 both wptotwat and wpirrig were higher than that obtained by kijne 2003 and bouman and tuong 2001 kijne 2003 reported wpirrig of 0 05 0 6 kg m 3 while bouman and tuong 2001 reported wpirrig as 0 2 0 4 kg m 3 for india and 0 3 0 1 kg m 3 for the philippines under continuous flooded rice cultivation wptotwat and wpirrig in our study varied over a wider range reflecting the scope for its further improvement however defining crop water productivity by using actual crop evapotranspiration rather than by only supplied irrigation amount is practically more sensible at field and system levels in our observation plot average estimated actual crop evapotranspiration based water productivity wpetc was 1 60 kg m 3 in 2015 16 and 1 78 kg m 3 in 2016 17 with the highest value of 2 92 kg m 3 and 3 03 kg m 3 for the corresponding rice growing season like wpirrig the average wpetc of the plots was also much higher than that reported by kijne 2003 wpetc was higher than wpirrig since the water spent in the rice production system except etc was not included in determining wpetc our results reveal significant p 0 05 variations in the physical water productivities among the seven sites six rice varieties operation mode and type of irrigation wells and two crop years these variations reflect potential for further improvement in physical water productivity spatial and temporal variations of water productivity of rice were also reported for thailand cambodia laos and vietnam mainuddin and kirby 2009b zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 reviewed 84 literature sources available over the last 25 years and reported a range of globally measured wpetc values between 0 60 1 6 kg m 3 with an average of 1 09 kg m 3 for rice tuong and bouman 2003 reported a lower range of wpetc 0 4 1 1 kg m 3 for rice in farmers Ô¨Åelds and irrigation systems of nw india while kijne 2003 reported a range of wpetc 0 5 1 1 kg m 3 which is very similar to that of tuong and bouman 2003 singh et al 2006 reported an average wpetc of 0 94 kg m 3 at farmers Ô¨Åelds in sirsa district of nw india both the average and maximum wpetc in our study were higher than those reported by zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 tuong and bouman 2003 and kijne 2003 due to the higher yield of boro rice varieties in bangladesh increased water productivity due to high yielding rice varieties was also evident for the lower mekong river basin hasegawa et al 2008 however higher land productivity and deficit irrigation may also provide higher water productivity of irrigation system molden et al 2001b in our study there were considerable spatial and temporal variations in water productivity for different rice varieties as well as for the same variety this observation also reveals the scope for improvements in water productivity although productivity is already high figs 6 8 increasing the crop yield by replacing low yielding varieties with high yielding varieties and optimum soil and water management is the most effective way to increasing productivity wpirrig can be improved by reducing all forms of field water losses e g drainage evaporation seepage and percolation and by increasing the effective usage of rainfall however improvements in water productivity are context dependent molden et al 2007 the options and practices associated with these philosophies require different approaches and technologies at different spatial scales kijne 2003 farmers in most developing countries including bangladesh can improve water productivity by adopting some agronomic and water management practices like alternate wetting and drying awd method of irrigation aerobic rice cultivation soil mulching soil fertility maintenance small scale affordable water distribution system and timely delivery of water although improved nutrient management is often ignored it can increase water productivity by augmenting the yield proportionally more than it increases evapotranspiration kijne 2003 to implement the effective agronomic and water management practices in the field farmers need to be trained properly 4 2 farmers knowledge on water management farmers are well aware of the declining groundwater level and in general are very prudent in supplying water to the rice field in areas where water level falls below the suction limit of the stws particularly during peak demand march april water supply was very close to the estimated water requirements within 2 to 4 under or over application fig 5 at sherpur both in 2015 16 and 2016 17 rice seasons among the stw sites the highest decline in groundwater level was in sherpur fig 12 groundwater level declined to 8 7 m and 8 2 m at the beginning of april in 2015 16 and 2016 17 season respectively making stws technically infeasible due to exceeding their suction lift limit mainuddin et al 2019 to overcome the suction lift limitation all stw owners lowered the pumps below ground surface by 1 m however discharge from the pumps decreased because of increased suction lift the farmers were aware of this reduction in pump discharge and applied water to their fields more cautiously that was the main reason for efficient water application to the plots of sherpur in both rice growing seasons in badarganj water was supplied by commercial water providers using solar energy to operate their pumps qualified agronomic and irrigation professionals oversee the solar scheme management and water distribution the improved management was the major contributing factor for the small difference 3 over application between the applied water and estimated water requirement for ishurdi due to decline in groundwater level stw 1 table 1 could not withdraw water with its full capacity and also remained out of operation over some period when groundwater level fell below the suction lift usually 8 m below the pump centre in 2015 16 season fig 12 consequently the application of irrigation water was low compared to the estimated water requirement in that site the owner of stw 1 replaced the centrifugal pump with the submersible pump before the 2016 17 rice season to avoid constraint in pumping water during peak time this may have contributed to the higher water supply compared to the estimated requirements in 2016 17 this site is dominated by dtws and submersible pumps have no problem accessing groundwater in both dtw sites water supply was much higher than the estimated requirements in these sites farmers could independently operate the pump using pre paid cards the cost of irrigation water was much lower for electrically powered government owned dtws when compared to diesel powered stws there was a tendency for the farmers to apply more water in the dtw fields in estimating the irrigation requirements we considered the average conveyance losses for different sites based on the information available from the literature sayed et al 2014 studied the conveyance losses in stw irrigation schemes during boro season of 2010 11 at mithapukur they found the average conveyance losses of 45 in the existing earthen canals and 24 in the improved earthen canals we considered 24 as losses instead of 45 for all sites we used conservative values of conveyance losses the actual losses could be higher that is likely to have some impact in the difference between the estimated requirements and the actual water supplied we have also used single value of seepage and percolation for all plots within a site in reality there is likely to have some difference due to the variation in soil condition condition of the bund and location of the plots nonetheless in general we can conclude that i dtw irrigated area has significant oversupply due to low cost and availability of water ii the supply of water is very reasonable in stw irrigated area due to higher cost of water than dtw and declining groundwater level and iii in stw area farmers are prudent in supplying water in the field 4 3 impacts on sustainable groundwater irrigation all water applied to the rice fields is not transpired by the plant only evaporation from the soil and water surface represents a loss from the system seepage water from one field moves to the adjacent fields to be used by the plants usually rice fields adjoin each other in a command area and are separated by narrow and low height bunds at the single plot level seepage in and seepage out of a field balance each other only the plots at the edges of the command area usually bounded by roads and drains may lose some water that cannot be used for crop production water percolating below the rice field is neither consumed by the plants nor is it lost from the groundwater irrigation system since it goes back to the underlying aquifer as return flow rushton et al 2020 water is extracted for irrigation from the underlying aquifer of the rice fields consequently groundwater level falls during irrigation periods creating space to accommodate recharging water during the monsoon months percolation from the rice fields also recharges the aquifer during the irrigation season dry season rushton et al 2020 the withdrawal of water from the aquifer is always more than the recharge to the aquifer from percolation consequently the contribution of percolation to the aquifer is not visible in the groundwater level hydrographs however without the recharge from percolation groundwater level would drop below what is actually observed percolated water could be a loss from the system if irrigation water is pumped from sources other than the underlying aquifer e g rivers in an area where groundwater is not used due to limitations such as salinity arsenic contamination etc this is however not the case in the groundwater irrigation system of the study region in the face of declining groundwater levels the government of bangladesh plans to reduce groundwater pumping several farm scale water saving measures have been promoted from improved irrigation delivery technologies e g stopping seepage from water delivery canals to new agronomic practices e g alternate wetting and drying method and conservation practices like zero tillage minimum tillage etc these measures are however based on the perception that farmers substantially overuse water and much water supplied to the rice fields is lost the review by perry and steduto 2017 found no documented examples of substantial water savings for field crops in terms of consumptive use they reported only a very few cases where biophysical water productivity yield per m3 of etc or transpiration increased an improvement in irrigation technology or conveyance efficiency may result in the requirement to divert or extract less water from the source but if the amount used by the plant the consumptive use remains the same then the impact of the improved technology is to leave the unused water at the source rather than conveying it to another place there will be no saving of water unless the return flows from the crop fields e g seepage and percolation end up in a sink from where water is not recoverable for reuse water saving technologies like awd often claimed to result in water saving might reduce the pumping volume and associated cost however if the actual evapotranspiration has not changed the net impact on the groundwater is nil as the excess water applied to the field returns to the aquifer in addition to alternate wetting and drying conservation agriculture e g zero tillage minimum tillage etc is also being promoted to reduce water use for irrigation in order to reduce pressure on groundwater aquifers while such conservation practices may reduce seepage and percolation there is no evidence that they have reduced etc of the crop but they may prevent temporary decline of groundwater level below the suction limit of hand tubewells also shallow tubewells which are predominantly used in domestic purposes thus reducing women s drudgery to collect water from distant places while conservation agriculture may be economically beneficial it may reduce recharge into the aquifers in the monsoon season because of the low infiltration rate of water or higher runoff from the soil surface perry and steduto 2017 pointed out that much confusion arises in water saving from the juxtaposition of two different perspectives from the point of view of the farmers pumping less water is water saving and also a saving in pumping costs from the point of view of other users no water is saved unless the farmers can actually reduce the water consumed as evapotranspiration which they rarely do and more often than not the water consumed increases so many water saving technologies such as reducing ponded water depth in the rice fields to the level of soil saturation bouman and tuong 2001 tabbal et al 2002 system of rice intensification sri satyanarayana et al 2007 awd and deficit irrigation guerra et al 1998 although increase irrigation water productivity wpirrig do not reduce crop evapotranspiration ahmad et al 2007 and hence have no impact on sustaining groundwater irrigation the hypothesis behind the government s policy intervention with reduced groundwater pumping and reduced water application to the fields to achieve sustainable groundwater irrigation is unlikely to have any significant impact on declining groundwater level groundwater pumping for irrigation in terms of net water use i e evapotranspiration in some parts of the region where the annual recharge is less than the net water use needs to be reduced this can be done by replacing boro rice with other non rice crops such as wheat maize pulses and oilseeds which have lower potential crop evapotranspiration than rice pe√±a arancibia et al 2020 showed that there may be multiple factors behind the declining groundwater level in the southern part of the study region in addition to higher net water extraction more than the annual recharge there is reduced recharge due to an observed decline in rainfall pe√±a arancibia et al 2020 mojid et al 2019 and reduced deep drainage through the plough pans neumann et al 2009 or from a combination of these trends of rainfall showed distinct patterns with most districts in the north except for gaibandha and nilphamari showing large statistically significant declines of 20 mm per year or more pe√±a arancibia et al 2020 with declining rainfall the vadose zone soil profile above groundwater table will be fully saturated with water at the later part of the monsoon period and only for a shorter period thus limiting the period of deep drainage from the vadose zone and reducing the potential for groundwater recharge pe√±a arancibia et al 2020 neumann et al 2009 showed that puddling substantially reduces the deep drainage of water in the rice fields as more and more of the landscapes have been put under boro cultivation over the years 45 47 landscapes are puddled every dry season pe√±a arancibia et al 2020 this potentially reduces groundwater recharge that is manifested in the decline in groundwater level recently the government is emphasizing surface water use through excavation of canals ponds and conservation of river water which has the potential to increase recharge and sustain groundwater irrigation however a comprehensive rethinking of the current policy of sustainable groundwater irrigation in the region is essential 5 conclusions in this study we tried to bust some myths and misconceptions about groundwater usage for irrigation by the farmers and their consequences on the decline in groundwater level in the nw region of bangladesh our revelations are based on extensive information collected from the farmers fields over two rice growing seasons 2015 16 and 2016 17 we found that the farmers are in general very prudent in applying water to their rice fields in stw irrigated areas farmers are more cautious in applying water to the rice fields than in dtw irrigated areas this is because of the concern of possible dropping of groundwater level below suction lift limit of the stws and higher cost of water from stws than from dtws dtw irrigated rice fields had some over application of water the scale of which was however nowhere near as generally perceived 3000 5000 l of water to produce one kilogram of rice yet this overstated perception has added a lot more confusion for future planning of the nw region s irrigated agriculture specifically irrigated boro rice cultivation water usage by the rice plants was the actual crop evapotranspiration under these contexts adoption of any water saving technologies e g awd deficit irrigation conservation agriculture to reduce seepage and percolation loss of water will have little impacts on improving the declining groundwater levels in the region the findings of this study are expected to remove the existing unfounded perception on water usages by the farmer and help policy makers to identify the real areas of intervention for sustainable groundwater irrigation and thus maintain food security and alleviate poverty it is noted that this study did not consider the impact of climate change that is presumed likely to impact

10512,groundwater irrigated boro rice is produced on 83 of the net cultivable area nca in north west nw region of bangladesh falling groundwater levels in many parts of the region raised concerns about the sustainability of groundwater irrigation it is generally accepted that in the absence of a comprehensive scientific study uncontrolled groundwater use for boro rice cultivation leads to water wastage and low water productivity therefore it is crucial to know the actual field level water usage and irrigation water productivity which will help identifying options to sustain groundwater irrigation this study provides a comprehensive account of these aspects of boro rice cultivation based on field observations at 420 farmers plots in 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons across seven sites in the nw region necessary data including land type soil type rice varieties seeding and transplanting times grain and biomass yields pump discharge and irrigation amount were recorded average water productivity was 0 67 kg m 3 and 0 64 kg m 3 based on total available water rainfall plus irrigation in the fields 0 80 kg m 3 and 0 95 kg m 3 based on supplied irrigation and 1 60 kg m 3 and 1 78 kg m 3 based on estimated actual crop evapotranspiration etc during 2015 16 and 2016 17 respectively these water productivities are the highest among the major rice growing asian countries indicating limited scope for improving farmers water management practices comparison of the actual water supplied to the field and the estimated requirements shows that farmers are in general very efficient in supplying water to rice in shallow tube well stw sites water supplied by the farmers was very close to actual requirements but rice plots in dtw sites had some over application the average total amount of water available in the field to grow one kilogram of rice was 1 606 l l in 2015 16 and 1605 l in 2016 17 the average irrigation water supplied to the field was 1402 l kg 1 in 2015 16 and 1086 l kg 1 in 2016 17 however not all water supplied to the rice plots are consumed by the plants actual crop evapotranspiration is the real water use and based on that only 661 l in 2015 16 and 584 l in 2016 17 were required to grow one kilogram of rice percolation and seepage water return to the underlying aquifer as return flow so the current government policy of so called water savings by reducing pumping of groundwater is unlikely to have any major impacts on the sustainable groundwater irrigation in the nw region keywords irrigated rice water usage people s perception water productivity 1 introduction water scarcity is a serious threat to food security for millions of people particularly in the arid and semi arid regions singh et al 2006 at the global level water consumption for agriculture is forecasted to increase by 584 km3 during the period of 2000 2025 while world population is expected to grow from 6 18 billion in 2000 to 7 9 billion in 2025 shiklomanov 2000 molden et al 2007 estimated agricultural water withdrawal from natural systems to be 2664 km3 which constitutes 70 of water withdrawn for human requirements they also estimated evapotranspiration from agricultural land to be 7130 km3 which is projected to increase by 60 90 by 2050 if water productivity cannot be increased improving water productivity in agriculture will be crucial to reduce the need for additional water in irrigated systems and is a critical response to addressing water scarcity inclusive knowledge of fresh water usage and crop production systems is essential for water managers and policy makers to improve water management in areas with low water productivity immerzeel et al 2008 water productivity expresses the value or beneÔ¨Åt derived from the usage of water and includes essential aspects of water management molden and sakthivadivel 1999 molden et al 2001a droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 kijne et al 2003 singh et al 2006 its analysis can provide insights into means to improve overall agricultural water management abdullaev and molden 2004 water productivity is commonly measured as crop output per unit volume of water seckler et al 2003 the inverse of this expressed as litres of water to produce one kilogram of the crop is widely used both by researchers and policy makers in bangladesh specifically for rice rice is the predominant crop in three main crop growing seasons kharif 1 march june kharif 2 july october and rabi november february in bangladesh three types of rice aus in kharif i aman in kharif ii and boro in rabi season are cultivated both aus and aman rice cultivated in monsoon may october are mostly rainfed and often partially irrigated due to risk of floods and other natural disasters such as cyclones during the monsoon the dry season is the most productive risk free and diversified cropping season in the country consequently boro rice is the major irrigated crop in the dry season that currently contributes 55 60 of the country s total rice production mainuddin et al 2019 the total irrigated area has increased from 1 52 mha in 1983 18 of the net cultivable area nca to 5 5 mha in 2015 64 of the nca mainuddin et al 2019 due to tremendous increase in shallow tubewells stws and deep tubewells dtws for extracting groundwater the number of stw increased from 93 thousand to 1 52 million and that of dtw from 14 000 to 36 700 during the same period approximately 79 4 2 mha of the area is now irrigated by groundwater and only 21 1 25 mha is irrigated by surface water bbs bangladesh bureau of statistics 2017 the northwest nw region of bangladesh produces 34 of the country s total rice in addition to a major share of other crops like wheat maize potato and pulses despite having only 30 of the nca of the country the region has more than 40 of the total irrigated area currently 83 of the nca is irrigated in this region compared to 64 nationally mainuddin et al 2019 the nw region has the most intensive use of groundwater with 97 of the irrigated area irrigated only from groundwater while irrigated boro rice covers around 65 of the total irrigated area mainuddin et al 2015 due to higher irrigation requirements 91 of the total irrigation water is used for boro rice cultivation mainuddin et al 2014 2015 the irrigated area in the region has now plateaued revealing that groundwater irrigation may have reached the maximum limit of groundwater usage under the current bio physical and infrastructure conditions on the contrary the current 168 million population of bangladesh has been projected to increase to 202 million in 2050 united nations 2017 the country must increase food production for the additional population requiring further intensification of crop production from a land area that is declining continuously due to urbanization and industrial development considering the current trend in food production it is expected that the extra food must come from a further increase in productivity of both rainfed and irrigated agriculture mainuddin and kirby 2015 so the availability of water for irrigation remains crucial for maintaining growth in agricultural production in bangladesh however there are serious concerns about the sustainability of groundwater use in the nw region in recent years several studies e g shamsudduha et al 2009 shahid and hazarika 2010 rahman and mahbub 2012 dey et al 2013 2017 aziz et al 2015 mustafa et al 2017 mojid et al 2019 pe√±a arancibia et al 2020 show that groundwater levels are falling in many parts of the nw region groundwater levels at many areas in the region fall below the suction limit of centrifugal pumps 8 m during march to may in each year making stws that represent the majority of tubewells technically infeasible this implies that using shallow aquifers and stw s in the nw region has become unsustainable hossain and bahauddin 2013 kirby et al 2013 if current rates of groundwater usage continue groundwater levels are likely to decline continuously with a potential long term threat to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture ahmad et al 2014 the agriculture sector is being challenged to increase production using less water by improving agricultural water productivity jehangir et al 2007 djaman et al 2018 the government of bangladesh has focused on sustainable groundwater irrigation while maintaining the current growth in production in the nw region efficient water usage to attain high water productivity is considered one of the feasible steps to increase irrigated boro production with sustainable groundwater usage reliable determination of water productivity under challenging Ô¨Åeld conditions requires detailed hydrological and biophysical measurements using sophisticated and costly instrumentation such Ô¨Åeld experiments are expensive laborious and time consuming especially when they are to be spatially and temporally representative singh et al 2006 to our knowledge no detail studies on actual water usage by the farmers in rice fields and on the amount of water required to produce one kilogram of rice is available for bangladesh however most researchers and policy makers in bangladesh perceive that farmers waste substantial amounts of irrigation water rahman 2018 hoque 2018 it is frequently reported that 3 000 5 000 l of water are required to produce one kilogram of boro rice tuong 2008 reddy et al 2014 these discernments are perhaps based on surface water irrigation systems where on farm water management is generally absent or poor because of poor delivery of irrigation water mostly through highly inefficient earthen canals current responses to the declining groundwater levels observed in some areas of the country are based on a perception of the over usage of irrigation water without any detail field measurements because of the sustainability concerns of groundwater irrigation the government of bangladesh intends to reduce dependency on this water source by reducing groundwater pumping and increasing the usage of surface water for irrigation crop diversification and replacing boro rice with low water consuming non rice crops like wheat potato and maize gob government of bangladesh 2010 however despite such efforts cultivation of irrigated boro rice in the nw bangladesh shall remain crucial for the country s future food security and sustaining groundwater irrigation a clear understanding of the current state of water usage and water productivity for irrigated crops specifically for boro rice and their impacts on groundwater sustainability is essential for future planning of irrigated agriculture therefore the aim of this study was to investigate water usages and water productivities for irrigated boro rice cultivation in the nw region of bangladesh based on field measurements of hydrological and biophysical variables and to assess their possible impacts on sustainable groundwater irrigation 2 methodology 2 1 land topography and hydro climatic characteristics the nw region of bangladesh comprising 23 5 34 515 km2 of the country s total area is divided into 16 administrative districts under two administrative divisions rajshahi and rangpur fig 1 the region is characterized by two distinct landforms the barind tract and the floodplains the barind tract is a distinctive physiographic unit that comprises a series of uplifted blocks of terraced land and covers 8720 km2 in the north western bangladesh riches 2008 it covers parts of pabna rajshahi bogra and joypurhat districts of rajshahi division and some parts of dinajpur and rangpur districts of the rangpur division the nw region belongs to the dry humid zone with average annual from 1985 to 2010 rainfall varying from 1273 to 2515 mm almost 82 of the rainfall occurs during monsoon may october and only 18 occurs during dry season november april the barind area has the lowest average annual rainfall 1428 mm and rangpur area has the highest 2262 mm rainfall varies widely from year to year coefficient of variation cv 20 24 average monthly temperature ranges from 25 to 35 c in the hottest period and 9 15 c in the coolest period average monthly relative humidity varies from 62 in march to 87 in july with a mean annual value of 78 jahan et al 2010 the average reference evapotranspiration eto is 1309 mm which varies spatially and temporally cv 6 8 with the highest value of 1366 mm in ishurdi and lowest value of 1251 mm in rangpur 2 2 site selection several resolute criteria were adopted in selecting the study sites the criteria included i a good geographical spread of the sites within the nw region ii each site has several dtws and or stws covering at least 10 20 ha agricultural lands iii both diesel and electrically operated stws and dtws were considered iv irrigation is done mainly for boro rice v the selected sites cover different practicing water pricing systems e g share of crop as water charge fixed land area based water charge smart card payment system diesel fixed charge etc and vi the sites are convenient for communication based on extensive reconnaissance survey six specific sites in six districts one site in each of rajshahi pabna bogra rangpur dinajpur and thakurgaon districts fig 1 were selected in the first stage for monitoring and data collection rajshahi and thakurgaon sites were selected as dtw irrigation zones since dtw is the predominant technology for irrigation in these districts in the other four sites stw is the main mode of irrigation although both dtws and stws are used for irrigation some common characteristics of the selected sites include i selling irrigation water is considered as a business ii most of the farmers are marginal and tenants and iii irrigated rice is the main dry season crop a total of 14 stws and 3 dtws were selected in the six sites fig 1 for monitoring and data recording which commenced at the start of the dry season crop in november 2015 all plots under the command areas of the stws were monitored the command areas of the dtws are large and irrigation water is supplied through buried pipes with multiple outlets through which farmers extract water to keep the volume of data collection manageable the command areas of three outlets in each dtw site at head middle and tail end were selected the details of each stw and dtw along with their command areas are provided in table 1 considering the large volume of data collection the monitoring activities at tanore site in rajshahi and kaharol site in dinajpur were curtailed in the second year of study 2016 17 the number of stws in the other sites was also reduced in the second year however one additional site at badarganj upazilla of rangpur district table 1 stw with solar energy was selected for data collection in 2016 2017 2 3 data collection data related to water usage and water productivity of rice was recorded using pre designed accounting for farmers field activities the quantity of irrigation supplied from the source to the plots was calculated by multiplying the discharge rate of the irrigation pumps stws and dtws with irrigation duration of the irrigation event the discharge rates were measured during the initial middle and later parts of the rice growing season to account for any temporal variation of the discharges due to groundwater level fluctuation farmers decided to irrigate their rice fields based on field conditions usually irrigating when there was no standing water owing to the large number of plots within the command area of each stw and dtw table 1 application of irrigation was often delayed sometimes farmers irrigated early when the irrigation pumps were available anticipating a delay in accessing the pump if they held off other detail data on rice cultivation e g seedling age transplanting date days to different growth stages of the crop crop growth and yield etc was also recorded different inputs such as fertilizer pesticides labour cost and revenue data were also recorded but have not been reported in this paper daily historical climate data such as rainfall maximum and minimum temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity wind speed and total sunshine period were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department bmd for six weather stations located near the monitoring sites the weather stations were at rajshahi ishurdi bogra rangpur dinajpur and sayedpur which represented tanore ishurdi sherpur mithapukur and badarganj kaharol and thakurgaon monitoring sites respectively 2 4 irrigation requirement estimation reference crop evapotranspiration eto was determined from climate data based on fao recommended modified penman monteith method using ref et software package allen 2011 the daily crop evapotranspiration etc and irrigation requirement were estimated by using a soil water balance swb simulation model which gives identical results to the fao cropwat 8 0 model http www fao org nr water infores databases cropwat html under identical conditions the main advantage of the swb model over the cropwat model is that it loops automatically through several climate regions soils crops and irrigation rules to avoid manually setting up and running many input files crop coefficient approach for estimating etc is described in allen et al 1998 and doorenbos and kassam 1979 more detail about the swb model is reported in mainuddin et al 2014 2015 the important soil properties that are input to the swb model are field capacity wilting point water holding capacity and percolation rate silt loam is the dominant soil in ishurdi sherpur kaharol and in parts of tanore some parts of tanore have clay loam mithapukur has sandy loam soil and thakurgaon has clay loam soil mainuddin et al 2014 collected the sand silt and clay fractions from soil resources development institute srdi for the three major soil series in each of the selected districts soil textural classes and other pertinent properties e g saturation point field capacity and wilting point were determined using the us soil triangle hydraulic properties calculator http www pedosphere ca resources texture triangle us cfm by utilizing these soil parameters the swb model was parameterized crop coefficients and yield response factors were adopted from the fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 the duration of the rice growing period was selected from field observation the lengths of growth stages of rice varieties were taken primarily from the fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 and adjusted based on the actual duration of rice crop in the fields percolation rate is an essential component of the water balance in the rice fields since it exerts a large impact on irrigation requirement we measured the actual percolation rate table 2 from fields at the six sites during the two experimental seasons by using the cylinder method for detail please see maniruzzaman et al 2019 crop evapotranspiration etc estimated by the swb simulation model was calibrated against remote sensing based actual evapotranspiration estimation eta described in ahmad et al 2014 for the same region that was described in detail in mainuddin et al 2015 and kirby et al 2015 after parameterizing the model using the data collected from the farmers field under this study etc was compared with long term 2000 2015 and district wise all 16 districts estimates of eta done for the same region using a recent and more reliable remote sensing based estimation method different to the one used in ahmad et al 2014 the average coefficient of determination was 0 86 and the maximum difference between the monthly average etc estimated using swb model and the eta estimated using remote sensing method was 5 4 this was described comprehensively in pe√±a arancibia et al 2020 so based on those comprehensive calibrations we are confident that etc is the reliable estimates of actual evapotranspiration for this region used in this study irrigation water requirement of rice varies due to its geographical location climate variations soil properties rice varieties and time of transplanting measured irrigation water supplied was compared with irrigation water requirements for full yield potential estimated using the swb model for boro rice at different planting dates the transplanting date of rice was distributed at a regular interval within the transplanting period for different rice varieties for the sites etc and irrigation requirements were estimated at 2 10 days interval after transplanting seedlings in the fields in estimating the irrigation requirements of rice we considered the average conveyance losses for different sites table 2 water was applied from the pumps stws and dtws to the fields through the existing buried pipes lined and earthen channels and polyethylene pipes the conveyance losses depended on the type of distribution systems their condition and the distance from the pump to the fields a single value of percolation loss of water for all plots within a site was assumed however there could be some differences in the percolation loss due to the variation in soil condition condition of the bunds and location of the plots 2 5 water productivity estimation water productivity correlates physical accounting of water with crop yield to give an indication of how much value is obtained from the usage of water molden 1997 three different types of crop water productivity physical economic and non economic are usually distinguished for different agricultural systems abdullaev and molden 2004 immerzeel et al 2008 mainuddin and kirby 2009a cai et al 2011 mainuddin et al 2012 the most popular is the physical water productivity hereafter denoted as wp defined as the mass of product per unit of consumed water or actual crop evapotranspiration etc and usually expressed in kg m 3 however for most practical purposes wp is also estimated considering the quantity of water supplied to the field irrigation and total water available in the field irrigation plus rainfall economic water productivity is the standardized gross or net value of the product or net benefit per unit of water consumed while non economic e g social or environmental water productivity indicates the net social benefits per unit of consumed water in this study we estimated the physical water productivity in terms of rice yield per unit of water available in the field rainfall plus irrigation supplied to the field irrigation and per unit of water consumed by the crop through etc 2 6 cultivated rice area mode of irrigation and rice varieties we monitored 235 plots covering 35 06 ha in 2015 16 across six sites in 2016 17 the monitoring activities were concentrated in 185 rice plots covering 24 62 ha table 1 in five of the seven sites excluding tanore and kaharol six high yielding rice varieties hybrid rice brri dhan28 brri dhan29 minikit kajallata and jirashail were cultivated in 2015 16 the growth duration from seed sowing through nursery to harvest of both hybrid rice and brri dhan29 is 160 days the growth duration of the other varieties is 140 days brri dhan28 and brri dhan29 were cultivated in half 50 2 of the total plots in 2015 16 hybrid rice minikit kajallata and jirashail were cultivated in 18 3 13 2 8 9 and 9 4 of the plots respectively in 2015 16 in 2016 17 brri dhan28 and brri dhan29 were cultivated in 86 46 plots mostly in ishurdi mithapukur thakurgaon and badarganj 3 results 3 1 rice transplanting time transplanting of boro rice started in late december and was completed by the end of february in 2015 16 with most of the plots 80 5 transplanted during 16 january to 15 february fig 2 in 2016 17 transplanting in 93 of the plots was done during this central period transplanting time is also specific to locations in most of the plots of ishurdi sherpur tanore and thakurgaon transplanting was done during 2nd half of january to 1 st half of february in 2015 16 the growth duration of brri dhan29 is 20 days longer than that of brri dhan28 so brri dhan29 needs to be transplanted earlier to harvest in time date of transplanting significantly influences potential crop evapotranspiration and the irrigation requirements discussed later date of transplanting affects the yield of rice fig s1 in supplementary materials in general there is a decreasing trend in yield with the delay in transplanting for brri dhan28 and brri dhan29 however the hybrid rice seems not affected by the transplanting time 3 2 age of rice seedlings age of seedlings influence rice yields the higher the age of seedlings the lower was the yields for brri dhan28 and brri dhan29 fig s2 in supplementary materials although the recommended age of seedlings for these rice varieties is 40 days brri bangladesh rice research institute 2018 the average age of transplanted seedlings was 64 days for brri dhan28 and 58 days for brri dhan29 in 2015 16 for the hybrid rice jirashail kajallata and minikit the average age of seedlings was 48 43 44 and 41 days respectively in 2016 17 the average age of seedlings was 59 66 60 and 54 days respectively for brri dhan28 brri dhan29 hybrid rice and minikit while over aged seedlings reduce rice yield they are also likely to reduce water requirement for rice cultivation if 40 days old seedlings were transplanted the rice fields would have required an additional 20 days of irrigation water which would have increased the cost of irrigation where the payment is based on fixed charge and or fuel the main reason for transplanting older seedlings was that land was used to cultivate one short duration non rice crop e g potato tomato pulses vegetables etc after harvesting of aman rice consequently transplanting of boro rice seedlings was delayed and older seedlings were transplanted to ensure harvest before early monsoon rainfall and hailstorms although slight yield loss occurs with older seedlings the overall benefit would improve owing to the additional crop and reduced irrigation requirement 3 3 evapotranspiration of rice estimated actual crop evapotranspiration of rice etc increased with delayed transplanting dates fig 3 and fig s3 in supplementary materials due to increase in temperature with the progress of the rice growing season boro rice starts growing in cooler and drier weather which continues up to the vegetative stage the flowering ripening and harvesting stages are associated with hot summer weather etc varied over the locations and was the highest in ishurdi and lowest in mithapukur the average etc over the locations was the highest for brri dhan29 and hybrid rice etc varied from 359 to 545 mm across the locations and transplanting dates in 2015 16 with an average of 448 mm the actual growth period of brri dhan29 and hybrid rice was 20 days longer than that of brri dhan28 and other rice varieties consequently the average etc was 385 mm for brri dhan29 and 379 mm for the other rice varieties in 2015 16 fig 3 in 2016 17 etc of brri dhan29 and hybrid rice was 254 mm for transplanting on 20 december 2016 and 497 mm for transplanting on 10 march 2017 for brri dhan28 and minikit etc was 208 mm and 424 mm respectively because of 20 days higher seedling age than the recommended age the crop was in the field for shorter duration with a consequent reduction in etc the model results showed that the estimated actual crop evapotranspiration was exactly like the potential crop evapotranspiration indicating that none of the plots was under water stress all the plots were under well watered condition 3 4 supplied versus estimated irrigation water the quantity of irrigation water supplied to the rice fields differed among the monitoring sites due to their geographical locations climatic variations soil properties rice varieties and time of transplanting fig 4 compares the applied plot averaged quantity of water supplied and estimated water requirements of rice while fig 5 provides the percentage of under application or over application of water supplied compared to the estimated water

water application was very close to the estimated water requirements 2 of requirement in mithapukur thakurgaon and tanore sites the actual water application was 60 37 and 36 higher respectively when compared to the estimated requirements fig 5 in 2016 17 the actual water application was close to the estimated water requirements in mithapukur 7 higher sherpur 4 higher and badarganj 3 higher water application was 36 higher in ishurdi and 57 higher in thakurgaon compared to the estimated requirements irrigation water requirements in general were lower in 2016 17 due to higher than usual rainfall during this season january to may total rainfall was 283 497 mm in 2015 16 and 304 527 mm in 2016 17 across the locations plot wise comparison of water supplied and estimated irrigation requirements

water productivity the physical water productivity of boro rice based on total water available in the field rainfall plus irrigation water supplied wptotwat varied from 0 34 kg m 3 to 1 05 kg m 3 in 2015 16 and 0 39 kg m 3 to 1 01 kg m 3 in 2016 17 water productivity based on irrigation water supplied wpirrig varied from 0 37 kg m 3 to 1 47 kg m 3 in 2015 16 and 0 63 kg m 3 to 1 43 kg m 3 in 2016 17 the plot averaged wptotwat and wpirrig were 0 67 kg m 3 and 0 64 kg m 3 respectively in 2015 16 and 0 80 kg m 3 and 0 95 kg m 3 respectively in 2016 17 the plot averaged water productivity based on crop evapotranspiration etc denoted as wpetc was 1 60 kg m 3 in 2015 16 and 1 78 kg m 3 in 2016 17 the highest wpetc was 2 92 kg m 3 in 2015 16 and 3 03 kg m 3 in 2016 17 figs 6 8 illustrate significant p 0 05 variations in water productivity both wptotwat wpirrig and wpetc of rice among the sites varieties and irrigation well types the variations were due to the variations in yield of rice varieties difference in rainfall irrigation water supplied to the fields and variations in crop evapotranspiration in 2015 16 among the locations the highest average wptotwat 0 92 kg m 3 and wpirrig 1 31 kg m 3 were in ishurdi due to higher yield of rice and lower usage of water than in the other sites the lowest was in tanore 0 46 kg m 3 and 0 58 kg m 3 but in 2016 17 the highest wptotwat and wpirrig were in thakurgaon 0 88 kg m 3 and 1 19 kg m 3 and the lowest were in sherpur 0 56 kg m 3 and 0 84 kg m 3 unlike wptotwat and wpirrig wpetc was the highest in mithapukur in 2015 16 and badarganj in 2016 17 fig 8 among the varieties hybrid rice 2 13 kg m 3 and brri dhan28 2 06 kg m 3 provided the highest wpetc in 2015 16 and 2016 17 respectively in general wptotwat wpirrig and wpetc are higher for hybrid rice brri dhan29 and brri dhan28 due to their higher yield water productivities also varied due to different pump types as shown in figs 6 8 the amount of water necessary to grow one kilogram of rice generally expressed in litres of water per kilogram of rice l kg 1 is specifically used in bangladesh to indicate water consumption for rice production fig 9 illustrates amount of water available rainfall plus supplied irrigation to the rice plots under investigation for 2015 16 and 2016 17 crop seasons the amount of water available varied from 955 l kg1 to 2904 l kg 1 in 2015 16 and 988 l kg 1 to 2533 l kg 1 in 2016 17 with the corresponding average of 1606 l kg 1 and 1605 l kg 1 the average amount of water available for one kilogram of rice in 2015 16 was for 235 plots across 6 locations and the average in 2016 17 was for 184 plots there was no yield from one plot across 5 locations including 4 considered in 2015 16 surprisingly the averages are almost same for both years the quantity of supplied irrigation water varied from 670 l kg 1 to 2683 l kg 1 in 2015 16 and 701 l kg 1 to 1593 l kg 1 in 2016 17 fig 10 the average of all the plots and sites quantity of applied irrigation water was 1402 l kg 1 in 2015 16 and 1086 l kg 1 in 2016 17 fig 10 water supply was 29 higher in 2015 16 than in 2016 17 due to higher rainfall in 2016 17 as mentioned earlier out of 235 rice plots monitored in 2015 16 only two plots 0 85 used more than 2500 l kg 1 water and 17 plots 7 23 used more than 2000 l kg 1 water in 2016 17 only one plot out of 184 used more than 1500 l kg 1 water in terms of total water available in the field fig 9 only 3 8 of the plots had more than 2500 l kg 1 of water and 18 7 had more than 2000 l kg 1 of water in 2016 17 the corresponding number of plots was 0 5 and 8 1 so the general perception of overuse of water to the extent of 3 000 5 000 l to produce one kilogram of rice reddy et al 2014 tuong 2008 is nowhere near reality in the farmers fields due to high price of irrigation water reduced availability of water and good knowledge on irrigation the farmers in the region are efficient in applying irrigation water to their rice fields this is reflected in fig 9 as there was almost no difference between the average amounts of water available in the fields for two seasons in 2016 17 due to higher rainfall farmers applied less irrigation in the fields over the years the yield of rice increased almost linearly mainuddin and kirby 2015 while the actual water supply might have decreased with an increase in farmers focus on irrigation efficiency this is also a contributing factor in reduced water usage for producing unit mass of rice the amount of water used to grow rice is the actual crop evapotranspiration etc during the rice growing period fig 11 shows etc requirement to produce one kilogram of rice for the plots of all monitoring sites average etc was 661 l kg 1 in 2015 16 and 584 l kg 1 in 2016 17 these results clearly refute the general perception that water usage or water applied to the fields to grow one kilogram of rice is excessive 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of water productivity the average water productivity based on available water in the fields wptotwat was 0 67 kg m 3 in 2015 16 and 0 64 kg m 3 in 2016 17 wpirrig was 0 80 kg m 3 in 2015 16 and 0 95 kg m 3 in 2016 17 both wptotwat and wpirrig were higher than that obtained by kijne 2003 and bouman and tuong 2001 kijne 2003 reported wpirrig of 0 05 0 6 kg m 3 while bouman and tuong 2001 reported wpirrig as 0 2 0 4 kg m 3 for india and 0 3 0 1 kg m 3 for the philippines under continuous flooded rice cultivation wptotwat and wpirrig in our study varied over a wider range reflecting the scope for its further improvement however defining crop water productivity by using actual crop evapotranspiration rather than by only supplied irrigation amount is practically more sensible at field and system levels in our observation plot average estimated actual crop evapotranspiration based water productivity wpetc was 1 60 kg m 3 in 2015 16 and 1 78 kg m 3 in 2016 17 with the highest value of 2 92 kg m 3 and 3 03 kg m 3 for the corresponding rice growing season like wpirrig the average wpetc of the plots was also much higher than that reported by kijne 2003 wpetc was higher than wpirrig since the water spent in the rice production system except etc was not included in determining wpetc our results reveal significant p 0 05 variations in the physical water productivities among the seven sites six rice varieties operation mode and type of irrigation wells and two crop years these variations reflect potential for further improvement in physical water productivity spatial and temporal variations of water productivity of rice were also reported for thailand cambodia laos and vietnam mainuddin and kirby 2009b zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 reviewed 84 literature sources available over the last 25 years and reported a range of globally measured wpetc values between 0 60 1 6 kg m 3 with an average of 1 09 kg m 3 for rice tuong and bouman 2003 reported a lower range of wpetc 0 4 1 1 kg m 3 for rice in farmers Ô¨Åelds and irrigation systems of nw india while kijne 2003 reported a range of wpetc 0 5 1 1 kg m 3 which is very similar to that of tuong and bouman 2003 singh et al 2006 reported an average wpetc of 0 94 kg m 3 at farmers Ô¨Åelds in sirsa district of nw india both the average and maximum wpetc in our study were higher than those reported by zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 tuong and bouman 2003 and kijne 2003 due to the higher yield of boro rice varieties in bangladesh increased water productivity due to high yielding rice varieties was also evident for the lower mekong river basin hasegawa et al 2008 however higher land productivity and deficit irrigation may also provide higher water productivity of irrigation system molden et al 2001b in our study there were considerable spatial and temporal variations in water productivity for different rice varieties as well as for the same variety this observation also reveals the scope for improvements in water productivity although productivity is already high figs 6 8 increasing the crop yield by replacing low yielding varieties with high yielding varieties and optimum soil and water management is the most effective way to increasing productivity wpirrig can be improved by reducing all forms of field water losses e g drainage evaporation seepage and percolation and by increasing the effective usage of rainfall however improvements in water productivity are context dependent molden et al 2007 the options and practices associated with these philosophies require different approaches and technologies at different spatial scales kijne 2003 farmers in most developing countries including bangladesh can improve water productivity by adopting some agronomic and water management practices like alternate wetting and drying awd method of irrigation aerobic rice cultivation soil mulching soil fertility maintenance small scale affordable water distribution system and timely delivery of water although improved nutrient management is often ignored it can increase water productivity by augmenting the yield proportionally more than it increases evapotranspiration kijne 2003 to implement the effective agronomic and water management practices in the field farmers need to be trained properly 4 2 farmers knowledge on water management farmers are well aware of the declining groundwater level and in general are very prudent in supplying water to the rice field in areas where water level falls below the suction limit of the stws particularly during peak demand march april water supply was very close to the estimated water requirements within 2 to 4 under or over application fig 5 at sherpur both in 2015 16 and 2016 17 rice seasons among the stw sites the highest decline in groundwater level was in sherpur fig 12 groundwater level declined to 8 7 m and 8 2 m at the beginning of april in 2015 16 and 2016 17 season respectively making stws technically infeasible due to exceeding their suction lift limit mainuddin et al 2019 to overcome the suction lift limitation all stw owners lowered the pumps below ground surface by 1 m however discharge from the pumps decreased because of increased suction lift the farmers were aware of this reduction in pump discharge and applied water to their fields more cautiously that was the main reason for efficient water application to the plots of sherpur in both rice growing seasons in badarganj water was supplied by commercial water providers using solar energy to operate their pumps qualified agronomic and irrigation professionals oversee the solar scheme management and water distribution the improved management was the major contributing factor for the small difference 3 over application between the applied water and estimated water requirement for ishurdi due to decline in groundwater level stw 1 table 1 could not withdraw water with its full capacity and also remained out of operation over some period when groundwater level fell below the suction lift usually 8 m below the pump centre in 2015 16 season fig 12 consequently the application of irrigation water was low compared to the estimated water requirement in that site the owner of stw 1 replaced the centrifugal pump with the submersible pump before the 2016 17 rice season to avoid constraint in pumping water during peak time this may have contributed to the higher water supply compared to the estimated requirements in 2016 17 this site is dominated by dtws and submersible pumps have no problem accessing groundwater in both dtw sites water supply was much higher than the estimated requirements in these sites farmers could independently operate the pump using pre paid cards the cost of irrigation water was much lower for electrically powered government owned dtws when compared to diesel powered stws there was a tendency for the farmers to apply more water in the dtw fields in estimating the irrigation requirements we considered the average conveyance losses for different sites based on the information available from the literature sayed et al 2014 studied the conveyance losses in stw irrigation schemes during boro season of 2010 11 at mithapukur they found the average conveyance losses of 45 in the existing earthen canals and 24 in the improved earthen canals we considered 24 as losses instead of 45 for all sites we used conservative values of conveyance losses the actual losses could be higher that is likely to have some impact in the difference between the estimated requirements and the actual water supplied we have also used single value of seepage and percolation for all plots within a site in reality there is likely to have some difference due to the variation in soil condition condition of the bund and location of the plots nonetheless in general we can conclude that i dtw irrigated area has significant oversupply due to low cost and availability of water ii the supply of water is very reasonable in stw irrigated area due to higher cost of water than dtw and declining groundwater level and iii in stw area farmers are prudent in supplying water in the field 4 3 impacts on sustainable groundwater irrigation all water applied to the rice fields is not transpired by the plant only evaporation from the soil and water surface represents a loss from the system seepage water from one field moves to the adjacent fields to be used by the plants usually rice fields adjoin each other in a command area and are separated by narrow and low height bunds at the single plot level seepage in and seepage out of a field balance each other only the plots at the edges of the command area usually bounded by roads and drains may lose some water that cannot be used for crop production water percolating below the rice field is neither consumed by the plants nor is it lost from the groundwater irrigation system since it goes back to the underlying aquifer as return flow rushton et al 2020 water is extracted for irrigation from the underlying aquifer of the rice fields consequently groundwater level falls during irrigation periods creating space to accommodate recharging water during the monsoon months percolation from the rice fields also recharges the aquifer during the irrigation season dry season rushton et al 2020 the withdrawal of water from the aquifer is always more than the recharge to the aquifer from percolation consequently the contribution of percolation to the aquifer is not visible in the groundwater level hydrographs however without the recharge from percolation groundwater level would drop below what is actually observed percolated water could be a loss from the system if irrigation water is pumped from sources other than the underlying aquifer e g rivers in an area where groundwater is not used due to limitations such as salinity arsenic contamination etc this is however not the case in the groundwater irrigation system of the study region in the face of declining groundwater levels the government of bangladesh plans to reduce groundwater pumping several farm scale water saving measures have been promoted from improved irrigation delivery technologies e g stopping seepage from water delivery canals to new agronomic practices e g alternate wetting and drying method and conservation practices like zero tillage minimum tillage etc these measures are however based on the perception that farmers substantially overuse water and much water supplied to the rice fields is lost the review by perry and steduto 2017 found no documented examples of substantial water savings for field crops in terms of consumptive use they reported only a very few cases where biophysical water productivity yield per m3 of etc or transpiration increased an improvement in irrigation technology or conveyance efficiency may result in the requirement to divert or extract less water from the source but if the amount used by the plant the consumptive use remains the same then the impact of the improved technology is to leave the unused water at the source rather than conveying it to another place there will be no saving of water unless the return flows from the crop fields e g seepage and percolation end up in a sink from where water is not recoverable for reuse water saving technologies like awd often claimed to result in water saving might reduce the pumping volume and associated cost however if the actual evapotranspiration has not changed the net impact on the groundwater is nil as the excess water applied to the field returns to the aquifer in addition to alternate wetting and drying conservation agriculture e g zero tillage minimum tillage etc is also being promoted to reduce water use for irrigation in order to reduce pressure on groundwater aquifers while such conservation practices may reduce seepage and percolation there is no evidence that they have reduced etc of the crop but they may prevent temporary decline of groundwater level below the suction limit of hand tubewells also shallow tubewells which are predominantly used in domestic purposes thus reducing women s drudgery to collect water from distant places while conservation agriculture may be economically beneficial it may reduce recharge into the aquifers in the monsoon season because of the low infiltration rate of water or higher runoff from the soil surface perry and steduto 2017 pointed out that much confusion arises in water saving from the juxtaposition of two different perspectives from the point of view of the farmers pumping less water is water saving and also a saving in pumping costs from the point of view of other users no water is saved unless the farmers can actually reduce the water consumed as evapotranspiration which they rarely do and more often than not the water consumed increases so many water saving technologies such as reducing ponded water depth in the rice fields to the level of soil saturation bouman and tuong 2001 tabbal et al 2002 system of rice intensification sri satyanarayana et al 2007 awd and deficit irrigation guerra et al 1998 although increase irrigation water productivity wpirrig do not reduce crop evapotranspiration ahmad et al 2007 and hence have no impact on sustaining groundwater irrigation the hypothesis behind the government s policy intervention with reduced groundwater pumping and reduced water application to the fields to achieve sustainable groundwater irrigation is unlikely to have any significant impact on declining groundwater level groundwater pumping for irrigation in terms of net water use i e evapotranspiration in some parts of the region where the annual recharge is less than the net water use needs to be reduced this can be done by replacing boro rice with other non rice crops such as wheat maize pulses and oilseeds which have lower potential crop evapotranspiration than rice pe√±a arancibia et al 2020 showed that there may be multiple factors behind the declining groundwater level in the southern part of the study region in addition to higher net water extraction more than the annual recharge there is reduced recharge due to an observed decline in rainfall pe√±a arancibia et al 2020 mojid et al 2019 and reduced deep drainage through the plough pans neumann et al 2009 or from a combination of these trends of rainfall showed distinct patterns with most districts in the north except for gaibandha and nilphamari showing large statistically significant declines of 20 mm per year or more pe√±a arancibia et al 2020 with declining rainfall the vadose zone soil profile above groundwater table will be fully saturated with water at the later part of the monsoon period and only for a shorter period thus limiting the period of deep drainage from the vadose zone and reducing the potential for groundwater recharge pe√±a arancibia et al 2020 neumann et al 2009 showed that puddling substantially reduces the deep drainage of water in the rice fields as more and more of the landscapes have been put under boro cultivation over the years 45 47 landscapes are puddled every dry season pe√±a arancibia et al 2020 this potentially reduces groundwater recharge that is manifested in the decline in groundwater level recently the government is emphasizing surface water use through excavation of canals ponds and conservation of river water which has the potential to increase recharge and sustain groundwater irrigation however a comprehensive rethinking of the current policy of sustainable groundwater irrigation in the region is essential 5 conclusions in this study we tried to bust some myths and misconceptions about groundwater usage for irrigation by the farmers and their consequences on the decline in groundwater level in the nw region of bangladesh our revelations are based on extensive information collected from the farmers fields over two rice growing seasons 2015 16 and 2016 17 we found that the farmers are in general very prudent in applying water to their rice fields in stw irrigated areas farmers are more cautious in applying water to the rice fields than in dtw irrigated areas this is because of the concern of possible dropping of groundwater level below suction lift limit of the stws and higher cost of water from stws than from dtws dtw irrigated rice fields had some over application of water the scale of which was however nowhere near as generally perceived 3000 5000 l of water to produce one kilogram of rice yet this overstated perception has added a lot more confusion for future planning of the nw region s irrigated agriculture specifically irrigated boro rice cultivation water usage by the rice plants was the actual crop evapotranspiration under these contexts adoption of any water saving technologies e g awd deficit irrigation conservation agriculture to reduce seepage and percolation loss of water will have little impacts on improving the declining groundwater levels in the region the findings of this study are expected to remove the existing unfounded perception on water usages by the farmer and help policy makers to identify the real areas of intervention for sustainable groundwater irrigation and thus maintain food security and alleviate poverty it is noted that this study did not consider the impact of climate change that is presumed likely to impact

10513,cyanotoxins are secondary metabolites of the ubiquitous cyanobacteria and exert their toxicity to plants and humans human health can be impacted by cyanotoxin bioaccumulation in crops via irrigation from contaminated water reservoirs in the present study we conducted an ecologically relevant experiment in terms of toxin dose cultivation time and the use of agricultural soil and naturally contaminated irrigation water we investigated the growth response protection potential bioaccumulation profile and the related health risk of two widely consumed root vegetables radish and carrot when the exposure to microcystins rich water commences at different developmental stages from seed to 4 true leaves stage additionally carrot was subjected to a prolonged depuration phase in order to evaluate its recovery potential the results indicate a developmental stage dependent profile of all measured parameters severe growth reduction was evident for plants receiving degraded water from the seed stage which reached 50 and 70 for radish and carrots respectively the impact was less pronounced when degraded water was first received at subsequent developmental stages the protection response in terms of phenolic content was considerably insufficient to mitigate the stress at the tissue level the earlier in its life cycle a plant confronts the exposure the greater microcystins content occurs in its tissue particularly in the edible parts posing considerably high health risk for humans upon consumption estimated daily toxin intake after consuming treated taproots exceeded the world health organization safety threshold by 4 and 5 times for adults and children respectively the experimental depuration in carrot only partially alleviated the problem of bioaccumulation and growth impairment thus pointing to irreversible hazards the results highlight the importance of monitoring the major cyanotoxins content in irrigation water and emphasize the necessity to re visit the regulation guidelines concerning the origin and quality of the irrigation water in the frame of effective agricultural water management keywords cyanotoxins phenolics growth bioaccumulation human health risk depuration 1 introduction cyanotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by some toxic cyanobacterial species mainly as defense and allelopathic agents omidi et al 2018 they are released to surface water of lakes and reservoirs during cyanobacterial blooms especially thriving under eutrophic conditions microcystins mcs comprise the most widespread group of cyanotoxins globally with 200 congeners already been identified fontanillo and k√∂hn 2018 altaner et al 2019 mcs are regarded as a threat to plant human and livestock health which they reach through irrigation and drinking water as well as via food chain contamination corbel et al 2014 the threat to animal health is related to mcs hepatotoxic and carcinogenic potential the toxicity mechanism is well recognized and appears to be the same in both plant and animal cells based primarily on the inhibition of phosphatases pp1 and pp2a which causes the impairment of many physiological processes fontanillo and k√∂hn 2018 secondary mechanisms of toxicity in the plant body include increased production of reactive oxygen species ros reduced transcription of genes related to root growth and interference with auxin transport chen et al 2013 machado et al 2017b prieto et al 2011 the above mentioned mcs effects reflect upon the whole plant physiology and growth photosynthesis nutrient uptake shoot and root growth especially lateral roots and root hair formation and loss of membrane integrity are reported to be negatively affected by mcs absorption by plant cao et al 2018a 2017 cordeiro ara√∫jo et al 2015 redouane et al 2019 in addition to the possible functional impairment caused by mcs their bioaccumulation is evident in a wide range of edible plant species raising concerns about the risk of consuming mc contaminated fresh products machado et al 2017b and literature there in in most of the relevant studies levizou et al 2017 mohamed and al shehri 2009 the toxin concentration in roots was higher compared to the leaves but these studies focused on vegetables whose edible part is the leaf leaving thus a knowledge gap on the toxin accumulation potential of root vegetables despite their importance as part of human diet a decade of intensive research concerning mcs effects on plant performance often exaggerating in concentrations used short time of exposure and preference to substrate or hydroponics instead of soil as growth medium helped in defining the thresholds as well as the mechanisms of mc possible toxic activity after this period during which many plant species were tested two review papers proposed a new conceptual framework concerning environmental relevance and true dimensions of mcs effect corbel et al 2014 and machado et al 2017b identified the gaps criticized exaggerations in experimental setup but most notably set the prerequisites for safe conclusions i e i realistic concentrations b adequate time of exposure c soil as growth medium ecologically relevant mcs concentrations are essential in order to avoid overestimation of mcs impacts on plant and the bioaccumulation dynamics since both are dependent on the exposure concentration moreover the extremely short exposure times ranging from 1 to 15 days are considered non indicative of plant performance since the stress is sharp and plant defense mechanisms have no time to deploy finally soil seems to have an important role in the mitigation of mcs toxic effects through hampering plant uptake due to toxin adsorption in soil particles chelation and bio degradation chen et al 2006 redouane et al 2019 two understudied aspects of mcs effects on plant are the developmental stage dependent response and the depuration potential of the vegetable when its exposure to mc contaminated water terminates concerning the latter only two studies have been published reporting that decontamination of lettuce and spinach was possible after a short exposure to a medium mc lr concentration followed by a depuration period of long duration cao et al 2019 cordeiro ara√∫jo et al 2016 our previous work with lettuce irrigated with mcs rich water indicated that the developmental stage in which the plant faces the toxin is important in shaping its response as well as the bioaccumulation profile levizou et al 2017 the conclusion was that the earlier in its life cycle lettuce receives contaminated water the greater impact on growth and the higher bioaccumulation is evident taking into account the realistic experimental conditions framework we performed experiments to assess the effect of mc lr on two root vegetables and furthermore to test whether the developmental stage in which the plant receives the degraded water plays a crucial role in growth and bioaccumulation response carrot and radish were grown in agricultural soil and irrigated with mc lr rich water from a freshwater reservoir constructed for agricultural use additionally in the case of carrot a depuration treatment was performed to evaluate its de contamination potential the study aims at a better understanding of the true impact of ecologically relevant concentration of mc lr on growth and acceptability for human consumption of high risk root vegetables 2 materials and methods 2 1 irrigation water the karla reservoir 38 km2 in thessaly central greece has been under its water filling process since 2009 and is intended mostly for agricultural use since it has already been adversely affected by both agricultural and industrial pollution from part of its catchment area harmful cyanobacterial blooms are persistent resulting in high mcs concentrations ranging from 1 5 Œºg l 1 to 33 Œºg l 1 papadimitriou et al 2013 in september 2016 a total volume of 250 l was collected from the karla reservoir for the experimental plants irrigation since our purpose was to use the common agricultural practice in water management the water was not subjected to any treatment concerning the release of the intracellular cyanotoxins therefore we examined only the effect of dissolved extracellular mcs the concentration of which was 3 76 Œºg l 1 and remained stable throughout the experiment according to

discussion cyanobacterial blooms and the subsequent release of their toxic compounds is an ongoing problem all over the globe and it is intensified due to climate change o√∂neil et al 2012 this water quality problem has been widely acknowledged to cause adverse effects on crop production when used for irrigation along with posing human health risks nevertheless the assessment of the real dimensions of the problem and the risk is crucial to rely on either in situ surveys of heavily impacted agro ecosystems or experiments with an environmentally relevant experimental setup in the present study we addressed the environmental relevance of mc exposure by using irrigation water from a mcs impacted agricultural water reservoir with no amendments to decrease or enhance mc concentrations additionally the experimental set up included a long lasting exposure covering the period from seed to harvest radish plants receiving karla s water from the commencement of their life cycle i e seed showed a significant 50 growth reduction of the above ground tissues compared to control fig 1 a plants of the other treatments that received degraded water at a subsequent developmental stage showed intermediate growth concerning the edible part the taproot growth was negatively affected in all karla treatments with the exception of 2 leaves fig 1b not only biomass accumulation but also the size of taproots was decreased as the volume measurements indicated fig 2 a carrot growth presented a similar picture in the aerial parts fig 1c nevertheless the carrots produced in the seed treatment were severely affected since a 70 decrease compared to control was evident fig 1d the depuration procedure r resulted in similar carrot growth and size with the 4 l treatment both not significantly lower from control figs 1d and 2b accordingly the general picture of both radish and carrot growth performance was that degraded water resulted in lighter and smaller taproots moreover the extent of decrease compared to control was related to the developmental stage that the plants first received mc rich water in the case of carrots the prolonged depuration phase 2 5 months was not sufficient for the full recovery of all growth parameters the response of carrot plants to irrigation with mc lr contaminated water at ecologically relevant concentrations was the subject of two recent studies lee et al 2017 machado et al 2017a their different experimental set up regarded the short time period restricted to 28 30 days the fully or semi controlled environment and the absence of developmental stage related exposure to mcs machado et al 2017a found no growth effects of mc lr at the concentration of 10 Œºg l 1 whilst at 50 Œºg l 1 a pronounced decrease was evident consistent to our results was the inferiority of growth performance of carrots exposed to 1 5 and 10 Œºg l 1 mc lr in the study of lee et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge there are only two articles in the relevant literature dealing with plant exposure to mc rich irrigation water at different developmental stages one studying lettuce levizou et al 2017 and the other cucumber zhu et al 2018 lettuce root growth was marginally reduced whilst the aerial part did not suffer any growth reduction of after 2 months of mc rich water treatment however the growth of cucumber was impaired in a developmental stage dependent manner with the earliest stage severely affected similar to the response of both root vegetables in the present study according to elisa test mcs were detected in both tested root vegetables the elisa test used in this study is based on an indirect competitive method using the b amino acid 6e adda as the epitope for antibody recognition for the quantitative analysis of all the mc analogs which could lead to false positive results and matrix effect however according to validation tests which were performed in the present study there were no false positive results and the matrix effect was negligible the general patterns of this bioaccumulation collectively comprise of i a developmental stage dependency ii a marginal efficiency of the depuration phase iii a species specific allocation of toxin between the above and below ground plant parts and iv a minimal toxin load of the soil in more detail the bioaccumulation profile of radish showed a clear developmental stage dependency especially in the edible taproot since the concentration of mcs was the highest in the seed treatment followed in a decreasing order by cotyledon 2 leaves and 4 leaves treatments table 1 the same trend was obvious in the radish leaves although the difference between seed and cotyledon leaves was not statistically significant in the case of carrots the seed and 4 leaves plants displayed similar quantitative differences with radish in both the aerial part and taproots table 1 remarkably three fold mcs concentration was detected in the seed treatment when compared with 4 leaves treatment in both measured plant species and plant parts the above described findings fully corroborate the two earlier studies conducted with the application of mc lr at different plant developmental stages indeed both lettuce levizou et al 2017 and cucumber zhu et al 2018 showed the same profile with radish and carrot i e the earlier in its life cycle a plant is exposed to mcs the higher the toxin bioaccumulation is this possibly explains the well documented increased vulnerability of seedlings to cyanotoxins that was consistently reported in relevant studies azevedo et al 2014 peuthert and pflugmacher 2010 saqrane et al 2008 comparable mcs concentrations were reported for radish in the early work of mohamed and al shehri 2009 who performed a monitoring of mcs bioaccumulation in various vegetables which were exposed to contaminated water from underground wells although the toxin concentration in the irrigation water was low 0 3 1 8 Œºg of total mcs l 1 considerably high values were detected in radish taproots reaching 360 ng mc eq g 1 fw mohamed and al shehri 2009 which well corresponds to 2 leaves treatment values of the present study obviously we can only speculate that the total toxin administered to plants is comparable because in this former study no time of exposure is mentioned interestingly working with carrots exposed to 10 and 50 Œºg mc lr l 1 for 28 days machado et al 2017a detected extremely low mc lr concentration in roots when elisa test was employed while lee et al 2017 reported comparable with our results in carrots receiving similar mcs doses carrots of the present study were subjected to a depuration experiment in which they received tap water for the second half of their life cycle while in the first half 2 5 months were irrigated with mc rich water at the end of the 5 months growth period r plants were found to retain half of the mc load measured in seed plants table 1 and this was evident in both above and below ground tissues in fact r plants turned out to respond similarly to the 4 leaves treatment concerning toxin uptake and accumulation despite the prolonged depuration phase it proved inefficient to eliminate mcs from the plant tissues to the best of our knowledge the depuration potential of carrot has not been documented previously lettuce and spinach have been recently subjected to depuration experiments which although in a different setting from ours confirmed the recovery possibility in a species specific degree cao et al 2019 cordeiro ara√∫jo et al 2016 cordeiro ara√∫jo et al 2016 have shown that lettuce required 29 and 37 days to depurate when treated for 7 days with 5 and 10 Œºg l 1 mc lr respectively different depuration periods were reported by cao et al 2019 working with lettuce and spinach exposed for 12 days to 10 Œºg l 1 mc lr i e 6 and 12 days respectively are needed to reach to a safe mc level which in the case of lettuce approached zero it has to be stressed here that in the previous mentioned studies the exposure to mc lr was short 7 and 12d and both highlighted the time dependent bioaccumulation of mc lr this latter result implies that if longer time period of the bioaccumulation phase was employed e g the whole crop growing period the efficiency of depuration phase would be different although inconsistent in settings and time scales all the above described findings confirm that to some extent it is possible to decontaminate mcs laden edible tissues the radish taproots exhibited consistently higher accumulation of toxins compared with the leaves at all treatments table 1 this profile is widely documented in vegetables exposed to cyanotoxins cao et al 2018b levizou et al 2017 mohamed and al shehri 2009 but it is not ubiquitous the opposite was found in carrot interestingly if we calculate the ratio of mc lr equivalents measured in leaves roots it results to 1 0 5 0 8 for radish but for carrot 1 4 5 6 2 the bioaccumulation pattern in terms of aerial root difference is completely species specific in contrast with our study lee et al 2017 found that the carrot edible part accumulated significantly higher amount of mc lr compared to leaves at all tested doses this discrepancy may be attributed mainly to the different time scale of the two studies i e our plants faced the mcs laden water for 5 months whilst at lee et al experiment for one month the prolonged exposure lasting the whole growth period until harvest at marketable size potentiates toxin uptake and accumulation this is an additional indication that the realistic time period for crop exposure to contaminated water constitutes an important factor for safe conclusions regarding the bioaccumulation thus the assessment of health risk soil retained a minimal mcs load in both treated vegetables comprising about 10 of taproot concentration in radish and 15 in carrot table 1 substantial differences were not found between treatments however the percentage difference was similar to the reported for carrot in the 10 Œºg mc lr l 1 dose by lee et al 2017 vegetables usually show much higher concentration than the paired soils cao et al 2018b corbel et al 2016 levizou et al 2017 nevertheless soil as a growth medium possesses controversial and often hard to unravel physicochemical features at one end adsorption and bio degradation of mcs result to mitigation of toxic effects through reduced toxin bioavailability and at the other end high persistence and therefore continuous presence of toxins result to soil serving as potential reservoir of mcs thus a threat for consecutive cultivations lee et al 2017 our knowledge about the multiple facets of soil function in respect to mcs fate is far from complete so further relevant studies are urgently needed in order to explore the implications of mcs presence in real soil conditions plant phenolics are multifunctional compounds and one of their primary roles is the protection against abiotic stress karabourniotis et al 2014a in particular under conditions of stress induced to the plant by high mc lr concentration in irrigation water the increase of total phenolics content indicate the activation of the antioxidant system lachrouni et al 2013 similar responses have been documented for other components of the antioxidant machinery such as certain antioxidant enzymes and non enzymatic antioxidants e g ascorbic acid glutathione cao et al 2017 freitas et al 2015 in many studies while the above mentioned molecules as well as total phenolic content showed significant increases at high mc lr concentrations exceeding 50 Œºg l 1 no significant changes have been documented at environmentally relevant mcs concentrations 10 Œºg l 1 drobac et al 2017 levizou et al 2017 machado et al 2017a pereira et al 2017 this implies that at low toxin doses inherent antioxidant potential renders sufficient protection and or the magnitude of stress does not potentiate the ros formation in our study two interesting aspects of plant response in regard to phenolics have been emerged and presented in figs 3 and 4 radish roots accumulate more phenolics compared to leaves however the between treatments differences follow similar patterns for both tissues fig 3a seed and cot plants exhibited statistically significant decreases compared to control whereas a trend for intermediate concentration was obvious at plants treated with degraded water later in their life cycle i e 2 leaves and 4 leaves in contrast to radish the carrot taproots displayed half phenolic content of the corresponding leaves fig 3b nevertheless similarly to radish seed plants were negatively affected by karla s water in regard to their ability to accumulate phenolics in both above and below ground tissues the recovery treatment in carrot resulted in phenolic content comparable to control fig 3b while the above described tissue phenolic content is a meaningful measure of plant protection response to degraded water an interesting ecophysiological aspect of this protection deployment is presented in fig 4 for carrot there is a significant negative correlation between tissue biomass for all plants and plant parts and the corresponding concentration of total phenolics expressed per g of dry mass this relationship reflects the trade off between growth and defense protection confirming the ecological theory of resource allocation between primary and secondary metabolism under adverse environmental conditions karabourniotis et al 2014a b the cost for the biosynthesis of phenolics as protective metabolites against abiotic and biotic stresses is considerably high thus under these conditions the photosynthate is diverted from growth and allocated to defense protection for the plant to tackle the stress the final result of this resource allocation is reduced growth as compensation for meeting the protection needs against abiotic stress as was the case of carrot facing mcs rich water the possible human health risk from consuming mc treated fresh produce is described by the comparison between the estimated daily intake edi with the tolerable daily intake tdi established by who 1998 the edi values take into account the bioaccumulation of toxin in edible plant tissue the suggested daily serving and the body weight according to the values of edi table 2 the consumption of radish and carrot grown under the conditions described in the present study poses a considerable threat for adults and most notably for children the root vegetables that received mcs rich water from the commencement of their life cycle i e seed treatment exceeded the tdi guideline by almost 4 times for adults and 5 times for children moreover this is a rather conservative estimate since it assumes the consumption of a medium carrot per day for the adults and half for the children nevertheless we adopted the suggested serving sizes of a typical meal proposed by lee et al 2017 for comparison reasons the edi values of cotyledon treatment in radish are comparable with seed while plants that received mcs laden irrigation water in later developmental stages may be considered of moderate risk in carrot the 4 leaves treatment marginally exceeded tdi limit while the recovery treatment did not eliminate the risk though considerably minimized it in comparison with seed taproots the other two studies working with carrots in a different time scale and experimental setting from ours reported controversial results in respect of health risk machado et al 2017a found edi values to be under the tdi limit after 28 days of carrot exposure to moderate concentration of mc lr corroborating our results lee et al 2017 classified the health risk of consuming carrots as moderate and high when consuming carrots irrigated with 5 and 10 Œºg l 1 mc lr respectively 4 conclusions the present study explored the impact of irrigation water originated from an agricultural water reservoir with moderate cyanotoxins load on growth biochemical protection response and bioaccumulation profiles of two widely consumed root vegetables the treated plants received the degraded water at different developmental stages collectively the pattern of growth response of both radish and carrot pointed to the deterioration of plant productivity when plants confront mcs from the commencement of their life cycle the impact is less profound when degraded water is first received at subsequent developmental stages the protection response in terms of phenolic content was considerably insufficient to tackle the challenge at the tissue level the bioaccumulation profile indicated that the earlier in its life cycle a plant confronts the exposure the greater mcs content is evident since this was particularly intense in the edible parts the related health risk is considerably high the attempted depuration procedure in carrot although prolonged proved inefficient to eliminate mcs bioaccumulation and growth impairment thus pointing to irreversible hazards very few studies have examined the mc impact on crops using naturally contaminated water i e from lakes agricultural reservoirs or groundwater and not pure mc lr or cyanobacterial extracts other bioactive metabolites may also be present in the naturally contaminated water possibly interfering with cyanotoxins and or accounting in some extent for the observed results in this frame although the growth and protection response of radish and carrot cannot be exclusively attributed to a cause and effect relationship to the presence of mcs in irrigation water the considerable bioaccumulation of mcs is evident and poses serious threats to human health the health risk is high and could only partially be alleviated by subsequent irrigation with mcs free water the results emphasize the vulnerability of agricultural systems and highlight the importance of monitoring the cyanotoxins content in irrigation water furthermore since the agricultural water management is a multifaceted subject it is necessary to re visit the regulation and guidelines concerning the origin the quality and the cyanotoxins load of the irrigation water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10513,cyanotoxins are secondary metabolites of the ubiquitous cyanobacteria and exert their toxicity to plants and humans human health can be impacted by cyanotoxin bioaccumulation in crops via irrigation from contaminated water reservoirs in the present study we conducted an ecologically relevant experiment in terms of toxin dose cultivation time and the use of agricultural soil and naturally contaminated irrigation water we investigated the growth response protection potential bioaccumulation profile and the related health risk of two widely consumed root vegetables radish and carrot when the exposure to microcystins rich water commences at different developmental stages from seed to 4 true leaves stage additionally carrot was subjected to a prolonged depuration phase in order to evaluate its recovery potential the results indicate a developmental stage dependent profile of all measured parameters severe growth reduction was evident for plants receiving degraded water from the seed stage which reached 50 and 70 for radish and carrots respectively the impact was less pronounced when degraded water was first received at subsequent developmental stages the protection response in terms of phenolic content was considerably insufficient to mitigate the stress at the tissue level the earlier in its life cycle a plant confronts the exposure the greater microcystins content occurs in its tissue particularly in the edible parts posing considerably high health risk for humans upon consumption estimated daily toxin intake after consuming treated taproots exceeded the world health organization safety threshold by 4 and 5 times for adults and children respectively the experimental depuration in carrot only partially alleviated the problem of bioaccumulation and growth impairment thus pointing to irreversible hazards the results highlight the importance of monitoring the major cyanotoxins content in irrigation water and emphasize the necessity to re visit the regulation guidelines concerning the origin and quality of the irrigation water in the frame of effective agricultural water management keywords cyanotoxins phenolics growth bioaccumulation human health risk depuration 1 introduction cyanotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by some toxic cyanobacterial species mainly as defense and allelopathic agents omidi et al 2018 they are released to surface water of lakes and reservoirs during cyanobacterial blooms especially thriving under eutrophic conditions microcystins mcs comprise the most widespread group of cyanotoxins globally with 200 congeners already been identified fontanillo and k√∂hn 2018 altaner et al 2019 mcs are regarded as a threat to plant human and livestock health which they reach through irrigation and drinking water as well as via food chain contamination corbel et al 2014 the threat to animal health is related to mcs hepatotoxic and carcinogenic potential the toxicity mechanism is well recognized and appears to be the same in both plant and animal cells based primarily on the inhibition of phosphatases pp1 and pp2a which causes the impairment of many physiological processes fontanillo and k√∂hn 2018 secondary mechanisms of toxicity in the plant body include increased production of reactive oxygen species ros reduced transcription of genes related to root growth and interference with auxin transport chen et al 2013 machado et al 2017b prieto et al 2011 the above mentioned mcs effects reflect upon the whole plant physiology and growth photosynthesis nutrient uptake shoot and root growth especially lateral roots and root hair formation and loss of membrane integrity are reported to be negatively affected by mcs absorption by plant cao et al 2018a 2017 cordeiro ara√∫jo et al 2015 redouane et al 2019 in addition to the possible functional impairment caused by mcs their bioaccumulation is evident in a wide range of edible plant species raising concerns about the risk of consuming mc contaminated fresh products machado et al 2017b and literature there in in most of the relevant studies levizou et al 2017 mohamed and al shehri 2009 the toxin concentration in roots was higher compared to the leaves but these studies focused on vegetables whose edible part is the leaf leaving thus a knowledge gap on the toxin accumulation potential of root vegetables despite their importance as part of human diet a decade of intensive research concerning mcs effects on plant performance often exaggerating in concentrations used short time of exposure and preference to substrate or hydroponics instead of soil as growth medium helped in defining the thresholds as well as the mechanisms of mc possible toxic activity after this period during which many plant species were tested two review papers proposed a new conceptual framework concerning environmental relevance and true dimensions of mcs effect corbel et al 2014 and machado et al 2017b identified the gaps criticized exaggerations in experimental setup but most notably set the prerequisites for safe conclusions i e i realistic concentrations b adequate time of exposure c soil as growth medium ecologically relevant mcs concentrations are essential in order to avoid overestimation of mcs impacts on plant and the bioaccumulation dynamics since both are dependent on the exposure concentration moreover the extremely short exposure times ranging from 1 to 15 days are considered non indicative of plant performance since the stress is sharp and plant defense mechanisms have no time to deploy finally soil seems to have an important role in the mitigation of mcs toxic effects through hampering plant uptake due to toxin adsorption in soil particles chelation and bio degradation chen et al 2006 redouane et al 2019 two understudied aspects of mcs effects on plant are the developmental stage dependent response and the depuration potential of the vegetable when its exposure to mc contaminated water terminates concerning the latter only two studies have been published reporting that decontamination of lettuce and spinach was possible after a short exposure to a medium mc lr concentration followed by a depuration period of long duration cao et al 2019 cordeiro ara√∫jo et al 2016 our previous work with lettuce irrigated with mcs rich water indicated that the developmental stage in which the plant faces the toxin is important in shaping its response as well as the bioaccumulation profile levizou et al 2017 the conclusion was that the earlier in its life cycle lettuce receives contaminated water the greater impact on growth and the higher bioaccumulation is evident taking into account the realistic experimental conditions framework we performed experiments to assess the effect of mc lr on two root vegetables and furthermore to test whether the developmental stage in which the plant receives the degraded water plays a crucial role in growth and bioaccumulation response carrot and radish were grown in agricultural soil and irrigated with mc lr rich water from a freshwater reservoir constructed for agricultural use additionally in the case of carrot a depuration treatment was performed to evaluate its de contamination potential the study aims at a better understanding of the true impact of ecologically relevant concentration of mc lr on growth and acceptability for human consumption of high risk root vegetables 2 materials and methods 2 1 irrigation water the karla reservoir 38 km2 in thessaly central greece has been under its water filling process since 2009 and is intended mostly for agricultural use since it has already been adversely affected by both agricultural and industrial pollution from part of its catchment area harmful cyanobacterial blooms are persistent resulting in high mcs concentrations ranging from 1 5 Œºg l 1 to 33 Œºg l 1 papadimitriou et al 2013 in september 2016 a total volume of 250 l was collected from the karla reservoir for the experimental plants irrigation since our purpose was to use the common agricultural practice in water management the water was not subjected to any treatment concerning the release of the intracellular cyanotoxins therefore we examined only the effect of dissolved extracellular mcs the concentration of which was 3 76 Œºg l 1 and remained stable throughout the experiment according to

discussion cyanobacterial blooms and the subsequent release of their toxic compounds is an ongoing problem all over the globe and it is intensified due to climate change o√∂neil et al 2012 this water quality problem has been widely acknowledged to cause adverse effects on crop production when used for irrigation along with posing human health risks nevertheless the assessment of the real dimensions of the problem and the risk is crucial to rely on either in situ surveys of heavily impacted agro ecosystems or experiments with an environmentally relevant experimental setup in the present study we addressed the environmental relevance of mc exposure by using irrigation water from a mcs impacted agricultural water reservoir with no amendments to decrease or enhance mc concentrations additionally the experimental set up included a long lasting exposure covering the period from seed to harvest radish plants receiving karla s water from the commencement of their life cycle i e seed showed a significant 50 growth reduction of the above ground tissues compared to control fig 1 a plants of the other treatments that received degraded water at a subsequent developmental stage showed intermediate growth concerning the edible part the taproot growth was negatively affected in all karla treatments with the exception of 2 leaves fig 1b not only biomass accumulation but also the size of taproots was decreased as the volume measurements indicated fig 2 a carrot growth presented a similar picture in the aerial parts fig 1c nevertheless the carrots produced in the seed treatment were severely affected since a 70 decrease compared to control was evident fig 1d the depuration procedure r resulted in similar carrot growth and size with the 4 l treatment both not significantly lower from control figs 1d and 2b accordingly the general picture of both radish and carrot growth performance was that degraded water resulted in lighter and smaller taproots moreover the extent of decrease compared to control was related to the developmental stage that the plants first received mc rich water in the case of carrots the prolonged depuration phase 2 5 months was not sufficient for the full recovery of all growth parameters the response of carrot plants to irrigation with mc lr contaminated water at ecologically relevant concentrations was the subject of two recent studies lee et al 2017 machado et al 2017a their different experimental set up regarded the short time period restricted to 28 30 days the fully or semi controlled environment and the absence of developmental stage related exposure to mcs machado et al 2017a found no growth effects of mc lr at the concentration of 10 Œºg l 1 whilst at 50 Œºg l 1 a pronounced decrease was evident consistent to our results was the inferiority of growth performance of carrots exposed to 1 5 and 10 Œºg l 1 mc lr in the study of lee et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge there are only two articles in the relevant literature dealing with plant exposure to mc rich irrigation water at different developmental stages one studying lettuce levizou et al 2017 and the other cucumber zhu et al 2018 lettuce root growth was marginally reduced whilst the aerial part did not suffer any growth reduction of after 2 months of mc rich water treatment however the growth of cucumber was impaired in a developmental stage dependent manner with the earliest stage severely affected similar to the response of both root vegetables in the present study according to elisa test mcs were detected in both tested root vegetables the elisa test used in this study is based on an indirect competitive method using the b amino acid 6e adda as the epitope for antibody recognition for the quantitative analysis of all the mc analogs which could lead to false positive results and matrix effect however according to validation tests which were performed in the present study there were no false positive results and the matrix effect was negligible the general patterns of this bioaccumulation collectively comprise of i a developmental stage dependency ii a marginal efficiency of the depuration phase iii a species specific allocation of toxin between the above and below ground plant parts and iv a minimal toxin load of the soil in more detail the bioaccumulation profile of radish showed a clear developmental stage dependency especially in the edible taproot since the concentration of mcs was the highest in the seed treatment followed in a decreasing order by cotyledon 2 leaves and 4 leaves treatments table 1 the same trend was obvious in the radish leaves although the difference between seed and cotyledon leaves was not statistically significant in the case of carrots the seed and 4 leaves plants displayed similar quantitative differences with radish in both the aerial part and taproots table 1 remarkably three fold mcs concentration was detected in the seed treatment when compared with 4 leaves treatment in both measured plant species and plant parts the above described findings fully corroborate the two earlier studies conducted with the application of mc lr at different plant developmental stages indeed both lettuce levizou et al 2017 and cucumber zhu et al 2018 showed the same profile with radish and carrot i e the earlier in its life cycle a plant is exposed to mcs the higher the toxin bioaccumulation is this possibly explains the well documented increased vulnerability of seedlings to cyanotoxins that was consistently reported in relevant studies azevedo et al 2014 peuthert and pflugmacher 2010 saqrane et al 2008 comparable mcs concentrations were reported for radish in the early work of mohamed and al shehri 2009 who performed a monitoring of mcs bioaccumulation in various vegetables which were exposed to contaminated water from underground wells although the toxin concentration in the irrigation water was low 0 3 1 8 Œºg of total mcs l 1 considerably high values were detected in radish taproots reaching 360 ng mc eq g 1 fw mohamed and al shehri 2009 which well corresponds to 2 leaves treatment values of the present study obviously we can only speculate that the total toxin administered to plants is comparable because in this former study no time of exposure is mentioned interestingly working with carrots exposed to 10 and 50 Œºg mc lr l 1 for 28 days machado et al 2017a detected extremely low mc lr concentration in roots when elisa test was employed while lee et al 2017 reported comparable with our results in carrots receiving similar mcs doses carrots of the present study were subjected to a depuration experiment in which they received tap water for the second half of their life cycle while in the first half 2 5 months were irrigated with mc rich water at the end of the 5 months growth period r plants were found to retain half of the mc load measured in seed plants table 1 and this was evident in both above and below ground tissues in fact r plants turned out to respond similarly to the 4 leaves treatment concerning toxin uptake and accumulation despite the prolonged depuration phase it proved inefficient to eliminate mcs from the plant tissues to the best of our knowledge the depuration potential of carrot has not been documented previously lettuce and spinach have been recently subjected to depuration experiments which although in a different setting from ours confirmed the recovery possibility in a species specific degree cao et al 2019 cordeiro ara√∫jo et al 2016 cordeiro ara√∫jo et al 2016 have shown that lettuce required 29 and 37 days to depurate when treated for 7 days with 5 and 10 Œºg l 1 mc lr respectively different depuration periods were reported by cao et al 2019 working with lettuce and spinach exposed for 12 days to 10 Œºg l 1 mc lr i e 6 and 12 days respectively are needed to reach to a safe mc level which in the case of lettuce approached zero it has to be stressed here that in the previous mentioned studies the exposure to mc lr was short 7 and 12d and both highlighted the time dependent bioaccumulation of mc lr this latter result implies that if longer time period of the bioaccumulation phase was employed e g the whole crop growing period the efficiency of depuration phase would be different although inconsistent in settings and time scales all the above described findings confirm that to some extent it is possible to decontaminate mcs laden edible tissues the radish taproots exhibited consistently higher accumulation of toxins compared with the leaves at all treatments table 1 this profile is widely documented in vegetables exposed to cyanotoxins cao et al 2018b levizou et al 2017 mohamed and al shehri 2009 but it is not ubiquitous the opposite was found in carrot interestingly if we calculate the ratio of mc lr equivalents measured in leaves roots it results to 1 0 5 0 8 for radish but for carrot 1 4 5 6 2 the bioaccumulation pattern in terms of aerial root difference is completely species specific in contrast with our study lee et al 2017 found that the carrot edible part accumulated significantly higher amount of mc lr compared to leaves at all tested doses this discrepancy may be attributed mainly to the different time scale of the two studies i e our plants faced the mcs laden water for 5 months whilst at lee et al experiment for one month the prolonged exposure lasting the whole growth period until harvest at marketable size potentiates toxin uptake and accumulation this is an additional indication that the realistic time period for crop exposure to contaminated water constitutes an important factor for safe conclusions regarding the bioaccumulation thus the assessment of health risk soil retained a minimal mcs load in both treated vegetables comprising about 10 of taproot concentration in radish and 15 in carrot table 1 substantial differences were not found between treatments however the percentage difference was similar to the reported for carrot in the 10 Œºg mc lr l 1 dose by lee et al 2017 vegetables usually show much higher concentration than the paired soils cao et al 2018b corbel et al 2016 levizou et al 2017 nevertheless soil as a growth medium possesses controversial and often hard to unravel physicochemical features at one end adsorption and bio degradation of mcs result to mitigation of toxic effects through reduced toxin bioavailability and at the other end high persistence and therefore continuous presence of toxins result to soil serving as potential reservoir of mcs thus a threat for consecutive cultivations lee et al 2017 our knowledge about the multiple facets of soil function in respect to mcs fate is far from complete so further relevant studies are urgently needed in order to explore the implications of mcs presence in real soil conditions plant phenolics are multifunctional compounds and one of their primary roles is the protection against abiotic stress karabourniotis et al 2014a in particular under conditions of stress induced to the plant by high mc lr concentration in irrigation water the increase of total phenolics content indicate the activation of the antioxidant system lachrouni et al 2013 similar responses have been documented for other components of the antioxidant machinery such as certain antioxidant enzymes and non enzymatic antioxidants e g ascorbic acid glutathione cao et al 2017 freitas et al 2015 in many studies while the above mentioned molecules as well as total phenolic content showed significant increases at high mc lr concentrations exceeding 50 Œºg l 1 no significant changes have been documented at environmentally relevant mcs concentrations 10 Œºg l 1 drobac et al 2017 levizou et al 2017 machado et al 2017a pereira et al 2017 this implies that at low toxin doses inherent antioxidant potential renders sufficient protection and or the magnitude of stress does not potentiate the ros formation in our study two interesting aspects of plant response in regard to phenolics have been emerged and presented in figs 3 and 4 radish roots accumulate more phenolics compared to leaves however the between treatments differences follow similar patterns for both tissues fig 3a seed and cot plants exhibited statistically significant decreases compared to control whereas a trend for intermediate concentration was obvious at plants treated with degraded water later in their life cycle i e 2 leaves and 4 leaves in contrast to radish the carrot taproots displayed half phenolic content of the corresponding leaves fig 3b nevertheless similarly to radish seed plants were negatively affected by karla s water in regard to their ability to accumulate phenolics in both above and below ground tissues the recovery treatment in carrot resulted in phenolic content comparable to control fig 3b while the above described tissue phenolic content is a meaningful measure of plant protection response to degraded water an interesting ecophysiological aspect of this protection deployment is presented in fig 4 for carrot there is a significant negative correlation between tissue biomass for all plants and plant parts and the corresponding concentration of total phenolics expressed per g of dry mass this relationship reflects the trade off between growth and defense protection confirming the ecological theory of resource allocation between primary and secondary metabolism under adverse environmental conditions karabourniotis et al 2014a b the cost for the biosynthesis of phenolics as protective metabolites against abiotic and biotic stresses is considerably high thus under these conditions the photosynthate is diverted from growth and allocated to defense protection for the plant to tackle the stress the final result of this resource allocation is reduced growth as compensation for meeting the protection needs against abiotic stress as was the case of carrot facing mcs rich water the possible human health risk from consuming mc treated fresh produce is described by the comparison between the estimated daily intake edi with the tolerable daily intake tdi established by who 1998 the edi values take into account the bioaccumulation of toxin in edible plant tissue the suggested daily serving and the body weight according to the values of edi table 2 the consumption of radish and carrot grown under the conditions described in the present study poses a considerable threat for adults and most notably for children the root vegetables that received mcs rich water from the commencement of their life cycle i e seed treatment exceeded the tdi guideline by almost 4 times for adults and 5 times for children moreover this is a rather conservative estimate since it assumes the consumption of a medium carrot per day for the adults and half for the children nevertheless we adopted the suggested serving sizes of a typical meal proposed by lee et al 2017 for comparison reasons the edi values of cotyledon treatment in radish are comparable with seed while plants that received mcs laden irrigation water in later developmental stages may be considered of moderate risk in carrot the 4 leaves treatment marginally exceeded tdi limit while the recovery treatment did not eliminate the risk though considerably minimized it in comparison with seed taproots the other two studies working with carrots in a different time scale and experimental setting from ours reported controversial results in respect of health risk machado et al 2017a found edi values to be under the tdi limit after 28 days of carrot exposure to moderate concentration of mc lr corroborating our results lee et al 2017 classified the health risk of consuming carrots as moderate and high when consuming carrots irrigated with 5 and 10 Œºg l 1 mc lr respectively 4 conclusions the present study explored the impact of irrigation water originated from an agricultural water reservoir with moderate cyanotoxins load on growth biochemical protection response and bioaccumulation profiles of two widely consumed root vegetables the treated plants received the degraded water at different developmental stages collectively the pattern of growth response of both radish and carrot pointed to the deterioration of plant productivity when plants confront mcs from the commencement of their life cycle the impact is less profound when degraded water is first received at subsequent developmental stages the protection response in terms of phenolic content was considerably insufficient to tackle the challenge at the tissue level the bioaccumulation profile indicated that the earlier in its life cycle a plant confronts the exposure the greater mcs content is evident since this was particularly intense in the edible parts the related health risk is considerably high the attempted depuration procedure in carrot although prolonged proved inefficient to eliminate mcs bioaccumulation and growth impairment thus pointing to irreversible hazards very few studies have examined the mc impact on crops using naturally contaminated water i e from lakes agricultural reservoirs or groundwater and not pure mc lr or cyanobacterial extracts other bioactive metabolites may also be present in the naturally contaminated water possibly interfering with cyanotoxins and or accounting in some extent for the observed results in this frame although the growth and protection response of radish and carrot cannot be exclusively attributed to a cause and effect relationship to the presence of mcs in irrigation water the considerable bioaccumulation of mcs is evident and poses serious threats to human health the health risk is high and could only partially be alleviated by subsequent irrigation with mcs free water the results emphasize the vulnerability of agricultural systems and highlight the importance of monitoring the cyanotoxins content in irrigation water furthermore since the agricultural water management is a multifaceted subject it is necessary to re visit the regulation and guidelines concerning the origin the quality and the cyanotoxins load of the irrigation water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

10514,winter wheat is the predominant crop in the huaibei plain of anhui province china the huaibei plain has a transitional climate and a shallow water table as global warming accelerates climate change in the area may impact agricultural production in shallow groundwater regions capillary rise can be large and it can act as an important water resource for crop use however it is not clear how climate change will impact groundwater depths and crops based on local weather data from 1960 to 2010 a general circulation model hadgem2 ao which performed best in simulating precipitation in the study area and three representative concentration pathways rcps rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the validated numerical model hydrus 1d was used to estimate the daily groundwater contribution to the crop root zone in 2011 2100 of different hydrological growing seasons the largest groundwater contribution and deep drainage occurred at a water table depth of 1 5 m the groundwater contribution to crop root zones was largest for rcp 2 6 and the deep drainage was largest for rcp 8 5 the results indicated that climate change could alter the distribution of the groundwater contribution in each growing period meanwhile the phenophases of winter wheat for rcp 2 6 were delayed while they were advanced for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 in wet and normal seasons there was no need for irrigation for rcp 4 5 during the whole growing season however in a dry season a small amount of irrigation was still needed during the maturity stage for rcp 2 6 in general the total irrigation amounts needed for winter wheat growth were reduced for all hydrological conditions with the three rcps keywords winter wheat groundwater contribution climate change transpiration crop water requirement hydrus 1d 1 introduction the current climate change period is brought about in part by human activities according to the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2013 climate change is accelerating it is reported that global surface mean temperature rose 0 85 during the period 1880 2012 for representative concentration pathways rcp rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 the mean surface temperatures are estimated to increase by 1 0 1 8 2 2 and 3 7 respectively in the late twenty first century precipitation amounts have increased over the mid latitude land areas of the northern hemisphere since 1901 and extreme precipitation events are estimated to become more intense and frequent in many regions ipcc 2013 climate change and increasing temperature affect water resources and crop ecological systems via precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture and groundwater chiew et al 1995 elmeddahi et al 2014 helfer et al 2012 li and fang 2017 shahvari et al 2019 woldeamlak et al 2007 a warming climate can accelerate evapotranspiration lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 change the hydrologic cycle bala et al 2010 and increase lake drying klein et al 2014 renewable surface water and groundwater resources will decrease ipcc 2013 thus it is important to estimate future climate impacts on water resources help plan for changes in water availability and to palliate foreseeable damages irrigated agriculture accounts for approximately 70 of the world s freshwater withdrawals ayars and schoneman 2006 with renewable water resources becoming scarcer as temperatures increase it is urgent to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce agricultural water usage in china 70 of the food is produced on irrigated land gao et al 2017 additionally rapid development of urbanization and industrialization will increasingly use more water and the decreasing water resources will force agriculture to reduce its water usage yan et al 2015 therefore improving irrigation efficiency and reducing agricultural water use in china under climate change is an important priority wang et al 2014b possible solutions include developing more efficient irrigation methods such as drip thompson et al 2009 and improving irrigation management to maximize the use of shallow groundwater by crops gao et al 2017 in shallow groundwater regions capillary rise occurs and at times contributes significantly to crop water requirements this indicates that developing and managing the use of shallow groundwater can reduce or even completely eliminate irrigation requirements without compromising on crop yields gao et al 2017 as a critical resource for crop water consumption the groundwater contribution to agriculture water consumption has attracted widespread attention white 1932 provided an early description on how groundwater contributes to crop roots grismer and gates 1988 presented a nomograph describing the groundwater contribution to et of cotton yang and hong 1999 reported that 16 of the transpiration of maize was derived from a water table with a depth between 0 7 and 1 3 m analogously babajimopoulos et al 2007 found that the contribution of groundwater to maize was 18 when the water table depth was 0 58 m furthermore kahlown et al 2005 investigated the effect of shallow groundwater on crop water requirements for six crops a water table depth of 1 5 2 0 m was considered to be the optimum depth for all of the studied crops these results indicated that shallow groundwater had a potential to be a supplementary water resource for crop water requirements developing a better understanding of crop water uptake from groundwater is needed to support the optimum design of irrigation systems numerical simulation is an efficient method to investigate upward soil water fluxes liu et al 2006 used the water balance simulation model isareg to estimate the groundwater contribution to the crop root zone soylu et al 2014 integrated hydrus 1d into the agro ibis agroecosystem model to estimate the influence of shallow groundwater on crop growth similarly han et al 2015 used a numerical model which coupled hydrus 1d with a simplified crop growth model from swat to evaluate the effect of groundwater on cotton root zone water balance shouse et al 2011 and satchithanantham et al 2014 used the hydrus 1d water flow model to simulate soil water contents and upward water fluxes from groundwater they verified that the model simulation results closely matched the measurements although the contribution of groundwater to crop water use is relatively well studied it is not clear how groundwater contributions will be affected by climate change the huaibei plain of anhui province is an important irrigated grain production area in china which experiences times of water shortage and times of waterlogging due to precipitation heterogeneity wang and xu 2012 therefore using surface water and shallow groundwater for irrigation is common in the huaibei plain water resources research institute of anhui province and huai river conservancy 2010 some effects of climate change on huaibei plain water resources have been studied zuo et al 2012 reported that surface water resources decrease with decreasing rainfall and increasing air temperature shi et al 2013 found that recent climate change has increased the surface water and stream flow but decreased actual evapotranspiration surface water has been studied but less is known about the impact of climate change on groundwater in the huaibei plain groundwater is a significant component of the water balance and should be viewed as an important source of water for crop evapotranspiration zhu et al 2018 supplementary irrigation is only required when effective precipitation and the contribution of groundwater do not meet the crop water requirements in order to protect river water and groundwater from chemical pollution as a result of excessive irrigation yet at the same time to meet the crop water needs irrigation water amounts must be estimated accurately therefore estimating the contribution of groundwater to crops is important for determining irrigation volumes and discharge volumes for crop growth management decision making winter wheat is the major crop in the huaibei plain during the winter wheat growing season which is a rainless season the contribution of groundwater to the crop represents an important water source for growth in this study the validated numerical model hydrus 1d ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2008 was used to estimate the daily contribution of groundwater to winter wheat root zone in 2011 2100 for the scenarios described by hadgem2 ao the main objectives of this research were 1 to determine the evapotranspiration and the water table depth in 2011 2100 for low medium and high rcp scenarios with hadgem2 ao a general circulation model gcm 2 to model the shallow groundwater contribution to winter wheat for 2011 2100 for rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 and 3 to investigate the impact of climate change on the contribution of groundwater to the crop root zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the huaibei plain is situated in northern anhui province china covering the area between 32 25 to 34 35 n and 114 55 to 118 10 e with a total area of 37 420 km2 its primary soils are lime concretion black soil and fluvo aquic soil which account for 54 and 33 respectively of the huaibei plain land area the study area belongs to a transitional zone of northern subtropical and warm temperate climates table 1 presents the annual average hydrological and crop growth data of the huaibei plain the annual precipitation of the huaibei plain decreases from southeast to northwest 1100 750 mm wang et al 2010 and the water table depth increases from southeast to northwest 1 5 3 5 m wang and bo 2014a 2014b the wudaogou experimentation research station wers of hohai university of xinmaqiao township guzhen county anhui province is located at 33 9 n 117 21 e fig 1 the mean annual precipitation is 890 mm with 60 or more of the precipitation occurring in june to september the average evaporation demand is 1000 mm the mean annual

by vertical seepage of atmospheric water and discharged mainly by evapotranspiration and artificial abstraction huaibei plain is the winter wheat production area notably wers is located in a winter wheat breeding field with representative phenophases of winter wheat zhang et al 2014 the hydrological and crop growth conditions of wers represent the average conditions of the huaibei plain consequently wers is selected as a typical representative station of the huaibei plain to investigate the effect of climate change on the groundwater contribution 2 2 data 2 2 1 meteorological data the meteorological data required by hydrus 1d are daily precipitation mean temperature maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity and wind speed during the winter wheat growth season meteorological data are monitored at wers the precipitation and temperature of future years 2011 2100 for a very low forcing scenario rcp 2 6 a medium stabilization scenario rcp 4 5 and a very high baseline emission scenario rcp 8 5 are estimated by hadgem2 ao of cmip5 2 2 2 winter wheat growth parameters twenty years 1991 2011 of records show that the huaibei plain winter wheat mean planting date is october 10 with mean harvest date of may 31 water resources research institute of anhui province and huai river conservancy 2010 the crop growth stages and days after sowing das are shown in table 2 the crop height at maturity the maximum leaf area index lai during the growth period and the root distribution were used to describe winter wheat growth at its optimal state the crop height at maturity and the maximum lai during the growth period were determined by their relationships with yield using the data for 1991 2011 during 1991 2011 2009 had the largest winter wheat yield of 7559 kg ha 1 in 2009 the average plant height at maturity was 69 cm and the maximum lai was 7 0 water resources research institute of anhui province and huai river conservancy 2010 when calculating the daily groundwater contribution to the root zone for the different hydrologic seasons of both historical and future years it was assumed that all winter wheat plants were in their optimal state under the conditions of maximum lai set at 7 0 and plant height at maturity of 69 cm 2 2 3 depth of water table hu et al 2009 and gao 2010 reported that human activity effects the huaibei plain water table depth more than precipitation and evaporation depths of water table during winter wheat growth seasons from 1989 2009 are shown in fig 2 data came from wers the shallowest water table for last 21 years was 1 1 m in 1992 and 2000 and the deepest was 5 3 m of 2001 however it is projected that the groundwater is only available for the roots when the depth is less than 4 1 m water resources research institute of anhui province and huai river conservancy 2010 so we set the future water table depth to be between 1 1 m and 4 1 m the perennial average daily water table depth during the winter wheat growth season is shown in fig 3 and the average water table depth during the winter wheat growth period is 2 0 m according to the available water table data the average water table depths were set at 1 1 m 1 5 m 2 0 m 2 5 m 3 0 m 3 5 m and 4 1 m respectively in the future crop stages correspondingly daily water table depths during the winter wheat growth season under different average water table depth conditions were calculated by translating the perennial average daily water table depth according to the historical water table depth the probability of each average water table depth is shown in table 3 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 general circulation model the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 released more than 40 gcms ouyang 2016 compared the monthly average temperature and precipitation of 40 gcms and 14 meteorological stations in the huaibei plain the hadgem2 ao climate model performed best in simulating precipitation so hadgem2 ao was used to simulate the future climate conditions in the huaibei plain for three scenarios rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 the hadgem2 ao climate model was developed by the national institute of meteorological research of the korea and met office hadley centre using the hadley centre global environmental model version 2 coupled with atmosphere ocean configuration baek et al 2013 with a resolution of 1 25 1 875 2 3 2 downscaling method a quantile mapping qm method was derived from the empirical transformation of panofsky and brier 1965 it was successfully applied in hydrological applications ringard et al 2017 wood et al 2004 and error correction of gcms cannon et al 2015 piani et al 2010 the principle of qm is to construct empirical cumulative distribution functions ecdf with modeled and observed datasets

≈°im≈Ønek et al 2008 was used to simulate soil water and upward water flux from the shallow groundwater this model simulates one dimensional flow and root water uptake processes the governing equation in the model is the richards equation with a sink term added to simulate the root water extraction ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2008 precipitation potential evapotranspiration etp lai rooting depth water table depth and soil hydraulic properties were the input data required to estimate the shallow groundwater contributions to crop roots precipitation and other weather data required to calculate etp were obtained from wers in this study the maximum lai was set at 7 0 the required hydraulic properties of the soil including residual water content Œ∏r saturated water content Œ∏s parameter Œ± and n in the soil water retention function saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and empirical tortuosity parameter l for five soil layers 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 80 cm and 80 600 cm were estimated in a previous study zhu et al 2018 the upper boundary was specified as an atmospheric boundary condition the potential evaporation ep and transpiration tp rates were specified on a daily basis under this boundary condition and the model calculated the actual evaporation and transpiration rates according to the simulated soil moisture conditions the lower boundary was specified as a time varying pressure head boundary condition the simulated soil profile was 600 cm based on a study of zhu et al 2018 a piecewise root density distribution function was used during the whole growth period the model used to estimate the contribution of groundwater to the root zone of winter wheat has been calibrated and validated in the huaibei plain by zhu et al 2018 the results indicated that the model performed well with root mean square errors rmse of 0 009 cm3 cm 3 and 0 04 mm d 1 in soil water content and evapotranspiration respectively details of the model calibration and validation can be found in zhu et al 2018 2 3 4 future reference crop evapotranspiration as mentioned above etp is an essential input for the simulations it was calculated as 2 e t p k c e t 0 where the kc is a crop efficiency coefficient determined by tang et al 2008 and et 0 is thereference crop evapotranspiration for the historical period et 0 was calculated by the fao penman monteith equation however it was somewhat difficult to calculate et 0 directly with the penman monteith equation for future scenarios because et 0 was closely related to temperature future et 0 was estimated on the basis of temperature the correlation between temperature and et 0 is shown in table 4 the most significant correlation was found between et 0 and maximum temperature tmax with a correlation coefficient of 0 923 monthly tmax and et 0 of 1960 2010 were used to determine the corresponding regression fig 4 two different sets of regression were carried out a linear regression from january to june with a coefficient of correlation of 0 946 fig 5 a and an exponential regression for the period of july to december with a coefficient of correlation of 0 956 fig 5b the regression results are shown in eq 3 these regressions were than used to determine the effect of climate change on the et 0 characteristics 3 e t 0 0 1606 x 0 0998 j a n u a r y t o j u n e 0 365 exp x 13 33 0 5026 j u l y t o d e c e m b e r 2 3 5 determination of hydrological growing seasons based on precipitation frequency analysis during winter wheat growing seasons in the years1980 2010 seasons in which precipitation exceeds 437 mm are considered as wet between 294 437 mm is average and below 294 mm is dry using the coefficient of variation cv and coefficient of skewness cs cv 0 29 cs cv 1 83 according to precipitation data from october to may of 1980 2010 the 1997 1998 2001 2002 and 1999 2000 2007 2008 and 1991 1992 and 2004 2005 seasons are selected as representations of wet normal and dry rainfall conditions respectively fig 6 similarly representative seasons of 2011 2100 are selected by the same method based on precipitation data from hadgem2 ao for three rcps as shown in table 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate change scenarios 3 1 1 future climate scenario simulations based on the simulations using the hadgem2 ao model seasonal precipitation and mean temperature during the winter wheat growth season 10 october 31 may from 1960 to 2100 for three rcps are shown in fig 7 clearly seasonal precipitation and mean temperature had increasing trends in the historical years 1960 2010 in addition to rcp 2 6 the seasonal precipitation and mean temperature for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 also continued to increase based on the historical values rcp 8 5 showed the fastest growth both in precipitation and temperature although the precipitation and temperature for rcp 4 5 was larger than rcp 8 5 in the 2030s the later precipitation and temperature for rcp 8 5 exceeded rcp 4 5 while the precipitation and temperature for rcp 2 6 was lower than the historical period they still had increasing trends in the next 90 years data presented in table 6 shows changes in seasonal tmax tmin minimum temperature and precipitation in the future for the three rcps the projected future tmax increases range from 2 16 to 2 74 for rcp 2 6 from 0 71 to 2 61 for rcp 4 5 and from 0 67 to 4 65 for rcp 8 5 for future tmin the projected increases range from 0 28 to 0 73 for rcp 2 6 from 0 96 to 2 57 for rcp 4 5 and from 0 65 to 4 28 for rcp 8 5 the changes of future tmax and tmin were roughly the same for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 however the changes of tmin were less than those of tmax for rcp 2 6 the future precipitation during the winter wheat growth season reduced by 4 15 for rcp 2 6 and increased by 52 69 and 48 87 for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively therefore the future temperature and precipitation increased the most for rcp 8 5 but decreased for rcp 2 6 compared to the historical values 3 1 2 comparison of simulated to measured climate scenarios to further validate the applicability of three emission scenarios derived by hadgem2 ao in the huaibei plain the simulated precipitation and temperature were compared with that observed at wers during the 2011 2018 winter wheat growth seasons two statistical metrics are selected to evaluate the applicability of three emission scenarios table 7 the correlation coefficient cc was used to describe the degree of linear correlation between the simulated and observed meteorological data and the relative bias rbias was selected to describe the bias of simulation and observation from the statistical indices for precipitation simulation rcp 2 6 remarkably presented the best performance among three emission scenarios in the huaibei plain with the highest cc of 0 56 and the best rbias of 11 47 although the rbias of rcp 2 6 was higher in temperature simulation among three rcps the simulated temperature of rcp 2 6 showed the strongest correlation with the observed temperature with a cc of 0 58 the poor performance of ribas is attributed to the underestimation of the maximum temperature during the winter wheat growth season on the whole in 2011 2018 the climate scenarios of rcp 2 6 were closest to the observations 3 2 effect of climate change on the contribution of groundwater to the root zone 3 2 1 changes of groundwater contributions for various water table depths for seven water table depths the modified hydrus 1d and the hadgem2 ao models were used to estimate the daily groundwater contribution to the root zone of winter wheat from 2011 2100 the simulated cumulative water flux at the bottom of the winter wheat root zone during future crop growth seasons are presented in fig 8 positive values indicate that water entered the root zone from the bottom interestingly a shallower water table depth did not always produce a greater contribution to the root zone which was different from the previous findings that the groundwater contribution decreased with increasing groundwater table depth yang et al 2011 wassar et al 2016 the largest contribution of groundwater to the root zone during the different future hydrological conditions occurred at a water table depth of 1 5 m except for the wet season for rcp 2 6 surprisingly the effective root depth was also 1 5 m liu and luo 2011 found a similar conclusion that the moisture condition in the root zone was appropriate for root development of winter wheat with a water table depth of 1 5 m according to nosetto et al 2009 if the water table is very shallow transpiration decreases due to waterlogging and root anoxia meanwhile if the water table is too shallow the soil water contents are large enough to meet the crop water requirement resulting in a decrease of groundwater contribution to the root zone thus compared to a water table depth of 1 5 m there was a smaller contribution of groundwater with a water table depth of 1 1 m the contributions to the root zone decreased significantly as the groundwater table became deeper than 1 5 m this could be attributed to the smaller upward water fluxes as the water sources moved further below the root zone and the water stress in the root zone decreased the actual evapotranspiration xue et al 2018 the contribution of groundwater to the root zone approached 0 when the water table depth was 4 1 m at which water table depth was defined as the extinction depth of groundwater contribution shah et al 2007 this finding was consistent with the conclusion that the deepest water table depth supplying water to winter wheat roots was 4 1 m water resources research institute of anhui province and huai river conservancy 2010 shah et al 2007 indicated that the extinction depth could vary due to the changes in seasonal and long term climatic conditions the extinction depth derived in this paper was 4 1 m in different emission scenarios and different hydrological growth seasons which did not vary with climate change the negative values in fig 8 imply that water drained from the bottom generally the deep drainage increased from the 2030s to 2090s due to increasing precipitation especially in the wet season this indicated that as precipitation increased deep drainage increased for a water table of 2 5 m deep drainage was almost zero in the normal season while it was large in the wet season the deep drainage did not always increase with decreasing water table depth in the normal season and the dry season for the three rcps the largest deep drainage was observed when the water table depth was 1 5 m as mentioned above the maximum groundwater contribution also occurred at the water table depth of 1 5 m as the water table depth became deeper than 1 5 m the deep drainage tended to decrease with increasing water table depth luo and sophocleous 2010 reported that deep drainage decreased as water table depth increased when the water table depth became deeper the groundwater contribution varied more significantly than did deep drainage this indicated that the deep drainage sensitivity to water table depth was less than the groundwater contribution sensitivity to water table depth 3 2 2 changes of groundwater contribution during winter wheat growth seasons based on the 1989 2009 probability of average water table depth data in the study area table 2 the contributions to the root zones and the drainages for seven water table depths were weighted averaged the future weighted average groundwater contributions and deep drainages during the crop growth season for different hydrological conditions for three emission scenarios are presented in fig 9 positive values indicate a contribution of groundwater to the root zone and negative values imply deep drainage for a status year the contribution of groundwater to a root zone was largest in the normal season at 412 mm and least in the wet season at 286 mm in three future periods the groundwater contribution dropped in the normal season increased in the dry season while there were fluctuations in the wet season compared with the status year the increase of the contribution of groundwater to crop growth in the dry season indicated that the irrigation water could be reduced in future dry seasons the deep drainage was also largest in the normal season and least in the dry season in the status year for future three rcps the deep drainage was largest in the wet season while the normal season was second and the dry season was the least except for the 2030s for rcp 2 6 consequently there was no direct complementary relationship between the groundwater contribution and the deep drainage as shown in fig 9 the groundwater contributions in three hydrological growth seasons were largest for rcp 2 6 the deep drainages were largest for rcp 8 5 and the precipitation was least for rcp 2 6 therefore it could be concluded that there was an inversely proportional relationship between groundwater contribution and precipitation and the deep drainage was proportionate to precipitation previous studies have reported similar results chen et al 2016 luo et al 2010 the noticeable decline in the precipitation resulted in a water table depth decline which is supposed to induce a contribution of groundwater decrease as well however a precipitation decline will also induce a soil moisture deficit for crop growth resulting in an increased contribution of groundwater to root zones to maintain the strong crop water requirement for rcp 2 6 the wet and normal season groundwater contributions decreased in the 2030s due to the decrease of evapotranspiration which was caused by decreasing temperature then in the 2060s to 2090s the upward flux of groundwater to root zones was strengthened with increasing temperature however in the dry season the contribution of groundwater increased in the 2030s due to the decline in precipitation and it decreased in the 2060s to 2090s as the precipitation increased therefore the groundwater contribution in the dry season was mainly affected by precipitation while it was mainly affected by temperature in the normal and wet seasons for rcp2 6 for rcp 4 5 the groundwater contributions rose in the 2030s in the wet and dry seasons mainly due to the increased temperature and evapotranspiration and then dropped in the 2060s and 2090s due to the increased precipitation for rcp 8 5 the contribution of groundwater to the root zone increased in the dry season due to the increase of evapotranspiration and in the normal and wet season it reduced in the 2030s as precipitation increased then it increased in the 2060s with an increase of temperature and finally dropped in the 2090s due to heavier precipitation consequently the contributions of groundwater to the root zone in three hydrological growth seasons were affected by the interaction of temperature and precipitation for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 as seen in fig 9 the deep drainage in the three hydrological growth seasons increased for the three rcps especially for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 in the wet season the deep drainage was even larger than the groundwater contribution to the root zone this indicated that the exchanges of moisture between the soil water and the groundwater could be stronger in future three rcps 3 2 3 changes in groundwater contribution in each growth period of winter wheat fig 10 shows the logarithm of the contribution of groundwater to the root zone of winter wheat during each growth period for three emission scenarios the distributions of the wet season groundwater contribution in growth periods for the future three rcps were significantly different from that in the status year while the distributions were nearly same in the dry season this indicated that climate change could alter the distribution of the groundwater contribution to the root zone of winter wheat in each growth period at the wet season but the variations of the groundwater contribution distributions were similar for the three emission scenarios in the wet and dry seasons the groundwater contribution increased in the sowing and jointing stages notably the increase was more significant in the wet season the increase of the groundwater contribution in the jointing stage was due to high water requirements of winter wheat and increased evapotranspiration caused by increased temperature luo et al 2010 as mentioned the contribution of groundwater dropped in the normal season for the three rcps this decline mainly occurred in the heading and maturity stages in addition according to fig 10 the difference in groundwater contribution in each growth stage was the smallest in the dry season between 32 100 mm which indicated that the dry season had the most homogeneous distribution of groundwater contribution 3 3 effect of climate change on potential transpiration to investigate the effect of climate change on tp this study estimated the cumulative tp of winter wheat during the whole growing season for three rcps in different hydrological growth seasons fig 11 compared to the status year tp during the crop growth period reduced with average values from 399 mm to 326 mm for rcp 2 6 but increased to 424 mm and 443 mm for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively luo et al 2010 reported that evapotranspiration increased with increasing seasonal water input which included rainfall and irrigation their finding was also in agreement with the conclusion of this paper compared to tp for rcp 8 5 the higher temperature and lager precipitation induced larger tp in the 2030s for rcp 4 5 however after the 2030s with significant increases in temperature and precipitation for rcp 8 5 the tp for rcp 8 5 was larger than it was for rcp 4 5 in addition the largest status year tp occurred in the normal season but it occurred in the dry season for the three emission scenarios because of the considerable increases of precipitation in the dry season increasing water input caused changes in soil water status over the soil profile and hence affected crop evapotranspiration luo et al 2010 according to tp in the sowing stage winter wheat emerged at the beginning of december for rcp 2 6 while it emerged in mid or late november in the status year for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the winter wheat emerged at the beginning of november therefore the winter wheat growth period may be delayed for rcp 2 6 due to the decrease in temperature but advanced for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 because of increasing temperature a similar result was reported by li 2009 showing that the phenophases of winter wheat had an obvious advancing trend with increasing temperature he reported that temperature was the main factor that determined the variation of winter wheat phenophases in the huaibei plain additionally the winter wheat emerged earliest in the dry season in the status year but it emerged earliest in the wet season by the 2090s these results corresponded with the result that the groundwater contribution in the sowing stage was largest in the dry season in the status year and it was largest in the wet season in the next 90 years 3 4 effect of climate change on the contribution of groundwater to transpiration in shallow groundwater regions groundwater can contribute to plant transpiration via root water uptake fig 12 is the ratio of groundwater contribution to tp in the status year the ratio of the groundwater contribution to tp was largest in the normal season at 97 and least in the wet season at 63 it demonstrated that the winter wheat can extract a considerable amount of water from groundwater in the study area in the next 90 years the proportion had an upward trend in the dry season and the largest ratios for the three emission scenarios were in the dry season furthermore the contribution of groundwater and the transpiration increased in the dry season for the three rcps as well which was discussed above this indicated that transpiration increased slower than did the contribution of groundwater in these three emission scenarios as a result precipitation appeared to have had a more significant impact than did tp on groundwater contribution during the winter wheat growth season the average ratio of groundwater contribution to tp over the next 90 years for three rcps is presented in fig 12b the proportion for rcp 2 6 increased in the wet normal and dry seasons by 16 0 10 8 and 45 6 respectively for the other two emission scenarios it increased only in the dry season by 13 2 and decreased in the other two hydrological seasons compared to the status year moreover the ratio for rcp 8 5 was reduced in the wet and normal seasons by 12 9 and 26 9 respectively the increased ratio for rcp 2 6 and declined ratio for the other two emission scenarios could be attributed to the decreased precipitation in rcp 2 6 and the increased precipitation in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 chen et al 2016 indicated that the contribution of groundwater to evapotranspiration was related to water input and there was an inversely proportional relationship between the ratio of contribution of groundwater to evapotranspiration and rainfall luo and sophocleous 2010 had the same conclusion that the ratio of water table contribution to evapotranspiration decreased with increasing water input although the ratio of the groundwater contribution to tp for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 reduced compared to the status year groundwater could contribute more than 50 to winter wheat transpiration through root water uptake for rcp 2 6 the ratio of the groundwater contribution to tp in the normal and dry seasons was even more than 100 indicating that for the future three emission scenarios the upward flow from groundwater could be the main resource for crop water consumption in the huaibei plain as a result the groundwater contribution is an important component of the water cycle in soil plant atmosphere interface and it cannot be ignored when calculating irrigation water requirements 3 4 1 effect of climate change on the groundwater contribution to crop water requirements fig 13 shows the ratio of groundwater contributions to crop water requirements during each growth stage in three hydrological conditions for three rcps crop water requirements for winter wheat were derived from field measurements water resources research institute of anhui province and huai river conservancy 2010 the ratio of the groundwater contribution to crop water requirements during each growth period was similar for different emission scenarios in the next 90 years but they differed from the status year especially during the wet season the ratio maps of each growth stage in the three hydrological growth seasons for the three rcps had the same hook like shape from the sowing stage to the jointing stage the contribution of groundwater to the crop water requirements gradually decreased and it began to rise after the jointing stage therefore the ratio of groundwater contribution to crop water requirements was lowest at the jointing stage with 2 5 9 0 12 2 20 4 and 20 1 23 3 in the wet normal and dry seasons respectively for the three rcps the ratio was lowest at the jointing stage because of the highest water requirement of winter wheat the groundwater contribution to root zones was only a small part of the crop water requirements at the jointing stage therefore if there is little precipitation during the jointing stage in future years irrigation should be considered in addition the ratio of the groundwater contribution to the crop water requirements was largest for rcp 2 6 and lowest for rcp 8 5 compared to the status year the proportion of the groundwater contribution to crop water requirements increased only in the dry season to investigate the variation of irrigation after considering the groundwater contribution the net irrigation requirements which are equal to crop water requirements minus precipitation and groundwater contribution during each growth stage are shown in fig 13 in the wet season precipitation and groundwater contribution at the jointing stage could not meet the crop water requirement thus an additional irrigation was needed to support the high water demand at the jointing stage in the status year however the amount of irrigation needed decreased with climate change in future jointing stages irrigation could be reduced to zero at the jointing stage for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios as seen in fig 13 in the dry and normal seasons over the next 90 years the groundwater contribution is more than the crop water requirements before the recovering stage this indicated that the contribution of groundwater to root zones could fully meet the crop water requirements before the recovering stage as a result the groundwater contribution could substitute for irrigation which could be critical to the development of farmland irrigation systems in the study area after the recovering stage an additional irrigation was needed in the jointing and heading stages while it decreased for rcp 8 5 and was zero for rcp 4 5 compared with the status year in the normal season though the ratio of groundwater contribution to crop water requirement increased in the dry season the irrigation requirement increased significantly as well compared with the other two hydrological growth seasons furthermore in the jointing stage the future irrigation requirements for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were more than the status year but in the heading stage the future irrigation requirement decreased however it should be noted that for the rcp 2 6 scenario a small amount of irrigation was still needed in the maturity stage in general the total irrigation amounts during the winter wheat growth season reduced in all hydrological conditions for the future three rcps an earlier study by gao et al 2017 demonstrated that the contribution of groundwater could reduce irrigation water usage they found that due to an increased groundwater contribution the yield of maize only reduced by 15 with a 22 5 decline in irrigation the results are useful to aid the development of agricultural irrigation schemes in shallow groundwater regions the present study obtained the similar results showing that increasing groundwater contributions can lead to reduced irrigation inputs in the future three rcps 4 conclusions based on hadgem2 ao a gcm for very low medium and very high emission scenarios the calibrated and validated hydrus 1d software package was used to simulate groundwater contributions to winter wheat root zones during growth seasons 10 october 31 may over the next ninety years the impact of climate change on the groundwater contribution to the root zone was investigated 1 the largest groundwater contribution to the root zone for the three rcps occurred at a water table depth of 1 5 m except for the wet season for rcp 2 6 the largest deep drainage also occurred at a water table depth of 1 5 m in the normal and dry seasons in addition the extinction depth of groundwater contribution was 4 1 m and the extinction depth did not vary with climate change in the huaibei plain the groundwater contribution and deep drainage decreased as water table depths became deeper than 1 5 m 2 the groundwater contribution to a crop was largest for rcp 2 6 and the deep drainage was largest for rcp 8 5 climate change could alter the distribution of the groundwater contribution in each growth period of winter wheat especially in the wet season but the variations of the groundwater contribution distributions were nearly same for all three emission scenarios the dry season had the most homogeneous distribution of groundwater contribution in addition the exchanges of moisture between the soil water and the groundwater could be stronger in the future three rcps the phenophases of winter wheat for rcp 2 6 were delayed while they were advanced for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 3 although the ratio of groundwater contributions to crop water requirements was lowest at the jointing stage the groundwater contribution could fully meet the crop water requirements during this stage in the wet and normal seasons for rcp 4 5 in the dry season the irrigation requirement increased significantly compared to the other two hydrological growth seasons however in the heading stage of the dry season the future irrigation requirement decreased it should be noted that for the rcp 2 6 scenario a small amount of irrigation could still be needed in the maturity stage of the dry season in general the total irrigation amounts during the winter wheat growth season reduced in all hydrological conditions for the future three rcps to our knowledge this is the first investigation of the impact of climate change on the contribution of groundwater to the root zone of winter wheat our research considered seven scenarios of future water table depths applied a gcm to hydrus 1d and provided compelling evidence for determining future irrigation needs for winter wheat growth management decision making although our study investigates the bottom water flux of the winter wheat root zone with climate change it is not clear how much of the groundwater contributes to crop transpiration and how much is used for soil water evaporation partitioning of the groundwater contribution must be further clarified in future studies in addition climate change will also alter the winter wheat growth period and crop water requirements although the impact of climate change on crop growth period and water requirements is not considered in this study it should be considered in future investigations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

10514,winter wheat is the predominant crop in the huaibei plain of anhui province china the huaibei plain has a transitional climate and a shallow water table as global warming accelerates climate change in the area may impact agricultural production in shallow groundwater regions capillary rise can be large and it can act as an important water resource for crop use however it is not clear how climate change will impact groundwater depths and crops based on local weather data from 1960 to 2010 a general circulation model hadgem2 ao which performed best in simulating precipitation in the study area and three representative concentration pathways rcps rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the validated numerical model hydrus 1d was used to estimate the daily groundwater contribution to the crop root zone in 2011 2100 of different hydrological growing seasons the largest groundwater contribution and deep drainage occurred at a water table depth of 1 5 m the groundwater contribution to crop root zones was largest for rcp 2 6 and the deep drainage was largest for rcp 8 5 the results indicated that climate change could alter the distribution of the groundwater contribution in each growing period meanwhile the phenophases of winter wheat for rcp 2 6 were delayed while they were advanced for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 in wet and normal seasons there was no need for irrigation for rcp 4 5 during the whole growing season however in a dry season a small amount of irrigation was still needed during the maturity stage for rcp 2 6 in general the total irrigation amounts needed for winter wheat growth were reduced for all hydrological conditions with the three rcps keywords winter wheat groundwater contribution climate change transpiration crop water requirement hydrus 1d 1 introduction the current climate change period is brought about in part by human activities according to the fifth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2013 climate change is accelerating it is reported that global surface mean temperature rose 0 85 during the period 1880 2012 for representative concentration pathways rcp rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 the mean surface temperatures are estimated to increase by 1 0 1 8 2 2 and 3 7 respectively in the late twenty first century precipitation amounts have increased over the mid latitude land areas of the northern hemisphere since 1901 and extreme precipitation events are estimated to become more intense and frequent in many regions ipcc 2013 climate change and increasing temperature affect water resources and crop ecological systems via precipitation evapotranspiration soil moisture and groundwater chiew et al 1995 elmeddahi et al 2014 helfer et al 2012 li and fang 2017 shahvari et al 2019 woldeamlak et al 2007 a warming climate can accelerate evapotranspiration lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 change the hydrologic cycle bala et al 2010 and increase lake drying klein et al 2014 renewable surface water and groundwater resources will decrease ipcc 2013 thus it is important to estimate future climate impacts on water resources help plan for changes in water availability and to palliate foreseeable damages irrigated agriculture accounts for approximately 70 of the world s freshwater withdrawals ayars and schoneman 2006 with renewable water resources becoming scarcer as temperatures increase it is urgent to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce agricultural water usage in china 70 of the food is produced on irrigated land gao et al 2017 additionally rapid development of urbanization and industrialization will increasingly use more water and the decreasing water resources will force agriculture to reduce its water usage yan et al 2015 therefore improving irrigation efficiency and reducing agricultural water use in china under climate change is an important priority wang et al 2014b possible solutions include developing more efficient irrigation methods such as drip thompson et al 2009 and improving irrigation management to maximize the use of shallow groundwater by crops gao et al 2017 in shallow groundwater regions capillary rise occurs and at times contributes significantly to crop water requirements this indicates that developing and managing the use of shallow groundwater can reduce or even completely eliminate irrigation requirements without compromising on crop yields gao et al 2017 as a critical resource for crop water consumption the groundwater contribution to agriculture water consumption has attracted widespread attention white 1932 provided an early description on how groundwater contributes to crop roots grismer and gates 1988 presented a nomograph describing the groundwater contribution to et of cotton yang and hong 1999 reported that 16 of the transpiration of maize was derived from a water table with a depth between 0 7 and 1 3 m analogously babajimopoulos et al 2007 found that the contribution of groundwater to maize was 18 when the water table depth was 0 58 m furthermore kahlown et al 2005 investigated the effect of shallow groundwater on crop water requirements for six crops a water table depth of 1 5 2 0 m was considered to be the optimum depth for all of the studied crops these results indicated that shallow groundwater had a potential to be a supplementary water resource for crop water requirements developing a better understanding of crop water uptake from groundwater is needed to support the optimum design of irrigation systems numerical simulation is an efficient method to investigate upward soil water fluxes liu et al 2006 used the water balance simulation model isareg to estimate the groundwater contribution to the crop root zone soylu et al 2014 integrated hydrus 1d into the agro ibis agroecosystem model to estimate the influence of shallow groundwater on crop growth similarly han et al 2015 used a numerical model which coupled hydrus 1d with a simplified crop growth model from swat to evaluate the effect of groundwater on cotton root zone water balance shouse et al 2011 and satchithanantham et al 2014 used the hydrus 1d water flow model to simulate soil water contents and upward water fluxes from groundwater they verified that the model simulation results closely matched the measurements although the contribution of groundwater to crop water use is relatively well studied it is not clear how groundwater contributions will be affected by climate change the huaibei plain of anhui province is an important irrigated grain production area in china which experiences times of water shortage and times of waterlogging due to precipitation heterogeneity wang and xu 2012 therefore using surface water and shallow groundwater for irrigation is common in the huaibei plain water resources research institute of anhui province and huai river conservancy 2010 some effects of climate change on huaibei plain water resources have been studied zuo et al 2012 reported that surface water resources decrease with decreasing rainfall and increasing air temperature shi et al 2013 found that recent climate change has increased the surface water and stream flow but decreased actual evapotranspiration surface water has been studied but less is known about the impact of climate change on groundwater in the huaibei plain groundwater is a significant component of the water balance and should be viewed as an important source of water for crop evapotranspiration zhu et al 2018 supplementary irrigation is only required when effective precipitation and the contribution of groundwater do not meet the crop water requirements in order to protect river water and groundwater from chemical pollution as a result of excessive irrigation yet at the same time to meet the crop water needs irrigation water amounts must be estimated accurately therefore estimating the contribution of groundwater to crops is important for determining irrigation volumes and discharge volumes for crop growth management decision making winter wheat is the major crop in the huaibei plain during the winter wheat growing season which is a rainless season the contribution of groundwater to the crop represents an important water source for growth in this study the validated numerical model hydrus 1d ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2008 was used to estimate the daily contribution of groundwater to winter wheat root zone in 2011 2100 for the scenarios described by hadgem2 ao the main objectives of this research were 1 to determine the evapotranspiration and the water table depth in 2011 2100 for low medium and high rcp scenarios with hadgem2 ao a general circulation model gcm 2 to model the shallow groundwater contribution to winter wheat for 2011 2100 for rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 and 3 to investigate the impact of climate change on the contribution of groundwater to the crop root zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the huaibei plain is situated in northern anhui province china covering the area between 32 25 to 34 35 n and 114 55 to 118 10 e with a total area of 37 420 km2 its primary soils are lime concretion black soil and fluvo aquic soil which account for 54 and 33 respectively of the huaibei plain land area the study area belongs to a transitional zone of northern subtropical and warm temperate climates table 1 presents the annual average hydrological and crop growth data of the huaibei plain the annual precipitation of the huaibei plain decreases from southeast to northwest 1100 750 mm wang et al 2010 and the water table depth increases from southeast to northwest 1 5 3 5 m wang and bo 2014a 2014b the wudaogou experimentation research station wers of hohai university of xinmaqiao township guzhen county anhui province is located at 33 9 n 117 21 e fig 1 the mean annual precipitation is 890 mm with 60 or more of the precipitation occurring in june to september the average evaporation demand is 1000 mm the mean annual temperature is 14 and the mean annual relative humidity is 70 the annual range in depth of water table is 0 71 4 19 m and the annual average water table depth is 2 0 m groundwater is mainly recharged by vertical seepage of atmospheric water and discharged mainly by evapotranspiration and artificial abstraction huaibei plain is the winter wheat production area notably wers is located in a winter wheat breeding field with representative phenophases of winter wheat zhang et al 2014 the hydrological and crop growth conditions of wers represent the average conditions of the huaibei plain consequently wers is selected as a typical representative station of the huaibei plain to investigate the effect of climate change on the groundwater contribution 2 2 data 2 2 1 meteorological data the meteorological data required by hydrus 1d are daily precipitation mean temperature maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity and wind speed during the winter wheat growth season meteorological data are monitored at wers the precipitation and temperature of future years 2011 2100 for a very low forcing scenario rcp 2 6 a medium stabilization scenario rcp 4 5 and a very high baseline emission scenario rcp 8 5 are estimated by hadgem2 ao of cmip5 2 2 2 winter wheat growth parameters twenty years 1991 2011 of records show that the huaibei plain winter wheat mean planting date is october 10 with mean harvest date of may 31 water resources research institute of anhui province and huai river conservancy 2010 the crop growth stages and days after sowing das are shown in table 2 the crop height at maturity the maximum leaf area index lai during the growth period and the root distribution were used to describe winter wheat growth at its optimal state the crop height at maturity and the maximum lai during the growth period were determined by their relationships with yield using the data for 1991 2011 during 1991 2011 2009 had the largest winter wheat yield of 7559 kg ha 1 in 2009 the average plant height at maturity was 69 cm and the maximum lai was 7 0 water resources research institute of anhui province and huai river conservancy 2010 when calculating the daily groundwater contribution to the root zone for the different hydrologic seasons of both historical and future years it was assumed that all winter wheat plants were in their optimal state under the conditions of maximum lai set at 7 0 and plant height at maturity of 69 cm 2 2 3 depth of water table hu et al 2009 and gao 2010 reported that human activity effects the huaibei plain water table depth more than precipitation and evaporation depths of water table during winter wheat growth seasons from 1989 2009 are shown in fig 2 data came from wers the shallowest water table for last 21 years was 1 1 m in 1992 and 2000 and the deepest was 5 3 m of 2001 however it is projected that the groundwater is only available for the roots when the depth is less than 4 1 m water resources research institute of anhui province and huai river conservancy 2010 so we set the future water table depth to be between 1 1 m and 4 1 m the perennial average daily water table depth during the winter wheat growth season is shown in fig 3 and the average water table depth during the winter wheat growth period is 2 0 m according to the available water table data the average water table depths were set at 1 1 m 1 5 m 2 0 m 2 5 m 3 0 m 3 5 m and 4 1 m respectively in the future crop stages correspondingly daily water table depths during the winter wheat growth season under different average water table depth conditions were calculated by translating the perennial average daily water table depth according to the historical water table depth the probability of each average water table depth is shown in table 3 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 general circulation model the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 released more than 40 gcms ouyang 2016 compared the monthly average temperature and precipitation of 40 gcms and 14 meteorological stations in the huaibei plain the hadgem2 ao climate model performed best in simulating precipitation so hadgem2 ao was used to simulate the future climate conditions in the huaibei plain for three scenarios rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 the hadgem2 ao climate model was developed by the national institute of meteorological research of the korea and met office hadley centre using the hadley centre global environmental model version 2 coupled with atmosphere ocean configuration baek et al 2013 with a resolution of 1 25 1 875 2 3 2 downscaling method a quantile mapping qm method was derived from the empirical transformation of panofsky and brier 1965 it was successfully applied in hydrological applications ringard et al 2017 wood et al 2004 and error correction of gcms cannon et al 2015 piani et al 2010 the principle of qm is to construct empirical cumulative distribution functions ecdf with modeled and observed datasets in validation and calibration periods respectively and to correct the daily precipitation and temperature of gcm simulation mod the correction function transfers gcm output xval to the corrected evaluate yval according to 1 y t i v a l e c d f t i o b s c a l 1 e c d f t i m o d c a l x t i v a l where yval is the corrected daily mean temperature or precipitation in the validation period 2011 2040 denoted as 2030s 2041 2070 denoted as 2060s and 2071 2100 denoted as 2090s ecdf obs cal 1 indicates the inverse ecdf of observed data in the calibration period and thus a data quantile ecdf mod cal is the ecdf of modeled data in the calibration period and xval is the daily mean temperature or precipitation of the gcm outputs in the validation period 2 3 3 hydrological model hydrus 1d ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2008 was used to simulate soil water and upward water flux from the shallow groundwater this model simulates one dimensional flow and root water uptake processes the governing equation in the model is the richards equation with a sink term added to simulate the root water extraction ≈°im≈Ønek et al 2008 precipitation potential evapotranspiration etp lai rooting depth water table depth and soil hydraulic properties were the input data required to estimate the shallow groundwater contributions to crop roots precipitation and other weather data required to calculate etp were obtained from wers in this study the maximum lai was set at 7 0 the required hydraulic properties of the soil including residual water content Œ∏r saturated water content Œ∏s parameter Œ± and n in the soil water retention function saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and empirical tortuosity parameter l for five soil layers 0 20 cm 20 40 cm 40 80 cm and 80 600 cm were estimated in a previous study zhu et al 2018 the upper boundary was specified as an atmospheric boundary condition the potential evaporation ep and transpiration tp rates were specified on a daily basis under this boundary condition and the model calculated the actual evaporation and transpiration rates according to the simulated soil moisture conditions the lower boundary was specified as a time varying pressure head boundary condition the simulated soil profile was 600 cm based on a study of zhu et al 2018 a piecewise root density distribution function was used during the whole growth period the model used to estimate the contribution of groundwater to the root zone of winter wheat has been calibrated and validated in the huaibei plain by zhu et al 2018 the results indicated that the model performed well with root mean square errors rmse of 0 009 cm3 cm 3 and 0 04 mm d 1 in soil water content and evapotranspiration respectively details of the model calibration and validation can be found in zhu et al 2018 2 3 4 future reference crop evapotranspiration as mentioned above etp is an essential input for the simulations it was calculated as 2 e t p k c e t 0 where the kc is a crop efficiency coefficient determined by tang et al 2008 and et 0 is thereference crop evapotranspiration for the historical period et 0 was calculated by the fao penman monteith equation however it was somewhat difficult to calculate et 0 directly with the penman monteith equation for future scenarios because et 0 was closely related to temperature future et 0 was estimated on the basis of temperature the correlation between temperature and et 0 is shown in table 4 the most significant correlation was found between et 0 and maximum temperature tmax with a correlation coefficient of 0 923 monthly tmax and et 0 of 1960 2010 were used to determine the corresponding regression fig 4 two different sets of regression were carried out a linear regression from january to june with a coefficient of correlation of 0 946 fig 5 a and an exponential regression for the period of july to december with a coefficient of correlation of 0 956 fig 5b the regression results are shown in eq 3 these regressions were than used to determine the effect of climate change on the et 0 characteristics 3 e t 0 0 1606 x 0 0998 j a n u a r y t o j u n e 0 365 exp x 13 33 0 5026 j u l y t o d e c e m b e r 2 3 5 determination of hydrological growing seasons based on precipitation frequency analysis during winter wheat growing seasons in the years1980 2010 seasons in which precipitation exceeds 437 mm are considered as wet between 294 437 mm is average and below 294 mm is dry using the coefficient of variation cv and coefficient of skewness cs cv 0 29 cs cv 1 83 according to precipitation data from october to may of 1980 2010 the 1997 1998 2001 2002 and 1999 2000 2007 2008 and 1991 1992 and 2004 2005 seasons are selected as representations of wet normal and dry rainfall conditions respectively fig 6 similarly representative seasons of 2011 2100 are selected by the same method based on precipitation data from hadgem2 ao for three rcps as shown in table 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate change scenarios 3 1 1 future climate scenario simulations based on the simulations using the hadgem2 ao model seasonal precipitation and mean temperature during the winter wheat growth season 10 october 31 may from 1960 to 2100 for three rcps are shown in fig 7 clearly seasonal precipitation and mean temperature had increasing trends in the historical years 1960 2010 in addition to rcp 2 6 the seasonal precipitation and mean temperature for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 also continued to increase based on the historical values rcp 8 5 showed the fastest growth both in precipitation and temperature although the precipitation and temperature for rcp 4 5 was larger than rcp 8 5 in the 2030s the later precipitation and temperature for rcp 8 5 exceeded rcp 4 5 while the precipitation and temperature for rcp 2 6 was lower than the historical period they still had increasing trends in the next 90 years data presented in table 6 shows changes in seasonal tmax tmin minimum temperature and precipitation in the future for the three rcps the projected future tmax increases range from 2 16 to 2 74 for rcp 2 6 from 0 71 to 2 61 for rcp 4 5 and from 0 67 to 4 65 for rcp 8 5 for future tmin the projected increases range from 0 28 to 0 73 for rcp 2 6 from 0 96 to 2 57 for rcp 4 5 and from 0 65 to 4 28 for rcp 8 5 the changes of future tmax and tmin were roughly the same for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 however the changes of tmin were less than those of tmax for rcp 2 6 the future precipitation during the winter wheat growth season reduced by 4 15 for rcp 2 6 and increased by 52 69 and 48 87 for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively therefore the future temperature and precipitation increased the most for rcp 8 5 but decreased for rcp 2 6 compared to the historical values 3 1 2 comparison of simulated to measured climate scenarios to further validate the applicability of three emission scenarios derived by hadgem2 ao in the huaibei plain the simulated precipitation and temperature were compared with that observed at wers during the 2011 2018 winter wheat growth seasons two statistical metrics are selected to evaluate the applicability of three emission scenarios table 7 the correlation coefficient cc was used to describe the degree of linear correlation between the simulated and observed meteorological data and the relative bias rbias was selected to describe the bias of simulation and observation from the statistical indices for precipitation simulation rcp 2 6 remarkably presented the best performance among three emission scenarios in the huaibei plain with the highest cc of 0 56 and the best rbias of 11 47 although the rbias of rcp 2 6 was higher in temperature simulation among three rcps the simulated temperature of rcp 2 6 showed the strongest correlation with the observed temperature with a cc of 0 58 the poor performance of ribas is attributed to the underestimation of the maximum temperature during the winter wheat growth season on the whole in 2011 2018 the climate scenarios of rcp 2 6 were closest to the observations 3 2 effect of climate change on the contribution of groundwater to the root zone 3 2 1 changes of groundwater contributions for various water table depths for seven water table depths the modified hydrus 1d and the hadgem2 ao models were used to estimate the daily groundwater contribution to the root zone of winter wheat from 2011 2100 the simulated cumulative water flux at the bottom of the winter wheat root zone during future crop growth seasons are presented in fig 8 positive values indicate that water entered the root zone from the bottom interestingly a shallower water table depth did not always produce a greater contribution to the root zone which was different from the previous findings that the groundwater contribution decreased with increasing groundwater table depth yang et al 2011 wassar et al 2016 the largest contribution of groundwater to the root zone during the different future hydrological conditions occurred at a water table depth of 1 5 m except for the wet season for rcp 2 6 surprisingly the effective root depth was also 1 5 m liu and luo 2011 found a similar conclusion that the moisture condition in the root zone was appropriate for root development of winter wheat with a water table depth of 1 5 m according to nosetto et al 2009 if the water table is very shallow transpiration decreases due to waterlogging and root anoxia meanwhile if the water table is too shallow the soil water contents are large enough to meet the crop water requirement resulting in a decrease of groundwater contribution to the root zone thus compared to a water table depth of 1 5 m there was a smaller contribution of groundwater with a water table depth of 1 1 m the contributions to the root zone decreased significantly as the groundwater table became deeper than 1 5 m this could be attributed to the smaller upward water fluxes as the water sources moved further below the root zone and the water stress in the root zone decreased the actual evapotranspiration xue et al 2018 the contribution of groundwater to the root zone approached 0 when the water table depth was 4 1 m at which water table depth was defined as the extinction depth of groundwater contribution shah et al 2007 this finding was consistent with the conclusion that the deepest water table depth supplying water to winter wheat roots was 4 1 m water resources research institute of anhui province and huai river conservancy 2010 shah et al 2007 indicated that the extinction depth could vary due to the changes in seasonal and long term climatic conditions the extinction depth derived in this paper was 4 1 m in different emission scenarios and different hydrological growth seasons which did not vary with climate change the negative values in fig 8 imply that water drained from the bottom generally the deep drainage increased from the 2030s to 2090s due to increasing precipitation especially in the wet season this indicated that as precipitation increased deep drainage increased for a water table of 2 5 m deep drainage was almost zero in the normal season while it was large in the wet season the deep drainage did not always increase with decreasing water table depth in the normal season and the dry season for the three rcps the largest deep drainage was observed when the water table depth was 1 5 m as mentioned above the maximum groundwater contribution also occurred at the water table depth of 1 5 m as the water table depth became deeper than 1 5 m the deep drainage tended to decrease with increasing water table depth luo and sophocleous 2010 reported that deep drainage decreased as water table depth increased when the water table depth became deeper the groundwater contribution varied more significantly than did deep drainage this indicated that the deep drainage sensitivity to water table depth was less than the groundwater contribution sensitivity to water table depth 3 2 2 changes of groundwater contribution during winter wheat growth seasons based on the 1989 2009 probability of average water table depth data in the study area table 2 the contributions to the root zones and the drainages for seven water table depths were weighted averaged the future weighted average groundwater contributions and deep drainages during the crop growth season for different hydrological conditions for three emission scenarios are presented in fig 9 positive values indicate a contribution of groundwater to the root zone and negative values imply deep drainage for a status year the contribution of groundwater to a root zone was largest in the normal season at 412 mm and least in the wet season at 286 mm in three future periods the groundwater contribution dropped in the normal season increased in the dry season while there were fluctuations in the wet season compared with the status year the increase of the contribution of groundwater to crop growth in the dry season indicated that the irrigation water could be reduced in future dry seasons the deep drainage was also largest in the normal season and least in the dry season in the status year for future three rcps the deep drainage was largest in the wet season while the normal season was second and the dry season was the least except for the 2030s for rcp 2 6 consequently there was no direct complementary relationship between the groundwater contribution and the deep drainage as shown in fig 9 the groundwater contributions in three hydrological growth seasons were largest for rcp 2 6 the deep drainages were largest for rcp 8 5 and the precipitation was least for rcp 2 6 therefore it could be concluded that there was an inversely proportional relationship between groundwater contribution and precipitation and the deep drainage was proportionate to precipitation previous studies have reported similar results chen et al 2016 luo et al 2010 the noticeable decline in the precipitation resulted in a water table depth decline which is supposed to induce a contribution of groundwater decrease as well however a precipitation decline will also induce a soil moisture deficit for crop growth resulting in an increased contribution of groundwater to root zones to maintain the strong crop water requirement for rcp 2 6 the wet and normal season groundwater contributions decreased in the 2030s due to the decrease of evapotranspiration which was caused by decreasing temperature then in the 2060s to 2090s the upward flux of groundwater to root zones was strengthened with increasing temperature however in the dry season the contribution of groundwater increased in the 2030s due to the decline in precipitation and it decreased in the 2060s to 2090s as the precipitation increased therefore the groundwater contribution in the dry season was mainly affected by precipitation while it was mainly affected by temperature in the normal and wet seasons for rcp2 6 for rcp 4 5 the groundwater contributions rose in the 2030s in the wet and dry seasons mainly due to the increased temperature and evapotranspiration and then dropped in the 2060s and 2090s due to the increased precipitation for rcp 8 5 the contribution of groundwater to the root zone increased in the dry season due to the increase of evapotranspiration and in the normal and wet season it reduced in the 2030s as precipitation increased then it increased in the 2060s with an increase of temperature and finally dropped in the 2090s due to heavier precipitation consequently the contributions of groundwater to the root zone in three hydrological growth seasons were affected by the interaction of temperature and precipitation for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 as seen in fig 9 the deep drainage in the three hydrological growth seasons increased for the three rcps especially for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 in the wet season the deep drainage was even larger than the groundwater contribution to the root zone this indicated that the exchanges of moisture between the soil water and the groundwater could be stronger in future three rcps 3 2 3 changes in groundwater contribution in each growth period of winter wheat fig 10 shows the logarithm of the contribution of groundwater to the root zone of winter wheat during each growth period for three emission scenarios the distributions of the wet season groundwater contribution in growth periods for the future three rcps were significantly different from that in the status year while the distributions were nearly same in the dry season this indicated that climate change could alter the distribution of the groundwater contribution to the root zone of winter wheat in each growth period at the wet season but the variations of the groundwater contribution distributions were similar for the three emission scenarios in the wet and dry seasons the groundwater contribution increased in the sowing and jointing stages notably the increase was more significant in the wet season the increase of the groundwater contribution in the jointing stage was due to high water requirements of winter wheat and increased evapotranspiration caused by increased temperature luo et al 2010 as mentioned the contribution of groundwater dropped in the normal season for the three rcps this decline mainly occurred in the heading and maturity stages in addition according to fig 10 the difference in groundwater contribution in each growth stage was the smallest in the dry season between 32 100 mm which indicated that the dry season had the most homogeneous distribution of groundwater contribution 3 3 effect of climate change on potential transpiration to investigate the effect of climate change on tp this study estimated the cumulative tp of winter wheat during the whole growing season for three rcps in different hydrological growth seasons fig 11 compared to the status year tp during the crop growth period reduced with average values from 399 mm to 326 mm for rcp 2 6 but increased to 424 mm and 443 mm for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively luo et al 2010 reported that evapotranspiration increased with increasing seasonal water input which included rainfall and irrigation their finding was also in agreement with the conclusion of this paper compared to tp for rcp 8 5 the higher temperature and lager precipitation induced larger tp in the 2030s for rcp 4 5 however after the 2030s with significant increases in temperature and precipitation for rcp 8 5 the tp for rcp 8 5 was larger than it was for rcp 4 5 in addition the largest status year tp occurred in the normal season but it occurred in the dry season for the three emission scenarios because of the considerable increases of precipitation in the dry season increasing water input caused changes in soil water status over the soil profile and hence affected crop evapotranspiration luo et al 2010 according to tp in the sowing stage winter wheat emerged at the beginning of december for rcp 2 6 while it emerged in mid or late november in the status year for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the winter wheat emerged at the beginning of november therefore the winter wheat growth period may be delayed for rcp 2 6 due to the decrease in temperature but advanced for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 because of increasing temperature a similar result was reported by li 2009 showing that the phenophases of winter wheat had an obvious advancing trend with increasing temperature he reported that temperature was the main factor that determined the variation of winter wheat phenophases in the huaibei plain additionally the winter wheat emerged earliest in the dry season in the status year but it emerged earliest in the wet season by the 2090s these results corresponded with the result that the groundwater contribution in the sowing stage was largest in the dry season in the status year and it was largest in the wet season in the next 90 years 3 4 effect of climate change on the contribution of groundwater to transpiration in shallow groundwater regions groundwater can contribute to plant transpiration via root water uptake fig 12 is the ratio of groundwater contribution to tp in the status year the ratio of the groundwater contribution to tp was largest in the normal season at 97 and least in the wet season at 63 it demonstrated that the winter wheat can extract a considerable amount of water from groundwater in the study area in the next 90 years the proportion had an upward trend in the dry season and the largest ratios for the three emission scenarios were in the dry season furthermore the contribution of groundwater and the transpiration increased in the dry season for the three rcps as well which was discussed above this indicated that transpiration increased slower than did the contribution of groundwater in these three emission scenarios as a result precipitation appeared to have had a more significant impact than did tp on groundwater contribution during the winter wheat growth season the average ratio of groundwater contribution to tp over the next 90 years for three rcps is presented in fig 12b the proportion for rcp 2 6 increased in the wet normal and dry seasons by 16 0 10 8 and 45 6 respectively for the other two emission scenarios it increased only in the dry season by 13 2 and decreased in the other two hydrological seasons compared to the status year moreover the ratio for rcp 8 5 was reduced in the wet and normal seasons by 12 9 and 26 9 respectively the increased ratio for rcp 2 6 and declined ratio for the other two emission scenarios could be attributed to the decreased precipitation in rcp 2 6 and the increased precipitation in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 chen et al 2016 indicated that the contribution of groundwater to evapotranspiration was related to water input and there was an inversely proportional relationship between the ratio of contribution of groundwater to evapotranspiration and rainfall luo and sophocleous 2010 had the same conclusion that the ratio of water table contribution to evapotranspiration decreased with increasing water input although the ratio of the groundwater contribution to tp for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 reduced compared to the status year groundwater could contribute more than 50 to winter wheat transpiration through root water uptake for rcp 2 6 the ratio of the groundwater contribution to tp in the normal and dry seasons was even more than 100 indicating that for the future three emission scenarios the upward flow from groundwater could be the main resource for crop water consumption in the huaibei plain as a result the groundwater contribution is an important component of the water cycle in soil plant atmosphere interface and it cannot be ignored when calculating irrigation water requirements 3 4 1 effect of climate change on the groundwater contribution to crop water requirements fig 13 shows the ratio of groundwater contributions to crop water requirements during each growth stage in three hydrological conditions for three rcps crop water requirements for winter wheat were derived from field measurements water resources research institute of anhui province and huai river conservancy 2010 the ratio of the groundwater contribution to crop water requirements during each growth period was similar for different emission scenarios in the next 90 years but they differed from the status year especially during the wet season the ratio maps of each growth stage in the three hydrological growth seasons for the three rcps had the same hook like shape from the sowing stage to the jointing stage the contribution of groundwater to the crop water requirements gradually decreased and it began to rise after the jointing stage therefore the ratio of groundwater contribution to crop water requirements was lowest at the jointing stage with 2 5 9 0 12 2 20 4 and 20 1 23 3 in the wet normal and dry seasons respectively for the three rcps the ratio was lowest at the jointing stage because of the highest water requirement of winter wheat the groundwater contribution to root zones was only a small part of the crop water requirements at the jointing stage therefore if there is little precipitation during the jointing stage in future years irrigation should be considered in addition the ratio of the groundwater contribution to the crop water requirements was largest for rcp 2 6 and lowest for rcp 8 5 compared to the status year the proportion of the groundwater contribution to crop water requirements increased only in the dry season to investigate the variation of irrigation after considering the groundwater contribution the net irrigation requirements which are equal to crop water requirements minus precipitation and groundwater contribution during each growth stage are shown in fig 13 in the wet season precipitation and groundwater contribution at the jointing stage could not meet the crop water requirement thus an additional irrigation was needed to support the high water demand at the jointing stage in the status year however the amount of irrigation needed decreased with climate change in future jointing stages irrigation could be reduced to zero at the jointing stage for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios as seen in fig 13 in the dry and normal seasons over the next 90 years the groundwater contribution is more than the crop water requirements before the recovering stage this indicated that the contribution of groundwater to root zones could fully meet the crop water requirements before the recovering stage as a result the groundwater contribution could substitute for irrigation which could be critical to the development of farmland irrigation systems in the study area after the recovering stage an additional irrigation was needed in the jointing and heading stages while it decreased for rcp 8 5 and was zero for rcp 4 5 compared with the status year in the normal season though the ratio of groundwater contribution to crop water requirement increased in the dry season the irrigation requirement increased significantly as well compared with the other two hydrological growth seasons furthermore in the jointing stage the future irrigation requirements for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were more than the status year but in the heading stage the future irrigation requirement decreased however it should be noted that for the rcp 2 6 scenario a small amount of irrigation was still needed in the maturity stage in general the total irrigation amounts during the winter wheat growth season reduced in all hydrological conditions for the future three rcps an earlier study by gao et al 2017 demonstrated that the contribution of groundwater could reduce irrigation water usage they found that due to an increased groundwater contribution the yield of maize only reduced by 15 with a 22 5 decline in irrigation the results are useful to aid the development of agricultural irrigation schemes in shallow groundwater regions the present study obtained the similar results showing that increasing groundwater contributions can lead to reduced irrigation inputs in the future three rcps 4 conclusions based on hadgem2 ao a gcm for very low medium and very high emission scenarios the calibrated and validated hydrus 1d software package was used to simulate groundwater contributions to winter wheat root zones during growth seasons 10 october 31 may over the next ninety years the impact of climate change on the groundwater contribution to the root zone was investigated 1 the largest groundwater contribution to the root zone for the three rcps occurred at a water table depth of 1 5 m except for the wet season for rcp 2 6 the largest deep drainage also occurred at a water table depth of 1 5 m in the normal and dry seasons in addition the extinction depth of groundwater contribution was 4 1 m and the extinction depth did not vary with climate change in the huaibei plain the groundwater contribution and deep drainage decreased as water table depths became deeper than 1 5 m 2 the groundwater contribution to a crop was largest for rcp 2 6 and the deep drainage was largest for rcp 8 5 climate change could alter the distribution of the groundwater contribution in each growth period of winter wheat especially in the wet season but the variations of the groundwater contribution distributions were nearly same for all three emission scenarios the dry season had the most homogeneous distribution of groundwater contribution in addition the exchanges of moisture between the soil water and the groundwater could be stronger in the future three rcps the phenophases of winter wheat for rcp 2 6 were delayed while they were advanced for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 3 although the ratio of groundwater contributions to crop water requirements was lowest at the jointing stage the groundwater contribution could fully meet the crop water requirements during this stage in the wet and normal seasons for rcp 4 5 in the dry season the irrigation requirement increased significantly compared to the other two hydrological growth seasons however in the heading stage of the dry season the future irrigation requirement decreased it should be noted that for the rcp 2 6 scenario a small amount of irrigation could still be needed in the maturity stage of the dry season in general the total irrigation amounts during the winter wheat growth season reduced in all hydrological conditions for the future three rcps to our knowledge this is the first investigation of the impact of climate change on the contribution of groundwater to the root zone of winter wheat our research considered seven scenarios of future water table depths applied a gcm to hydrus 1d and provided compelling evidence for determining future irrigation needs for winter wheat growth management decision making although our study investigates the bottom water flux of the winter wheat root zone with climate change it is not clear how much of the groundwater contributes to crop transpiration and how much is used for soil water evaporation partitioning of the groundwater contribution must be further clarified in future studies in addition climate change will also alter the winter wheat growth period and crop water requirements although the impact of climate change on crop growth period and water requirements is not considered in this study it should be considered in future investigations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
