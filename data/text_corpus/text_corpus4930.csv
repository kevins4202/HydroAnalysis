24650,ecosystem based modeling is rapidly becoming an established technique to investigate the health and stability of ecosystems in the gulf of mexico ecosystem models are applied to neritic systems but less focus has been placed on the oceanic domain since 2011 severe declines have been observed in many micronekton groups that occupy the mesopelagic zone 200 1000 m depth here we present an ecosystem model for the oceanic northern gulf of mexico for the year 2011 simulate that model according to micronekton trends through 2018 and quantify the top down and bottom up impacts that each functional group has on one another these trends were examined to determine whether interactions between the two groups have changed directionally over time in 2011 zooplankton trophic level 2 occupied greater than one third of the total metazoan biomass and also 40 of the total energy throughput ascended to higher trophic levels in the system of the 1849 possible functional group interactions most of which are indirect approximately 27 showed significant changes between 2011 and 2018 which were related to shifts in biomass and diet throughout the simulation direct top down interactions changed more frequently than other types of trophic relationships the frequency of direct changes that occurred in the simulation was not observed evenly among all functional groups as opposed to indirect interactions these changes between functional group interactions can be used to further examine potential shifts in the trophic structure of marine ecosystems under various forcing

system s stability and resiliency towards future disturbances costanza and magaeu 1999 in order to examine the health and stability of an ecosystem a multi species modeling approach is useful to track the interactions of many species within the same model ecosystem modeling is a tool that combines information regarding all known biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem with the goal of quantifying ecosystem services and food web topology levin et al 2008 in ecosystem models both direct trophic connection exists and indirect interactions no trophic interaction between species can be investigated monaco and ulanowicz 1997 however ecosystem models require many input values and simulations involve the changing of many parameters this increases the uncertainty of an ecosystem model when compared to a single species model due to a lack of sufficient data there are few ecosystem models for the oceanic realm seaward of the 200 m isobath when compared to neritic zones webb et al 2010 a lack of ecosystem models hinders our ability to predict shifts in the trophic structure of oceanic ecosystems over time the trophic structure of an ecosystem is often classified as a series of top down and bottom up interactions among species and is associated with predator and prey abundances within the system verity and smetacek 2002 fluctuations in the population size of a predator species may have an impact on the population size of a prey species but this effect is not equal across all prey of a single predator species worm and myers 2003 ulanowicz and puccia 1990 developed the mixed trophic impact measurement mti a metric to determine the effect an infinitesimal increase in the population size of one functional group would have on each other functional group within an ecosystem this index ranges from 1 to 1 where large negative values indicate top down feedback and large positive values indicate bottom up feedback mti has been used extensively in ecosystem models to recognize keystone species libralato et al 2006 important trophic connections sagarese et al 2017 and the importance of fishing pressure towards the future status of a fishery walters et al 1997 given that the mti is a measure of the relative effect of one functional group on another within the ecosystem changes in mtis among multiple pairs of functional groups over time indicate changes to the system s trophic structure when simulating an ecosystem across time it may be valuable to model a series of individual time steps as static ecosystems and analyze this positioning as a time series this method is usually developed for ecosystem level indicators such as biomass coll and steenbeek 2017 yield coll et al 2008 and trophic level shannon et al 2014 calculating mti at each time step in the simulation may reveal potential trends in the top down bottom up impacts one species exerts on another relative to other species within the model akin to other low latitude systems large finfishes e g tunas billfishes and sharks are the predominant apex predators in the epipelagic 0 200 m depth gulf of mexico gom hereafter while marine mammals exist in lower abundances many of these upper trophic level predators make routine dives into mesopelagic depths to prey upon micronekton assemblages watwood et al 2006 wilson and block 2009 many mesopelagic organisms particularly those in the deep scattering layer ascend into the epipelagic zone during nighttime to prey upon zooplankton or other mesopelagic migrators and descend back into mesopelagic depths during the daytime to avoid predators frost and mccrone 1978 deeper dwelling pelagic predators e g swordfishes make a diel vertical migration into the epipelagic zone during the night as well presumably following micronekton prey lerner et al 2013 however the micronekton assemblage is diverse and predators are likely not confined to a single prey source instead upper trophic level predators in the upper ocean are likely opportunistically feeding on the entire assemblage suggesting the ecosystem may be resilient to severe declines in a singular functional group ménard et al 2006 micronekton feed on diverse zooplankton and micronekton assemblages in a manner that may be taxon or size class specific to partition resources among species hopkins and sutton 1998 overall the food web of the oceanic gom is complex with depth layers connected by vertical migrations changes in the population size of functional groups within the ecosystem may alter the trophic structure of the system recently a large emphasis has been placed on ecosystem based management in the northern gom grüss et al 2016 this emphasis can be attributed to the large amounts of data collected since the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill and an increase in data sharing capabilities through online data repositories such as griidc www data gulfresearchintiative org these models have focal points that address ecosystem restoration de mutsert et al 2012 harmful algal blooms perryman et al 2020 hypoxia de mutsert et al 2016 fishery policy decisions chagaris et al 2015 and trophic interactions geers et al 2016 ecosystem models constructed in the gom have primarily focused on the coastal realm with just a few exceptions expanding into the open ocean vidal and pauly 2004 ainsworth et al 2015 rigorous data collection of non commercial species in the open ocean since 2011 has filled data gaps providing data necessary to develop an ecosystem model for this domain sutton et al 2020 a model devoted to the offshore gom would highlight the importance of micronekton as prey resources and predators of other organisms in the ecosystem as is apparent in other oceanic systems griffiths et al 2013 choy et al 2016 in this study we present the first ecosystem model in the northern gom devoted to the offshore waters seaward of the 1000 m isobath the model is simulated from 2011 to 2018 using observed trends in mesopelagic micronekton as the driver of the simulation we explore the uncertainty in input parameters and use this potential error to provide confidence intervals towards model output results the trophic structure of the ecosystem is characterized in the context of relative top down and bottom up relationships among species we estimate how these trophic interactions have changed from 2011 to 2018 finally we discuss these changes in the context of ecosystem health and stability 2 methods 2 1 model structure the modeled area encompasses the gom portion of the u s exclusive economic zone seaward of the 1000 m isobath approximately 350 000 km2 zeller and pauly 2015 fig 1 the vertical domain of the model region is from the surface to 1000 m depth the functional groups in the ecosystem model included all species that occupy the ecosystem at any time throughout the year nine species yellowfin tuna thunnus albacares blue marlin makaira nigricans bigeye tuna thunnus obesus white marlin kajikia albidus swordfish xiphias gladius sailfish istiophorus albicans bluefin tuna thunnus thynnus albacore tuna thunnus alalunga and skipjack tuna katsuwonus pelamis were each divided into two stage multi stanza groups juvenile and adult to account for ontogenetic changes in diet and fishing selectivity larval conspecifics were included in the juvenile life stage as tuna and billfish larval stages are much shorter than one year and growth rates are rapid fromentin and powers 2005 sponaugle et al 2010 the age of each multi stanza division was determined by the age at maturity referenced in stock assessments roundscale spearfish tetrapturus georgii is included with white marlin because of difficulties in distinguishing between the two species by fishers shivji et al 2006 mesopelagic fishes included the four biomass dominant fish families in the gom myctophidae sternoptychidae gonostomatidae and stomiidae mesopelagic fishes from other families were aggregated based on the known hopkins et al 1996 or assumed trophic positions juvenile neritic fishes that either migrate or are advected offshore by currents were included in the epipelagic forage feeder group as this would be their ecological role aggregate groups of invertebrates and primary producers were necessary to complete the food web the resulting model consists of 42 functional groups including three marine mammal groups sea turtles seabirds 29 fish groups 10 of which are larval or juvenile six invertebrate groups one primary producer and one detritus group additionally one fishery is included in the model 2 2 ecopath with ecosim ecopath with ecosim ewe is a mass balanced ecosystem software that assumes the ecosystem is in equilibrium ewe was initially developed as a method to provide information about the standing stock of functional groups and the flow of energy throughout an ecosystem polovina 1984 since its initial release ewe has undergone extensive development with the inclusion of additional plug in procedures steenbeek et al 2016 but the original framework still exists in the current software two master equations control the mass balance assumption within ecopath one describes production and the second describes energy balance sensu christensen et al 2008 four ecopath parameters are necessary for each group biomass b production biomass p b consumption biomass q b and ecotrophic efficiency ee table 1 ecotrophic efficiency is defined as the proportion of production that is used within the system and is best calculated as an estimated parameter when all other information is known a biomass accumulation ba parameter can be included to reflect population trends leading into the initial model year and can increase the reliability of model results in data limited ecosystems natugonza et al 2020 ecopath once required the assumption of a steady state polovina 1984 but advancements have reduced this assumption so that each functional group must achieve mass balance throughout each time step in the model and can otherwise be dynamic an additional input parameter is the diet composition i e the proportion of annual diet by biomass of each predator group on each prey group in the model the diet of each functional group must be entered and cannot be estimated including cohorts of multi stanza groups in this model diet information is provided from bibliographic sources supplementary material a walters et al 1997 developed ecosim a temporal dynamic model that uses input parameters from a balanced ecopath model and estimates changes in an ecosystem over time the dynamics of an ecosim model are expressed through two differential equations one that estimates changes in biomass over time and another that estimates changes in consumption rates at each time step sensu christensen et al 2008 during an ecosim simulation additional parameters monitor the change in a predator s ability to find and consume prey the changes in consumption rates are derived from the foraging arena concept walters and juanes 1993 where prey groups can shift between vulnerable available to the predator and invulnerable unavailable to the predator states a high vulnerability parameter signifies top down control while a low vulnerability parameter is indicative of bottom up forcing vulnerability parameters were estimated for each functional group using an iterative fitting procedure christensen et al 2008 this procedure tests different vulnerability values for each species and searches for the values that provide the best statistical fit towards a reference time series heymans et al 2016 the vulnerability of larval and juvenile fishes was set at 1 bottom up forcing which significantly improved model performance towards expected adult tuna and billfish trends 2 3 parameterization information regarding specific sources used to parameterize the model are in supplementary material b biomass b metric tons km 2 values derive from single species stock assessments or from fisheries independent survey data the finfish stock assessment species that occupy the oceanic gom have a wider distribution than the model domain the adult biomass for each multi stanza group was determined as the quotient of nominal catch in the gom and fishing mortality that occurs in the model domain b c f fishing mortality in the model domain was calculated as the product of the proportion of catches in the gom relative to the entire stock and the fishing mortality of the entire stock the data originate from the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas iccat www iccat int en this calculation forces the assumption that standardized catches throughout a stock are a suitable proxy for the distribution of the stock and was chosen in favor of assuming the stock is distributed uniformly across the stock area marine mammal and micronekton functional group biomasses were calculated as the product of the standardized abundance n individuals km 2 and mean weight of an organism from either literature values trites and pauly 1998 nmfs 2019 or survey data the production biomass ratio p b year 1 or total mortality z year 1 is calculated as the sum of natural mortality and fishing mortality from stock assessments or through empirical relationships pauly 1980 eq 1 1 m k 0 65 l 0 279 t c 0 463 where m is natural mortality year 1 k is the curvature parameter from the von bertalanffy growth equation l is the asymptotic length and tc is the mean water temperature in celsius consumption values q b were estimated based on empirical relationships concerning diet morphometrics and water temperature at mean depth palomeres and pauly 1989 eq 2 2 log q b 5 847 0 280 l o g z 0 152 l o g w 1 360 t 0 062 a 0 510 h 0 390 d where w is the asymptotic weight g t is the mean water temperature expressed as 1000 temperature in kelvins a is the aspect ratio and h and d are factors correcting for herbivores and detritivores the values input into equation 6 are derived from fishbase froese and pauly 2019 the diet compositions of all functional groups were estimated from literature values and adjusted to match the requirements of input into an ecopath model weight in diet to account for uncertainty among input values each parameter was assigned a rank in ewe s pedigree table which places a confidence interval around the input value to be used along with resampling techniques trophic levels are calculated as fractional values odum and heald 1975 for use in simulation based analyses for energy flow related results i e non ecosim a trophic aggregation technique ulanowicz 1995 reorganized functional groups into integer based trophic levels as first described in lindeman 1942 one commercial fishing fleet was incorporated u s pelagic longline landings and fishing effort no of hooks from the longline fleet was obtained from iccat databases for the years 2011 2018 bycatch values for the u s pelagic longline fleet and bycatch mortality rates were gathered from literature sources pacheco et al 2011 kerstetter and graves 2008 garrison and stokes 2014 if bycatch data were not available for a functional group all catches were assumed to be landed the resulting model requires model balancing a systematic process in which the parameters that were believed to have the greatest uncertainty were adjusted first 2 4 time series the ewe model was developed with the reference year of 2011 and simulated through 2018 the ecosim model was calibrated to 25 time series of relative changes in catch and biomass values over the eight year period declines in the biomass of five micronekton groups lanternfishes bristlemouths hatchetfishes decapods and euphausiids were forced during simulations i e the user controls the value at each time step christensen et al 2008 according to survey information in 2011 and 2015 2018 cook and sutton 2017a 2017b sutton et al 2017 cook and sutton 2018 2020 time series biomass values for micronekton groups were calculated as the product of the median standardized abundance and the average weight of an individual of that functional group per sampled year only gulf common water sampling stations sensu johnston et al 2019 were included in micronekton biomass calculations to reduce sample bias caused by the loop current euphausiid biomass values were estimated at the start of the simulation so the forced change over time is relative to the initial start value dragonfish stomiidae biomass values were not forced during simulations because a significant portion of the population is believed to avoid capture by 10 m2 mocness deployments the standard gear used to catch micronekton in the modelled region marks et al 2020 due to an absence of reference data changes in biomass for micronekton functional groups from 2012 2014 are assumed to be a linear function between 2011 and 2015 interannual changes in the fishing effort for the longline fleet were also forced 2 5 shifts in trophic structure using the aforementioned pedigree as a guide for confidence intervals and the original input parameter as a prior value monte carlo simulations 1000 iterations were run to explore the variation in final output based on original uncertainty heymans et al 2016 variance among input parameters from the monte carlo iterations is displayed in supplementary material c similar to choy et al 2016 feeding guilds were established for all functional groups with a trophic level greater than 3 5 to differentiate among feeding of top predators a trophic level of 3 5 was chosen as a cut off because this group contains adult cohorts of tunas and billfishes micronektivorous fishes and marine mammals we employed this method for both 2011 start of simulation and 2018 end of simulation to identify trophic shifts among top predators in the ecosystem the average diet matrix mean of 1000 iterations for each year was calculated a hierarchical clustering method performed on a bray curtis similarity matrix determined the feeding guilds in each year using 60 similarity as a cut off clarke and gorley 2006 these guilds were overlaid with fitted eigen vectors on an mds plot to aid in the interpretation of clustering results all multivariate analyses were conducted using the r vegan package oksanen et al 2019 the mixed trophic impact mti was calculated ulanowicz and puccia 1990 individually for each iteration for each functional group pair in the model n 1849 and for each year n 8 averages and standard deviations were calculated for every functional group pair every year treating the iterations as replicates for each pair a linear model was developed to examine whether the trend in mti was a significant change or not a p value of less than 0 05 was considered statistically significant the code used to calculate the mti from the monte carlo model output is available as an r markdown document on github www github com mwood078 ogom ewe 3 results 3 1 ecopath results the model comprises approximately five trophic levels with sharks marine mammals and adult tunas and billfishes occupying the top of the food web the micronekton groups that were forced in this simulation occupied trophic levels ranging from 2 42 to 3 33 a decomposition of the origin of flows by integer based trophic level for each functional group revealed that for all mesopelagic zooplanktivorous fish functional groups greater than 75 of the energy they receive placed them in the third trophic level fig 2 the two primary producer groups including detritus accounted for 29 1 of the total standing stock biomass in the system while upper trophic level organisms tl 4 amounted to just 10 1 of the total biomass the largest proportion of biomass was zooplankton tl 2 which accounted for 35 9 of the total biomass in the system zooplankton was responsible for 38 4 of the total system throughput sum of consumption by predators export flow to detritus and respiration while upper trophic level organisms were only responsible for 3 7 of the total throughput detritus was the origin of a significant proportion of the total flow through the system 36 which can be a sign of a mature ecosystem odum and heald 1975 and highlights the importance of detritus in the oceanic gom 3 2 simulated processes throughout the eight year simulation all functional groups experienced some change in their biomass and trophic level but many changes were discrete fig 3 thirty one of the 42 functional groups within the model showed a decrease in biomass throughout the simulation the three functional groups that benefited the most throughout the simulation were juvenile skipjack 13 18 increase oceanic sharks 7 79 increase and mesozooplankton 3 01 increase the most negatively affected functional groups in terms of percentage change were decapod crustaceans 81 10 decrease bristlemouths 65 2 decrease and dragonfishes 61 5 decrease twenty five functional groups experienced a decrease in trophic level throughout the simulation the largest overall changes in trophic level tl occurred in fishes that rely heavily on mesopelagic micronekton as a prey source adult albacore tuna 0 08 tl decrease juvenile albacore tuna 0 08 tl decrease and dragonfishes 0 04 tl increase in general 19 functional groups decreased in both trophic level and biomass while just eight increased in both fig 3 3 3 shifts in diet the underlying mechanics behind an ecopath with ecosim model rely on the predator prey relationships driven by the diet matrix any change in the trophic structure that is not captured by changes in the trophic level of a functional group should be reflected in the diet matrix as a significant shift in prey taxa consumed biomass relative to other predators at a similar trophic level to target the effect of declines in micronekton biomass two sets of feeding guilds were established for functional groups with a trophic level greater than 3 5 in 2011 12 feeding guilds were established based on the similarity of diets fig 4 a predation on bristlemouths decapod crustaceans epipelagic forage feeders cephalopods ichthyoplankton and dragonfishes best explained the food web structure lanternfishes are notably absent from this list because they are eaten by nearly all upper trophic level organisms and do not contribute to diverging diets although marine mammals consume mesopelagic prey their diets were separated from many tuna and billfish species because of an affinity for cephalopods and larval fishes fig 4a seven single group feeding guilds were present oceanic sharks adult albacore tuna adult bigeye tuna adult bluefin tuna adult white marlin small tunas and other large predators and dragonfishes an epipelagic fish feeding guild was composed of seabirds juvenile bluefin tuna and juvenile yellowfin tuna dragonfishes were a bit of an outlier among the other functional groups as their diet composition is primarily mesopelagic zooplanktivores other diets are more diverse than dragonfishes including cephalopods and micronektonivores so the dragonfish placement in this plot was more indicative of a vastly different diet compared to other top predators in the ecosystem in 2018 eleven feeding guilds were recognized and some functional groups have transitioned to have similar diets to other functional groups i e changed feeding guild fig 4b decapod crustaceans bristlemouths and dragonfishes no longer explained the majority of the food web structure and instead were replaced by adult albacore tuna juvenile yellowfin tuna and other mesopelagic fishes compared to 2011 other upper trophic level organisms explained more of the food web structure than mesopelagics which can be interpreted as a reduction in the mesopelagic biomass constricting the diversity of prey available to top predators 3 4 mixed trophic impact analysis individual linear models n 1849 indicated that there was a change in 27 3 of the functional group interactions during this simulation fig 5 although each functional group acted as both the impacting and impacted group towards each other functional group in the model a change in one end of the interaction was reciprocated with a change in the other side of the relationship 47 times which is likely an indication ecosystem complexity of the interactions where there was a direct trophic relationship i e predator prey interaction n 505 32 3 of the interactions showed a change from 2011 2018 table 2 an uneven number of direct top down and bottom up interactions was the result of cyclical relationships e g cannibalism during the simulation direct relationships strengthened more frequently than they weakened for both top down and bottom up interactions table 2 contrary to direct interactions indirect interactions weakened more frequently than strengthened table 2 indirect interactions were the most common type of relationship n 1344 and changed less frequently than direct interactions 24 7 frequency direct top down interactions changed more than the other three types of interactions suggesting these types of relationships are more labile in the oceanic gom when organizing groups by trophic level there was no apparent trend in the proportion of changed interactions related to a functional group role in the ecosystem fig 6 the changes seen in direct interactions were focused on certain functional groups as opposed to being shared across all groups in the system i e some functional groups had zero interactions change while others had many changes among direct top down interactions were more frequent than among direct bottom up interactions fig 6 both types of indirect interactions top down and bottom up changed in small proportions for all functional groups in the model suggesting that the entire ecosystem experienced some change between 2011 and 2018 the preponderance of weakening indirect interactions and scarcity of strengthening suggests ecosystem resiliency has decreased bertness et al 2015 as future ecosystem processes will now be more driven by direct interactions 4 discussion the role of mesopelagic micronekton as wasp waist controllers in pelagic ecosystems is well documented griffiths et al 2013 choy et al 2016 compared to neritic habitats pelagic organisms have less specific diets but preferential preys exist drazen and sutton 2017 the feeding guilds that mesopelagic fishes can occupy are limited because the concentration of particulates in the water column is too low for filter feeding at mesopelagic depths herring 2002 and herbivory is rare robison 1984 thus carnivory dominates the feeding mode of mesopelagic fishes just three of the direct top down interactions that involve myctophids sternoptychids gonostomatids and other mesopelagic zooplanktivores as predators strengthened throughout the simulation while seven weakened all from the aggregate group a dearth of change among these functional groups which had significant declines in biomass is evidence of a poor ability to switch prey among a diminished prey field these restricted diet options combined with declines in macrozooplankton populations will likely inhibit the recovery of micronekton fish populations as food is less prevalent furthermore the direct top down interactions exerted on the mesopelagic zooplanktivorous fish groups strengthened in 23 of 60 possible interactions and weakened in only five decreased mesopelagic zooplanktivorous fish populations in the oceanic gom should hypothetically be relieved of predation pressure regardless of where the population was pre 2011 but in many instances the role they provide as prey has become more intense similar to the euphausiid capelin mallotus villosus trophic relationship in newfoundland waters obradovich et al 2014 a persistent decline in micronekton populations may have inauspicious effects on predator population growth zooplankton populations are pivotal to the stability of oceanic ecosystems as they are the food web link between autotrophic organisms and secondary consumers filter feeding zooplankton package pico 10 12 m and nano size particles 10 9 m into a consumable material for other consumers others such as decapod crustaceans and some euphausiids consume microzooplankton and mesozooplankton occasionally competing with small fishes heffernan and hopkins 1981 kinsey and hopkins 1994 hopkins and sutton 1998 this wide niche breadth throughout the trophic level is why approximately two fifths of the total system throughput occurs at the zooplankton trophic level similar to fishes the direct interactions involving zooplankton were labile therefore pelagic zooplankton was predicted to experience greater predation pressure in 2018 despite their population decline however an underrepresented portion of many food web models is the role of gelatinous zooplankton in the transfer of energy through the ecosystem although this model incorporates occurrences of gelatinous feeding by upper trophic level organisms cardona et al 2012 these values are believed to be heavily underreported in the literature drazen and sutton 2017 the stability of the oceanic gom ecosystem is dependent on the stability of the zooplankton trophic level so it is imperative to understand the interactions that control their population dynamics approximately one quarter of all possible trophic interactions in the oceanic gom changed between 2011 and 2018 for each functional group pair i and j there are two types of interactions one interaction is where group i is the group exerting impact on group j and another is where group i is receiving the impact from group j in an ecosystem with high modularity i e several guilds of organisms only interact with each other a change in the top down impact of one group to another should result in a change of the bottom up impact in the reciprocating interaction as a result of ecosystem simplicity however in this exercise a change in the interaction between two groups did not often result in a change in the opposite direction for example the direct top down pressure that dragonfishes exert on hatchetfishes weakened but the direct bottom up support hatchetfishes provide to dragonfishes did not change from 2011 2018 this phenomenon is likely attributable to the complexity of the oceanic gom micronekton assemblage hopkins and lancraft 1984 that allows upper trophic level predators to shift their diet to new preys rather than starve the importance of mesopelagic micronekton in the diet of apex predators in the oceanic zone suggests that changes in population sizes within the micronekton community could have a direct impact on the predatory success of these apex predators duffy et al 2017 as this exercise shows declined predator success will result in declined biomass but gom specific abundance indices suggest that yellowfin and bluefin tuna populations may be relatively stable or increasing anon 2017 2019 the potential underestimates in apex predator biomass is likely a product of an inability to model an open system where organisms could leave but suggests that the results related to the top down pressure on micronekton may be conservative in reality opportunistic predation and long distance migrations by apex predators likely provide a buffer towards the stability of these predator populations ménard et al 2006 despite declines in major prey resources in the gom these diet shifts were reflected in the calculation of the mti as the declined prey group was predicted to experience less predation pressure from the predator and the predator now benefits less from the existence of the former prey group lower diet contribution in stable ecosystems individual populations can fluctuate because species that occupy a similar niche can replace declining populations holling 1973 in the context of this exercise changes among top down and bottom up effects may not reflect permanent changes to the trophic structure of the ecosystem but instead a temporary change based on fluctuations in prey abundances however simulated biomass declines in other micronekton groups e g dragonfishes cephalopods and other mesopelagic micronektivorous fishes indicates the northern gom may no longer be a plentiful foraging ground for upper trophic level organisms compared to 2011 changes in the mti of one functional group on another will mostly be influenced by changes in diet and biomass significant changes in diet relative to the rest of the ecosystem should adjust the trophic level of a functional group throughout a simulation and diet is influenced by shifts in the biomass of prey groups over time shannon et al 2014 declines in several micronekton groups in this model led to a slight increase in the biomass of groups of a similar niche that were not forced e g mesozooplankton but to a decline in those dependent on mesopelagic micronekton as a prey resource e g dragonfishes an investigation of the mti over time provides a more refined view into potential shifts in the role of each organism relative to others within the system and could be used to assess other oceanic ecosystems the total effort of fishers on an annual basis is a dynamic process influenced by the availability of target fishes length of the fishing season and unexpected shutdowns monroy et al 2010 in an ecosystem model the role of each fishing fleet is to remove biomass similar to an apex predator fluctuations in the effort of a fishing fleet influence the amount of fishing pressure exerted on each commercial species since 2011 the fishing effort by the u s pelagic longline fleet in the gom has declined as a response to fishing regulations implemented in the region to reduce bluefin tuna bycatch nmfs 2020 this decline in the fishing effort has lessened the fishing mortality exerted on commercial groups having a negative indirect effect on many intermediate trophic level groups micronekton interact on a much smaller spatial scale than large pelagic fishes but exist in large numbers as a well dispersed assemblage milligan and sutton 2020 still the commercial impact of declines in mesopelagic micronekton in the gom is untested future addenda to management and conservation policies in the oceanic gom should be cognizant of declined prey abundances that could influence the direct trophic relationships with species of economic concern and energy flows throughout the ecosystem the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill likely had an immediate negative impact on oceanic biota abbriano et al 2011 but intense data collection regimes began after the disturbance sutton et al 2020 without a pre disturbance reference point it is difficult to discern between natural changes and human influenced changes therefore this exercise does not imply that anthropogenic impacts are responsible for changes within the ecosystem instead these results may provide an example of the dynamic nature of complex ecosystems with opportunistic apex predators and diverse intermediate trophic level

24650,ecosystem based modeling is rapidly becoming an established technique to investigate the health and stability of ecosystems in the gulf of mexico ecosystem models are applied to neritic systems but less focus has been placed on the oceanic domain since 2011 severe declines have been observed in many micronekton groups that occupy the mesopelagic zone 200 1000 m depth here we present an ecosystem model for the oceanic northern gulf of mexico for the year 2011 simulate that model according to micronekton trends through 2018 and quantify the top down and bottom up impacts that each functional group has on one another these trends were examined to determine whether interactions between the two groups have changed directionally over time in 2011 zooplankton trophic level 2 occupied greater than one third of the total metazoan biomass and also 40 of the total energy throughput ascended to higher trophic levels in the system of the 1849 possible functional group interactions most of which are indirect approximately 27 showed significant changes between 2011 and 2018 which were related to shifts in biomass and diet throughout the simulation direct top down interactions changed more frequently than other types of trophic relationships the frequency of direct changes that occurred in the simulation was not observed evenly among all functional groups as opposed to indirect interactions these changes between functional group interactions can be used to further examine potential shifts in the trophic structure of marine ecosystems under various forcing

system s stability and resiliency towards future disturbances costanza and magaeu 1999 in order to examine the health and stability of an ecosystem a multi species modeling approach is useful to track the interactions of many species within the same model ecosystem modeling is a tool that combines information regarding all known biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem with the goal of quantifying ecosystem services and food web topology levin et al 2008 in ecosystem models both direct trophic connection exists and indirect interactions no trophic interaction between species can be investigated monaco and ulanowicz 1997 however ecosystem models require many input values and simulations involve the changing of many parameters this increases the uncertainty of an ecosystem model when compared to a single species model due to a lack of sufficient data there are few ecosystem models for the oceanic realm seaward of the 200 m isobath when compared to neritic zones webb et al 2010 a lack of ecosystem models hinders our ability to predict shifts in the trophic structure of oceanic ecosystems over time the trophic structure of an ecosystem is often classified as a series of top down and bottom up interactions among species and is associated with predator and prey abundances within the system verity and smetacek 2002 fluctuations in the population size of a predator species may have an impact on the population size of a prey species but this effect is not equal across all prey of a single predator species worm and myers 2003 ulanowicz and puccia 1990 developed the mixed trophic impact measurement mti a metric to determine the effect an infinitesimal increase in the population size of one functional group would have on each other functional group within an ecosystem this index ranges from 1 to 1 where large negative values indicate top down feedback and large positive values indicate bottom up feedback mti has been used extensively in ecosystem models to recognize keystone species libralato et al 2006 important trophic connections sagarese et al 2017 and the importance of fishing pressure towards the future status of a fishery walters et al 1997 given that the mti is a measure of the relative effect of one functional group on another within the ecosystem changes in mtis among multiple pairs of functional groups over time indicate changes to the system s trophic structure when simulating an ecosystem across time it may be valuable to model a series of individual time steps as static ecosystems and analyze this positioning as a time series this method is usually developed for ecosystem level indicators such as biomass coll and steenbeek 2017 yield coll et al 2008 and trophic level shannon et al 2014 calculating mti at each time step in the simulation may reveal potential trends in the top down bottom up impacts one species exerts on another relative to other species within the model akin to other low latitude systems large finfishes e g tunas billfishes and sharks are the predominant apex predators in the epipelagic 0 200 m depth gulf of mexico gom hereafter while marine mammals exist in lower abundances many of these upper trophic level predators make routine dives into mesopelagic depths to prey upon micronekton assemblages watwood et al 2006 wilson and block 2009 many mesopelagic organisms particularly those in the deep scattering layer ascend into the epipelagic zone during nighttime to prey upon zooplankton or other mesopelagic migrators and descend back into mesopelagic depths during the daytime to avoid predators frost and mccrone 1978 deeper dwelling pelagic predators e g swordfishes make a diel vertical migration into the epipelagic zone during the night as well presumably following micronekton prey lerner et al 2013 however the micronekton assemblage is diverse and predators are likely not confined to a single prey source instead upper trophic level predators in the upper ocean are likely opportunistically feeding on the entire assemblage suggesting the ecosystem may be resilient to severe declines in a singular functional group ménard et al 2006 micronekton feed on diverse zooplankton and micronekton assemblages in a manner that may be taxon or size class specific to partition resources among species hopkins and sutton 1998 overall the food web of the oceanic gom is complex with depth layers connected by vertical migrations changes in the population size of functional groups within the ecosystem may alter the trophic structure of the system recently a large emphasis has been placed on ecosystem based management in the northern gom grüss et al 2016 this emphasis can be attributed to the large amounts of data collected since the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill and an increase in data sharing capabilities through online data repositories such as griidc www data gulfresearchintiative org these models have focal points that address ecosystem restoration de mutsert et al 2012 harmful algal blooms perryman et al 2020 hypoxia de mutsert et al 2016 fishery policy decisions chagaris et al 2015 and trophic interactions geers et al 2016 ecosystem models constructed in the gom have primarily focused on the coastal realm with just a few exceptions expanding into the open ocean vidal and pauly 2004 ainsworth et al 2015 rigorous data collection of non commercial species in the open ocean since 2011 has filled data gaps providing data necessary to develop an ecosystem model for this domain sutton et al 2020 a model devoted to the offshore gom would highlight the importance of micronekton as prey resources and predators of other organisms in the ecosystem as is apparent in other oceanic systems griffiths et al 2013 choy et al 2016 in this study we present the first ecosystem model in the northern gom devoted to the offshore waters seaward of the 1000 m isobath the model is simulated from 2011 to 2018 using observed trends in mesopelagic micronekton as the driver of the simulation we explore the uncertainty in input parameters and use this potential error to provide confidence intervals towards model output results the trophic structure of the ecosystem is characterized in the context of relative top down and bottom up relationships among species we estimate how these trophic interactions have changed from 2011 to 2018 finally we discuss these changes in the context of ecosystem health and stability 2 methods 2 1 model structure the modeled area encompasses the gom portion of the u s exclusive economic zone seaward of the 1000 m isobath approximately 350 000 km2 zeller and pauly 2015 fig 1 the vertical domain of the model region is from the surface to 1000 m depth the functional groups in the ecosystem model included all species that occupy the ecosystem at any time throughout the year nine species yellowfin tuna thunnus albacares blue marlin makaira nigricans bigeye tuna thunnus obesus white marlin kajikia albidus swordfish xiphias gladius sailfish istiophorus albicans bluefin tuna thunnus thynnus albacore tuna thunnus alalunga and skipjack tuna katsuwonus pelamis were each divided into two stage multi stanza groups juvenile and adult to account for ontogenetic changes in diet and fishing selectivity larval conspecifics were included in the juvenile life stage as tuna and billfish larval stages are much shorter than one year and growth rates are rapid fromentin and powers 2005 sponaugle et al 2010 the age of each multi stanza division was determined by the age at maturity referenced in stock assessments roundscale spearfish tetrapturus georgii is included with white marlin because of difficulties in distinguishing between the two species by fishers shivji et al 2006 mesopelagic fishes included the four biomass dominant fish families in the gom myctophidae sternoptychidae gonostomatidae and stomiidae mesopelagic fishes from other families were aggregated based on the known hopkins et al 1996 or assumed trophic positions juvenile neritic fishes that either migrate or are advected offshore by currents were included in the epipelagic forage feeder group as this would be their ecological role aggregate groups of invertebrates and primary producers were necessary to complete the food web the resulting model consists of 42 functional groups including three marine mammal groups sea turtles seabirds 29 fish groups 10 of which are larval or juvenile six invertebrate groups one primary producer and one detritus group additionally one fishery is included in the model 2 2 ecopath with ecosim ecopath with ecosim ewe is a mass balanced ecosystem software that assumes the ecosystem is in equilibrium ewe was initially developed as a method to provide information about the standing stock of functional groups and the flow of energy throughout an ecosystem polovina 1984 since its initial release ewe has undergone extensive development with the inclusion of additional plug in procedures steenbeek et al 2016 but the original framework still exists in the current software two master equations control the mass balance assumption within ecopath one describes production and the second describes energy balance sensu christensen et al 2008 four ecopath parameters are necessary for each group biomass b production biomass p b consumption biomass q b and ecotrophic efficiency ee table 1 ecotrophic efficiency is defined as the proportion of production that is used within the system and is best calculated as an estimated parameter when all other information is known a biomass accumulation ba parameter can be included to reflect population trends leading into the initial model year and can increase the reliability of model results in data limited ecosystems natugonza et al 2020 ecopath once required the assumption of a steady state polovina 1984 but advancements have reduced this assumption so that each functional group must achieve mass balance throughout each time step in the model and can otherwise be dynamic an additional input parameter is the diet composition i e the proportion of annual diet by biomass of each predator group on each prey group in the model the diet of each functional group must be entered and cannot be estimated including cohorts of multi stanza groups in this model diet information is provided from bibliographic sources supplementary material a walters et al 1997 developed ecosim a temporal dynamic model that uses input parameters from a balanced ecopath model and estimates changes in an ecosystem over time the dynamics of an ecosim model are expressed through two differential equations one that estimates changes in biomass over time and another that estimates changes in consumption rates at each time step sensu christensen et al 2008 during an ecosim simulation additional parameters monitor the change in a predator s ability to find and consume prey the changes in consumption rates are derived from the foraging arena concept walters and juanes 1993 where prey groups can shift between vulnerable available to the predator and invulnerable unavailable to the predator states a high vulnerability parameter signifies top down control while a low vulnerability parameter is indicative of bottom up forcing vulnerability parameters were estimated for each functional group using an iterative fitting procedure christensen et al 2008 this procedure tests different vulnerability values for each species and searches for the values that provide the best statistical fit towards a reference time series heymans et al 2016 the vulnerability of larval and juvenile fishes was set at 1 bottom up forcing which significantly improved model performance towards expected adult tuna and billfish trends 2 3 parameterization information regarding specific sources used to parameterize the model are in supplementary material b biomass b metric tons km 2 values derive from single species stock assessments or from fisheries independent survey data the finfish stock assessment species that occupy the oceanic gom have a wider distribution than the model domain the adult biomass for each multi stanza group was determined as the quotient of nominal catch in the gom and fishing mortality that occurs in the model domain b c f fishing mortality in the model domain was calculated as the product of the proportion of catches in the gom relative to the entire stock and the fishing mortality of the entire stock the data originate from the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas iccat www iccat int en this calculation forces the assumption that standardized catches throughout a stock are a suitable proxy for the distribution of the stock and was chosen in favor of assuming the stock is distributed uniformly across the stock area marine mammal and micronekton functional group biomasses were calculated as the product of the standardized abundance n individuals km 2 and mean weight of an organism from either literature values trites and pauly 1998 nmfs 2019 or survey data the production biomass ratio p b year 1 or total mortality z year 1 is calculated as the sum of natural mortality and fishing mortality from stock assessments or through empirical relationships pauly 1980 eq 1 1 m k 0 65 l 0 279 t c 0 463 where m is natural mortality year 1 k is the curvature parameter from the von bertalanffy growth equation l is the asymptotic length and tc is the mean water temperature in celsius consumption values q b were estimated based on empirical relationships concerning diet morphometrics and water temperature at mean depth palomeres and pauly 1989 eq 2 2 log q b 5 847 0 280 l o g z 0 152 l o g w 1 360 t 0 062 a 0 510 h 0 390 d where w is the asymptotic weight g t is the mean water temperature expressed as 1000 temperature in kelvins a is the aspect ratio and h and d are factors correcting for herbivores and detritivores the values input into equation 6 are derived from fishbase froese and pauly 2019 the diet compositions of all functional groups were estimated from literature values and adjusted to match the requirements of input into an ecopath model weight in diet to account for uncertainty among input values each parameter was assigned a rank in ewe s pedigree table which places a confidence interval around the input value to be used along with resampling techniques trophic levels are calculated as fractional values odum and heald 1975 for use in simulation based analyses for energy flow related results i e non ecosim a trophic aggregation technique ulanowicz 1995 reorganized functional groups into integer based trophic levels as first described in lindeman 1942 one commercial fishing fleet was incorporated u s pelagic longline landings and fishing effort no of hooks from the longline fleet was obtained from iccat databases for the years 2011 2018 bycatch values for the u s pelagic longline fleet and bycatch mortality rates were gathered from literature sources pacheco et al 2011 kerstetter and graves 2008 garrison and stokes 2014 if bycatch data were not available for a functional group all catches were assumed to be landed the resulting model requires model balancing a systematic process in which the parameters that were believed to have the greatest uncertainty were adjusted first 2 4 time series the ewe model was developed with the reference year of 2011 and simulated through 2018 the ecosim model was calibrated to 25 time series of relative changes in catch and biomass values over the eight year period declines in the biomass of five micronekton groups lanternfishes bristlemouths hatchetfishes decapods and euphausiids were forced during simulations i e the user controls the value at each time step christensen et al 2008 according to survey information in 2011 and 2015 2018 cook and sutton 2017a 2017b sutton et al 2017 cook and sutton 2018 2020 time series biomass values for micronekton groups were calculated as the product of the median standardized abundance and the average weight of an individual of that functional group per sampled year only gulf common water sampling stations sensu johnston et al 2019 were included in micronekton biomass calculations to reduce sample bias caused by the loop current euphausiid biomass values were estimated at the start of the simulation so the forced change over time is relative to the initial start value dragonfish stomiidae biomass values were not forced during simulations because a significant portion of the population is believed to avoid capture by 10 m2 mocness deployments the standard gear used to catch micronekton in the modelled region marks et al 2020 due to an absence of reference data changes in biomass for micronekton functional groups from 2012 2014 are assumed to be a linear function between 2011 and 2015 interannual changes in the fishing effort for the longline fleet were also forced 2 5 shifts in trophic structure using the aforementioned pedigree as a guide for confidence intervals and the original input parameter as a prior value monte carlo simulations 1000 iterations were run to explore the variation in final output based on original uncertainty heymans et al 2016 variance among input parameters from the monte carlo iterations is displayed in supplementary material c similar to choy et al 2016 feeding guilds were established for all functional groups with a trophic level greater than 3 5 to differentiate among feeding of top predators a trophic level of 3 5 was chosen as a cut off because this group contains adult cohorts of tunas and billfishes micronektivorous fishes and marine mammals we employed this method for both 2011 start of simulation and 2018 end of simulation to identify trophic shifts among top predators in the ecosystem the average diet matrix mean of 1000 iterations for each year was calculated a hierarchical clustering method performed on a bray curtis similarity matrix determined the feeding guilds in each year using 60 similarity as a cut off clarke and gorley 2006 these guilds were overlaid with fitted eigen vectors on an mds plot to aid in the interpretation of clustering results all multivariate analyses were conducted using the r vegan package oksanen et al 2019 the mixed trophic impact mti was calculated ulanowicz and puccia 1990 individually for each iteration for each functional group pair in the model n 1849 and for each year n 8 averages and standard deviations were calculated for every functional group pair every year treating the iterations as replicates for each pair a linear model was developed to examine whether the trend in mti was a significant change or not a p value of less than 0 05 was considered statistically significant the code used to calculate the mti from the monte carlo model output is available as an r markdown document on github www github com mwood078 ogom ewe 3 results 3 1 ecopath results the model comprises approximately five trophic levels with sharks marine mammals and adult tunas and billfishes occupying the top of the food web the micronekton groups that were forced in this simulation occupied trophic levels ranging from 2 42 to 3 33 a decomposition of the origin of flows by integer based trophic level for each functional group revealed that for all mesopelagic zooplanktivorous fish functional groups greater than 75 of the energy they receive placed them in the third trophic level fig 2 the two primary producer groups including detritus accounted for 29 1 of the total standing stock biomass in the system while upper trophic level organisms tl 4 amounted to just 10 1 of the total biomass the largest proportion of biomass was zooplankton tl 2 which accounted for 35 9 of the total biomass in the system zooplankton was responsible for 38 4 of the total system throughput sum of consumption by predators export flow to detritus and respiration while upper trophic level organisms were only responsible for 3 7 of the total throughput detritus was the origin of a significant proportion of the total flow through the system 36 which can be a sign of a mature ecosystem odum and heald 1975 and highlights the importance of detritus in the oceanic gom 3 2 simulated processes throughout the eight year simulation all functional groups experienced some change in their biomass and trophic level but many changes were discrete fig 3 thirty one of the 42 functional groups within the model showed a decrease in biomass throughout the simulation the three functional groups that benefited the most throughout the simulation were juvenile skipjack 13 18 increase oceanic sharks 7 79 increase and mesozooplankton 3 01 increase the most negatively affected functional groups in terms of percentage change were decapod crustaceans 81 10 decrease bristlemouths 65 2 decrease and dragonfishes 61 5 decrease twenty five functional groups experienced a decrease in trophic level throughout the simulation the largest overall changes in trophic level tl occurred in fishes that rely heavily on mesopelagic micronekton as a prey source adult albacore tuna 0 08 tl decrease juvenile albacore tuna 0 08 tl decrease and dragonfishes 0 04 tl increase in general 19 functional groups decreased in both trophic level and biomass while just eight increased in both fig 3 3 3 shifts in diet the underlying mechanics behind an ecopath with ecosim model rely on the predator prey relationships driven by the diet matrix any change in the trophic structure that is not captured by changes in the trophic level of a functional group should be reflected in the diet matrix as a significant shift in prey taxa consumed biomass relative to other predators at a similar trophic level to target the effect of declines in micronekton biomass two sets of feeding guilds were established for functional groups with a trophic level greater than 3 5 in 2011 12 feeding guilds were established based on the similarity of diets fig 4 a predation on bristlemouths decapod crustaceans epipelagic forage feeders cephalopods ichthyoplankton and dragonfishes best explained the food web structure lanternfishes are notably absent from this list because they are eaten by nearly all upper trophic level organisms and do not contribute to diverging diets although marine mammals consume mesopelagic prey their diets were separated from many tuna and billfish species because of an affinity for cephalopods and larval fishes fig 4a seven single group feeding guilds were present oceanic sharks adult albacore tuna adult bigeye tuna adult bluefin tuna adult white marlin small tunas and other large predators and dragonfishes an epipelagic fish feeding guild was composed of seabirds juvenile bluefin tuna and juvenile yellowfin tuna dragonfishes were a bit of an outlier among the other functional groups as their diet composition is primarily mesopelagic zooplanktivores other diets are more diverse than dragonfishes including cephalopods and micronektonivores so the dragonfish placement in this plot was more indicative of a vastly different diet compared to other top predators in the ecosystem in 2018 eleven feeding guilds were recognized and some functional groups have transitioned to have similar diets to other functional groups i e changed feeding guild fig 4b decapod crustaceans bristlemouths and dragonfishes no longer explained the majority of the food web structure and instead were replaced by adult albacore tuna juvenile yellowfin tuna and other mesopelagic fishes compared to 2011 other upper trophic level organisms explained more of the food web structure than mesopelagics which can be interpreted as a reduction in the mesopelagic biomass constricting the diversity of prey available to top predators 3 4 mixed trophic impact analysis individual linear models n 1849 indicated that there was a change in 27 3 of the functional group interactions during this simulation fig 5 although each functional group acted as both the impacting and impacted group towards each other functional group in the model a change in one end of the interaction was reciprocated with a change in the other side of the relationship 47 times which is likely an indication ecosystem complexity of the interactions where there was a direct trophic relationship i e predator prey interaction n 505 32 3 of the interactions showed a change from 2011 2018 table 2 an uneven number of direct top down and bottom up interactions was the result of cyclical relationships e g cannibalism during the simulation direct relationships strengthened more frequently than they weakened for both top down and bottom up interactions table 2 contrary to direct interactions indirect interactions weakened more frequently than strengthened table 2 indirect interactions were the most common type of relationship n 1344 and changed less frequently than direct interactions 24 7 frequency direct top down interactions changed more than the other three types of interactions suggesting these types of relationships are more labile in the oceanic gom when organizing groups by trophic level there was no apparent trend in the proportion of changed interactions related to a functional group role in the ecosystem fig 6 the changes seen in direct interactions were focused on certain functional groups as opposed to being shared across all groups in the system i e some functional groups had zero interactions change while others had many changes among direct top down interactions were more frequent than among direct bottom up interactions fig 6 both types of indirect interactions top down and bottom up changed in small proportions for all functional groups in the model suggesting that the entire ecosystem experienced some change between 2011 and 2018 the preponderance of weakening indirect interactions and scarcity of strengthening suggests ecosystem resiliency has decreased bertness et al 2015 as future ecosystem processes will now be more driven by direct interactions 4 discussion the role of mesopelagic micronekton as wasp waist controllers in pelagic ecosystems is well documented griffiths et al 2013 choy et al 2016 compared to neritic habitats pelagic organisms have less specific diets but preferential preys exist drazen and sutton 2017 the feeding guilds that mesopelagic fishes can occupy are limited because the concentration of particulates in the water column is too low for filter feeding at mesopelagic depths herring 2002 and herbivory is rare robison 1984 thus carnivory dominates the feeding mode of mesopelagic fishes just three of the direct top down interactions that involve myctophids sternoptychids gonostomatids and other mesopelagic zooplanktivores as predators strengthened throughout the simulation while seven weakened all from the aggregate group a dearth of change among these functional groups which had significant declines in biomass is evidence of a poor ability to switch prey among a diminished prey field these restricted diet options combined with declines in macrozooplankton populations will likely inhibit the recovery of micronekton fish populations as food is less prevalent furthermore the direct top down interactions exerted on the mesopelagic zooplanktivorous fish groups strengthened in 23 of 60 possible interactions and weakened in only five decreased mesopelagic zooplanktivorous fish populations in the oceanic gom should hypothetically be relieved of predation pressure regardless of where the population was pre 2011 but in many instances the role they provide as prey has become more intense similar to the euphausiid capelin mallotus villosus trophic relationship in newfoundland waters obradovich et al 2014 a persistent decline in micronekton populations may have inauspicious effects on predator population growth zooplankton populations are pivotal to the stability of oceanic ecosystems as they are the food web link between autotrophic organisms and secondary consumers filter feeding zooplankton package pico 10 12 m and nano size particles 10 9 m into a consumable material for other consumers others such as decapod crustaceans and some euphausiids consume microzooplankton and mesozooplankton occasionally competing with small fishes heffernan and hopkins 1981 kinsey and hopkins 1994 hopkins and sutton 1998 this wide niche breadth throughout the trophic level is why approximately two fifths of the total system throughput occurs at the zooplankton trophic level similar to fishes the direct interactions involving zooplankton were labile therefore pelagic zooplankton was predicted to experience greater predation pressure in 2018 despite their population decline however an underrepresented portion of many food web models is the role of gelatinous zooplankton in the transfer of energy through the ecosystem although this model incorporates occurrences of gelatinous feeding by upper trophic level organisms cardona et al 2012 these values are believed to be heavily underreported in the literature drazen and sutton 2017 the stability of the oceanic gom ecosystem is dependent on the stability of the zooplankton trophic level so it is imperative to understand the interactions that control their population dynamics approximately one quarter of all possible trophic interactions in the oceanic gom changed between 2011 and 2018 for each functional group pair i and j there are two types of interactions one interaction is where group i is the group exerting impact on group j and another is where group i is receiving the impact from group j in an ecosystem with high modularity i e several guilds of organisms only interact with each other a change in the top down impact of one group to another should result in a change of the bottom up impact in the reciprocating interaction as a result of ecosystem simplicity however in this exercise a change in the interaction between two groups did not often result in a change in the opposite direction for example the direct top down pressure that dragonfishes exert on hatchetfishes weakened but the direct bottom up support hatchetfishes provide to dragonfishes did not change from 2011 2018 this phenomenon is likely attributable to the complexity of the oceanic gom micronekton assemblage hopkins and lancraft 1984 that allows upper trophic level predators to shift their diet to new preys rather than starve the importance of mesopelagic micronekton in the diet of apex predators in the oceanic zone suggests that changes in population sizes within the micronekton community could have a direct impact on the predatory success of these apex predators duffy et al 2017 as this exercise shows declined predator success will result in declined biomass but gom specific abundance indices suggest that yellowfin and bluefin tuna populations may be relatively stable or increasing anon 2017 2019 the potential underestimates in apex predator biomass is likely a product of an inability to model an open system where organisms could leave but suggests that the results related to the top down pressure on micronekton may be conservative in reality opportunistic predation and long distance migrations by apex predators likely provide a buffer towards the stability of these predator populations ménard et al 2006 despite declines in major prey resources in the gom these diet shifts were reflected in the calculation of the mti as the declined prey group was predicted to experience less predation pressure from the predator and the predator now benefits less from the existence of the former prey group lower diet contribution in stable ecosystems individual populations can fluctuate because species that occupy a similar niche can replace declining populations holling 1973 in the context of this exercise changes among top down and bottom up effects may not reflect permanent changes to the trophic structure of the ecosystem but instead a temporary change based on fluctuations in prey abundances however simulated biomass declines in other micronekton groups e g dragonfishes cephalopods and other mesopelagic micronektivorous fishes indicates the northern gom may no longer be a plentiful foraging ground for upper trophic level organisms compared to 2011 changes in the mti of one functional group on another will mostly be influenced by changes in diet and biomass significant changes in diet relative to the rest of the ecosystem should adjust the trophic level of a functional group throughout a simulation and diet is influenced by shifts in the biomass of prey groups over time shannon et al 2014 declines in several micronekton groups in this model led to a slight increase in the biomass of groups of a similar niche that were not forced e g mesozooplankton but to a decline in those dependent on mesopelagic micronekton as a prey resource e g dragonfishes an investigation of the mti over time provides a more refined view into potential shifts in the role of each organism relative to others within the system and could be used to assess other oceanic ecosystems the total effort of fishers on an annual basis is a dynamic process influenced by the availability of target fishes length of the fishing season and unexpected shutdowns monroy et al 2010 in an ecosystem model the role of each fishing fleet is to remove biomass similar to an apex predator fluctuations in the effort of a fishing fleet influence the amount of fishing pressure exerted on each commercial species since 2011 the fishing effort by the u s pelagic longline fleet in the gom has declined as a response to fishing regulations implemented in the region to reduce bluefin tuna bycatch nmfs 2020 this decline in the fishing effort has lessened the fishing mortality exerted on commercial groups having a negative indirect effect on many intermediate trophic level groups micronekton interact on a much smaller spatial scale than large pelagic fishes but exist in large numbers as a well dispersed assemblage milligan and sutton 2020 still the commercial impact of declines in mesopelagic micronekton in the gom is untested future addenda to management and conservation policies in the oceanic gom should be cognizant of declined prey abundances that could influence the direct trophic relationships with species of economic concern and energy flows throughout the ecosystem the 2010 deepwater horizon oil spill likely had an immediate negative impact on oceanic biota abbriano et al 2011 but intense data collection regimes began after the disturbance sutton et al 2020 without a pre disturbance reference point it is difficult to discern between natural changes and human influenced changes therefore this exercise does not imply that anthropogenic impacts are responsible for changes within the ecosystem instead these results may provide an example of the dynamic nature of complex ecosystems with opportunistic apex predators and diverse intermediate trophic level

included stand and landscape scale empirical and process based models used across europe the test dataset originated from inventory data covering 50 years tree measurements 1963 1983 and 2013 and included annual harvesting records at tree level uncertainties in data and forest conditions were considered by defining 12 scenarios varying initial regeneration browsing pressure and harvest modalities we evaluated the models ability to initialize forest conditions accurately whether management interventions could be implemented based on harvest records and how well basal area and diameter structure could be predicted simulation results for basal area development showed good to satisfactory performance for all models at which samsara2 sibyla and picus showed the best agreement comparison of simulated and observed diameter distributions showed good performance of forclim picus samsara2 and sibyla model output variability was between 6 and 24 indicating the relevance to consider uncertainties that can be attributed to specific sources there was no clear hierarchy between more empirical or more process based models regarding accuracy of stand development projections the cohort based landscape model landclim showed the lowest stand level accuracy and scenario sensitivity but results nevertheless qualified it for complementary application at landscape scale within individual based models spatially explicit models seemed to be more suitable for heterogeneous mixed mountain forests the findings demonstrated the usefulness of inventory datasets for model testing and intercomparison keywords model intercomparison tree growth tree mortality forest management ungulate browsing forest inventory data 1 introduction forest simulation models are powerful tools for testing and evaluating the mid to long term implications of different management strategies on future forest development and related ecosystem service provisioning söderbergh and ledermann 2003 schelhaas et al 2014 changing environmental conditions and intensifying disturbance regimes e g seidl et al 2011 temperli et al 2013 have increased the complexity in forest resource planning and management and consequently the role of model based decision support has drawn a lot of attention recently muys et al 2011 linkevičius et al 2019 one response to this growing challenge has been an increased reliance on forest simulation models which are potentially climate sensitive and allow for alternative and novel forest management strategies to be evaluated concomitantly there has also been an increase in testing the benefits limits and credibility of forest models courbaud et al 2015 foster et al 2017 model evaluation studies are required to build trust and confidence in model outputs and are thus a prerequisite for any model application in practical decision support in view of growing interest in complex forest structures multi species mixtures the provisioning of various ecosystem services beyond timber production and the need to consider the effects of a changing climate the demands being placed on forest models have grown considerably over the recent years silvicultural regimes that have been proposed to adapt forests to climate change often focus on small scale silvicultural measures and the creation of heterogeneous stand conditions to foster forest resilience christensen 1997 puettmann et al 2009 adequately representing these forest structures and the underlying ecosystem processes that generate them requires individual based climate sensitive forest modeling approaches that allow the simulation of complex silvicultural tree selection and cutting patterns söderbergh and ledermann 2003 grimm et al 2005 mina et al 2017 from the perspective of a potential model user it can be difficult to decide what the appropriate model for a specific task and location should be based on its original theoretical concept the reason is that many models being scientific tools under permanent development rather than ready products are continuously refined extended or hybridized with other models larocque et al 2011 therefore to identify strengths and weaknesses of different models intercomparison studies are recommended huber et al 2013 where multiple models are tested within a harmonized framework against independent observational data while model comparison studies are frequently published for carbon and water flux models e g ryan et al 1996 hanson et al 2004 jin et al 2016 thurner et al 2017 multi model evaluation studies for forest ecosystem models are rare for instance badeck et al 2001 tested six gap models against observed structure and species composition of a virgin forest other studies comparing models originating from the same region have been published by härkönen et al 2010 huber et al 2013 and mccullagh et al 2017 recently bugmann et al 2019 compared the behavior of mortality algorithms implemented in several forest models however studies comparing forest models that originate from different countries and different ecological and management contexts against long term observational data sets from managed forests are rare but see e g mäkelä et al 2000 lindner et al 2005 consistent data sets from managed multi species forests that extend over several decades are rare particularly when tree level data are required usually data from silvicultural experiments are utilized for this purpose mäkelä et al 2000 yaussy 2000 lindner et al 2005 seidl et al 2005 when long term observational data are used for a model evaluation study the issue of information quality arises gadow 2000 historical data from decades ago may be subject to uncertainty with regard to accuracy of measurements and there may be gaps with regard to tree species specific information and unknown calipering thresholds moreover usually no information about tree positions forest structure or spatial species mixture types is available the timing of harvests as well as the composition of harvested volume species dead and alive trees may also not be known exactly given the relevance of legacies for future forest development erroneous initial forest conditions may propagate over time and increase uncertainty which limits the power of model evaluation studies in the fp7 project arange http www arange project eu several forest models originally developed for different european forest types and representing different conceptual modeling approaches were employed to explore management alternatives for mountain forests in major european mountain ranges bugmann et al 2017 in addition multi decade forest inventory data from the dinaric mountains in slovenia were available within the project consortium this setting provided the opportunity to compare five established models in a model intercomparison study specific questions of the study were 1 how well can forest models be initialized with historical inventory data 2 how well can forest models implement historical management schemes derived from harvest records 3 how well do observed stand trajectories and model simulations match with regard to volume basal area and diameter structure 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the observational time series data comes from an area near the snĕžnik mountain 1796 m a s l in the northern part of the dinaric mountains slovenia europe the snĕžnik area is a karst limestone plateau transformed in the last glacial period the soils are mainly chromic cambisols and rendzic leptosols the climate in the northern dinaric mountains has mediterranean influences with warm summer temperatures long term mean from july to august is 18 3 c at 800 m a s l and 14 9 c at 1300 m a s l and low winter temperatures mean january temperatures 0 6 c to 4 1 c mean annual temperature ranges from 6 8 c at 800 m to 3 1 c at 1300 m with annual precipitation between 1670 mm and 1930 mm respectively mean summer precipitation may to september ranges from 650 to 740 mm the upper timberline is located at approximately 1550 m mountainous silver fir abies alba mill european beech fagus sylvatica l norway spruce picea abies karst forests are the prevailing natural forest type with frequent occurrence of sycamore maple acer pseudoplatanus l and wych elm ulmus glabra huds while small leaved lime tilia cordata mill rowan sorbus aucuparia l common whitebeam sorbus aria l crantz yew taxus baccata l and some other species can also be found sporadically the first major regular utilization of these forests started in the second half of the 19th century when silver fir was promoted while in line with the economic principles of that time beech was weeded out and used for charcoal and potash production and wood distillation perko 2002 at the beginning of the 20th century an uneven aged single stem selection system i e plenter system was introduced schollmayer 1906 due to a noticeable decrease in fir vitality and its insufficient regeneration and recruitment klopcic et al 2010 a combination of single stem and small scale irregular shelterwood system was introduced in the 1960s afterwards it was adapted to a more flexible site and stand specific continuous cover system labeled free style silviculture combining elements of single stem selection irregular shelterwood and shelterwood approaches which has been applied since then mlinsek 1968 boncina 2011 within the sneznik area a set of nine compartments with a total area of 60 0 ha was chosen for the model evaluation study the sites are located apart from each other on elevations between 800 m to 1300 m a s l 2 2 forest inventory dataset along with the introduction of uneven aged forest management at the beginning of the 20th century a permanent division of forests into compartments was established and since 1912 eight forest inventories have been conducted before 1973 inventories were implemented by fully callipering the compartments in 1973 and 1983 inventories were executed as full callipering of a sample of compartments while in 1993 permanent sample plots were established and used since then the full callipering data were available from inventories in 1963 and a follow up measurement in 1973 compartment 17a or 1983 all other compartments due to low sampling densities in the 1993 and 2003 inventories this data could not be utilized to calculate reliable values for individual compartments thus for the current study an angle count sampling inventory bitterlich 1952 was conducted in 2013 on a 50 50 m grid to gather data compatible with the historical surveys in 1963 1973 and 1983 thus compartment polygons did not change throughout the observation period starting in 1963 from all inventories stem numbers per hectare were available per tree species in 5 cm dbh diameter at breast height classes starting at 10 cm dbh only live trees were recorded in the inventories for details about the nine study compartments see table sm1 depending on the site index two sets of height functions relating tree height to dbh for individual species were assigned to the compartments to calculate initial tree height in 1963 table sm2 starting in 1963 a historical register of annual harvests per compartment was available documenting the harvests in 5 cm dbh classes table sm1 presents selected information about the harvesting activities in the forest compartments 2 3 climate data the forest models require daily or monthly climate data to drive the simulations see table sm3 for each of the nine forest compartments a daily time series of climate data covering the period 1963 2013 was prepared based on the nearest grid cell lat 45 625 long 14 375 of the e obs data set van den besselaar et al 2011 the mt clim routines running et al 1987 thornton and running 1999 were used to adjust the e obs climate record for elevation slope and aspect of the nine sites and to estimate incoming global radiation of the daylight period and vapor pressure deficit see thornton et al 2000 2 4 forest models the five models were the gap model forclim bugmann 1996 the landscape model landclim schumacher et al 2004 the hybrid 3d patch model picus hönninger and lexer 2001 seidl et al 2005 and the spatially explicit empirical models samsara2 courbaud et al 2015 and sibyla fabrika 2005 the models are briefly introduced and their key features summarized in table sm3 for detailed descriptions we refer to the original sources 2 4 1 forclim forclim is a climate sensitive forest succession gap model that has been developed to simulate forest dynamics over a wide range of environmental conditions bugmann 1994 the model simulates establishment growth and mortality of individual trees on small independent patches using a minimum of ecological assumptions to capture the influence of climate and ecological processes on forest dynamics bugmann 1996 didion et al 2009b forclim is structured into four sub models weather water plant and management the plant sub model is the core of forclim where establishment and growth of tree cohorts i e trees of the same species and age are simulated based on light availability soil nutrients browsing intensity and bioclimatic indices calculated within the sub models weather and water tree mortality is modeled as a combination of constant background mortality and a stress induced component the management sub model enables the simulation of a wide range of silvicultural treatments such as clearcutting shelterwood thinning planting and others in this study we applied forclim version 3 0 rasche et al 2011 complemented by an empirical harvesting algorithm for simulating removals of an exact number of stems for every tree species by diameter class single stem removal see description in mina et al 2017 forclim is currently parameterized for 31 european tree species and has been tested for the representation of natural forest dynamics of temperate forests of the northern hemisphere e g didion et al 2009a 2 4 2 landclim landclim is a process based forest landscape model schumacher et al 2004 schumacher et al 2006 designed to simulate forest dynamics and disturbances at large spatial scales 103 to 106 ha over long periods of time hundreds to thousands of years in landclim landscapes are represented as a 25 25 m grid with specific topographic and climatic input variables for each cell within each cell a simplified forest gap model bugmann 2001 simulates establishment growth competition and mortality of trees on an annual time step similar to forclim trees are simulated using a cohort approach i e a computational simplification where one representative individual is simulated for all trees of the same species and age within a cell bugmann 1996 tree growth is simulated using a logistic growth equation where species specific maximum growth rate and size are reduced by light availability degree day sum and a drought index schumacher et al 2004 establishment and mortality are stochastic processes each year the potential for tree establishment is determined as a function of environmental filters i e available light at the forest floor minimum winter temperature growing degree day sum drought index and browsing mortality probability is determined as a combination of stress density dependent and intrinsic mortality landclim can simulate management in 10 year intervals on defined management areas by selecting and removing a percentage of trees fulfilling specified dbh constraints the model has been tested and adapted to the european alps briner et al 2013 elkin et al 2013 temperli et al 2013 north american rocky mountains schumacher et al 2006 schwörer et al 2016 and mediterranean forests henne et al 2015 for this study the individual compartments were simulated in landclim as independent entities without landscape level interactions among them to produce results comparable to the stand level models 2 4 3 picus the forest model picus version 1 5 lexer and hönninger 2001 seidl et al 2005 irauschek et al 2017a henceforth referred to as picus is a hybrid of classical gap model components and process based stand level npp algorithms landsberg and waring 1997 the spatial core structure of picus is an array of 10 10 m patches with vertical crown cells of 5 m in height interactions between patches are considered via a three dimensional light model and spatially explicit seed dispersal stand level npp is estimated with a model of light use efficiency landsberg and waring 1997 which depends on intercepted radiation temperature precipitation vapor pressure deficit soil water and nutrient supply distribution of assimilates to individual trees is based on the relative competitive success of the individual trees tree mortality depends on age and stress conditions natural tree regeneration considers seed production and distribution germination and establishment up to the height of 130 cm seedlings are simulated with a height class approach beyond that threshold they are considered as individuals in the tree population irauschek et al 2017b picus includes a flexible management module enabling the implementation of silvicultural treatments at tree level depending on tree attributes and patch location the model includes 17 parameterized tree species and has been validated seidl et al 2005 didion et al 2009a and applied in numerous studies all over europe lexer et al 2002 maroschek et al 2015 pardos et al 2015 zlatanov et al 2017 2 4 4 samsara2 samsara2 is an individual based and spatially explicit model to simulate regeneration growth and mortality of individual trees in mixed and uneven aged mountain forest stands courbaud et al 2015 the model builds on the theory that light interception by tree crowns is a key driver in uneven aged stands because they present a strong vertical heterogeneity favoring asymmetric competition between trees and between the canopy and seedlings in samsara2 competition for light within a stand is calculated based on light ray interception by tree crowns samsara2 has been calibrated empirically for silver fir and norway spruce stands within the montane elevation belt of the alps in france ecological factors other than light such as climate and site conditions are not directly taken into account fertility of the site is taken into account indirectly through the value of the different demographic parameters according to courbaud et al 2015 the model should be recalibrated if applied under different site conditions annual diameter increment of individual trees depends on their size and the amount of light intercepted by their crown during the growing season natural mortality depends on tree diameter and a competition index defined as the basal area of larger trees within a radius of 15 m seeds are produced by adult trees and germination growth and survival of seedlings depend on the light reaching the ground calculated in the center of 25 m2 cells trees participate in light interception above dbh of 7 5 cm specific management algorithms allow the simulation of detailed silvicultural strategies varying both the characteristics of harvested trees and their spatial arrangement within a stand lafond et al 2012 lafond et al 2014 2 4 5 sibyla the sibyla model fabrika 2005 is based on the silva simulator pretzsch et al 2002 it is an empirical distance dependent ecological niche based model that simulates the growth of individual trees the expected height increment is estimated from the potential height increment of the tree and a multiplier which characterizes the effects of competition soil and climatic conditions see pretzsch and kahn 1998 sibyla was parameterized and validated using forest inventory data from germany switzerland and slovakia the model is parameterized for five main european forest tree species norway spruce silver fir scots pine european beech and oak quercus sp other species can be simulated on the basis of their ecological and morphological similarity with the aforementioned species and using calibration functions the model consists of sub models for mortality competition growth regeneration and thinning and a stand structure generator growth responses to environmental drivers growing degree days annual temperature amplitude c mean air temperature c and precipitation in the growing season mm de martonne 1925 index of aridity soil moisture and site nutrient status were formalized according to kahn 1994 the model can simulate several cutting and thinning techniques typically applied in central europe fabrika and ďurský 2005 2 5 simulation scenarios 2 5 1 small tree initialization for trees smaller than 10 cm dbh no information was available however most forest models consider trees of smaller sizes in landclim from dbh 5 cm forclim and sibyla from height 1 3 m and in picus from 10 cm seedling height to allow a harmonized initialization of those models two scenarios were defined for small tree initialization i no small trees a1 table 1 ii small trees initialized using the threshold of 130 cm seedling height a2 for the latter the regeneration sub model of sibyla fabrika 2005 was employed to estimate the initial number of trees in 1963 for diameter classes not covered by the historical inventory data dbh 0 5 cm and 5 10 cm see details of the process in the supplementary material for use in all models 2 5 2 browsing by ungulates over the observation period 1963 2013 there was a considerable influence on regeneration by ungulate browsing klopcic et al 2010 because consistent browsing data was not available for each measurement period browsing intensities per species over the entire simulation period were estimated based on detailed browsing inventories carried out between 1992 and 2000 expert knowledge and historical deer census data to consider the uncertainties in browsing parameters a total of three browsing scenarios were defined b1 b2 and b3 see table 1 further details are given in table sm4 2 5 3 harvesting the historical register of harvests separately accounted for sanitary and regular logging this means that harvests included at least partly dead or near dead trees i e sanitary fellings according to internal reports from the snĕžnik region there is the tendency that in compartments with longer extraction distances less sanitary harvests are carried out due to economic reasons this poses several problems for the specification of harvested trees in the simulations to consider the potential effects of different modes of selecting trees for extraction two harvesting scenarios were implemented i only living trees harvested c1 ii in a sanitary management scenario trees that had died in the simulations in the two years preceding a planned harvest were preferably selected for harvest c2 2 6 analysis approach we compared observed basal area in 1963 with the initial state of compartments in the model simulations i e initial state 1983 except for compartment 17a that was first remeasured in 1973 for simplicity we refer to the first remeasurement date in the results as 1983 only and 2013 with simulated basal area using the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 1 r m s e i 1 9 o b s e r v e d i s i m u l a t e d i 2 9 the root mean square error represents the square root of the quadratic mean of the differences between predicted simulated and observed basal areas for the 9 forest compartments i eq 1 the rmse is always non negative where a value of 0 indicates a perfect fit to the data rmse can be related to the standard deviation of the measured values to provide a standardized index where values less than half the standard deviation may be considered low singh et al 2004 2 m e i 1 9 o b s e r v e d i s i m u l a t e d i 9 as an additional bias metric we show the mean error me eq 2 3 nse 1 i 1 9 o b s e r v e d i s i m u l a t e d i 2 i 1 9 o b s e r v e d i x o b s e r v e d 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency is a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the variance in the measured data nash and sutcliffe 1970 eq 3 nse takes on values from to 1 values close to 1 correspond to a perfect match of data and simulations nse of 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accur99ate as the mean of the observed data and values below 0 indicate that the observed mean is a better predictor than the model the denominator in eq 3 determines to some extent the calculated nse values because in the current study forest compartments were managed with an uneven aged continuous cover regime the variation of the observed basal area values was small and consequently to achieve high nse values difficult the r package hydrogof zambrano bigiarini 2017 was applied to calculate nse 4 dde 1 2 j 1 14 n o b s e r v e d j n o b s e r v e d n s i m u l a t e d j n s i m u l a t e d to compare observed and simulated dbh distributions we used the diameter distribution error dde described as total variation distance index in levin et al 2009 eq 4 where j are 14 diameter classes of 5 cm width starting at 10 cm n is the stem number per ha per diameter class and n is the total sum of trees per ha see also saad et al 2015 the sum of the differences of the relative frequency in the diameter classes is multiplied by ½ to scale the error between 0 and 100 with optimum dde at 0 dde was chosen because it is a distribution free measure that calculates the diameter distribution error independent of the total number of trees the diameter classes were the same as those in the inventory records for each compartment we calculated tree volume for the three measurement years for all trees that had died during the simulations as well as for the harvested trees in a standardized approach by using local height curves table sm2 and individual tree stem volume functions pollanschütz 1974 to compare periodic volume growth and mortality while avoiding possible biases due to biomass and volume estimation methods used by individual forest models only thurnher et al 2013 5 t o t a l g

p 2 7 simulation protocol the modeling groups jointly defined the scenario settings cf table 1 and received the same data consisting of i tree data to initialize simulation stands representing the forest compartments in 1963 ii site and soil attributes iii daily weather data for the period 1963 2013 and iv historical harvest data for the period 1963 2013 each group performed the simulation runs see table 1 and delivered the model output data in a harmonized format to the lead author who aggregated and analyzed the data tables sm1 and sm2 show site attributes available to the modeling groups and aggregated information on tree and harvesting data 3 results 3 1 forest model initialization performance total basal area of trees with dbh above 10 cm in 1963 as initialized in picus samsara2 and sibyla matched the observations very well fig 1 a rmse was 0 3 m2 ha 1 for picus 0 2 m2 ha 1 for samsara2 and 0 7 m2 ha 1 for sibyla table sm8 initial basal area in landclim showed the highest absolute deviations rmse 6 9 m2 ha 1 with lower basal area in all compartments compared with the inventory in 1963 a comparison of initial dbh distributions in the models and the inventory in 1963 revealed a similar picture fig 1b the diameter distribution errors dde for samsara2 were below 1 and for picus and forclim below 2 with one department as exception for forclim with dde over 4 dde values for sibyla were between 1 5 and 3 5 indicating good agreement with the 1963 inventory landclim had moderate dde values from 4 to 9 inspection of landclim diameter distributions revealed that most of the mismatch in diameter structure occurred in the high dbh classes 3 2 simulation of compartment development starting with the initial compartment characteristics see 3 1 above the models simulated forest development according to the scenarios in table 1 in fig 2 the simulated basal area development for each model is shown per compartment and compared to the inventory records most models slightly underestimated mean compartment basal area after 50 simulation years in 2013 forclim at 27 0 m³ha 1 samsara2 26 3 m³ ha 1 picus 26 1 m³ ha 1 and sibyla at 25 5 m³ ha 1 versus the mean inventory value of 28 4 m³ ha 1 on average landclim slightly overestimated basal area at the end of the simulation period in 2013 29 3 m³ ha 1 the mean error me over all scenarios and compartments for the models was 3 0 m³ ha 1 forclim 3 2 m³ ha 1 picus 1 6 m³ ha 1 samsara2 2 5 m³ ha 1 sibyla and 3 2 m³ ha 1 for landclim more details on simulated basal area are shown in fig 3 overall samsara2 sibyla and picus showed good model performance nse 0 5 mean rmse 5 m2 ha 1 with picus being the only model performing well in both observation periods landclim had negative nse values in both periods meaning that the mean of the observations was a better predictor than the model forclim had the worst of all observed nse values in 2013 ranging from 1 5 to 1 8 but nse was highly influenced by poor performance in compartment 17a interestingly this was the only compartment dominated by beech while in the other compartments silver fir was dominating also other models sibyla and samsara2 showed the largest deviations from the observed values in compartment 17a for the observations in 2013 it is interesting to look at the sensitivity of the models to the scenario assumptions overall the variation in model output as triggered by scenario a initialization and b browsing was smallest for landclim 2 of the mean result and largest for samsara2 8 relative range in output for forclim picus and sybila was approx 4 to 6 fig 4 adding scenarios c harvesting mode increased the variation to 24 samsara2 11 picus and 6 sybila of the mean output see also figure sm1 and table sm8 comparing simulated and observed diameter distributions at different time points is a rigorous test of the ability of the models to project forest structure over the 50 year period both in 1983 and 2013 landclim showed the largest mean dde value 23 6 69 8 and forclim the lowest 13 7 29 8 with sybila samsara2 and picus having similar dde values as forclim for all models dde increased from 1983 to 2013 fig 5 what was the scenario that produced the best outcome with each of the five models to answer this question the mean nse and rmse related to basal area over the entire simulation period were calculated for each simulation scenario and for each model the scenario with the maximum nse was selected as best scenario table sm6 in a similar procedure mean dde statistics were calculated for the entire simulation period and the scenario with the lowest dde per model was selected table sm6 regarding the simulated diameter distributions scenario a2 which included small trees in the initialization resulted in more accurate simulated diameter distributions for all models the scenario assumptions that produced the best overall match with regard to basal area differed among the five models while for forclim and landclim no browsing b1 combined with sanitary management c2 produced better results for picus samsara2 and sibyla the browsing pressure as observed in 2013 b2 in combination with sanitary management c2 resulted in more accurate results for all models the two error statistics nse and rmse consistently ranked the same scenario at the top 3 3 realization of harvests according to the harvest records the compartments were treated regularly in an interval of 10 to 20 years moreover in some compartments sanitation logging occurred almost every year e g several operations in compartment 40c between 1985 and 1990 or in compartment 2c in the years 1980 to 1995 see fig 2 when comparing the diameter structure of simulated harvests with the records all models except landclim performed well not shown with sybila showing the best match of simulated and observed diameter distribution of harvested trees for all models deviations occurred mainly in the smaller diameter classes below 20 cm dbh 3 4 total volume production utilizing the harvest records the periodic harvest volumes harvest can be calculated for the historical period while tree mortality which has not been extracted and thus is not included in harvest is not known consequently no observed total growth could be calculated for the nine study compartments however for comparison we could retrieve the local total mean annual volume growth from forest management plans about 9 m3 ha 1 yr 1 this general estimate can be compared with total growth according to eq 4 for each model simulation from fig 6 it is evident that there are differences among the models compared with the local estimate forclim samsara2 and sibyla simulated somewhat lower total growth 5 6 7 0 7 1 m3ha 1yr 1 landclim is clearly overestimating 15 7 m3ha 1yr 1 and picus is closest to the reference value of 9 m3ha 1yr 1 8 4 m3ha 1yr 1 samsara2 and sibyla reproduced the recorded harvest volumes accurately picus and forclim show only minor underestimates whereas landclim clearly overestimated harvests large differences between the models are visible regarding mortality here forclim samsara2 and sibyla clearly simulated much lower tree mortality forclim 0 9 m3ha 1yr 1 samsara2 1 3 m3ha 1yr 1 and siblya 2 2 m3ha 1yr 1 than landclim 5 1 m3ha 1yr 1 and picus 3 9 m3ha 1yr 1 the effect of the sanitary management scheme causing a shift of volume from mortality to harvest is small details for both inventory periods are shown in table sm7 4 discussion 4 1 assessment approach one major challenge for increasing the acceptance of simulation tools for decision support is the objective validation of models to build trust in the validity of model output muys et al 2011 multi model evaluation exercises offer a great opportunity to compare detailed model outputs and point out differences strengths and deficiencies recently studies have started to quantify parametric uncertainty hartig et al 2012 and some results exist on the contributions of model sub processes to overall parametric uncertainty augustynczik et al 2017 but the quantification of structural uncertainty is less advanced a prerequisite for multi model evaluation studies is that the participating model groups are provided with identical site stand and climate information and follow a harmonized protocol that avoids specific fitting of model settings to local conditions in a comparative analysis of 15 forest models with regard to model sensitivity to different tree mortality algorithms bugmann et al 2019 refrained from having all participating models run under identical conditions however this approach adds another source of uncertainty and makes it even harder to track those model sub processes that contribute most to the variation in model output and to respond to the question of why a specific model does better or worse in a specific situation the historical long term compartment based dataset in combination with management records as used in this study offered great potential to test models in species rich forest ecosystems in realistic management contexts inventories carried out by forest enterprises usually do not fulfill the criteria for long term model evaluation exercises here the focus usually lies on cost efficiency and less on continuous long term datasets methodologies usually switched from full calipering of trees over wide forest areas to statistically more advanced and less cost intensive sampling methods starting from the 1950s onwards as a result continuous datasets consisting of tree data with sufficient sampling densities over a long time period are very scarce the tree and harvest data from the presented case study cover a remarkably long period of 50 years they represent entire compartments and are thus better representatives of real forests compared to small plots of large scale forest inventories see huber et al 2013 however to fully understand forest development in the nine compartments information on tree mortality stand structural information and tree regeneration would be essential in an attempt to frame sources of uncertainty in the evaluation data 12 scenarios were defined to specify explicit assumptions on the initial state of regeneration browsing pressure by ungulates over the monitoring period and the inclusion of tree mortality in harvesting decisions table 1 what could be considered a weakness of the evaluation data was turned into a strength of the assessment approach because it added rigor to the comparison of model output and observations it also facilitated analysis of the sensitivity of the models to assumptions that have to be made quite often when data and model input from decades ago are used 4 2 model initialization a first crucial step in practical model applications is to initialize stand structures from available information to our knowledge the ability of models to create realistic initial tree populations has not been considered before all models involved in this study include special routines for initialization to avoid stand structures that are not compatible with internal processes dealing with competition for resources and space and may therefore result in undesired behavior of simulated tree populations especially in the first simulation years see supplementary material generally these routines are most important for complex forest stands with high tree density vertical tree layers diverse species mixtures many size classes and patchy spatial structure in the model sibyla for example the models internal consistency of the virtual tree population is evaluated by estimating the suitability of the tree positions according to the nearest and second nearest neighbor trees using a probabilistic approach pretzsch 1993 for rejected trees new coordinates are generated until microstructural requirements are fulfilled the picus model operates in a similar way within its 10 10 m resolution to avoid the initialization of non viable tree neighborhoods the gap model forclim uses an algorithm to optimize the leaf area of virtual trees to avoid excessive shading samsara2 avoids initialization problems by using a uniform distribution for estimating coordinates which may visually result in very regular stand structures in landclim compartments are initialized spatially explicit at the level of the simulation cells 25 by 25 m the effort that has been put into generating realistic initial forest states shows that although so far not much attention has been paid to this issue i creating realistic tree population structures may have crucial implications for simulated short to midterm population behavior and ii indicates the relevance of structural information and tree coordinates see table sm3 for instance picus samsara2 and sibyla could have directly utilized tree coordinates for initializing forest stands all models except landclim were able to generate realistic forests regarding basal area density and diameter structure compare fig 1 and table sm8 for an overview the landscape model landclim which had not been developed to simulate fine grained tree populations at population level initialized forests with substantially lower basal area compared to observations and also did not match well the initial diameter structure of the validation data set 4 3 forest simulation results in simulating managed mixed mountain forests over five decades beyond growth regeneration and mortality of trees also harvests and the response of tree populations to these human disturbances need to be mimicked realistically the results showed that spatially explicit individual tree based models performed better in simulating basal area development than the non spatial gap model forclim and not surprisingly the landscape model landclim overall the best performing models in our study yielded rmse values for basal area over a simulation period of 50 years which are about 10 to 12 of the compartment basal area this simulation result is comparable to the range of basal area mean error values from large scale forest inventories e g næsset 2007 the mean error me values over all scenarios indicated that all models on average underestimated the observed basal area values by about 10 of the mean observed values except the landclim model which yielded a slightly larger positive bias an even greater challenge for forest models is to capture the development of the size structure of the tree population with the exception of landclim all models performed reasonably well furthermore the study did not confirm two general beliefs first and interestingly empirical models sybila samsara2 did not perform significantly better regarding the accurate prediction of dbh structure than the process based models forclim and picus compare guisan and zimmermann 2000 fontes et al 2011 a similar finding for the picus model had already been reported in seidl et al 2005 second none of the models had been developed for dinaric mountain forests as the model evaluation protocol avoided the calibration of the tested models to local tree growth data the expectations towards accurate model results in simulating 50 years of tree growth were low however the stand level models performed reasonable compare fig 7 the spatially explicit models picus samsara2 and sybila performed overall better than the non spatial gap model forclim and showed very concordant results on the other hand forclim showed the best performance regarding the diameter distributions the current study clearly showed that a model should perform well in a series of aspects beyond tree growth that drive forest development over the 50 year simulation period the interacting processes tree growth regeneration mortality and tree selection and harvesting determine the standing stock as well as the dbh distribution at a specific point in time hülsmann et al 2018 point out that mortality subroutines in forest models are typically rather fundamental and lack empirical basis in a recent study bugmann et al 2019 concluded that the sensitivity of forest models to changes in mortality algorithms is larger than the sensitivity to climate change signals unfortunately the testing data used for our study did not include tree mortality the extent to which harvests included a share of natural tree mortality was also not known however the scenarios c1 harvests include only living trees and c2 sanitary management harvests also include dead trees allowed to estimate the effect of the underlying assumptions our results showed that a seemingly simple process such as harvesting trees might produce quite different results among the models all models except landclim could handle harvest prescriptions on an annual basis however harvest algorithms within the models differ in the way they handle tree removals in specific dbh classes some algorithms search for specific trees size and species in the simulated forest as differences between observed and simulated dbh structures increase with increasing simulation length more flexible algorithms e g trees may be taken from neighboring dbh classes may be beneficial especially for very detailed harvest operations such as single tree or sanitary management records mina et al 2017 our results indicated that harvest algorithms incorporating multiple criteria such as basal area tree diameter and diameter distributions can improve overall modeling accuracy lafond et al 2012 the importance of consistently considering natural tree mortality in harvest algorithms will even increase with increasing relevance of disturbances in future climates seidl and rammer 2017 framing the uncertainty in the evaluation data initialization of small trees browsing by ungulates tree selection for harvesting by means of 12 scenarios proved to be an adequate approach to i consider data uncertainty and ii test the sensitivity of the models towards the scenario assumptions see figure sm1 and tables sm5 and sm6 it was interesting to note that the browsing scenarios b1 b2 b3 had a strong influence on the predictions and were predominantly affecting diameter structures whereas basal area was less affected samsara2 seemed to be particularly sensitive to the harvesting assumptions what is a useful threshold for model sensitivity this question cannot be answered easily as a general rule the sensitivity of a model to a driving gradient must allow to reproduce observable data along the gradient e g lexer and hönninger 2004 interestingly the average variation caused by the full set of scenarios as simulated by samsara2 picus and sibyla is approximately in the same order of magnitude as the error in basal area or volume estimates of large scale forest inventories landclim the only landscape model included in the comparison set delivered satisfactory estimates of basal area development per compartment though it operates on coarser resolutions regarding initialization management and growth simulation and was designed to simulate landscape level disturbances and processes that were not the focus of this study the advantage of landscape models is that they can be used to complement stand level models to explore forest development at multiple spatial scales from stand to landscape scale which is gaining importance with growing confidence that disturbance regimes will intensify under a warming climate interacting disturbance agents operate at multiple spatial scales which is beyond the reach of stand level models e g elkin et al 2013 hlásny et al 2019 5 conclusions several conclusions can be drawn from this study first a strong effort should be made by research institutes and forest owners to access and store historical inventory datasets and harmonize contemporary inventories with historical data to be able to capitalize on the benefits of a long consistent time series in particular detailed harvest records are crucial to understand time series data of stocks which are the usual monitoring focus knowing harvested trees by tree species and by status live dead would be a huge leap forward for further development and testing of forest ecosystem models second there is no clear hierarchy between more empirical or more process based models regarding the accuracy of stand development projections third individual based models are more precise for stand level predictions than the tested landscape model landclim but the latter performed reasonably well at the stand scale qualifying it for a complementary application at the landscape scale this serves as a great example for a finding from a model intercomparison study where the ultimate goal is not that every contestant shows excellent performance regarding standard outputs more important is a critical comparison between models to differentiate why certain models are better under specific conditions observed in the case study for specific outputs following a detailed description of underlying model assumptions and objective evaluation of outputs recommendations can then be given regarding the specific applicability of models and their limitations however model performance demonstrated in a specific ecological and management setting should not be generalized carelessly to diverging conditions repeated successful model evaluation experiments in different settings will build trust in model performance fourth in model evaluation studies a comprehensive set of model output variables should be assessed there is a fast growing demand by decision makers for reliable prediction of stand structural features beyond volume or basal area because for forest management planning ecosystem service provisioning is based on indicators on species composition and structure of the tree population e g maroschek et al 2015 the current study has shown that there are forest models available that qualify for forest management decision support fifth as a very relevant mission joint model intercomparison and evaluation studies compare currently available ecosystem models by challenging them with applications in novel case study settings and foster scientific collaboration among the modeling groups this prepares the ground for multi model applications in decision support

24651,forest ecosystem models being widespread science tools and used for forest management decision support are usually evaluated individually against field data sets while model intercomparison and joint evaluation studies are rare we tested five forest models according to a harmonized protocol against data from nine forest compartments in the snĕžnik region in slovenia the suite of models included stand and landscape scale empirical and process based models used across europe the test dataset originated from inventory data covering 50 years tree measurements 1963 1983 and 2013 and included annual harvesting records at tree level uncertainties in data and forest conditions were considered by defining 12 scenarios varying initial regeneration browsing pressure and harvest modalities we evaluated the models ability to initialize forest conditions accurately whether management interventions could be implemented based on harvest records and how well basal area and diameter structure could be predicted simulation results for basal area development showed good to satisfactory performance for all models at which samsara2 sibyla and picus showed the best agreement comparison of simulated and observed diameter distributions showed good performance of forclim picus samsara2 and sibyla model output variability was between 6 and 24 indicating the relevance to consider uncertainties that can be attributed to specific sources there was no clear hierarchy between more empirical or more process based models regarding accuracy of stand development projections the cohort based landscape model landclim showed the lowest stand level accuracy and scenario sensitivity but results nevertheless qualified it for complementary application at landscape scale within individual based models spatially explicit models seemed to be more suitable for heterogeneous mixed mountain forests the findings demonstrated the usefulness of inventory datasets for model testing and intercomparison keywords model intercomparison tree growth tree mortality forest management ungulate browsing forest inventory data 1 introduction forest simulation models are powerful tools for testing and evaluating the mid to long term implications of different management strategies on future forest development and related ecosystem service provisioning söderbergh and ledermann 2003 schelhaas et al 2014 changing environmental conditions and intensifying disturbance regimes e g seidl et al 2011 temperli et al 2013 have increased the complexity in forest resource planning and management and consequently the role of model based decision support has drawn a lot of attention recently muys et al 2011 linkevičius et al 2019 one response to this growing challenge has been an increased reliance on forest simulation models which are potentially climate sensitive and allow for alternative and novel forest management strategies to be evaluated concomitantly there has also been an increase in testing the benefits limits and credibility of forest models courbaud et al 2015 foster et al 2017 model evaluation studies are required to build trust and confidence in model outputs and are thus a prerequisite for any model application in practical decision support in view of growing interest in complex forest structures multi species mixtures the provisioning of various ecosystem services beyond timber production and the need to consider the effects of a changing climate the demands being placed on forest models have grown considerably over the recent years silvicultural regimes that have been proposed to adapt forests to climate change often focus on small scale silvicultural measures and the creation of heterogeneous stand conditions to foster forest resilience christensen 1997 puettmann et al 2009 adequately representing these forest structures and the underlying ecosystem processes that generate them requires individual based climate sensitive forest modeling approaches that allow the simulation of complex silvicultural tree selection and cutting patterns söderbergh and ledermann 2003 grimm et al 2005 mina et al 2017 from the perspective of a potential model user it can be difficult to decide what the appropriate model for a specific task and location should be based on its original theoretical concept the reason is that many models being scientific tools under permanent development rather than ready products are continuously refined extended or hybridized with other models larocque et al 2011 therefore to identify strengths and weaknesses of different models intercomparison studies are recommended huber et al 2013 where multiple models are tested within a harmonized framework against independent observational data while model comparison studies are frequently published for carbon and water flux models e g ryan et al 1996 hanson et al 2004 jin et al 2016 thurner et al 2017 multi model evaluation studies for forest ecosystem models are rare for instance badeck et al 2001 tested six gap models against observed structure and species composition of a virgin forest other studies comparing models originating from the same region have been published by härkönen et al 2010 huber et al 2013 and mccullagh et al 2017 recently bugmann et al 2019 compared the behavior of mortality algorithms implemented in several forest models however studies comparing forest models that originate from different countries and different ecological and management contexts against long term observational data sets from managed forests are rare but see e g mäkelä et al 2000 lindner et al 2005 consistent data sets from managed multi species forests that extend over several decades are rare particularly when tree level data are required usually data from silvicultural experiments are utilized for this purpose mäkelä et al 2000 yaussy 2000 lindner et al 2005 seidl et al 2005 when long term observational data are used for a model evaluation study the issue of information quality arises gadow 2000 historical data from decades ago may be subject to uncertainty with regard to accuracy of measurements and there may be gaps with regard to tree species specific information and unknown calipering thresholds moreover usually no information about tree positions forest structure or spatial species mixture types is available the timing of harvests as well as the composition of harvested volume species dead and alive trees may also not be known exactly given the relevance of legacies for future forest development erroneous initial forest conditions may propagate over time and increase uncertainty which limits the power of model evaluation studies in the fp7 project arange http www arange project eu several forest models originally developed for different european forest types and representing different conceptual modeling approaches were employed to explore management alternatives for mountain forests in major european mountain ranges bugmann et al 2017 in addition multi decade forest inventory data from the dinaric mountains in slovenia were available within the project consortium this setting provided the opportunity to compare five established models in a model intercomparison study specific questions of the study were 1 how well can forest models be initialized with historical inventory data 2 how well can forest models implement historical management schemes derived from harvest records 3 how well do observed stand trajectories and model simulations match with regard to volume basal area and diameter structure 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the observational time series data comes from an area near the snĕžnik mountain 1796 m a s l in the northern part of the dinaric mountains slovenia europe the snĕžnik area is a karst limestone plateau transformed in the last glacial period the soils are mainly chromic cambisols and rendzic leptosols the climate in the northern dinaric mountains has mediterranean influences with warm summer temperatures long term mean from july to august is 18 3 c at 800 m a s l and 14 9 c at 1300 m a s l and low winter temperatures mean january temperatures 0 6 c to 4 1 c mean annual temperature ranges from 6 8 c at 800 m to 3 1 c at 1300 m with annual precipitation between 1670 mm and 1930 mm respectively mean summer precipitation may to september ranges from 650 to 740 mm the upper timberline is located at approximately 1550 m mountainous silver fir abies alba mill european beech fagus sylvatica l norway spruce picea abies karst forests are the prevailing natural forest type with frequent occurrence of sycamore maple acer pseudoplatanus l and wych elm ulmus glabra huds while small leaved lime tilia cordata mill rowan sorbus aucuparia l common whitebeam sorbus aria l crantz yew taxus baccata l and some other species can also be found sporadically the first major regular utilization of these forests started in the second half of the 19th century when silver fir was promoted while in line with the economic principles of that time beech was weeded out and used for charcoal and potash production and wood distillation perko 2002 at the beginning of the 20th century an uneven aged single stem selection system i e plenter system was introduced schollmayer 1906 due to a noticeable decrease in fir vitality and its insufficient regeneration and recruitment klopcic et al 2010 a combination of single stem and small scale irregular shelterwood system was introduced in the 1960s afterwards it was adapted to a more flexible site and stand specific continuous cover system labeled free style silviculture combining elements of single stem selection irregular shelterwood and shelterwood approaches which has been applied since then mlinsek 1968 boncina 2011 within the sneznik area a set of nine compartments with a total area of 60 0 ha was chosen for the model evaluation study the sites are located apart from each other on elevations between 800 m to 1300 m a s l 2 2 forest inventory dataset along with the introduction of uneven aged forest management at the beginning of the 20th century a permanent division of forests into compartments was established and since 1912 eight forest inventories have been conducted before 1973 inventories were implemented by fully callipering the compartments in 1973 and 1983 inventories were executed as full callipering of a sample of compartments while in 1993 permanent sample plots were established and used since then the full callipering data were available from inventories in 1963 and a follow up measurement in 1973 compartment 17a or 1983 all other compartments due to low sampling densities in the 1993 and 2003 inventories this data could not be utilized to calculate reliable values for individual compartments thus for the current study an angle count sampling inventory bitterlich 1952 was conducted in 2013 on a 50 50 m grid to gather data compatible with the historical surveys in 1963 1973 and 1983 thus compartment polygons did not change throughout the observation period starting in 1963 from all inventories stem numbers per hectare were available per tree species in 5 cm dbh diameter at breast height classes starting at 10 cm dbh only live trees were recorded in the inventories for details about the nine study compartments see table sm1 depending on the site index two sets of height functions relating tree height to dbh for individual species were assigned to the compartments to calculate initial tree height in 1963 table sm2 starting in 1963 a historical register of annual harvests per compartment was available documenting the harvests in 5 cm dbh classes table sm1 presents selected information about the harvesting activities in the forest compartments 2 3 climate data the forest models require daily or monthly climate data to drive the simulations see table sm3 for each of the nine forest compartments a daily time series of climate data covering the period 1963 2013 was prepared based on the nearest grid cell lat 45 625 long 14 375 of the e obs data set van den besselaar et al 2011 the mt clim routines running et al 1987 thornton and running 1999 were used to adjust the e obs climate record for elevation slope and aspect of the nine sites and to estimate incoming global radiation of the daylight period and vapor pressure deficit see thornton et al 2000 2 4 forest models the five models were the gap model forclim bugmann 1996 the landscape model landclim schumacher et al 2004 the hybrid 3d patch model picus hönninger and lexer 2001 seidl et al 2005 and the spatially explicit empirical models samsara2 courbaud et al 2015 and sibyla fabrika 2005 the models are briefly introduced and their key features summarized in table sm3 for detailed descriptions we refer to the original sources 2 4 1 forclim forclim is a climate sensitive forest succession gap model that has been developed to simulate forest dynamics over a wide range of environmental conditions bugmann 1994 the model simulates establishment growth and mortality of individual trees on small independent patches using a minimum of ecological assumptions to capture the influence of climate and ecological processes on forest dynamics bugmann 1996 didion et al 2009b forclim is structured into four sub models weather water plant and management the plant sub model is the core of forclim where establishment and growth of tree cohorts i e trees of the same species and age are simulated based on light availability soil nutrients browsing intensity and bioclimatic indices calculated within the sub models weather and water tree mortality is modeled as a combination of constant background mortality and a stress induced component the management sub model enables the simulation of a wide range of silvicultural treatments such as clearcutting shelterwood thinning planting and others in this study we applied forclim version 3 0 rasche et al 2011 complemented by an empirical harvesting algorithm for simulating removals of an exact number of stems for every tree species by diameter class single stem removal see description in mina et al 2017 forclim is currently parameterized for 31 european tree species and has been tested for the representation of natural forest dynamics of temperate forests of the northern hemisphere e g didion et al 2009a 2 4 2 landclim landclim is a process based forest landscape model schumacher et al 2004 schumacher et al 2006 designed to simulate forest dynamics and disturbances at large spatial scales 103 to 106 ha over long periods of time hundreds to thousands of years in landclim landscapes are represented as a 25 25 m grid with specific topographic and climatic input variables for each cell within each cell a simplified forest gap model bugmann 2001 simulates establishment growth competition and mortality of trees on an annual time step similar to forclim trees are simulated using a cohort approach i e a computational simplification where one representative individual is simulated for all trees of the same species and age within a cell bugmann 1996 tree growth is simulated using a logistic growth equation where species specific maximum growth rate and size are reduced by light availability degree day sum and a drought index schumacher et al 2004 establishment and mortality are stochastic processes each year the potential for tree establishment is determined as a function of environmental filters i e available light at the forest floor minimum winter temperature growing degree day sum drought index and browsing mortality probability is determined as a combination of stress density dependent and intrinsic mortality landclim can simulate management in 10 year intervals on defined management areas by selecting and removing a percentage of trees fulfilling specified dbh constraints the model has been tested and adapted to the european alps briner et al 2013 elkin et al 2013 temperli et al 2013 north american rocky mountains schumacher et al 2006 schwörer et al 2016 and mediterranean forests henne et al 2015 for this study the individual compartments were simulated in landclim as independent entities without landscape level interactions among them to produce results comparable to the stand level models 2 4 3 picus the forest model picus version 1 5 lexer and hönninger 2001 seidl et al 2005 irauschek et al 2017a henceforth referred to as picus is a hybrid of classical gap model components and process based stand level npp algorithms landsberg and waring 1997 the spatial core structure of picus is an array of 10 10 m patches with vertical crown cells of 5 m in height interactions between patches are considered via a three dimensional light model and spatially explicit seed dispersal stand level npp is estimated with a model of light use efficiency landsberg and waring 1997 which depends on intercepted radiation temperature precipitation vapor pressure deficit soil water and nutrient supply distribution of assimilates to individual trees is based on the relative competitive success of the individual trees tree mortality depends on age and stress conditions natural tree regeneration considers seed production and distribution germination and establishment up to the height of 130 cm seedlings are simulated with a height class approach beyond that threshold they are considered as individuals in the tree population irauschek et al 2017b picus includes a flexible management module enabling the implementation of silvicultural treatments at tree level depending on tree attributes and patch location the model includes 17 parameterized tree species and has been validated seidl et al 2005 didion et al 2009a and applied in numerous studies all over europe lexer et al 2002 maroschek et al 2015 pardos et al 2015 zlatanov et al 2017 2 4 4 samsara2 samsara2 is an individual based and spatially explicit model to simulate regeneration growth and mortality of individual trees in mixed and uneven aged mountain forest stands courbaud et al 2015 the model builds on the theory that light interception by tree crowns is a key driver in uneven aged stands because they present a strong vertical heterogeneity favoring asymmetric competition between trees and between the canopy and seedlings in samsara2 competition for light within a stand is calculated based on light ray interception by tree crowns samsara2 has been calibrated empirically for silver fir and norway spruce stands within the montane elevation belt of the alps in france ecological factors other than light such as climate and site conditions are not directly taken into account fertility of the site is taken into account indirectly through the value of the different demographic parameters according to courbaud et al 2015 the model should be recalibrated if applied under different site conditions annual diameter increment of individual trees depends on their size and the amount of light intercepted by their crown during the growing season natural mortality depends on tree diameter and a competition index defined as the basal area of larger trees within a radius of 15 m seeds are produced by adult trees and germination growth and survival of seedlings depend on the light reaching the ground calculated in the center of 25 m2 cells trees participate in light interception above dbh of 7 5 cm specific management algorithms allow the simulation of detailed silvicultural strategies varying both the characteristics of harvested trees and their spatial arrangement within a stand lafond et al 2012 lafond et al 2014 2 4 5 sibyla the sibyla model fabrika 2005 is based on the silva simulator pretzsch et al 2002 it is an empirical distance dependent ecological niche based model that simulates the growth of individual trees the expected height increment is estimated from the potential height increment of the tree and a multiplier which characterizes the effects of competition soil and climatic conditions see pretzsch and kahn 1998 sibyla was parameterized and validated using forest inventory data from germany switzerland and slovakia the model is parameterized for five main european forest tree species norway spruce silver fir scots pine european beech and oak quercus sp other species can be simulated on the basis of their ecological and morphological similarity with the aforementioned species and using calibration functions the model consists of sub models for mortality competition growth regeneration and thinning and a stand structure generator growth responses to environmental drivers growing degree days annual temperature amplitude c mean air temperature c and precipitation in the growing season mm de martonne 1925 index of aridity soil moisture and site nutrient status were formalized according to kahn 1994 the model can simulate several cutting and thinning techniques typically applied in central europe fabrika and ďurský 2005 2 5 simulation scenarios 2 5 1 small tree initialization for trees smaller than 10 cm dbh no information was available however most forest models consider trees of smaller sizes in landclim from dbh 5 cm forclim and sibyla from height 1 3 m and in picus from 10 cm seedling height to allow a harmonized initialization of those models two scenarios were defined for small tree initialization i no small trees a1 table 1 ii small trees initialized using the threshold of 130 cm seedling height a2 for the latter the regeneration sub model of sibyla fabrika 2005 was employed to estimate the initial number of trees in 1963 for diameter classes not covered by the historical inventory data dbh 0 5 cm and 5 10 cm see details of the process in the supplementary material for use in all models 2 5 2 browsing by ungulates over the observation period 1963 2013 there was a considerable influence on regeneration by ungulate browsing klopcic et al 2010 because consistent browsing data was not available for each measurement period browsing intensities per species over the entire simulation period were estimated based on detailed browsing inventories carried out between 1992 and 2000 expert knowledge and historical deer census data to consider the uncertainties in browsing parameters a total of three browsing scenarios were defined b1 b2 and b3 see table 1 further details are given in table sm4 2 5 3 harvesting the historical register of harvests separately accounted for sanitary and regular logging this means that harvests included at least partly dead or near dead trees i e sanitary fellings according to internal reports from the snĕžnik region there is the tendency that in compartments with longer extraction distances less sanitary harvests are carried out due to economic reasons this poses several problems for the specification of harvested trees in the simulations to consider the potential effects of different modes of selecting trees for extraction two harvesting scenarios were implemented i only living trees harvested c1 ii in a sanitary management scenario trees that had died in the simulations in the two years preceding a planned harvest were preferably selected for harvest c2 2 6 analysis approach we compared observed basal area in 1963 with the initial state of compartments in the model simulations i e initial state 1983 except for compartment 17a that was first remeasured in 1973 for simplicity we refer to the first remeasurement date in the results as 1983 only and 2013 with simulated basal area using the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 1 r m s e i 1 9 o b s e r v e d i s i m u l a t e d i 2 9 the root mean square error represents the square root of the quadratic mean of the differences between predicted simulated and observed basal areas for the 9 forest compartments i eq 1 the rmse is always non negative where a value of 0 indicates a perfect fit to the data rmse can be related to the standard deviation of the measured values to provide a standardized index where values less than half the standard deviation may be considered low singh et al 2004 2 m e i 1 9 o b s e r v e d i s i m u l a t e d i 9 as an additional bias metric we show the mean error me eq 2 3 nse 1 i 1 9 o b s e r v e d i s i m u l a t e d i 2 i 1 9 o b s e r v e d i x o b s e r v e d 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency is a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the variance in the measured data nash and sutcliffe 1970 eq 3 nse takes on values from to 1 values close to 1 correspond to a perfect match of data and simulations nse of 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accur99ate as the mean of the observed data and values below 0 indicate that the observed mean is a better predictor than the model the denominator in eq 3 determines to some extent the calculated nse values because in the current study forest compartments were managed with an uneven aged continuous cover regime the variation of the observed basal area values was small and consequently to achieve high nse values difficult the r package hydrogof zambrano bigiarini 2017 was applied to calculate nse 4 dde 1 2 j 1 14 n o b s e r v e d j n o b s e r v e d n s i m u l a t e d j n s i m u l a t e d to compare observed and simulated dbh distributions we used the diameter distribution error dde described as total variation distance index in levin et al 2009 eq 4 where j are 14 diameter classes of 5 cm width starting at 10 cm n is the stem number per ha per diameter class and n is the total sum of trees per ha see also saad et al 2015 the sum of the differences of the relative frequency in the diameter classes is multiplied by ½ to scale the error between 0 and 100 with optimum dde at 0 dde was chosen because it is a distribution free measure that calculates the diameter distribution error independent of the total number of trees the diameter classes were the same as those in the inventory records for each compartment we calculated tree volume for the three measurement years for all trees that had died during the simulations as well as for the harvested trees in a standardized approach by using local height curves table sm2 and individual tree stem volume functions pollanschütz 1974 to compare periodic volume growth and mortality while avoiding possible biases due to biomass and volume estimation methods used by individual forest models only thurnher et al 2013 5 t o t a l g

forest compartments in 1963 ii site and soil attributes iii daily weather data for the period 1963 2013 and iv historical harvest data for the period 1963 2013 each group performed the simulation runs see table 1 and delivered the model output data in a harmonized format to the lead author who aggregated and analyzed the data tables sm1 and sm2 show site attributes available to the modeling groups and aggregated information on tree and harvesting data 3 results 3 1 forest model initialization performance total basal area of trees with dbh above 10 cm in 1963 as initialized in picus samsara2 and sibyla matched the observations very well fig 1 a rmse was 0 3 m2 ha 1 for picus 0 2 m2 ha 1 for samsara2 and 0 7 m2 ha 1 for sibyla table sm8 initial basal area in landclim showed the highest absolute deviations rmse 6 9 m2 ha 1 with lower basal area in all compartments compared with the inventory in 1963 a comparison of initial dbh distributions in the models and the inventory in 1963 revealed a similar picture fig 1b the diameter distribution errors dde for samsara2 were below 1 and for picus and forclim below 2 with one department as exception for forclim with dde over 4 dde values for sibyla were between 1 5 and 3 5 indicating good agreement with the 1963 inventory landclim had moderate dde values from 4 to 9 inspection of landclim diameter distributions revealed that most of the mismatch in diameter structure occurred in the high dbh classes 3 2 simulation of compartment development starting with the initial compartment characteristics see 3 1 above the models simulated forest development according to the scenarios in table 1 in fig 2 the simulated basal area development for each model is shown per compartment and compared to the inventory records most models slightly underestimated mean compartment basal area after 50 simulation years in 2013 forclim at 27 0 m³ha 1 samsara2 26 3 m³ ha 1 picus 26 1 m³ ha 1 and sibyla at 25 5 m³ ha 1 versus the mean inventory value of 28 4 m³ ha 1 on average landclim slightly overestimated basal area at the end of the simulation period in 2013 29 3 m³ ha 1 the mean error me over all scenarios and compartments for the models was 3 0 m³ ha 1 forclim 3 2 m³ ha 1 picus 1 6 m³ ha 1 samsara2 2 5 m³ ha 1 sibyla and 3 2 m³ ha 1 for landclim more details on simulated basal area are shown in fig 3 overall samsara2 sibyla and picus showed good model performance nse 0 5 mean rmse 5 m2 ha 1 with picus being the only model performing well in both observation periods landclim had negative nse values in both periods meaning that the mean of the observations was a better predictor than the model forclim had the worst of all observed nse values in 2013 ranging from 1 5 to 1 8 but nse was highly influenced by poor performance in compartment 17a interestingly this was the only compartment dominated by beech while in the other compartments silver fir was dominating also other models sibyla and samsara2 showed the largest deviations from the observed values in compartment 17a for the observations in 2013 it is interesting to look at the sensitivity of the models to the scenario assumptions overall the variation in model output as triggered by scenario a initialization and b browsing was smallest for landclim 2 of the mean result and largest for samsara2 8 relative range in output for forclim picus and sybila was approx 4 to 6 fig 4 adding scenarios c harvesting mode increased the variation to 24 samsara2 11 picus and 6 sybila of the mean output see also figure sm1 and table sm8 comparing simulated and observed diameter distributions at different time points is a rigorous test of the ability of the models to project forest structure over the 50 year period both in 1983 and 2013 landclim showed the largest mean dde value 23 6 69 8 and forclim the lowest 13 7 29 8 with sybila samsara2 and picus having similar dde values as forclim for all models dde increased from 1983 to 2013 fig 5 what was the scenario that produced the best outcome with each of the five models to answer this question the mean nse and rmse related to basal area over the entire simulation period were calculated for each simulation scenario and for each model the scenario with the maximum nse was selected as best scenario table sm6 in a similar procedure mean dde statistics were calculated for the entire simulation period and the scenario with the lowest dde per model was selected table sm6 regarding the simulated diameter distributions scenario a2 which included small trees in the initialization resulted in more accurate simulated diameter distributions for all models the scenario assumptions that produced the best overall match with regard to basal area differed among the five models while for forclim and landclim no browsing b1 combined with sanitary management c2 produced better results for picus samsara2 and sibyla the browsing pressure as observed in 2013 b2 in combination with sanitary management c2 resulted in more accurate results for all models the two error statistics nse and rmse consistently ranked the same scenario at the top 3 3 realization of harvests according to the harvest records the compartments were treated regularly in an interval of 10 to 20 years moreover in some compartments sanitation logging occurred almost every year e g several operations in compartment 40c between 1985 and 1990 or in compartment 2c in the years 1980 to 1995 see fig 2 when comparing the diameter structure of simulated harvests with the records all models except landclim performed well not shown with sybila showing the best match of simulated and observed diameter distribution of harvested trees for all models deviations occurred mainly in the smaller diameter classes below 20 cm dbh 3 4 total volume production utilizing the harvest records the periodic harvest volumes harvest can be calculated for the historical period while tree mortality which has not been extracted and thus is not included in harvest is not known consequently no observed total growth could be calculated for the nine study compartments however for comparison we could retrieve the local total mean annual volume growth from forest management plans about 9 m3 ha 1 yr 1 this general estimate can be compared with total growth according to eq 4 for each model simulation from fig 6 it is evident that there are differences among the models compared with the local estimate forclim samsara2 and sibyla simulated somewhat lower total growth 5 6 7 0 7 1 m3ha 1yr 1 landclim is clearly overestimating 15 7 m3ha 1yr 1 and picus is closest to the reference value of 9 m3ha 1yr 1 8 4 m3ha 1yr 1 samsara2 and sibyla reproduced the recorded harvest volumes accurately picus and forclim show only minor underestimates whereas landclim clearly overestimated harvests large differences between the models are visible regarding mortality here forclim samsara2 and sibyla clearly simulated much lower tree mortality forclim 0 9 m3ha 1yr 1 samsara2 1 3 m3ha 1yr 1 and siblya 2 2 m3ha 1yr 1 than landclim 5 1 m3ha 1yr 1 and picus 3 9 m3ha 1yr 1 the effect of the sanitary management scheme causing a shift of volume from mortality to harvest is small details for both inventory periods are shown in table sm7 4 discussion 4 1 assessment approach one major challenge for increasing the acceptance of simulation tools for decision support is the objective validation of models to build trust in the validity of model output muys et al 2011 multi model evaluation exercises offer a great opportunity to compare detailed model outputs and point out differences strengths and deficiencies recently studies have started to quantify parametric uncertainty hartig et al 2012 and some results exist on the contributions of model sub processes to overall parametric uncertainty augustynczik et al 2017 but the quantification of structural uncertainty is less advanced a prerequisite for multi model evaluation studies is that the participating model groups are provided with identical site stand and climate information and follow a harmonized protocol that avoids specific fitting of model settings to local conditions in a comparative analysis of 15 forest models with regard to model sensitivity to different tree mortality algorithms bugmann et al 2019 refrained from having all participating models run under identical conditions however this approach adds another source of uncertainty and makes it even harder to track those model sub processes that contribute most to the variation in model output and to respond to the question of why a specific model does better or worse in a specific situation the historical long term compartment based dataset in combination with management records as used in this study offered great potential to test models in species rich forest ecosystems in realistic management contexts inventories carried out by forest enterprises usually do not fulfill the criteria for long term model evaluation exercises here the focus usually lies on cost efficiency and less on continuous long term datasets methodologies usually switched from full calipering of trees over wide forest areas to statistically more advanced and less cost intensive sampling methods starting from the 1950s onwards as a result continuous datasets consisting of tree data with sufficient sampling densities over a long time period are very scarce the tree and harvest data from the presented case study cover a remarkably long period of 50 years they represent entire compartments and are thus better representatives of real forests compared to small plots of large scale forest inventories see huber et al 2013 however to fully understand forest development in the nine compartments information on tree mortality stand structural information and tree regeneration would be essential in an attempt to frame sources of uncertainty in the evaluation data 12 scenarios were defined to specify explicit assumptions on the initial state of regeneration browsing pressure by ungulates over the monitoring period and the inclusion of tree mortality in harvesting decisions table 1 what could be considered a weakness of the evaluation data was turned into a strength of the assessment approach because it added rigor to the comparison of model output and observations it also facilitated analysis of the sensitivity of the models to assumptions that have to be made quite often when data and model input from decades ago are used 4 2 model initialization a first crucial step in practical model applications is to initialize stand structures from available information to our knowledge the ability of models to create realistic initial tree populations has not been considered before all models involved in this study include special routines for initialization to avoid stand structures that are not compatible with internal processes dealing with competition for resources and space and may therefore result in undesired behavior of simulated tree populations especially in the first simulation years see supplementary material generally these routines are most important for complex forest stands with high tree density vertical tree layers diverse species mixtures many size classes and patchy spatial structure in the model sibyla for example the models internal consistency of the virtual tree population is evaluated by estimating the suitability of the tree positions according to the nearest and second nearest neighbor trees using a probabilistic approach pretzsch 1993 for rejected trees new coordinates are generated until microstructural requirements are fulfilled the picus model operates in a similar way within its 10 10 m resolution to avoid the initialization of non viable tree neighborhoods the gap model forclim uses an algorithm to optimize the leaf area of virtual trees to avoid excessive shading samsara2 avoids initialization problems by using a uniform distribution for estimating coordinates which may visually result in very regular stand structures in landclim compartments are initialized spatially explicit at the level of the simulation cells 25 by 25 m the effort that has been put into generating realistic initial forest states shows that although so far not much attention has been paid to this issue i creating realistic tree population structures may have crucial implications for simulated short to midterm population behavior and ii indicates the relevance of structural information and tree coordinates see table sm3 for instance picus samsara2 and sibyla could have directly utilized tree coordinates for initializing forest stands all models except landclim were able to generate realistic forests regarding basal area density and diameter structure compare fig 1 and table sm8 for an overview the landscape model landclim which had not been developed to simulate fine grained tree populations at population level initialized forests with substantially lower basal area compared to observations and also did not match well the initial diameter structure of the validation data set 4 3 forest simulation results in simulating managed mixed mountain forests over five decades beyond growth regeneration and mortality of trees also harvests and the response of tree populations to these human disturbances need to be mimicked realistically the results showed that spatially explicit individual tree based models performed better in simulating basal area development than the non spatial gap model forclim and not surprisingly the landscape model landclim overall the best performing models in our study yielded rmse values for basal area over a simulation period of 50 years which are about 10 to 12 of the compartment basal area this simulation result is comparable to the range of basal area mean error values from large scale forest inventories e g næsset 2007 the mean error me values over all scenarios indicated that all models on average underestimated the observed basal area values by about 10 of the mean observed values except the landclim model which yielded a slightly larger positive bias an even greater challenge for forest models is to capture the development of the size structure of the tree population with the exception of landclim all models performed reasonably well furthermore the study did not confirm two general beliefs first and interestingly empirical models sybila samsara2 did not perform significantly better regarding the accurate prediction of dbh structure than the process based models forclim and picus compare guisan and zimmermann 2000 fontes et al 2011 a similar finding for the picus model had already been reported in seidl et al 2005 second none of the models had been developed for dinaric mountain forests as the model evaluation protocol avoided the calibration of the tested models to local tree growth data the expectations towards accurate model results in simulating 50 years of tree growth were low however the stand level models performed reasonable compare fig 7 the spatially explicit models picus samsara2 and sybila performed overall better than the non spatial gap model forclim and showed very concordant results on the other hand forclim showed the best performance regarding the diameter distributions the current study clearly showed that a model should perform well in a series of aspects beyond tree growth that drive forest development over the 50 year simulation period the interacting processes tree growth regeneration mortality and tree selection and harvesting determine the standing stock as well as the dbh distribution at a specific point in time hülsmann et al 2018 point out that mortality subroutines in forest models are typically rather fundamental and lack empirical basis in a recent study bugmann et al 2019 concluded that the sensitivity of forest models to changes in mortality algorithms is larger than the sensitivity to climate change signals unfortunately the testing data used for our study did not include tree mortality the extent to which harvests included a share of natural tree mortality was also not known however the scenarios c1 harvests include only living trees and c2 sanitary management harvests also include dead trees allowed to estimate the effect of the underlying assumptions our results showed that a seemingly simple process such as harvesting trees might produce quite different results among the models all models except landclim could handle harvest prescriptions on an annual basis however harvest algorithms within the models differ in the way they handle tree removals in specific dbh classes some algorithms search for specific trees size and species in the simulated forest as differences between observed and simulated dbh structures increase with increasing simulation length more flexible algorithms e g trees may be taken from neighboring dbh classes may be beneficial especially for very detailed harvest operations such as single tree or sanitary management records mina et al 2017 our results indicated that harvest algorithms incorporating multiple criteria such as basal area tree diameter and diameter distributions can improve overall modeling accuracy lafond et al 2012 the importance of consistently considering natural tree mortality in harvest algorithms will even increase with increasing relevance of disturbances in future climates seidl and rammer 2017 framing the uncertainty in the evaluation data initialization of small trees browsing by ungulates tree selection for harvesting by means of 12 scenarios proved to be an adequate approach to i consider data uncertainty and ii test the sensitivity of the models towards the scenario assumptions see figure sm1 and tables sm5 and sm6 it was interesting to note that the browsing scenarios b1 b2 b3 had a strong influence on the predictions and were predominantly affecting diameter structures whereas basal area was less affected samsara2 seemed to be particularly sensitive to the harvesting assumptions what is a useful threshold for model sensitivity this question cannot be answered easily as a general rule the sensitivity of a model to a driving gradient must allow to reproduce observable data along the gradient e g lexer and hönninger 2004 interestingly the average variation caused by the full set of scenarios as simulated by samsara2 picus and sibyla is approximately in the same order of magnitude as the error in basal area or volume estimates of large scale forest inventories landclim the only landscape model included in the comparison set delivered satisfactory estimates of basal area development per compartment though it operates on coarser resolutions regarding initialization management and growth simulation and was designed to simulate landscape level disturbances and processes that were not the focus of this study the advantage of landscape models is that they can be used to complement stand level models to explore forest development at multiple spatial scales from stand to landscape scale which is gaining importance with growing confidence that disturbance regimes will intensify under a warming climate interacting disturbance agents operate at multiple spatial scales which is beyond the reach of stand level models e g elkin et al 2013 hlásny et al 2019 5 conclusions several conclusions can be drawn from this study first a strong effort should be made by research institutes and forest owners to access and store historical inventory datasets and harmonize contemporary inventories with historical data to be able to capitalize on the benefits of a long consistent time series in particular detailed harvest records are crucial to understand time series data of stocks which are the usual monitoring focus knowing harvested trees by tree species and by status live dead would be a huge leap forward for further development and testing of forest ecosystem models second there is no clear hierarchy between more empirical or more process based models regarding the accuracy of stand development projections third individual based models are more precise for stand level predictions than the tested landscape model landclim but the latter performed reasonably well at the stand scale qualifying it for a complementary application at the landscape scale this serves as a great example for a finding from a model intercomparison study where the ultimate goal is not that every contestant shows excellent performance regarding standard outputs more important is a critical comparison between models to differentiate why certain models are better under specific conditions observed in the case study for specific outputs following a detailed description of underlying model assumptions and objective evaluation of outputs recommendations can then be given regarding the specific applicability of models and their limitations however model performance demonstrated in a specific ecological and management setting should not be generalized carelessly to diverging conditions repeated successful model evaluation experiments in different settings will build trust in model performance fourth in model evaluation studies a comprehensive set of model output variables should be assessed there is a fast growing demand by decision makers for reliable prediction of stand structural features beyond volume or basal area because for forest management planning ecosystem service provisioning is based on indicators on species composition and structure of the tree population e g maroschek et al 2015 the current study has shown that there are forest models available that qualify for forest management decision support fifth as a very relevant mission joint model intercomparison and evaluation studies compare currently available ecosystem models by challenging them with applications in novel case study settings and foster scientific collaboration among the modeling groups this prepares the ground for multi model applications in decision support

24652,the maintenance of natural capital and the stability of regulation services of marine ecosystems has proved to be linked to the conservation of key species supporting the ecosystems function chondrichthyes are key top predators and their removal from marine ecosystems due to fishing exploitation could lead to changes in species interactions and biomass that can negatively influence the provision of ecosystems services the ecological role of the demersal chondrichthyes living in the marine food web of the calabrian area in the northern ionian sea central mediterranean sea was analysed by means of ecological indicators derived from ecopath mass balance food web models estimated in their stationary states during the periods 1995 1997 2003 2005 and 2013 2015 the trophic web model was described by 57 functional groups 7 of which representing the demersal chondrichthyes which were described by their biomass t km2 production and consumption rate diet landings t km2 e discards t km2 remarkable changes in biomass were recorded for shark and rays as a consequence of changes in fishing patterns and oceanographic regime shift named bimodal oscillating systems bios demersal chondrichthyes occupy high trophic positions in the calabria food web showing trophic levels higher than 4 1 with the d licha identified as the main apex predators while e spinax and g melastomus as meso predators the pattern of the consumption flows highlighted a potential sensitivity of e spinax and g melastomus to the changes in deep waters circulation caused by the bios acting on the entire ecosystem of the ionian sea d licha was identified as the main keystone predators in all the investigated periods the analysis of the trophic indirect and direct impacts shows the role of the demersal chondrichthyes as beneficial predators with positive effects on several preys results also showed that g melastomus and the shelf elasmobranchs group e g raja asterias mustelus mustelus etc were overexploited in 1995 and that all groups of sharks and rays underwent to a decrease of exploitation rate over time chondrichthyes showed medium low values of overlap with the fishing gears 0 50 with the more relevant values estimated between the shelf elasmobranch group and passive nets and other gears according to the findings of this work the protection of chondrichthyes could combine biodiversity conservation and fisheries management objectives therefore it is envisaged the implementation of appropriate spatial planning and conservation measures for these top predators to guarantee valuable and sustainable flows of ecosystem goods and services keywords marine food web keystone species top down control regulation services natural capital ecosystem overfishing 1 introduction the maintenance of natural capital has proved to be linked to the conservation of key species supporting the ecosystems function as well as the stability of regulation services in different marine ecosystems hammerschlag et al 2019 sergio et al 2008 in particular the loss of top predators strongly affects the structure and functioning of entire ecosystems through cascading effects down the trophic levels of marine food webs estes et al 2011 the removal of sharks and rays from marine ecosystems due to fishing exploitation could often favour the alteration of top down controls with the release of meso predators the increase in their predation rates as well as their consumption on the species of basal trophic levels ferretti et al 2010 2013 heithaus et al 2008 heupel et al 2014 this can lead to a simplification of the ecosystem and changes in species interactions that can negatively influence the provision of ecosystems services such as the human food supply hammerschlag et al 2019 paradoxically although fishery obtains great advantages in terms of ecosystem stability from the roles of chondrichthyes in the marine food web as a counterpart they receive the most relevant negative impact from human exploitation such as the by catch of several fishing gears and the competition for the food resources dulvy et al 2014 in fact as reported by the international union for the conservation of nature and the iucn shark specialist group chondrichthyes are critical species of international concern i e global shark trends project 2018 2020 and assessed against threats according to the principles of biological sustainability within the international plan of action for conservation and management of sharks fischer et al 2012 because they are highly sensitive to fishing pressure and able to reflect the status of entire marine ecosystems davidson et al 2015 sharks and rays appear to be particularly vulnerable to exploitation because of their k selected life history strategy characterized by slow growth late attainment of sexual maturity long life spans low fecundity and natural mortality as well as a close relationship between the number of young produced and the size of the breeding biomass if overfished many shark populations would take several decades to recover baum et al 2003 bradai et al 2018 dulvy et al 2000 ferretti et al 2008 stevens et al 2000 in particular as by catch and discard of bottom trawlers and small scale multispecies fisheries the demersal chondrichthyes have low resilience to fishing pressure when suffering direct and indirect fishing impact follesa et al 2019 in fact the main direct effects of fishing can very often result in changes in their abundance size structure life history parameters and at the extreme could even lead to extinction colloca et al 2017 myers and worm 2003 indeed the indirect effects involve trophic interactions through selective removal of predator or prey species in the community as well as removal of competitors species replacement and enhancement of food supply through discards stevens et al 2000 while the role played by large pelagic sharks in the mechanisms of top down control in the oceanic ecosystems has been widely investigated baum and worm 2009 and reference therein the knowledge of the trophic controls exerted by small medium demersal elasmobranchs in the marine food web are less well known especially in the mediterranean sea as reported in the last assessment on the conservation status of the chondrichthyes in the mediterranean sea at least half of the rays 50 16 of 32 species face an elevated risk of extinction as well as 54 of sharks 22 of 41 whereas the only chimaera species chimaera monstrosa is considered least concern in these waters dulvy et al 2016 in that study the lack of adequate scientific information was also stated as the main limitation for implementing effective management measures for chondrichthyes in this regard the scarce availability of data from commercial fisheries in many mediterranean areas as well as the scarce application of holistic approach to investigate the chondrichthyes interactions in the food web highlights the need for an enlarged and deeper use of fishery independent data such as from scientific surveys to assess the current status of demersal chondrichthyes peristeraki et al 2020 from this perspective modelling approaches such as ecopath mass balance models www ecopath org christensen et al 2008 represent a valuable tool to describe the structure of the food web by integrating the fishing dynamics trophodynamic models allow formulation of ecological hypotheses about complex trophic regulations and the potential ecosystem effects of fishing that are difficult to detect with experimental field observations in this regard several food web models have been developed in the mediterranean sea coll and libralato 2012 but few studies have been focused on demersal chondrichthyes exploring their ecological roles and the fishing impact tecchio et al 2013 or testing some management scenarios for the conservation of commercial species coll et al 2013 remarkably the understanding of the trophic roles of sharks and rays is often not investigated at a local regional and macro regional scale although they play a key role in the food webs of the mediterranean sea sensu piroddi et al 2015 in the northern ionian sea central eastern mediterranean sea a total of 22 sharks 10 batoids and 1 chimaera were recorded during the eu international mediterranean trawl survey medits and previous studies identified these species as an important component of the demersal assemblage maiorano et al 2010 sion et al 2004 in particular the geographic distribution pattern of these species shows the existence of two specific groups of demersal chondrichthyes in the calabrian area between punta alice and capo spartivento giove et al 2010 fig 1 these conditions seem to be influenced by a narrow shelf a steep slope and several submarine canyons close to the coast especially in the southern calabrian area capezzuto et al 2010 a food web model is available for the area but its results are mainly focused on the description of general traits of the investigated ecosystem ricci et al 2019 in this particular model the chondrichthyes species were aggregated into 5 functional groups exploring a limited time period 1995 1997 which do not describe the trophic role of each shark and ray in the marine food web over a longer period in this study we overcome these limitations by increasing the modelling representation of some demersal chondrichthyes species in order to investigate their trophic roles their importance as keystone species in the food web and their trophic impacts on the other species within the demersal assemblage a set of ecological and fishing indicators was derived from mass balance food web models estimated during 3 time periods between 1995 and 2015 with a temporal scale of 10 years amongst the 3 investigated periods during which remarkable changes in abundances were recorded for shark and rays as a consequence of oceanographic regime shift as well as changes in the fishing pattern in the area in particular fishing indicators have been used to compare the competition between the demersal chondrichthyes and the fishery by means of the consumption of their prey and catches respectively finally this study adopts an ecosystem perspective by means of multi species modelling to provide advice for the management system to set effective conservation measures as required in the goals for sustainable development of the united nations goal 14 life below water duarte et al 2020 the eu common fishery policy and the

complex geomorphology and oceanography as well as generally low productivity lazzari et al 2012 the general hydrographic conditions determine substantial differences in salinity and temperature values within the nwis area and the large scale circulation undergoes decadal changes resulting in local modification of physical biogeochemical and ecological conditions in particular the ionian area is impacted by relevant changes in the deep water circulation of the ionian gyre which invert its direction from cyclonic to anticyclonic and vice versa affecting the nutrient cycling the primary production and the abundance and distribution of the species and demersal assemblages borzelli et al 2009 capezzuto et al 2010 carlucci et al 2018a d ortenzio et al 2003 klein et al 1999 this changes occur with a decadal oscillation linked to the adriatic water circulation system named bimodal oscillating systems bios civitarese et al 2010 the south western calabrian coasts are characterized by a generally narrow shelf and numerous submarine canyons located along the coasts senatore et al 1980 the environmental complexity of the area reflects the presence of several demersal faunal assemblages distributed along the depth gradient capezzuto et al 2010 carlucci et al 2018a d onghia et al 1998 maiorano et al 2010 the most important demersal resources that are both target of commercial fisheries and prey of chondrichthyes are represented by the red mullet mullus barbatus on the continental shelf european hake merluccius merluccius and deep water rose shrimp parapenaeus longirostris over a wide bathymetric range as well as deep water red shrimps aristeus antennatus and aristaeomorpha foliacea on the slope d onghia et al 2003 crotone and reggio calabria represent the most important fisheries along the calabrian coast mainly characterized by large trawlers 10gt maiorano et al 2010 in addition the presence of nursery areas for commercial species such as p longirostris and a foliacea in the gulf of squillace and the gulf of corigliano respectively carlucci et al 2009 colloca et al 2015 starting from the end 90 s a significant positive trend in the biomass of demersal chondrichthyes has been detected through the fishery independent trawl surveys maiorano et al 2019 the domain of the calabrian food web model cal extends from punta alice to capo spartivento for approximately 3469 km2 in the depth range 10 800 m fig 1 2 2 the ecopath modelling approach ecopath within the ecosim ewe modelling approach www ecopath org christensen et al 2008 was used to develop the food web model in the study area the ewe approach has been developed over the last 30 years and it is now widely used for building and analysing mass balance food web models of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide christensen and walters 2004 colléter et al 2015 ewe allows the static e g agnetta et al 2019 time dynamic e g celić et al 2018 and spatio temporal dynamic e g coll et al 2016 food web model approaches to be implemented through the ecopath ecosim and ecospace modules respectively food webs are described by means of functional groups fgs each representing a species a life stage of a species or a group of species with similar trophic ecological and physiological features links between fgs are formally described by a set of linear equations christensen et al 2008 the state variables are the biomasses of the groups and the parameters include the production rate p bi consumption rate q bi diet composition dcij unassimilated food u qi catches yi and exports ei for each group the system of equations is solved in ecopath by providing ewe with information on three out of the four basic parameters bi p bi q bi and the ecotrophic efficiency eei which represent the proportion of the production that is used in the system by fisheries and predators further details on the ewe modelling approach can be found in review literature christensen and walters 2004 christensen et al 2008 heymans et al 2016 2 3 model structure definition of functional groups the food web models realized in this study are based on the functional groups already used in a previous model build in the calabrian area representing the period 1995 1997 ricci et al 2019 the model was updated with several modifications regarding the aggregations of the demersal chondrichthyes species which were described by 7 fgs for detail see par 2 4 in particular the demersal and benthopelagic domains are described by the mediterranean international trawl survey medits time series 1995 2015 the 276 sampled species were aggregated into 29 fgs based on similarity in quantitative diet information and in bathymetric distribution of species ricci et al 2019 table 1 the methods is based on the ecological assumption that a consumer diet is influenced by the availability of resources in the area where it lives defined by the bathymetric layer preferred by the species in fact the depth is the most important environmental drivers structuring the demersal and benthopelagic assemblages carlucci et al 2018a and the assumption is that species belong to similar trophic ecological functional group when they have similar diet and similar preferred depth the centre of gravity cog daget 1976 was used as synthetic measure of the depth to which a species shows the highest biomass concentration the quantitative information on diet preferences in weight have been collected for 129 species on a total of 276 species sampled in the benthopelagic and demersal assemblages of study areas through the scientific published and grey literature both of local and nearby geographical areas the analysis of diet and bathymetric distribution data has been carried out by implementing a bi clustering on the matrix of prey predator relationships also using the vector of weighting factor cog implemented by means of a microsoft visual basic routine for more details to see ricci et al 2019 the remaining 147 species lacking in diet information were successively grouped according to their life history traits information from qualitative diets and habitat preferences identified by a self organizing map

the characteristic feeding habits of the group last part table 1 moreover 18 other living fgs describing components of the ecosystem were added namely 7 additional functional groups were used to describe the planktonic domain small phytoplankton large phytoplankton macro meso and microzooplankton bacterioplankton and gelatinous plankton these groups were defined on the basis of compartments and size classes used in biogeochemical models used to hindcast and forecast mediterranean productivity and ocean biogeochemistry https marine copernicus eu di biagio et al 2019 achieving a good resolution in the description of the trophic interactions in the planktonic community christensen et al 2008 the pelagic domain was described through additional 8 functional groups the loggerhead turtle seabirds the large medium and small pelagic fishes the fin whale and the odontocetes the benthic domain was described through additional 4 functional groups macrobenthic invertebrates polychaetes suprabenthic crustaceans and seagrasses and seaweeds thus the final food web model is described by a total of 57 fgs including 3 groups of non living matter detritus marine snow and discards in particular the marine snow as suspended particulate organic matter and the detritus benthic organic matter represent the two pathways in the detritus chain exploited by the bacterioplankton and scavengers respectively heymans et al 2016 2 4 demersal chondrichthyes in the northern ionian sea the life history traits and annual catch data of demersal chondrichthyes species sampled in the study area are reported in table 2 data were obtained from 29 experimental hauls carried out each year from 1995 to 2015 in the study area within the eu medits project the experimental trawl net used for the sampling of the demersal species was characterized by a codend mesh size of 20 mm stretched mesh and the hauls were distributed according a random stratified sampling design anonymous 2017 the demersal chondrichthyes are described by a total of 18 species sampled in the area and aggregated into 7 functional groups see table 1 in particular the kitefin shark dalatias licha the velvet belly in agreement with asfis lantern shark etmopterus spinax and the blackmouth catshark galeus melastomus are represented as individual fgs in the food web model this choice was based on the observation that these latter species are continuously present during the time series and their overall biomass was higher than 75 of the demersal chondrichthyes biomass sampled from 1995 2015 in addition a total of 16 diets of demersal chondrichthyes in weight estimated by means the stomach contents and stable isotope analysis were acquired for several mediterranean areas by consulting the literature and the fishbase dataset froese and pauly 2019 www fishbase org table 2 2 5 model parametrization and biomass input data the input parameters and data sources for biomasses t km 2 annual production and consumption rates p b and q b diets diet composition matrices and data sources and annual fishery landings and discards are reported in ricci et al submitted the diet information derived from several mediterranean areas preferring the information close to the study area ricci et al 2019 the ee was fixed for the polychaets and macrobenthic invertebrate groups at a value of 0 90 gelatinous plankton and suprabenthic crustacean groups at a value of 0 95 and for the macro and mesozooplankton fgs at a value of 0 99 heymans et al 2016 the biomass data from the medits trawl surveys do not account for the catchability of the fishing gear and thus data were corrected using a catchability factor by species qi obtained from the literature whenever possible fiorentino et al 2013 fraser et al 2007 in some instances catchability by species for demersal species was evaluated by comparison of medits estimates with other data e g benthic samples other fishing gears stock assessments in order to determine more accurate absolute densities at sea although this implies great uncertainty it is a necessary step which is not always explicit in ewe modelling see for example arreguin sanchez 1996 biomass data of marine mammals and marine turtles were estimated using abundance data n km 1 obtained from the obis seamap carlucci et al 2018b halpin et al 2009 and the mean individual weight used in other models see ricci et al 2019 landings by species were obtained by the fisheries and aquaculture economic research for the ministry of agricultural food and forestry policies mipaaf data referring to annual commercial landings for the period 2006 2015 were processed in order to reconstruct disaggregated landings for trawls otb long lines ll passive nets gnd other gears mix and purse seines ps in the period 1995 2005 discards of the trawl fishery by species with commercial value undersize individuals were calculated using the discard rate estimated by stecf 2004 the discard fraction for species or functional groups of no commercial value was calculated on the basis of the proportion of commercial and non commercial discards in medits data and local references d onghia et al 2003 discard for others gears was obtained from the scientific literature relative to neighbouring mediterranean areas tsagarakis et al 2014 and reference therein eventually correcting discard rate on the basis of local knowledge three mass balance models were developed describing the calabrian food web in three distinct periods each reconstructed as an average of 3 years of data the models represent the following periods 1 1995 1997 hereafter called model 1995 2 2003 2005 hereafter called model 2005 and 3 2013 2015 hereafter called model 2015 2 6 prebal analysis and balancing steps the pre balancing analysis prebal link 2010 was carried out to assess the coherence of the input data with the basic thermodynamic laws rules and principles of ecosystem ecology at the system level heymans et al 2016 appendix a figure a1 a3 the reliability of data input was assessed by means of the pedigree index an index used to assess the overall quality of the data and the model on the basis of the source of data and its accuracy ranging between 0 low quality and 1 high quality christensen and walters 2004 when the pedigree index indicated less reliable values in the dc matrix net food conversion efficiencies p q 0 05 0 3 respiration assimilation r a 1 and production respiration p r 1 ratios were checked to confirm they were within expected limits christensen et al 2008 cannibalism causes several problems in balancing the model heymans et al 2016 therefore it was decreased for hake sharks and rays demersal fish groups cephalopods shrimps and crabs groups initially the models were manually balanced consisting of slight modifications to the production rates within the range by species the input data p b and q b were re evaluated during the balancing steps by adopting a top down approach mackinson and daskalov 2007 nevertheless the models were finally balanced using a monte carlo routine ecoranger developed in ewe version 5 christensen et al 2008 that allows model parameters to be changed and progressive improvement of the mass balance to be evaluated considering an initial realistic uncertainty in the diet matrix 10 changes for all diet matrix elements thus the diet matrix was the only parameter set to change in the automatic routine during the balancing phases in order to bound the model results while most important input parameters differentiating between the models were the biomasses and catches of functional groups the monte carlo routine allowed three balanced models to be obtained objectively by exploring the range of trophic uncertainty and adapting the diet matrix to the biomass at sea and fishing pressure catches observed in each period 2 7 ecological indicators ecological indices were used to analyse the role of chondrichthyes groups species and ecosystem structure based on trophic flow analysis thermodynamic concepts and network theory christensen and walters 2004 in particular the fractional trophic level tl ecotrophic efficiency ee omnivory index oi niche overlap index o mixed trophic impacts mti and keystoness index ksi were calculated for each fg the tl of each fg summarizes the ecological position of each fg within the food web pauly et al 1998 and was calculated from the tl average of their prey i weighted by the proportion of each prey in the diet j dcij by convention primary producers and detritus have tl 1 pauly and watson 2005 the oi was calculated for each fg as the variance of the trophic level of a consumer s prey groups pauly et al 1993 when the oi value is zero the consumer in question is specialized i e it feeds on a single trophic level a large value indicates that the consumer feeds on many trophic levels libralato 2013 the niche overlap o was estimated amongst the chondrichthyes fgs 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 using the equation proposed by pianka 1973 o j k i 1 n p j i p k i i 1 n p j i 2 p k i 2 where p ji and p ki are the proportions of the resource i used by species j and k respectively the index is symmetrical and assumes values between 0 and 1 a value of 0 suggests that the two species do not share resources 1 indicates complete overlap and intermediate values show partial overlap in resource utilization the consumption flows t km 2 y 1 were estimated for each chondrichthyes fg analysing which of the consumed groups belong to the pelagic 7 fgs demersal 36 fgs splitted into shelf shelf break and slope planktonic 7 fgs and benthic 4 fgs compartments for the aggregation of the fgs in the compartments see table 1 similarly the biomass t km 2 y 1 and production t km 2 y 1 of the preys exploited by the chondrichthyes were estimated aggregating the groups in the previous compartments the ksi was calculated through mixed trophic impact analysis mti ulanowicz and puccia 1990 by quantifying the relative impact of biomass change within a component impacting group on each of the other components impacted groups in the food web including the fishing gears positive negative mti values indicate an increase decrease in biomass of the group j due to a slight increase in biomass of the impacting group i therefore negative impacts can be associated to prevailing top down effects and positive ones to bottom up effects libralato et al 2006 the overall effect εi of a group i represents all the direct or indirect mti values of group i on all the other groups in the food web ε i j 1 n m i j 2 where the impact on the group itself m ij with i j is not considered and ε i is calculated as a relative value with respect to the maximum libralato et al 2006 the parameter pi is the relative biomass of the group in the food web excluding detritus biomass p i b i k 1 n b i thus the ksi used in this study is expressed as k s i i c l b c 0 where icl impact component is estimated by means of the overall effect εi and bc0 the biomass component is estimated from pi where bc0 is the biomass in a descending order ranking valls et al 2015 the keystoness rank allowed to the importance of the fgs in the food web models that are system specific to be identified coll and libralato 2012 heymans et al 2014 the mti analysis was carried out on the chondrichthyes fgs in order to explore i the changes in the trophic impacts during the 3 investigated time periods at the level of single fgs ii the direct and indirect trophic impacts exerted on the fgs aggregated into the same compartments of consumption flow analysis direct trophic impacts were considered as the impacts on the groups consumed by the chondrichthyes fgs identified as the prey in their diet information while the indirect trophic impacts corresponded to the impacts on the groups not consumed by the chondrichthyes fgs ulanowicz and puccia 1990 positive direct impacts on a prey allowed the identification of the chondrichthyes fg as beneficial predators 2 8 fishing impact indicators the fishing impacts on the food webs and the interactions with chondrichthyes were assessed by a set of indicators the exploitation rate e which represents the proportion of fishing mortality f on the total mortality z was calculated for each chondrichthyes fg e values higher than 0 50 indicate unsustainable exploitation of the resource defined as an overfishing condition kolding et al 2015 the mti analysis of the negative and positive impacts exerted by fishing gears were estimated in all investigated periods and a comparative analysis between fishing gears and chondrichthyes fgs was carried out considering their overall effects positive and negative on all living fgs of the calabrian food web according to the pianka index approach 1973 the chondrichthyes fishing gears competition in the calabrian food web was assessed by means the fishery overlap index foi carlucci et al 2020 fo i j k i 1 n pc h j i g k i i 1 n pch j i 2 g k i 2 where pchji and gki are the proportions of the resource i consumed harvested by chondrichthyes fgj and fishing gear k respectively the index is included between 0 no overlap and 1 full overlap on the exploited resources the fishing gears can be considered as consumer in the food web with their diet represented by species composition in the catches or landings and their consumption flows in the ecosystems trites et al 1997 the overlap was estimated by means of the consumption flows t km 2 y 1 of each of the chondrichthyes fgs and the landings t km 2 y 1 of each fishing gear transforming the absolute values into relative values 3 results 3 1 trophic traits of demersal chondrichthyes within the food web the trophic levels of the demersal chondrichthyes fgs estimated during the 3 investigated periods highlighted the high trophic positions covered by these species which ranged between 4 18 sl srchim bent in 2015 and 5 15 sl elasm pisc in 1995 fig 2 a appendix b table b1 d licha showed tl values greater than 4 80 for all demersal chondrichthyes the tls values estimated in 2015 were lower than the values detected in 1995 and 2005 the group sl srchim bent and e spinax showed the highest values of the omnivory index 0 50 in 2015 and 0 41 in 2005 respectively while the lowest mean value was estimated for the sh elasm group 0 10 in 2005 and 2015 fig 2b the highest values of the niche overlap were estimated between g melastomus e spinax 0 62 in all investigated periods d licha e spinax 0 60 in 1995 0 64 in 2005 and 0 58 in 2015 respectively appendix b table b2 the sh elasm group showed the highest total consumption flows in 1995 0 51 t km 2 y 1 with the highest values on the prey on the coastal shelf 0 37 t km 2 y 1 fig 3 a appendix b table b3 in addition a clear reduction in total consumption was detected in the successive periods e spinax showed the highest value of total consumption in 2005 0 29 t km 2 y 1 exploiting the prey in the shelf break 0 12 t km 2 y 1 slope 0 11 t km 2 y 1 and planktonic compartment 0 05 t km 2 y 1 g melastomus showed the highest total consumption in 2015 0 33 t km 2 y 1 with the flows from the prey distributed in the shelf break 0 18 t km 2 y 1 and on the slope 0 12 t km 2 y 1 d licha increased its total consumption flows over the time showing its highest value in 2015 0 13 t km 2 y 1 feeding the demersal prey on the slope 0 10 t km 2 y 1 the sl srchim bent group showed its highest total consumption in 2005 0 14 t km 2 y 1 and the most important values were estimated for the prey in the shelf break 0 05 t km 2 y 1 benthic compartment 0 04 t km 2 y 1 and slope 0 03 t km 2 y 1 the sl elasm pisc group showed the lowest consumption flows 0 02 t km 2 y 1 in all investigated periods the sh crabs and the sh demersal fishes bent crust were the most consumed prey in 1995 while the prey distributed on the slope shrimps bp myctophids sl bathypelagic fishes pisc sl decapods scav and sl squids were mainly exploited in 2005 and 2015 appendix b table b3 in addition the consumption of the macrozooplankton and bathyal cephalopods increased over time while that of small and medium pelagic fishes fell the consumptions flows pattern observed during the investigated periods was consistent with the available biomass of the preys exploited by the demersal chondrichthyes fig 3b c in particular the increase of biomass availability was detected in 2005 for the planktonic and benthic prey exploited by the e spinax and sh elasm group similarly an increase of the biomass of the prey exploited in the slope layer by d licha was detected in 2005 and 2015 the keystoness analysis showed differences in the importance of the chondrichthyes within the calabrian food web in the 3 investigated periods with the more relevant values estimated for d licha e spinax g melastomus and the group sh elasm fig 4 appendix b table b1 d licha showed ks and rel total impact values higher than other elasmobranch groups in 1995 and 2015 occupying the 2nd and 3rd positions in the ks rank respectively the importance of e spinax increased in the ks ranks over time reaching 6th position in 2005 and 7th in 2015 in particular the ks and rel total impact of e spinax in 2005 were higher than the values of other elasmobranch groups and its relative biomass increased in this period g melastomus attained its highest ks rank positions in 2005 10th and in 2015 11th as well as showing its highest relative biomass values in these two periods the group sh elasm was characterized by high values of ks rel total impact and relative biomass in 1995 13th rank position while lower indices values and rank positions were observed in 2005 40th and in 2015 33rd the remaining groups show changes in ks values always below the 23rd position during all investigated periods the highest negative impacts played by the chondrichthyes were focused on the functional groups placed at the apex of the food web tl 4 1 for all investigated periods mti analysis fig 5 d licha fg 10 showed very high negative impacts on e spinax and g melastomus in all investigated periods in addition the negative impacts on the sl squids increased in 2015 differently the kitefin shark positively impacted its prey sl bathypelagic fishes pisc shrimps bp and sl decapods scav in all periods e spinax fg 11 showed negative impacts on the sl squids the shb bobtail squids and the sl bathypelagic fishes pisc with the highest values in 2005 in contrast positive impacts were seen on some of its prey for example rg shrimp myctophids and rb shrimp g melastomus fg 12 showed an increase in negative impacts on the sl squids over time other negative impacts were detected on the sl elasm pisc and sl cephalopods with very high values in 2015 on the contrary positive impacts were detected on the rb and rg shrimps and on some its prey such as the sl bathypelagic fishes pisc fg macrourids and sl crabs the sh elasm group fg 8 showed high negative impacts on the shb squids shb demersal fishes gen and sh demersal fishes bent crust in 1995 with a decrease in the values in 2005 and 2015 positive impacts were estimated on basal groups such as polychaets macrobenthic invertebrates seagrasses and algae the sl elasm pisc group fg 9 proved to be beneficial predators of the sl bathypelagic fishes pisc and sl cephalopods groups in all investigated periods the sl srchim bent group fg 6 showed negative and positive impacts especially in 2005 having negative impacts on e spinax g melastomus sl cephalopods shb squids and sl decapods scav differently the group was a beneficial predator of sl squids and shb bobtail squids finally the shb elasm group fg 7 showed considerable impacts in 2015 with negative values on the shb demersal fishes pisc b catshark shb squids hake sl srchim bent sl crabs and gel plank fgs on the contrary positive impacts were seen on anglers r mullet sh cephalopds macrobent inv and the elasmobranch group was a beneficial predator of small pelagic fishes and shb fishes crust the direct and indirect impacts calculated for the chondrichthyes fgs are reported in fig 6 in all investigated periods d licha showed negative direct impacts on the slope prey and positive direct impacts on the shelf break preys in all investigated periods e spinax and g melastomus had negative direct impacts on the prey distributed on the slope and in the shelf break in addition both species had negative indirect impacts on the pelagic compartment and positives on the slope groups the difference between the two species was the positive indirect impact on the planktonic compartment of e spinax in all investigated periods whereas g melastomus showed positive indirect impacts on the benthic compartments in 2015 the sh elasm group had its highest negative direct impacts on the prey on the shelf in the shelf break and on the slope while positive impacts were detected on the benthic and pelagic compartments the indirect impacts of the same group were exerted on all compartments in 1995 with the negative values only for shelf groups in the successive periods the values of indirect impacts decreased lastly negligible impacts were detected for the remaining groups 3 2 fishing interactions with the demersal chondrichthyes the exploitation rates estimated showed a decrease for all groups of sharks and rays over time appendix b table b1 g melastomus and sh elasm showed values higher than 0 50 in 1995 the negative direct and indirect impacts of fishing gears on the sharks and rays species were mainly from trawling in all periods appendix b table b4 an increase in the negative impacts of trawling were observed for the sl srchim bent fg while the sh elasm fg the velvet belly shark and the blackmouth catshark all showed a decrease in the negative impacts over time d licha and the sl elasm pisc showed similar negative impacts in all periods the positive impacts by trawling were only detected for the shb elasm in 2005 and 2015 and the velvet belly shark in 2015 lastly the long line had high negative impacts on the sl srchim bent fg in 1995 and 2005 the proportions of the overall effects between both the fishing gears and the chondrichthyes fgs changed in the investigated periods fig 7 appendix b table b4 in all periods trawling showed the highest negative effects on the food web with percentage values higher than 20 in addition trawling played the highest positive impacts on the food web with percentage values higher than 10 in 1995 and 2005 other gears exerted negative effects on the food web in 1995 and 2015 with a percentage value higher than 10 long lines exerted high negative effects in 2005 with a percentage value of 11 2 passive nets showed their high negative effects in 2015 with a percentage value of 10 2 differently the chondrichthyes fgs showed percentage values of negative effects less than 10 in all modelled periods the groups with the most impact in 1995 were the sh elasm fg and the kitefin shark with percentage values of negative effects equal to 6 1 and 5 6 respectively in 2005 e spinax and g melastomus were the sharks having the most impact with percentage values of negative effects equal to 6 5 and 5 2 respectively finally the species having the most impact in 2015 were d licha g melastomus and e spinax all with negative effects higher than 5 in all periods the total of the negative effects of fishery were greater than the negative effects of the chondrichthyes fgs in all investigated periods the fishery overlap index foi estimating the fisheries chondrichthyes overlap showed low values amongst the d licha e spinax g melastomus and all fishing gears fig 8 the sh elasm group showed medium values of overlap with the passive nets in 1995 0 49 in 2005 0 47 and with the other gears in 2005 0 48 in 1995 and 2005 the sl srchim bent group showed medium values of overlap with the trawl net the sl elasm pisc fg showed a medium value of overlap with the purse seine in 2005 finally all overlap ranged between low and low medium values in 2015 4 discussion this study analysed the ecological role of the demersal chondrichthyes living in the marine food web in the calabrian area a portion of the northern ionian sea central mediterranean sea in three different periods complex ecosystem models will result in large uncertainty in any input and output in an orthodox approach to uncertainty analysis essington 2007 while in this work a more pragmatic approach combining prebal and montecarlo was preferred to quantitatively to evaluate the accuracy and consider diet variability into model development respectively the ecological roles of the demersal chondrichthyes observed by means the models have shown different degrees of spatial and temporal variability with changes detected in their biomasses consumptions and trophic impacts these conditions are due to the combination of several environmental and anthropogenic drivers acting on the dynamic population of all species with effects on the shape of the trophic structure in particular the trophic interactions climate change and the fishing activities are identified as the most important drivers which act in cumulative way corrales et al 2017 2018 in particular some demersal chondrichthyes in the northern ionian sea have shown responses to the reduction of the fishing effort and to the variability of the primary production and prey as described in the successive paragraphs further studies are needed to deepen the dynamic relationships between these changes and the environmental and anthropogenic drivers however they could be faced with different specific analytical and methodological approaches 4 1 trophic roles of demersal sharks and rays in the calabrian food web demersal chondrichthyes occupy high trophic positions in the food web of the area investigated showing tls 4 1 in particular t nobiliana centrophorus cf uyato and s blanville grouped in sl sharks bp and d licha were characterized by the highest tls in the food web and they are the apex predators in the bathyal domain the former species have a diet mainly based on fin fishes followed by the decapods and benthopelagic squids barría et al 2015 while d licha shows a feeding preference for the demersal fishes and the small sharks g melastomus and e spinax coherently with the results from the stable isotope analysis reported in the study of navarro et al 2011 decapods and cephalopods seem to represent secondary prey in the diet of the kitefin shark but their consumption as a food supply could change in the long term considering the increases in abundance of cephalopods and crustaceans observed in the northern ionian sea maiorano et al 2010 in all investigated periods chimaera monstrosa dipturus oxyrhynchus and oxynotus centrina in the sl srchim bent group together with scyliorhinus canicula and raja miraleuts shb elasm showed the lowest trophic positions as a result of their feeding on benthic resources such as decapods and cephalopods polychaetes amphipods and macrozooplankton this variety of prey explains the high values of the omnivory index bengil et al 2019 mulas et al 2019 valls et al 2011 the species belonging to the group sh elasm raja asterias dasyatis pastinaca mustelus mustelus torpedo torpedo and torpedo marmorata occupy a intermediate trophic position in the study area with feeding preferences for crustaceans benthic cephalopods demersal fishes and small pelagic fishes in line with the observations from other mediterranean areas barría et al 2015 coll et al 2013 mulas et al 2019 similarly g melastomus and e spinax showed intermediate trophic levels amongst the demersal chondrichthyes confirming the estimates observed in the mediterranean sea stergiou and karpouzi 2002 therefore except for d licha and the sl elasm pisc the demersal chondrichthyes can be mainly considered meso consumers in the calabrian food web heupel et al 2014 a remarkable decrease in the trophic levels was observed for all demersal chondrichthyes in 2015 this trend could mimic ecosystem overexploitation with the removal of high trophic levels preys and lowering of the chondrichthyes tls stevens et al 2000 the oi values estimated by the models indicated feeding on a narrow range of trophic levels for the shallowest sharks and rays on the other hand an increase in a generalist strategy with feeding on a wide range of trophic levels was detected in the bathyal elasmobranchs especially for the bathyal sharks and rays exploiting benthic resources this condition could be explained by the low production and availability of food resources in deep environments inducing top predators to adopt more generalist feeding strategies carrassón et al 1992 valls et al 2011 the consumption flows aggregated for categories provide information on the transfer of energy and biomass between different compartments and bathymetric layers the pattern of consumption observed for g melastomus and e spinax is of particular interest they consume prey distributed on the shelf break and the slope in similar proportions reflecting the ontogenetic changes in their diets and the difference in feeding items exploited over the depth gradient fanelli et al 2009 the temporal changes in the consumption flows estimated on the basis of the objective mass balance approach are influenced by the oscillation in the biomasses of the predators and prey in the food web in fact the estimated increase in consumptions flows and biomass observed for d licha show a parallel biomass increase of both e spinax and g melastomus its preferred prey navarro et al 2014 in contrast the consumption flows of the velvet belly sensu asfis lantern shark and balckmouth catshark could be influenced by the changes in the deep waters circulation known as bimodal oscillating systems observed over a decadal time scale in different mediterranean areas lavigne et al 2018 these modifications in the hydrological regime have proven to affect temperature salinity and nutrient availability as well as the primary production in the ionian basin civitarese et al 2010 the effects of these hydrological changes have been detected in the planktonic community mazzocchi et al 2003 and could drive the abundance oscillations of the decapods a foliacea a antennatus and munida rutllanti capezzuto et al 2010 d onghia et al 2012 maiorano et al 2013 as well as the overall structure modifications of the demersal and benthopelagic assemblages carlucci et al 2018a in particular the species with benthopelagic habits feeding on low trophic levels seem to be more sensitive to the hydrological changes impacting on the primary productivity which triggers processes of regime shift conversi et al 2010 in this light e spinax and g melastomus could be more sensitive than other demersal sharks which feed on the macrozooplankton myctophids and benthopelagic cephalopods fanelli et al 2009 moreover e spinax proved to be more influenced than g melastomus by the trophic changes which occurred in the period 2003 2005 when increases in the primary production were detected in the study area d ortenzio et al 2003 the higher consumption detected for e spinax could be due to its benthopelagic feeding habits while g melastomus is more linked to demersal and benthic prey fanelli et al 2009 bengil et al 2019 similarly to e spinax the sl srchim bent group was characterized by an increase in its consumption likely due to the exploitation of prey with low trophic levels the sh elasm fg was characterized by an almost exclusive consumption of shallowest benthic demersal and pelagic resources moreover the strong fall in consumption after 1995 reflects the decline of the species induced by overfishing conditions see section 4 2 the keystoness index selected in this study emphasizes the importance of fgs characterized by high tl values and rare species valls et al 2015 temporal changes in the positions of the keystoness rank were detected for all the analysed demersal chondrichthyes groups the highest importance as keystone predators was observed for d licha in all the investigated periods e spinax and g melastomus ranked higher in importance as keystone species in 2005 and 2015 when the increase in their mixed trophic impacts due to their biomass increases occurred in gsa 19 maiorano et al 2010 2019 the bathyal piscivorous sharks showed lower keystoness index values the importance of the bathyal sharks as keystone species in the food web had previously been observed in other areas where the demersal sharks were often aggregated in the same functional groups for instance g melastomus proved to be a keystone species in the cold water corals habitats in the northern ionian sea vassallo et al 2017 d licha e spinax and g melastomus aggregated in one functional group were detected as keystone predators in the food web on the catalan continental slope tecchio et al 2013 similarly e spinax d licha t nobiliana and c cf uyato aggregated in a single functional group had already been identified as keystone predators in the calabrian food web in the period 1995 1997 ricci et al 2019 however details on their importance as single species have not been provided before in the shelf domain the group of sh elasm r asterias m mustelus d pastinaca showed a decrease from a relatively high rank position in 1995 to lower positions in 2005 and 2015 although the species are aggregated into different groups the low ks values detected in this study for the calabrian model are similar to those reported for r asterias in the north western mediterranean sea coll et al 2013 corrales et al 2015 and for m mustelus in the eastern ionian moutopoulos et al 2013 substantially rays and skates in mediterranean sea are often characterized by lower keystoness values than sharks piroddi et al 2015 the top down controls in the marine food web are fairly complex and could trigger trophic cascades involving the basal trophic levels or control mechanisms focused on the meso consumers release invertebrate prey release and specific decline of some prey baum and worm 2009 heupel et al 2014 in the calabrian food web the bathyal sharks have proven to be important keystone predators assuming different control roles in fact d licha acts as an apex predator with a negative control on e spinax and g melastomus meso predators and positive effects on some of their low trophic level prey such as decapods scavenger benthopelagic shrimps benthic cephalopods and bobtail squids notably these meso predators act as negative controls on the same prey positively favoured by d licha thus introducing counter balancing effects within the same demersal chondrichthyes groups nevertheless changes in biomass observed for the sh elasm shb elasm sl srchim bent and g melastomus fgs result in the variation of their impacts on the food web in particular the former group has a large indirect impact often positive as detected on the benthic primary producers in 1995 successively the impacts vanished over time highlighting a potential alteration of the trophic cascade in the coastal shelf concerning g melastomus its strong top down controls could be explained by its higher abundance in the submarine canyons which characterize the calabrian geomorphology and represent fishing shelter areas for this demersal shark as observed in the bari canyon in the southern adriatic sea sion et al 2019 finally the analysis of impacts due to the demersal chondrichthyes within the complex food web highlights their role as beneficial predators for instance a foliacea and a antennatus benefit from higher indirect positive effects due to d licha e spinax and g melastomus in fact the sharks predation on consumers and or competitors of the two bathyal shrimps has proved to have a greater impact than the direct predation on a foliacea and a antennatus these benefits were detected for other demersal chondrichthyes on several prey 4 2 fishing impacts on the demersal chondrichthyes in calabrian food web overexploitation e 0 50 was estimated only in 1995 for g melastomus and the sh elasm group as a consequence of the commercial interest in r asterias and m mustelus sartor et al 2017 the analysis of overall trends for all the elasmobranchs within the investigated food web showed a decrease in exploitation rates from 1995 to the other investigated periods in particular this decrease of e rate could be linked to the reduction in nominal fishing effort for the bottom trawl started in gsa 19 from the end of the 1990s carlucci et al 2018a maiorano et al 2010 russo et al 2017 the negative mti impacts due to trawling on g melastomus e spinax sh elasm and shb elasm decrease with time differently the indirect impacts due to trawling were high and stable mostly for the d licha sl elasm pisc and sl srchim bent fgs the indirect impacts of the fishing gears can be considered as the result of fisheries demersal chondrichthyes competition for elasmobranch prey although the reduction in the fishing efforts was observed critical impacts due to non selective gears trawls continue to affect the elasmobranch population dynamics through competition for their prey especially with the sharks identified as apex predators and distributed in the bathyal zones d licha c cf uyatoand t nobiliana moreover the recovery time of the elasmobranchs impacted by the fishery could change according to their life history traits for instance g melastomus and s canicula seem to withstand fishing pressure showing a high survival rate when discarded peristeraki et al 2020 differently r asterias and m mustelus are commercial species more sensitive and exposed to the multiple fishing pressures trawl and small scale fishery showing a historical decline in the mediterranean sea that require a longer recovery time of their populations colloca et al 2017 fortibuoni et al 2017 these aspect could explain the opposite trends observed for the bathyal groups and shallower group of chondrichthyes when experiencing a reduction in fishing effort while the former increase in biomass the latter decrease over time finally the results obtained by investigating the competition between demersal chondrichthyes and fishing gears represent a first attempt to assess the influence of these predators on the harvested resources the evidence detected proves that the landings prey overlaps are generally low medium foi 0 40 being at the highest values but always less than 0 50 during the period of overfishing condition 1995 thus the commercial resources in the area are scarcely impacted by the demersal chondrichthyes 5 conclusions this study provides several snapshots of the calabrian food web covering a time period of 20 years and updating information on the elasmobranchs which are too often over aggregated and based on poorly representative data in food web modelling goedegebuure et al 2017 understanding the trophic roles of the top predators is a fundamental key to the control mechanism driving food web stability through the dynamic functioning of the ecosystems hammerschalg et al 2019 the demersal chondrichthyes when represented in their diversity show highly interconnected roles through their specific feeding strategies interspecific competition and behaviour heupel et al 2014 this study underlines the positive effects of demersal chondrichthyes on the lower levels of the food web benthic primary producers and on species with important commercial value such as the deep water red shrimps therefore the identification of some elasmobranch species as beneficial predators of both commercial and discard species highlights their importance to ensure regulation services and to support stability of the natural capital in particular the bathyal sharks have proved to be very important in their control role of the food web mostly because they can assume different trophic positions as apex predators d licha or meso predators e spinax and g melastomus the fishing pressure exerted by non selective gears trawl net is confirmed to have a great impact on the demersal chondrichthyes and especially the species distributed on the coastal shelf indeed the presence along the calabrian coasts of marine canyons limiting the displacement of fishing effort to more accessible grounds offers an ecological refuge that contributes to their protection especially from trawling the implementation of appropriate spatial planning and conservation measures is required to guarantee valuable flows of goods and services for sustainable management of these ecosystems mostly because their protection could combine biodiversity conservation and fisheries management

24652,the maintenance of natural capital and the stability of regulation services of marine ecosystems has proved to be linked to the conservation of key species supporting the ecosystems function chondrichthyes are key top predators and their removal from marine ecosystems due to fishing exploitation could lead to changes in species interactions and biomass that can negatively influence the provision of ecosystems services the ecological role of the demersal chondrichthyes living in the marine food web of the calabrian area in the northern ionian sea central mediterranean sea was analysed by means of ecological indicators derived from ecopath mass balance food web models estimated in their stationary states during the periods 1995 1997 2003 2005 and 2013 2015 the trophic web model was described by 57 functional groups 7 of which representing the demersal chondrichthyes which were described by their biomass t km2 production and consumption rate diet landings t km2 e discards t km2 remarkable changes in biomass were recorded for shark and rays as a consequence of changes in fishing patterns and oceanographic regime shift named bimodal oscillating systems bios demersal chondrichthyes occupy high trophic positions in the calabria food web showing trophic levels higher than 4 1 with the d licha identified as the main apex predators while e spinax and g melastomus as meso predators the pattern of the consumption flows highlighted a potential sensitivity of e spinax and g melastomus to the changes in deep waters circulation caused by the bios acting on the entire ecosystem of the ionian sea d licha was identified as the main keystone predators in all the investigated periods the analysis of the trophic indirect and direct impacts shows the role of the demersal chondrichthyes as beneficial predators with positive effects on several preys results also showed that g melastomus and the shelf elasmobranchs group e g raja asterias mustelus mustelus etc were overexploited in 1995 and that all groups of sharks and rays underwent to a decrease of exploitation rate over time chondrichthyes showed medium low values of overlap with the fishing gears 0 50 with the more relevant values estimated between the shelf elasmobranch group and passive nets and other gears according to the findings of this work the protection of chondrichthyes could combine biodiversity conservation and fisheries management objectives therefore it is envisaged the implementation of appropriate spatial planning and conservation measures for these top predators to guarantee valuable and sustainable flows of ecosystem goods and services keywords marine food web keystone species top down control regulation services natural capital ecosystem overfishing 1 introduction the maintenance of natural capital has proved to be linked to the conservation of key species supporting the ecosystems function as well as the stability of regulation services in different marine ecosystems hammerschlag et al 2019 sergio et al 2008 in particular the loss of top predators strongly affects the structure and functioning of entire ecosystems through cascading effects down the trophic levels of marine food webs estes et al 2011 the removal of sharks and rays from marine ecosystems due to fishing exploitation could often favour the alteration of top down controls with the release of meso predators the increase in their predation rates as well as their consumption on the species of basal trophic levels ferretti et al 2010 2013 heithaus et al 2008 heupel et al 2014 this can lead to a simplification of the ecosystem and changes in species interactions that can negatively influence the provision of ecosystems services such as the human food supply hammerschlag et al 2019 paradoxically although fishery obtains great advantages in terms of ecosystem stability from the roles of chondrichthyes in the marine food web as a counterpart they receive the most relevant negative impact from human exploitation such as the by catch of several fishing gears and the competition for the food resources dulvy et al 2014 in fact as reported by the international union for the conservation of nature and the iucn shark specialist group chondrichthyes are critical species of international concern i e global shark trends project 2018 2020 and assessed against threats according to the principles of biological sustainability within the international plan of action for conservation and management of sharks fischer et al 2012 because they are highly sensitive to fishing pressure and able to reflect the status of entire marine ecosystems davidson et al 2015 sharks and rays appear to be particularly vulnerable to exploitation because of their k selected life history strategy characterized by slow growth late attainment of sexual maturity long life spans low fecundity and natural mortality as well as a close relationship between the number of young produced and the size of the breeding biomass if overfished many shark populations would take several decades to recover baum et al 2003 bradai et al 2018 dulvy et al 2000 ferretti et al 2008 stevens et al 2000 in particular as by catch and discard of bottom trawlers and small scale multispecies fisheries the demersal chondrichthyes have low resilience to fishing pressure when suffering direct and indirect fishing impact follesa et al 2019 in fact the main direct effects of fishing can very often result in changes in their abundance size structure life history parameters and at the extreme could even lead to extinction colloca et al 2017 myers and worm 2003 indeed the indirect effects involve trophic interactions through selective removal of predator or prey species in the community as well as removal of competitors species replacement and enhancement of food supply through discards stevens et al 2000 while the role played by large pelagic sharks in the mechanisms of top down control in the oceanic ecosystems has been widely investigated baum and worm 2009 and reference therein the knowledge of the trophic controls exerted by small medium demersal elasmobranchs in the marine food web are less well known especially in the mediterranean sea as reported in the last assessment on the conservation status of the chondrichthyes in the mediterranean sea at least half of the rays 50 16 of 32 species face an elevated risk of extinction as well as 54 of sharks 22 of 41 whereas the only chimaera species chimaera monstrosa is considered least concern in these waters dulvy et al 2016 in that study the lack of adequate scientific information was also stated as the main limitation for implementing effective management measures for chondrichthyes in this regard the scarce availability of data from commercial fisheries in many mediterranean areas as well as the scarce application of holistic approach to investigate the chondrichthyes interactions in the food web highlights the need for an enlarged and deeper use of fishery independent data such as from scientific surveys to assess the current status of demersal chondrichthyes peristeraki et al 2020 from this perspective modelling approaches such as ecopath mass balance models www ecopath org christensen et al 2008 represent a valuable tool to describe the structure of the food web by integrating the fishing dynamics trophodynamic models allow formulation of ecological hypotheses about complex trophic regulations and the potential ecosystem effects of fishing that are difficult to detect with experimental field observations in this regard several food web models have been developed in the mediterranean sea coll and libralato 2012 but few studies have been focused on demersal chondrichthyes exploring their ecological roles and the fishing impact tecchio et al 2013 or testing some management scenarios for the conservation of commercial species coll et al 2013 remarkably the understanding of the trophic roles of sharks and rays is often not investigated at a local regional and macro regional scale although they play a key role in the food webs of the mediterranean sea sensu piroddi et al 2015 in the northern ionian sea central eastern mediterranean sea a total of 22 sharks 10 batoids and 1 chimaera were recorded during the eu international mediterranean trawl survey medits and previous studies identified these species as an important component of the demersal assemblage maiorano et al 2010 sion et al 2004 in particular the geographic distribution pattern of these species shows the existence of two specific groups of demersal chondrichthyes in the calabrian area between punta alice and capo spartivento giove et al 2010 fig 1 these conditions seem to be influenced by a narrow shelf a steep slope and several submarine canyons close to the coast especially in the southern calabrian area capezzuto et al 2010 a food web model is available for the area but its results are mainly focused on the description of general traits of the investigated ecosystem ricci et al 2019 in this particular model the chondrichthyes species were aggregated into 5 functional groups exploring a limited time period 1995 1997 which do not describe the trophic role of each shark and ray in the marine food web over a longer period in this study we overcome these limitations by increasing the modelling representation of some demersal chondrichthyes species in order to investigate their trophic roles their importance as keystone species in the food web and their trophic impacts on the other species within the demersal assemblage a set of ecological and fishing indicators was derived from mass balance food web models estimated during 3 time periods between 1995 and 2015 with a temporal scale of 10 years amongst the 3 investigated periods during which remarkable changes in abundances were recorded for shark and rays as a consequence of oceanographic regime shift as well as changes in the fishing pattern in the area in particular fishing indicators have been used to compare the competition between the demersal chondrichthyes and the fishery by means of the consumption of their prey and catches respectively finally this study adopts an ecosystem perspective by means of multi species modelling to provide advice for the management system to set effective conservation measures as required in the goals for sustainable development of the united nations goal 14 life below water duarte et al 2020 the eu common fishery policy and the marine strategy framework directive msfd kopp et al 2016 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the north western ionian sea nwis located in the central mediterranean sea fig 1 is characterized by complex geomorphology and oceanography as well as generally low productivity lazzari et al 2012 the general hydrographic conditions determine substantial differences in salinity and temperature values within the nwis area and the large scale circulation undergoes decadal changes resulting in local modification of physical biogeochemical and ecological conditions in particular the ionian area is impacted by relevant changes in the deep water circulation of the ionian gyre which invert its direction from cyclonic to anticyclonic and vice versa affecting the nutrient cycling the primary production and the abundance and distribution of the species and demersal assemblages borzelli et al 2009 capezzuto et al 2010 carlucci et al 2018a d ortenzio et al 2003 klein et al 1999 this changes occur with a decadal oscillation linked to the adriatic water circulation system named bimodal oscillating systems bios civitarese et al 2010 the south western calabrian coasts are characterized by a generally narrow shelf and numerous submarine canyons located along the coasts senatore et al 1980 the environmental complexity of the area reflects the presence of several demersal faunal assemblages distributed along the depth gradient capezzuto et al 2010 carlucci et al 2018a d onghia et al 1998 maiorano et al 2010 the most important demersal resources that are both target of commercial fisheries and prey of chondrichthyes are represented by the red mullet mullus barbatus on the continental shelf european hake merluccius merluccius and deep water rose shrimp parapenaeus longirostris over a wide bathymetric range as well as deep water red shrimps aristeus antennatus and aristaeomorpha foliacea on the slope d onghia et al 2003 crotone and reggio calabria represent the most important fisheries along the calabrian coast mainly characterized by large trawlers 10gt maiorano et al 2010 in addition the presence of nursery areas for commercial species such as p longirostris and a foliacea in the gulf of squillace and the gulf of corigliano respectively carlucci et al 2009 colloca et al 2015 starting from the end 90 s a significant positive trend in the biomass of demersal chondrichthyes has been detected through the fishery independent trawl surveys maiorano et al 2019 the domain of the calabrian food web model cal extends from punta alice to capo spartivento for approximately 3469 km2 in the depth range 10 800 m fig 1 2 2 the ecopath modelling approach ecopath within the ecosim ewe modelling approach www ecopath org christensen et al 2008 was used to develop the food web model in the study area the ewe approach has been developed over the last 30 years and it is now widely used for building and analysing mass balance food web models of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide christensen and walters 2004 colléter et al 2015 ewe allows the static e g agnetta et al 2019 time dynamic e g celić et al 2018 and spatio temporal dynamic e g coll et al 2016 food web model approaches to be implemented through the ecopath ecosim and ecospace modules respectively food webs are described by means of functional groups fgs each representing a species a life stage of a species or a group of species with similar trophic ecological and physiological features links between fgs are formally described by a set of linear equations christensen et al 2008 the state variables are the biomasses of the groups and the parameters include the production rate p bi consumption rate q bi diet composition dcij unassimilated food u qi catches yi and exports ei for each group the system of equations is solved in ecopath by providing ewe with information on three out of the four basic parameters bi p bi q bi and the ecotrophic efficiency eei which represent the proportion of the production that is used in the system by fisheries and predators further details on the ewe modelling approach can be found in review literature christensen and walters 2004 christensen et al 2008 heymans et al 2016 2 3 model structure definition of functional groups the food web models realized in this study are based on the functional groups already used in a previous model build in the calabrian area representing the period 1995 1997 ricci et al 2019 the model was updated with several modifications regarding the aggregations of the demersal chondrichthyes species which were described by 7 fgs for detail see par 2 4 in particular the demersal and benthopelagic domains are described by the mediterranean international trawl survey medits time series 1995 2015 the 276 sampled species were aggregated into 29 fgs based on similarity in quantitative diet information and in bathymetric distribution of species ricci et al 2019 table 1 the methods is based on the ecological assumption that a consumer diet is influenced by the availability of resources in the area where it lives defined by the bathymetric layer preferred by the species in fact the depth is the most important environmental drivers structuring the demersal and benthopelagic assemblages carlucci et al 2018a and the assumption is that species belong to similar trophic ecological functional group when they have similar diet and similar preferred depth the centre of gravity cog daget 1976 was used as synthetic measure of the depth to which a species shows the highest biomass concentration the quantitative information on diet preferences in weight have been collected for 129 species on a total of 276 species sampled in the benthopelagic and demersal assemblages of study areas through the scientific published and grey literature both of local and nearby geographical areas the analysis of diet and bathymetric distribution data has been carried out by implementing a bi clustering on the matrix of prey predator relationships also using the vector of weighting factor cog implemented by means of a microsoft visual basic routine for more details to see ricci et al 2019 the remaining 147 species lacking in diet information were successively grouped according to their life history traits information from qualitative diets and habitat preferences identified by a self organizing map analysis carlucci et al 2018a some species of particular commercial interest within the demersal and benthopelagic assemblages have been described in an individual fg european hake m merluccius red mullet m barbatus the anglers lophius budegassa and l piscatorius the deep water shrimps the red giant shrimp a foliacea the blue and red shrimp a antennatus and the deep water rose shrimp p longirostris the 29 fgs were named using a trinomial nomenclature reporting indications on the bathymetric layer first code shelf sh shelf break shb slope sl the taxonomy of the group middle part and the characteristic feeding habits of the group last part table 1 moreover 18 other living fgs describing components of the ecosystem were added namely 7 additional functional groups were used to describe the planktonic domain small phytoplankton large phytoplankton macro meso and microzooplankton bacterioplankton and gelatinous plankton these groups were defined on the basis of compartments and size classes used in biogeochemical models used to hindcast and forecast mediterranean productivity and ocean biogeochemistry https marine copernicus eu di biagio et al 2019 achieving a good resolution in the description of the trophic interactions in the planktonic community christensen et al 2008 the pelagic domain was described through additional 8 functional groups the loggerhead turtle seabirds the large medium and small pelagic fishes the fin whale and the odontocetes the benthic domain was described through additional 4 functional groups macrobenthic invertebrates polychaetes suprabenthic crustaceans and seagrasses and seaweeds thus the final food web model is described by a total of 57 fgs including 3 groups of non living matter detritus marine snow and discards in particular the marine snow as suspended particulate organic matter and the detritus benthic organic matter represent the two pathways in the detritus chain exploited by the bacterioplankton and scavengers respectively heymans et al 2016 2 4 demersal chondrichthyes in the northern ionian sea the life history traits and annual catch data of demersal chondrichthyes species sampled in the study area are reported in table 2 data were obtained from 29 experimental hauls carried out each year from 1995 to 2015 in the study area within the eu medits project the experimental trawl net used for the sampling of the demersal species was characterized by a codend mesh size of 20 mm stretched mesh and the hauls were distributed according a random stratified sampling design anonymous 2017 the demersal chondrichthyes are described by a total of 18 species sampled in the area and aggregated into 7 functional groups see table 1 in particular the kitefin shark dalatias licha the velvet belly in agreement with asfis lantern shark etmopterus spinax and the blackmouth catshark galeus melastomus are represented as individual fgs in the food web model this choice was based on the observation that these latter species are continuously present during the time series and their overall biomass was higher than 75 of the demersal chondrichthyes biomass sampled from 1995 2015 in addition a total of 16 diets of demersal chondrichthyes in weight estimated by means the stomach contents and stable isotope analysis were acquired for several mediterranean areas by consulting the literature and the fishbase dataset froese and pauly 2019 www fishbase org table 2 2 5 model parametrization and biomass input data the input parameters and data sources for biomasses t km 2 annual production and consumption rates p b and q b diets diet composition matrices and data sources and annual fishery landings and discards are reported in ricci et al submitted the diet information derived from several mediterranean areas preferring the information close to the study area ricci et al 2019 the ee was fixed for the polychaets and macrobenthic invertebrate groups at a value of 0 90 gelatinous plankton and suprabenthic crustacean groups at a value of 0 95 and for the macro and mesozooplankton fgs at a value of 0 99 heymans et al 2016 the biomass data from the medits trawl surveys do not account for the catchability of the fishing gear and thus data were corrected using a catchability factor by species qi obtained from the literature whenever possible fiorentino et al 2013 fraser et al 2007 in some instances catchability by species for demersal species was evaluated by comparison of medits estimates with other data e g benthic samples other fishing gears stock assessments in order to determine more accurate absolute densities at sea although this implies great uncertainty it is a necessary step which is not always explicit in ewe modelling see for example arreguin sanchez 1996 biomass data of marine mammals and marine turtles were estimated using abundance data n km 1 obtained from the obis seamap carlucci et al 2018b halpin et al 2009 and the mean individual weight used in other models see ricci et al 2019 landings by species were obtained by the fisheries and aquaculture economic research for the ministry of agricultural food and forestry policies mipaaf data referring to annual commercial landings for the period 2006 2015 were processed in order to reconstruct disaggregated landings for trawls otb long lines ll passive nets gnd other gears mix and purse seines ps in the period 1995 2005 discards of the trawl fishery by species with commercial value undersize individuals were calculated using the discard rate estimated by stecf 2004 the discard fraction for species or functional groups of no commercial value was calculated on the basis of the proportion of commercial and non commercial discards in medits data and local references d onghia et al 2003 discard for others gears was obtained from the scientific literature relative to neighbouring mediterranean areas tsagarakis et al 2014 and reference therein eventually correcting discard rate on the basis of local knowledge three mass balance models were developed describing the calabrian food web in three distinct periods each reconstructed as an average of 3 years of data the models represent the following periods 1 1995 1997 hereafter called model 1995 2 2003 2005 hereafter called model 2005 and 3 2013 2015 hereafter called model 2015 2 6 prebal analysis and balancing steps the pre balancing analysis prebal link 2010 was carried out to assess the coherence of the input data with the basic thermodynamic laws rules and principles of ecosystem ecology at the system level heymans et al 2016 appendix a figure a1 a3 the reliability of data input was assessed by means of the pedigree index an index used to assess the overall quality of the data and the model on the basis of the source of data and its accuracy ranging between 0 low quality and 1 high quality christensen and walters 2004 when the pedigree index indicated less reliable values in the dc matrix net food conversion efficiencies p q 0 05 0 3 respiration assimilation r a 1 and production respiration p r 1 ratios were checked to confirm they were within expected limits christensen et al 2008 cannibalism causes several problems in balancing the model heymans et al 2016 therefore it was decreased for hake sharks and rays demersal fish groups cephalopods shrimps and crabs groups initially the models were manually balanced consisting of slight modifications to the production rates within the range by species the input data p b and q b were re evaluated during the balancing steps by adopting a top down approach mackinson and daskalov 2007 nevertheless the models were finally balanced using a monte carlo routine ecoranger developed in ewe version 5 christensen et al 2008 that allows model parameters to be changed and progressive improvement of the mass balance to be evaluated considering an initial realistic uncertainty in the diet matrix 10 changes for all diet matrix elements thus the diet matrix was the only parameter set to change in the automatic routine during the balancing phases in order to bound the model results while most important input parameters differentiating between the models were the biomasses and catches of functional groups the monte carlo routine allowed three balanced models to be obtained objectively by exploring the range of trophic uncertainty and adapting the diet matrix to the biomass at sea and fishing pressure catches observed in each period 2 7 ecological indicators ecological indices were used to analyse the role of chondrichthyes groups species and ecosystem structure based on trophic flow analysis thermodynamic concepts and network theory christensen and walters 2004 in particular the fractional trophic level tl ecotrophic efficiency ee omnivory index oi niche overlap index o mixed trophic impacts mti and keystoness index ksi were calculated for each fg the tl of each fg summarizes the ecological position of each fg within the food web pauly et al 1998 and was calculated from the tl average of their prey i weighted by the proportion of each prey in the diet j dcij by convention primary producers and detritus have tl 1 pauly and watson 2005 the oi was calculated for each fg as the variance of the trophic level of a consumer s prey groups pauly et al 1993 when the oi value is zero the consumer in question is specialized i e it feeds on a single trophic level a large value indicates that the consumer feeds on many trophic levels libralato 2013 the niche overlap o was estimated amongst the chondrichthyes fgs 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 using the equation proposed by pianka 1973 o j k i 1 n p j i p k i i 1 n p j i 2 p k i 2 where p ji and p ki are the proportions of the resource i used by species j and k respectively the index is symmetrical and assumes values between 0 and 1 a value of 0 suggests that the two species do not share resources 1 indicates complete overlap and intermediate values show partial overlap in resource utilization the consumption flows t km 2 y 1 were estimated for each chondrichthyes fg analysing which of the consumed groups belong to the pelagic 7 fgs demersal 36 fgs splitted into shelf shelf break and slope planktonic 7 fgs and benthic 4 fgs compartments for the aggregation of the fgs in the compartments see table 1 similarly the biomass t km 2 y 1 and production t km 2 y 1 of the preys exploited by the chondrichthyes were estimated aggregating the groups in the previous compartments the ksi was calculated through mixed trophic impact analysis mti ulanowicz and puccia 1990 by quantifying the relative impact of biomass change within a component impacting group on each of the other components impacted groups in the food web including the fishing gears positive negative mti values indicate an increase decrease in biomass of the group j due to a slight increase in biomass of the impacting group i therefore negative impacts can be associated to prevailing top down effects and positive ones to bottom up effects libralato et al 2006 the overall effect εi of a group i represents all the direct or indirect mti values of group i on all the other groups in the food web ε i j 1 n m i j 2 where the impact on the group itself m ij with i j is not considered and ε i is calculated as a relative value with respect to the maximum libralato et al 2006 the parameter pi is the relative biomass of the group in the food web excluding detritus biomass p i b i k 1 n b i thus the ksi used in this study is expressed as k s i i c l b c

the keystoness rank allowed to the importance of the fgs in the food web models that are system specific to be identified coll and libralato 2012 heymans et al 2014 the mti analysis was carried out on the chondrichthyes fgs in order to explore i the changes in the trophic impacts during the 3 investigated time periods at the level of single fgs ii the direct and indirect trophic impacts exerted on the fgs aggregated into the same compartments of consumption flow analysis direct trophic impacts were considered as the impacts on the groups consumed by the chondrichthyes fgs identified as the prey in their diet information while the indirect trophic impacts corresponded to the impacts on the groups not consumed by the chondrichthyes fgs ulanowicz and puccia 1990 positive direct impacts on a prey allowed the identification of the chondrichthyes fg as beneficial predators 2 8 fishing impact indicators the fishing impacts on the food webs and the interactions with chondrichthyes were assessed by a set of indicators the exploitation rate e which represents the proportion of fishing mortality f on the total mortality z was calculated for each chondrichthyes fg e values higher than 0

estimated in all investigated periods and a comparative analysis between fishing gears and chondrichthyes fgs was carried out considering their overall effects positive and negative on all living fgs of the calabrian food web according to the pianka index approach 1973 the chondrichthyes fishing gears competition in the calabrian food web was assessed by means the fishery overlap index foi

respectively the index is included between 0 no overlap and 1 full overlap on the exploited resources the fishing gears can be considered as consumer in the food web with their diet represented by species composition in the catches or landings and their consumption flows in the ecosystems trites et al 1997 the overlap was estimated by means of the consumption flows t km 2 y 1 of each of the chondrichthyes fgs and the landings t km 2 y 1 of each fishing gear transforming the absolute values into relative values 3 results 3 1 trophic traits of demersal chondrichthyes within the food web the trophic levels of the demersal chondrichthyes fgs estimated during the 3 investigated periods highlighted the high trophic positions covered by these species which ranged between 4 18 sl srchim bent in 2015 and 5 15 sl elasm pisc in 1995 fig 2 a appendix b table b1 d licha showed tl values greater than 4 80 for all demersal chondrichthyes the tls values estimated in 2015 were lower than the values detected in 1995 and 2005 the group sl srchim bent and e spinax showed the highest values of the omnivory index 0 50 in 2015 and 0 41 in 2005 respectively while the lowest mean value was estimated for the sh elasm group 0 10 in 2005 and 2015 fig 2b the highest values of the niche overlap were estimated between g melastomus e spinax 0 62 in all investigated periods d licha e spinax 0

the coastal shelf 0 37 t km 2 y 1 fig 3 a appendix b table b3 in addition a clear reduction in total consumption was detected in the successive periods e spinax showed the highest value of total

the most important values were estimated for the prey in the shelf break 0 05 t km 2 y 1 benthic compartment 0 04 t km 2 y 1 and slope 0 03 t km 2 y 1 the sl elasm pisc group showed the lowest consumption flows 0 02 t km 2 y 1 in all investigated periods the sh crabs and the sh demersal fishes bent crust were the most consumed prey in 1995 while the prey distributed on the slope shrimps bp myctophids sl bathypelagic fishes pisc sl decapods scav and sl squids were mainly exploited in 2005 and 2015 appendix b table b3 in addition the consumption of the macrozooplankton and bathyal cephalopods increased over time while that of small and medium pelagic fishes fell the consumptions flows pattern observed during the investigated periods was consistent with the available biomass of the preys exploited by the demersal chondrichthyes fig 3b c in particular the increase of biomass availability was detected in 2005 for the planktonic and benthic prey exploited by the e spinax and sh elasm group similarly an increase of the biomass of the prey exploited in the slope layer by d licha was detected in 2005 and 2015 the keystoness analysis showed differences in the importance of the chondrichthyes within the calabrian food web in the 3 investigated periods with the more relevant values estimated for d licha e spinax g melastomus and the group sh elasm fig 4 appendix b table b1 d licha showed ks and rel total impact values higher than other elasmobranch groups in 1995 and 2015 occupying the 2nd and 3rd positions in the ks rank respectively the importance of e spinax increased in the ks ranks over time reaching 6th position in 2005 and 7th in 2015 in particular the ks and rel total impact of e spinax in 2005 were higher than the values of other elasmobranch groups and its relative biomass increased in this period g melastomus attained its highest ks rank positions in 2005 10th and in 2015 11th as well as showing its highest relative biomass values in these two periods the group sh elasm was characterized by high values of ks rel total impact and relative biomass in 1995 13th rank position while lower indices values and rank positions were observed in 2005 40th and in 2015 33rd the remaining groups show changes in ks values always below the 23rd position during all investigated periods the highest negative impacts played by the chondrichthyes were focused on the functional groups placed at the apex of the food web tl 4 1 for all investigated periods mti analysis fig 5 d licha fg 10 showed very high negative impacts on e spinax and g melastomus in all investigated periods in addition the negative impacts on the sl squids increased in 2015 differently the kitefin shark positively impacted its prey sl bathypelagic fishes pisc shrimps bp and sl decapods scav in all periods e spinax fg 11 showed negative impacts on the sl squids the shb bobtail squids and the sl bathypelagic fishes pisc with the highest values in 2005 in contrast positive impacts were seen on some of its prey for example rg shrimp myctophids and rb shrimp g melastomus fg 12 showed an increase in negative impacts on the sl squids over time other negative impacts were detected on the sl elasm pisc and sl cephalopods with very high values in 2015 on the contrary positive impacts were detected on the rb and rg shrimps and on some its prey such as the sl bathypelagic fishes pisc fg macrourids and sl crabs the sh elasm group fg 8 showed high negative impacts on the shb squids shb demersal fishes gen and sh demersal fishes bent crust in 1995 with a decrease in the values in 2005 and 2015 positive impacts were estimated on basal groups such as polychaets macrobenthic invertebrates seagrasses and algae the sl elasm pisc group fg 9 proved to be beneficial predators of the sl bathypelagic fishes pisc and sl cephalopods groups in all investigated periods the sl srchim bent group fg 6 showed negative and positive impacts especially in 2005 having negative impacts on e spinax g melastomus sl cephalopods shb squids and sl decapods scav differently the group was a beneficial predator of sl squids and shb bobtail squids finally the shb elasm group fg 7 showed considerable impacts in 2015 with negative values on the shb demersal fishes pisc b catshark shb squids hake sl srchim bent sl crabs and gel plank fgs on the contrary positive impacts were seen on anglers r mullet sh cephalopds macrobent inv and the elasmobranch group was a beneficial predator of small pelagic fishes and shb fishes crust the direct and indirect impacts calculated for the chondrichthyes fgs are reported in fig 6 in all investigated periods d licha showed negative direct impacts on the slope prey and positive direct impacts on the shelf break preys in all investigated periods e spinax and g melastomus had negative direct impacts on the prey distributed on the slope and in the shelf break in addition both species had negative indirect impacts on the pelagic compartment and positives on the slope groups the difference between the two species was the positive indirect impact on the planktonic compartment of e spinax in all investigated periods whereas g melastomus showed positive indirect impacts on the benthic compartments in 2015 the sh elasm group had its highest negative direct impacts on the prey on the shelf in the shelf break and on the slope while positive impacts were detected on the benthic and pelagic compartments the indirect impacts of the same group were exerted on all compartments in 1995 with the negative values only for shelf groups in the successive periods the values of indirect impacts decreased lastly negligible impacts were detected for the remaining groups 3 2 fishing interactions with the demersal chondrichthyes the exploitation rates estimated showed a decrease for all groups of sharks and rays over time appendix b table b1 g melastomus and sh elasm showed values higher than 0 50 in 1995 the negative direct and indirect impacts of fishing gears on the sharks and rays species were mainly from trawling in all periods appendix b table b4 an increase in the negative impacts of trawling were observed for the sl srchim bent fg while the sh elasm fg the velvet belly shark and the blackmouth catshark all showed a decrease in the negative impacts over time d licha and the sl elasm pisc showed similar negative impacts in all periods the positive impacts by trawling were only detected for the shb elasm in 2005 and 2015 and the velvet belly shark in 2015 lastly the long line had high negative impacts on the sl srchim bent fg in 1995 and 2005 the proportions of the overall effects between both the fishing gears and the chondrichthyes fgs changed in the investigated periods fig 7 appendix b table b4 in all periods trawling showed the highest negative effects on the food web with percentage values higher than 20 in addition trawling played the highest positive impacts on the food web with percentage values higher than 10 in 1995 and 2005 other gears exerted negative effects on the food web in 1995 and 2015 with a percentage value higher than 10 long lines exerted high negative effects in 2005 with a percentage value of 11 2 passive nets showed their high negative effects in 2015 with a percentage value of 10 2 differently the chondrichthyes fgs showed percentage values of negative effects less than 10 in all modelled periods the groups with the most impact in 1995 were the sh elasm fg and the kitefin shark with percentage values of negative effects equal to 6 1 and 5 6 respectively in 2005 e spinax and g melastomus were the sharks having the most impact with percentage values of negative effects equal to 6 5 and 5 2 respectively finally the species having the most impact in 2015 were d licha g melastomus and e spinax all with negative effects higher than 5 in all periods the total of the negative effects of fishery were greater than the negative effects of the chondrichthyes fgs in all investigated periods the fishery overlap index foi estimating the fisheries chondrichthyes overlap showed low values amongst the d licha e spinax g melastomus and all fishing gears fig 8 the sh elasm group showed medium values of overlap with the passive nets in 1995 0 49 in 2005 0 47 and with the other gears in 2005 0 48 in 1995 and 2005 the sl srchim bent group showed medium values of overlap with the trawl net the sl elasm pisc fg showed a medium value of overlap with the purse seine in 2005 finally all overlap ranged between low and low medium values in 2015 4 discussion this study analysed the ecological role of the demersal chondrichthyes living in the marine food web in the calabrian area a portion of the northern ionian sea central mediterranean sea in three different periods complex ecosystem models will result in large uncertainty in any input and output in an orthodox approach to uncertainty analysis essington 2007 while in this work a more pragmatic approach combining prebal and montecarlo was preferred to quantitatively to evaluate the accuracy and consider diet variability into model development respectively the ecological roles of the demersal chondrichthyes observed by means the models have shown different degrees of spatial and temporal variability with changes detected in their biomasses consumptions and trophic impacts these conditions are due to the combination of several environmental and anthropogenic drivers acting on the dynamic population of all species with effects on the shape of the trophic structure in particular the trophic interactions climate change and the fishing activities are identified as the most important drivers which act in cumulative way corrales et al 2017 2018 in particular some demersal chondrichthyes in the northern ionian sea have shown responses to the reduction of the fishing effort and to the variability of the primary production and prey as described in the successive paragraphs further studies are needed to deepen the dynamic relationships between these changes and the environmental and anthropogenic drivers however they could be faced with different specific analytical and methodological approaches 4 1 trophic roles of demersal sharks and rays in the calabrian food web demersal chondrichthyes occupy high trophic positions in the food web of the area investigated showing tls 4 1 in particular t nobiliana centrophorus cf uyato and s blanville grouped in sl sharks bp and d licha were characterized by the highest tls in the food web and they are the apex predators in the bathyal domain the former species have a diet mainly based on fin fishes followed by the decapods and benthopelagic squids barría et al 2015 while d licha shows a feeding preference for the demersal fishes and the small sharks g melastomus and e spinax coherently with the results from the stable isotope analysis reported in the study of navarro et al 2011 decapods and cephalopods seem to represent secondary prey in the diet of the kitefin shark but their consumption as a food supply could change in the long term considering the increases in abundance of cephalopods and crustaceans observed in the northern ionian sea maiorano et al 2010 in all investigated periods chimaera monstrosa dipturus oxyrhynchus and oxynotus centrina in the sl srchim bent group together with scyliorhinus canicula and raja miraleuts shb elasm showed the lowest trophic positions as a result of their feeding on benthic resources such as decapods and cephalopods polychaetes amphipods and macrozooplankton this variety of prey explains the high values of the omnivory index bengil et al 2019 mulas et al 2019 valls et al 2011 the species belonging to the group sh elasm raja asterias dasyatis pastinaca mustelus mustelus torpedo torpedo and torpedo marmorata occupy a intermediate trophic position in the study area with feeding preferences for crustaceans benthic cephalopods demersal fishes and small pelagic fishes in line with the observations from other mediterranean areas barría et al 2015 coll et al 2013 mulas et al 2019 similarly g melastomus and e spinax showed intermediate trophic levels amongst the demersal chondrichthyes confirming the estimates observed in the mediterranean sea stergiou and karpouzi 2002 therefore except for d licha and the sl elasm pisc the demersal chondrichthyes can be mainly considered meso consumers in the calabrian food web heupel et al 2014 a remarkable decrease in the trophic levels was observed for all demersal chondrichthyes in 2015 this trend could mimic ecosystem overexploitation with the removal of high trophic levels preys and lowering of the chondrichthyes tls stevens et al 2000 the oi values estimated by the models indicated feeding on a narrow range of trophic levels for the shallowest sharks and rays on the other hand an increase in a generalist strategy with feeding on a wide range of trophic levels was detected in the bathyal elasmobranchs especially for the bathyal sharks and rays exploiting benthic resources this condition could be explained by the low production and availability of food resources in deep environments inducing top predators to adopt more generalist feeding strategies carrassón et al 1992 valls et al 2011 the consumption flows aggregated for categories provide information on the transfer of energy and biomass between different compartments and bathymetric layers the pattern of consumption observed for g melastomus and e spinax is of particular interest they consume prey distributed on the shelf break and the slope in similar proportions reflecting the ontogenetic changes in their diets and the difference in feeding items exploited over the depth gradient fanelli et al 2009 the temporal changes in the consumption flows estimated on the basis of the objective mass balance approach are influenced by the oscillation in the biomasses of the predators and prey in the food web in fact the estimated increase in consumptions flows and biomass observed for d licha show a parallel biomass increase of both e spinax and g melastomus its preferred prey navarro et al 2014 in contrast the consumption flows of the velvet belly sensu asfis lantern shark and balckmouth catshark could be influenced by the changes in the deep waters circulation known as bimodal oscillating systems observed over a decadal time scale in different mediterranean areas lavigne et al 2018 these modifications in the hydrological regime have proven to affect temperature salinity and nutrient availability as well as the primary production in the ionian basin civitarese et al 2010 the effects of these hydrological changes have been detected in the planktonic community mazzocchi et al 2003 and could drive the abundance oscillations of the decapods a foliacea a antennatus and munida rutllanti capezzuto et al 2010 d onghia et al 2012 maiorano et al 2013 as well as the overall structure modifications of the demersal and benthopelagic assemblages carlucci et al 2018a in particular the species with benthopelagic habits feeding on low trophic levels seem to be more sensitive to the hydrological changes impacting on the primary productivity which triggers processes of regime shift conversi et al 2010 in this light e spinax and g melastomus could be more sensitive than other demersal sharks which feed on the macrozooplankton myctophids and benthopelagic cephalopods fanelli et al 2009 moreover e spinax proved to be more influenced than g melastomus by the trophic changes which occurred in the period 2003 2005 when increases in the primary production were detected in the study area d ortenzio et al 2003 the higher consumption detected for e spinax could be due to its benthopelagic feeding habits while g melastomus is more linked to demersal and benthic prey fanelli et al 2009 bengil et al 2019 similarly to e spinax the sl srchim bent group was characterized by an increase in its consumption likely due to the exploitation of prey with low trophic levels the sh elasm fg was characterized by an almost exclusive consumption of shallowest benthic demersal and pelagic resources moreover the strong fall in consumption after 1995 reflects the decline of the species induced by overfishing conditions see section 4 2 the keystoness index selected in this study emphasizes the importance of fgs characterized by high tl values and rare species valls et al 2015 temporal changes in the positions of the keystoness rank were detected for all the analysed demersal chondrichthyes groups the highest importance as keystone predators was observed for d licha in all the investigated periods e spinax and g melastomus ranked higher in importance as keystone species in 2005 and 2015 when the increase in their mixed trophic impacts due to their biomass increases occurred in gsa 19 maiorano et al 2010 2019 the bathyal piscivorous sharks showed lower keystoness index values the importance of the bathyal sharks as keystone species in the food web had previously been observed in other areas where the demersal sharks were often aggregated in the same functional groups for instance g melastomus proved to be a keystone species in the cold water corals habitats in the northern ionian sea vassallo et al 2017 d licha e spinax and g melastomus aggregated in one functional group were detected as keystone predators in the food web on the catalan continental slope tecchio et al 2013 similarly e spinax d licha t nobiliana and c cf uyato aggregated in a single functional group had already been identified as keystone predators in the calabrian food web in the period 1995 1997 ricci et al 2019 however details on their importance as single species have not been provided before in the shelf domain the group of sh elasm r asterias m mustelus d pastinaca showed a decrease from a relatively high rank position in 1995 to lower positions in 2005 and 2015 although the species are aggregated into different groups the low ks values detected in this study for the calabrian model are similar to those reported for r asterias in the north western mediterranean sea coll et al 2013 corrales et al 2015 and for m mustelus in the eastern ionian moutopoulos et al 2013 substantially rays and skates in mediterranean sea are often characterized by lower keystoness values than sharks piroddi et al 2015 the top down controls in the marine food web are fairly complex and could trigger trophic cascades involving the basal trophic levels or control mechanisms focused on the meso consumers release invertebrate prey release and specific decline of some prey baum and worm 2009 heupel et al 2014 in the calabrian food web the bathyal sharks have proven to be important keystone predators assuming different control roles in fact d licha acts as an apex predator with a negative control on e spinax and g melastomus meso predators and positive effects on some of their low trophic level prey such as decapods scavenger benthopelagic shrimps benthic cephalopods and bobtail squids notably these meso predators act as negative controls on the same prey positively favoured by d licha thus introducing counter balancing effects within the same demersal chondrichthyes groups nevertheless changes in biomass observed for the sh elasm shb elasm sl srchim bent and g melastomus fgs result in the variation of their impacts on the food web in particular the former group has a large indirect impact often positive as detected on the benthic primary producers in 1995 successively the impacts vanished over time highlighting a potential alteration of the trophic cascade in the coastal shelf concerning g melastomus its strong top down controls could be explained by its higher abundance in the submarine canyons which characterize the calabrian geomorphology and represent fishing shelter areas for this demersal shark as observed in the bari canyon in the southern adriatic sea sion et al 2019 finally the analysis of impacts due to the demersal chondrichthyes within the complex food web highlights their role as beneficial predators for instance a foliacea and a antennatus benefit from higher indirect positive effects due to d licha e spinax and g melastomus in fact the sharks predation on consumers and or competitors of the two bathyal shrimps has proved to have a greater impact than the direct predation on a foliacea and a antennatus these benefits were detected for other demersal chondrichthyes on several prey 4 2 fishing impacts on the demersal chondrichthyes in calabrian food web overexploitation e 0 50 was estimated only in 1995 for g melastomus and the sh elasm group as a consequence of the commercial interest in r asterias and m mustelus sartor et al 2017 the analysis of overall trends for all the elasmobranchs within the investigated food web showed a decrease in exploitation rates from 1995 to the other investigated periods in particular this decrease of e rate could be linked to the reduction in nominal fishing effort for the bottom trawl started in gsa 19 from the end of the 1990s carlucci et al 2018a maiorano et al 2010 russo et al 2017 the negative mti impacts due to trawling on g melastomus e spinax sh elasm and shb elasm decrease with time differently the indirect impacts due to trawling were high and stable mostly for the d licha sl elasm pisc and sl srchim bent fgs the indirect impacts of the fishing gears can be considered as the result of fisheries demersal chondrichthyes competition for elasmobranch prey although the reduction in the fishing efforts was observed critical impacts due to non selective gears trawls continue to affect the elasmobranch population dynamics through competition for their prey especially with the sharks identified as apex predators and distributed in the bathyal zones d licha c cf uyatoand t nobiliana moreover the recovery time of the elasmobranchs impacted by the fishery could change according to their life history traits for instance g melastomus and s canicula seem to withstand fishing pressure showing a high survival rate when discarded peristeraki et al 2020 differently r asterias and m mustelus are commercial species more sensitive and exposed to the multiple fishing pressures trawl and small scale fishery showing a historical decline in the mediterranean sea that require a longer recovery time of their populations colloca et al 2017 fortibuoni et al 2017 these aspect could explain the opposite trends observed for the bathyal groups and shallower group of chondrichthyes when experiencing a reduction in fishing effort while the former increase in biomass the latter decrease over time finally the results obtained by investigating the competition between demersal chondrichthyes and fishing gears represent a first attempt to assess the influence of these predators on the harvested resources the evidence detected proves that the landings prey overlaps are generally low medium foi 0 40 being at the highest values but always less than 0 50 during the period of overfishing condition 1995 thus the commercial resources in the area are scarcely impacted by the demersal chondrichthyes 5 conclusions this study provides several snapshots of the calabrian food web covering a time period of 20 years and updating information on the elasmobranchs which are too often over aggregated and based on poorly representative data in food web modelling goedegebuure et al 2017 understanding the trophic roles of the top predators is a fundamental key to the control mechanism driving food web stability through the dynamic functioning of the ecosystems hammerschalg et al 2019 the demersal chondrichthyes when represented in their diversity show highly interconnected roles through their specific feeding strategies interspecific competition and behaviour heupel et al 2014 this study underlines the positive effects of demersal chondrichthyes on the lower levels of the food web benthic primary producers and on species with important commercial value such as the deep water red shrimps therefore the identification of some elasmobranch species as beneficial predators of both commercial and discard species highlights their importance to ensure regulation services and to support stability of the natural capital in particular the bathyal sharks have proved to be very important in their control role of the food web mostly because they can assume different trophic positions as apex predators d licha or meso predators e spinax and g melastomus the fishing pressure exerted by non selective gears trawl net is confirmed to have a great impact on the demersal chondrichthyes and especially the species distributed on the coastal shelf indeed the presence along the calabrian coasts of marine canyons limiting the displacement of fishing effort to more accessible grounds offers an ecological refuge that contributes to their protection especially from trawling the implementation of appropriate spatial planning and conservation measures is required to guarantee valuable flows of goods and services for sustainable management of these ecosystems mostly because their protection could combine biodiversity conservation and fisheries management

24653,the logistic equation is the simplest way to limit the growth in population dynamics when ecological interactions come into play different types of models can be found e g for consumer resource systems the generalized lotka volterra equation is widely used to model direct competition or predator prey systems and for mutualistic systems a functional response that limits the unbounded growth due to the mutual benefit is needed usually holling s type ii based on a recent general model of population dynamics with intraspecific interactions we present a factored general logistic model of population dynamics with inter and intraspecific interactions a major advantage of this model is that it can be used for any type of interspecific ecological interaction and also for beneficial or detrimental intraspecific interaction and always in a bounded way in this study we write a general logistic model in a factored way to obtain the stationary solutions by a system of simple linear equations and we formulate the analytical expression for the jacobian matrix of all the stationary solutions for an arbitrary number of populations we also show that this simple model can be used to represent complex ecological systems as an illustration we study some examples such as a stable direct competition with intraspecific cooperation a predator prey system with cooperative preys a mutualism with harmful intraspecific interactions and a real bacterial system with 4 populations keywords ecological interaction population dynamics verhulst model logistic equation intraspecific interaction predator prey mutualism competition 1 introduction the study of populations is a mathematical approach to model the number of individuals of one or several species population dynamics tries to model the temporal evolution of such populations by means of phenomenological differential equations for the growth rate in such equations one finds positive terms representing factors that increases the growth rate and negative terms that accounts for limiting factors decreasing the growth rate ecological interactions are usually formulated as density dependent factors sometimes leading to nonlinear terms murray 1993 turchin 2003 thus when one tries to study ecosystems of many interacting species the models become systems of nonlinear equations with many interacting terms in these cases numerical simulations are usually the only way to find stationary solutions turchin 2003 the complexity of ecological systems has involved a great effort to model populations of interacting species the first principle of this discipline is well known for an isolated population the exponential growth stated by malthus and the limit to that unbounded growth proposed by verhulst as a logistic equation verhulst 1838 this equation includes a negative squared term biological brake that converts the malthusian exponential solution to a sigmoid curve 1 d x d t r x a x 2 in this model the limiting value of the population is the carrying capacity given by k r a this limiting value can be included explicitly in the equation extracting the r x factor which is known as the r k formulation pearl and reed 1920 2 d x d t r x 1 x k however ecology implies interactions with environment and with other species this is the root of complexity interactions between many elements result in unexpected and complex dynamics montoya et al 2006 the complexity of ecological systems makes it difficult to model populations dynamics with simple equations mayfield and stouffer 2017 letten and stouffer 2019 aladwani and saavedra 2019 for example much effort has been devoted to the so called stability complexity problem formulated by may 1972 but see also allesina and tang 2015 and references therein an open question is the coexistence of many competitive species that can be observed in nature which is contrary to the principle of competitive exclusion to the best of our knowledge only simple real systems with a small number of species have been successfully modeled in population dynamics interactions are usually modeled as a density dependent functional response in the growth rate lotka volterra equations represent a well studied system of two species interacting as predator and prey lotka 1925 volterra 1926 in this simple and successful model growth of both species are limited by a negative term in the functional other more detailed models have included different time scales a fast behavioral time scale and the slow time scale for reproduction as the predator prey ratio in the functional response arditi and ginzburg 1989 the generalization of this model for an arbitrary number of populations that also allows direct competition the generalized lotka volterra glv model is one of the most used models in the study of systems with several species 3 d x i d t x i x i f i x where x is the vector of the n populations and f i x is the effective growth rate given by 4 f i x r i j b i j x j where b i j represents the effect of population j on population i this relationship between populations can be positive whether an increase on population j improves the growth rate of population i negative if it implies a detriment on population i or null if the presence of population j is irrelevant for population i this general expression for the population dynamics may model different food webs or even direct competition however this formulation cannot be used to model mutualism because it can lead to an unlimited growth rate in case of beneficial interactions other proxies have been proposed where the density dependent benefit in the interaction is written as a functional response holling 1959 and this functional accounts for specific limitations in the benefit arditi and ginzburg 2012 in the case of facultative mutualism it has been shown that a stable equilibrium can be reached when mutualistic benefit occurs at low densities wolin and lawlor 1984 the most popular functional that limits the mutualistic benefit is the holling s type ii functional where this benefit is restricted by means of the handling time wright 1989 another proxy assumes a linear mutualistic functional response but a nonlinear intraspecific density dependence moore et al 2018 with a θ logistic model the linear mutualistic functional can be stabilized in order to reformulate this generalized model for mutualism garcía algarra et al 2014 proposed a logistic mutualistic model that overcomes this unbounded growth this model includes a negative term using the logistic equation idea with the interspecific interaction term within the brake term 5 x i x i r i j i b i j x j a i c i j i b i j x j x i where i runs from i 1 to n the coefficient a i has the same meaning as in eq 1 and c i is another positive coefficient of intraspecific competition in this case it is the effect of members of the same population respect to the interaction with other species associated also to a carrying capacity k i 1 c i this equation can also be written as 6 x i x i r i a i x i j i b i j x j 1 c i x i the last term of this equation resembles the verhulst s equation 2 where the vegetative growth rate is replaced by another contribution to the growth rate due to the interspecific interactions in other words each contribution to the growth rate has its own limiting term in the form of verhulst s brake a new deeply study of eq 6 stucchi et al 2020 reveals that it can be used to model systems with any kind of ecological interactions from mutualism to interspecific competition and the intraspecific interaction cooperation or cannibalism can also be included in the effective growth rate so the logistic mutualistic model eq 6 can be easily extended to include intraspecific interaction if one allows the summand j i in both sums the intraspecific interactions are generally included as competition for resources however specific intraspecific interactions such as cooperation or cannibalism are frequently omitted in population dynamics equations furthermore it has been seen that these intraspecific terms play an important role in the stability of the system turchin 2003 stucchi et al 2020 for this equation to model any type of interspecific interaction allowing competition and predator prey interactions as well as mutualism the coefficients b i j are allowed to be positive and negative according to the sign of the interaction positive for beneficial and negative for harmful interactions without any restriction on the parameter b i j eq 5 reads as 7 x i x i r i j 1 n b i j x j a i c i j 1 n b i j x j x i i 1 n where b i j represents the effect of population j over i and it can be positive negative or null and a i and c i are positive limiting coefficients in eq 7 the coefficients a i and c i both are positive constants that play the role of the logistic brake as in eq 2 a i has the same meaning of saturating the vegetative growth as in the verhulst equation and c i controls the limit of the growth due to biological interactions as it has been reported in stucchi et al 2020 this generic equation can be used to model any type of interaction even communities of several species with a combination of interspecific and intraspecific interactions as an example a nursery pollination system composed by a plant male and female insects larvae and parasitoids reported in stucchi et al 2019 however the analytical study of this equation is difficult due to the third order of the polynomial the aim of this work is to study a simplified expression of this general model stucchi et al 2020 with two important conditions to allow the inclusion of any type of ecological interaction inter and intraspecific interactions and to allow a more treatable mathematical analysis we propose a factored version of the general model where each factor has a clear ecological meaning furthermore they are first order polynomials so the task of finding stationary solutions is reduced to solving a system of linear equations and linear stability analysis is a relatively low cost computational task even for systems of many populations taking as a starting point that in nature a consolidated ecosystem is locally stable this model will be very useful for studying real multi species systems because all solutions are bounded although the new model has one parameter less than the general model in stucchi et al 2020 and therefore loses some of the interesting solutions it gains mathematical and computational simplicity in the following section we introduce a factored version of this logistic model that reduces the complexity of the equation but can produces similar dynamic behaviors our goal is the study of the stationary solutions of this model for any type of inter and intraspecific interactions and their linear stability analysis in section 3 we analyze the linear stability of the stationary solutions for one two and n populations in order to illustrate the versatility of this model in section 4 we describe four numerical examples three different ecological interactions in 2 population systems such as a direct competition with intraspecific cooperation a predator prey with cooperation among preys and a mutualistic system with negative intraspecific effects in addition we simulate a real bacterial system with four populations with beneficial and harmful interactions whose stationary solution is the coexistence of all species 2 a factored logistic model for inter and intraspecific interactions in order to simplify eq 7 an overall limit for growth rate can be assumed as a general carrying capacity and then one may write a i r i c i in such a way that the logistic term is the same for all contributions to the growth rate with this condition eq 7 can be rewritten as 8 x i x i r i j 1 n b i j x j 1 c i x i it is easy to see that this expression is a logistic equation 2 with an effective growth rate 9 r eff i r i j 1 n b i j x j note that now the functional f i has a factored form 10 f i x r eff i x 1 c i x i x i the condition for the stationary solutions is 11 r eff i x 1 x n 1 c i x i x i 0 due to this factored expression it is easy to obtain the solutions as extinctions x i 0 populations reaching their carrying capacity x i 1 c i the equilibrium points given by the condition of null effective growth rate 12 r eff i x 1 x n 0 and any combination of these partial solutions note that one can find some populations extinct some others in their carrying capacities and the rest at the equilibrium point given by the system of eq 12 this generic model allows us to write and solve the conditions for every stationary solution of a system of any number of interacting species and any combination of interactions between species next we study the analytic expression of these solutions for one and two populations for an arbitrary number of populations finding the finite stationary solutions turns out to be as simple as solve a system of linear equations one population the simplest system is only one species interacting with the environment and with itself in this case eq 11 can be written dropping the subscripts as 13 f x x r b x 1 c x 0 where b is the interaction coefficient accounting for active intraspecific interaction between individuals of the same species such as cannibalism or cooperation and c is the intraspecific competition coefficient the stationary solutions are i the extinction x 0 ii the carrying capacity x 1 c and iii a new stationary solution between them x r b as can be seen in fig 1 a as we show in the linear stability analysis section this new solution has two different meanings according to the sign of b when b 0 the intraspecific interaction is beneficial i e a cooperative system and r 0 negative vegetative growth rate this new solution set the extinction threshold i e for a population below this value cooperation cannot overcome the deficit in the resources taken from the environment and the population goes to extinction however when population is above this threshold cooperation guarantees sufficient resources to reach a positive effective growth rate increasing population up to its carrying capacity see fig 1 b on the other hand when b 0 the intraspecific interaction is detrimental i e cannibalism or harmful intraspecific interaction the new stationary solution corresponds to a stable node that set the final population below its carrying capacity this means that for a certain range of parameters active intraspecific interaction cannibalism is more limiting than the intraspecific competition otherwise intraspecific competition will set the final population i e the carrying capacity this simple model for only one population reveals that including beneficial or detrimental intraspecific interactions changes the classical behavior with the emergence of a new stationary solution the price to pay is that we have increased the degree of the polynomial two populations in the case of two populations eq 8 can be written as x 1 r 1 b 11 x 1 b 12 x 2 1 c 1 x 1 x 1 f 1 x 1 x 2 14 x 2 r 2 b 21 x 1 b 22 x 2 1 c 2 x 2 x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 this third order system may exhibit up to nine non negative stationary solutions it is easy to see that in addition to the total extinction there are four partial extinctions when only one population remains 15 0 1 c 2 1 c 1 0 0 r 2 b 22 r 1 b 11 0 there are three possible finite stationary solutions in the carrying capacity the total carrying capacity and two partial carrying capacities when one population is in its carrying capacity and the other one has null effective growth rate 16 1 c 1 1 c 2 1 c 1 r 2 b 22 b 21 b 22 c 1 r 1 b 11 b 12 b 11 c 2 1 c 2 and finally there is a possible stationary solution for the two populations with null effective growth rate it is easy to obtain from the two linear equations eq 12 17 r 1 b 22 r 2 b 12 b 12 b 21 b 11 b 22 r 2 b 11 r 1 b 21 b 12 b 21 b 11 b 22 n populations for n populations the number of finite stationary solutions rises as 2 n from every populations in their carrying capacities 1 c 1 1 c n to all the species with null effective growth rate r eff i 0 including any combination of these two types of solutions the stationary solution for all populations with zero effective growth rate can be obtained from the system of linear equations eq 12 finite solutions can also be obtained with m populations in their carrying capacity and the remaining n m populations with zero effective growth rate solving this system of n m linear equations is a feasible task even for a large number of populations 18 r eff i r i j cc b i j c j k cc b i k x k 0 i cc where cc is the set of species in their carrying capacities the fact of having a factored expression for the growth rate makes easy to see all the solutions in a null clines diagram in such a picture the trajectory lines are limited by the parallelogram defined by the hyperplanes x i 0 and x i 1 c i in this diagram the stationary solutions are defined by the crossing of the null clines murray 1993 it is easy to see from eq 18 that the null clines corresponding to the condition of zero effective growth rate r eff i 0 are also hyperplanes so in addition to the total carrying capacity and the partial extinctions the intersections of the hyperplanes r eff i 0 with the limiting parallelogram and with other hyperplanes r eff k 0 define the rest of the finite stationary solutions as an example fig 2 shows the phase trajectories for two populations with two set of null clines orange dashed lines correspond to f 1 0 and green lines correspond to f 2 0 in addition to the total and partial extinctions and the carrying capacity 100 100 defining the limiting rectangle the oblique green line g 2 0 crosses the vertical orange line at 100 72 and both oblique lines cross at 55 33 phase trajectories around this point are spirals towards this stationary solution and then this is an stable node 3 linear stability analysis in order to study the linear stability of these finite stationary solutions the jacobian matrix can be easily obtain for any number of populations the partial derivatives of eq 10 for n species have the following structure 19 f i x i r eff i 1 2 c i x i b i i x i 1 c i x i 20 f i x j b i j x i 1 c i x i where the term r eff i may include dependencies on every species note that these expressions are simplified in the carrying capacity where the factor 1 c i x i vanishes 21 f i x i x i 1 c i r eff i 22 f i x j x i 1 c i 0 and at the null effective growth rate where the first summand in eq 19 is null 23 f i x i x i r eff 0 b i i x i 1 c i x i 24 f i x j x i r eff 0 b i j x i 1 c i x i one population for only one population to study the linear stability at the stationary points we just need to obtain the sign of its derivative at these points when the derivative is negative the stationary solution is stable and when the derivative is positive the solution is unstable the derivative of f x can be reduced to 25 d f x d x r eff 1 2 c x b x 1 c x where r eff r b x and now we can explore its sign at the three stationary solutions x 0 x 1 c and x r b it is easy to see that the solution x 0 is stable only when r 0 and the carrying capacity x 1 c is stable when r eff 0 i e r b c note that both solutions are stable at the same time when 0 r b c with b 0 the interesting point is the new stationary solution x r b in the case of b 0 cooperation this solution is unstable and at the same time extinction and carrying capacity are stable i e this new point is a saddle point that set a threshold for survival when the population is below this threshold the system is unstable and goes extinct however when the population is above this threshold cooperation guarantee the resources and populations can survive in the carrying capacity on the other hand for b 0 cannibalism this new solution is stable when b r c provided r 0 note that extinction is an unstable solution when r 0 and population increases towards its carrying capacity however with cannibalistic interaction population only reaches the new solution the carrying capacity becomes unstable that goes to zero as cannibalism becomes predominant two populations the stability condition for the total extinction solution is obtained from the jacobian matrix 26 j 0 0 r 1 0 0 r 2 therefore total extinction is a stable solution when r 1 0 and r 2 0 at the total carrying capacity 1 c 1 1 c 2 the jacobian matrix is 27 j 1 c 1 1 c 2 r eff 1 0 0 r eff 2 r 1 b 11 c 1 b 12 c 2 0 0 r 2 b 21 c 1 b 22 c 2 the condition for the total carrying capacity to be a stable solution is that both terms in the diagonal are negative i e when both effective growth rates are positive as can be expected in a mutualistic system as it is mentioned above there are four feasible partial extinctions two of them with the surviving populations in its carrying capacity and the other two with the surviving populations with null effective growth rate r eff i x j 0 r i b i i x i 0 x i r i b i i the jacobian matrix for partial extinction with the other population in its carrying capacity e g 0 1 c 2 is a mixture of the two previous jacobian matrices as follows 28 j 0 1 c 2 r 1 0 0 r eff 2 where r eff 2 is evaluated at 0 1 c 2 and symmetrically for the solution 1 c 1 0 the stationary solution 0 1 c 2 is stable as long as the species 1 s vegetative growth rate is negative and the species 2 s effective growth rate is positive r 1 0 and r 2 b 22 c 2 similar condition applies to the solution 1 c 1 0 the other partial extinctions emerge when one population goes extinct and the other one reaches null effective growth rate let us study for instance the stationary solution 0 r 2 b 22 i e when population 2 reaches zero effective growth rate let us call this value x eff 2 the first term in eq 19 becomes zero and the jacobian matrix reads 29 j 0 x eff 2 r 1 0 b 21 x eff 2 1 c 2 x eff 2 b 22 x eff 2 1 c 2 x eff 2 where x eff 2 r 2 b 22 and then the condition for linear stability is that the vegetative growth rates are r 1 0 and r 2 0 partial carrying capacities can be defined when one population reaches its carrying capacity and the other one has zero effective growth rate for example 1 c 1 x eff 2 where now x eff 2 r 2 b 22 b 21 c 1 b 22 in these cases the jacobian matrix has also a simple expression 30 j 1 c 1 x eff 2 r 1 b 11 c 1 b 12 x eff 2 0 b 21 x eff 2 1 c 2 x eff 2 b 22 x eff 2 1 c 2 x eff 2 the condition for this point to be stable is again that both diagonal terms are negative the first diagonal term is minus the effective growth rate at that point and the second diagonal term is the intraspecific interaction growth rate with the logistic term at that point note that any stationary solution satisfies x i 1 c i so the logistic term is always positive or zero so this second term is negative when the intraspecific interaction coefficient b 22 is negative i e when species 2 exhibits a detrimental intraspecific interaction cannibalism simplifying the expression b 22 x eff 2 r 2 b 21 c 1 the condition for the interspecific interaction coefficient is b 21 r 2 c 1 the same condition must be fulfilled for the solution x eff 1 1 c 2 exchanging subscripts 1 by 2 31 j x eff 1 1 c 2 b 11 x eff 1 1 c 1 x eff 1 b 12 x eff 1 1 c 1 x eff 1 0 r 2 b 22 c 2 b 21 x eff 1 finally the null effective growth rate solution x eff 1 x eff 2 17 has the jacobian matrix 32 j x eff 1 x eff 2 b 11 x 1 1 c 1 x 1 b 12 x 1 1 c 1 x 1 b 21 x 2 1 c 2 x 2 b 22 x 2 1 c 2 x 2 that can be written briefly as 33 j x eff 1 x eff 2 b 11 x 1 b 12 x 1 b 21 x 2 b 22 x 2 where x i x i 1 c i x i the eigenvalues λ 1 2 can be obtained from 34 j λ i 0 whose solutions are 35 λ 1 2 1 2 t r j t r 2 j 4 det j 1 2 b 11 x 1 b 22 x 2 b 11 x 1 b 22 x 2 2 4 b 12 b 21 x 1 x 2 1 2 b 11 x 1 b 22 x 2 b 11 x 1 2 b 22 x 2 2 2 x 1 x 2 2 b 12 b 21 b 11 b 22 n populations then the generic jacobian matrix for these finite stationary solutions has two types of row entries species i in the carrying capacity 36 j i i r eff i j i k 0 for k i species j satisfying r eff j 0 37 j j k b j k x eff j 1 c j x eff j b j k j j where j j x eff j 1 c j x eff j is the same for all columns k of the same row j so for rows corresponding to populations in the carrying capacity the generic jacobian matrix is zero except for the diagonal entry with terms equal to minus the effective growth rate and for rows corresponding to species j with null effective growth rate entries are b j k j j j 1 c i x eff j 0 r eff i 0 b j k j j b j j j j when all populations are in their carrying capacities the jacobian matrix is diagonal and the entries are the effective growth rates with a minus sign this means that this stationary solution will be locally stable when all the effective growth rates are positive 4 numerical simulations the fact of having a logistic factor in the dynamic equations guarantees a bounded evolution for populations with any set of parameters provided that the initial populations are below their carrying capacities in a phase trajectories plot all the evolutions are limited by the parallelogram defined by the hyperplanes x i 0 and x i 1 c i here we show the phase trajectories for different two species systems in the following figures we depict the null clines for both populations in orange for f 1 0 and green for f 2 0 and the intersections with filled and empty dots corresponding to stable and unstable stationary solutions respectively phase trajectories crossing these orange null clines are vertical growth rate for population 1 is zero and phase trajectories crossing the green null clines are horizontal growth rate for population 2 is zero but there are no lines crossing the limits of the parallelogram as in stucchi et al 2020 this generic model can be used to study different ecological interactions from competition to mutualism including also intraspecific interactions as cooperation or cannibalism in addition to the standard solutions for these basic ecological interactions the third order terms arising from the logistic factor allow new finite solutions that account for more complex interactions for illustrative purposes we only show some examples of interspecific ecological interactions that depict new ecological scenarios by effect of the intraspecific interactions reflecting the diversity of ecological communities this model can reproduce predator prey with cooperative preys some real predator prey systems do not exhibit large oscillations in their populations as expected from classic lotka volterra equations as an example lions wildebeest and zebras in the kruger national park south africa maintain roughly stationary or non oscillating populations over the years fay and greeff 2006 this equilibrium can be obtained when preys are numerous and they benefit from cooperation fig 3 a mimics this scenario where the stable spiral solution of the lotka volterra model not shown in this picture has been shifted to the stable node by the cooperation term in prey x axis where it becomes a stable node black dot fig 3 b depicts two time evolutions of predator and prey for two different initial conditions the blue and red squares in the phase trajectories plot prey in solid line and predator in dashed line note that the left y axis is for predators and the right y axis is for the preys the stable stationary solution in this picture is at 1000 30 as an example of large prey population and small predator population fay and greeff 2006 competition with intraspecific cooperation the general principle of competitive exclusion appears in competition models where the interspecific term is negative for both populations however this principle can be altered if populations benefit of cooperation in some occasions a positive intraspecific interaction may balance the negative effect of an interspecific interaction such as direct competition here we show that eq 14 with negative interspecific interactions may lead to a stable stationary solution by effect of intraspecific cooperation fig 4 a depicts the phase trajectories for two populations with direct competition but with the benefit of intraspecific cooperation two saddle points emerge at each carrying capacity the lines from these points to the origin are the separatrices that define the basin of attraction to the stable stationary solution in this way any initial condition between both separatrices not shown ends at the total carrying capacity for example the blue square in fig 4 a meanwhile any initial condition outside these lines ends in one of the partial extinctions according to the principle of competitive exclusion for example the red square in this case the effect of cooperation is not enough to overcome the advantage of its competitor fig 4 b shows the time evolution of these two points blue lines end in the carrying capacity because the initial point is inside the attraction basin of the total carrying capacity however the red dashed line corresponding to species 2 goes to zero because at the initial stage species 1 got some advantage over species 2 and finally the weaker goes extinct mutualism with harmful intraspecific interaction another interesting example can be observed in a mutualistic system due to intraspecific interaction in a bounded mutualistic system i e garcía algarra et al 2014 both species reach their carrying capacity because of their mutual benefit however if one of the species exhibits harmful intraspecific interaction referred to as cannibalism for example individuals fighting for a territory or males killing cubs the final stable equilibrium point may be far from its carrying capacity polis 1981 figs 5 and 6 show the effect of harmful intraspecific interactions in a obligate mutualistic system in fig 5 a the total carrying capacity becomes unstable due to the negative intraspecific interaction however the mutualistic benefits for population 1 are high enough to overcome the harmful effect so that population 1 reaches its carrying capacity the crossing of the oblique null clines defines an stationary solution corresponding to a saddle point most phase trajectories go to the right however this saddle point forces the lines for small populations of species 2 to turn around and end in the partial extinction at 10 0 fig 5 b depicts the time evolution of two populations with close initial conditions showed in picture 5 a the blue square is in the attraction basin of the carrying capacity and the red square is below the separatrix not shown red dashed line shows that population of species 2 goes extinct and species 1 decreases to its stationary state without partner however blue lines show that both populations reach the partial carrying capacity in fig 6 we show another mutualistic system but in this case the stable solution is in the carrying capacity of population 2 although the vegetative growth rate for population 2 is negative obligate mutualism note that oblique orange line in fig 6 a has a greater slope and crosses the null cline f 2 0 at the carrying capacity bacterial system of 4 populations finally we have tried to model a complex bacterial system in these systems the number of populations is usually high and the relationships between them may even depend on the species present recently some authors have developed mathematical algorithms to infer the growth rate and interaction matrix from microbiota data stein et al 2013 alshawaqfeh et al 2017 in these papers the authors have used time series datasets with abundances of operational taxonomic units referred to as otus from dna sequencing their algorithms are based on fitting the empirical data to a glv model eqs 3 and 4 so we could not use all their parameters for our equations in order to verify that eq 8 can also model complex multispecies systems we have taken the growth rates and the interaction matrix for some species from reference alshawaqfeh et al 2017 and looked for stable stationary solutions some subsets of species do not have stable solutions as an example we show in fig 7 the time evolution for 4 otus starting at random initial conditions after a transitory regime all of them reach the stable stationary solution in this example only otu2 reaches its carrying capacity the growth rates r i and the interaction parameters b i j are shown in table 1 note that the interaction matrix has positive and negative entries which means that bacterial species have beneficial interactions with some species and harmful interactions with others 5 discussion modeling ecological systems with population dynamics models has devoted much effort in the last decades however finding multi species coexistence in complex ecosystems with different types of interactions is a very difficult task on the other hand complex models fitted to achieve this goal are often mathematically hard to handle high order polynomials or with hyperbolic terms we are aware that complexity of nature cannot be modeled with simple equations and these population dynamics models are useful as benchmarks around stationary solutions consequently it is important that the model can provide feasible stationary solutions the solution space with the phase trajectories gives us an idea of the dynamic evolution with very simple equations we get only trivial and basic solutions with complex models we can obtain many stationary solutions but we must study the feasibility and the ecological meaning of that solutions a good approach can be reached with third order polynomial equations as it has been reported in stucchi et al 2020 low order polynomial equations have some advantages as the study of stationary solutions linear stability analysis phase trajectories and parameter stability without much effort the factored version of this model introduced in section 2 have two main advantages i mathematically the stationary solutions are the extinction the carrying capacity and the condition of null effective growth rate that can be obtained by solving a system of linear equations for an arbitrary number of populations and the linear stability analysis can be studied with a jacobian matrix whose entries are also the sum of linear terms in addition the stationary solutions can be found graphically as the intersection of hyperplanes as shown in figs 2 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 a ii conceptually the three factors of the growth rate have a clear ecological meaning the malthusian term the effective growth rate and the logistic term due to the intraspecific competition the fact that all ecological interactions appear as independent terms in the effective growth rate allows us to analyze the effect of each interaction with this formulation we recover the original interpretation of the logistic term on the other hand this simplified version has one parameter less and this may cause some interesting solutions to be lost moreover as the null clines are straight lines we can only have one finite solution inside the limiting rectangle defined by the carrying capacities the rest of the solutions are located on this limiting rectangle another drawback is the limitation in the initial densities they have to be less than c i 1 however for very small values of c i the model can reproduce the population dynamics for a wide range of population densities just as an illustration we have studied one example of predator prey system one example of competition two examples of mutualism and a real bacterial system with 4 populations in the predator prey system we have shown that a small cooperation effect in prey can lead the system to a stable solution with high prey population this situation can be observed in nature for example in the zebras wildebeest and lions populations reported in fay and greeff 2006 we have also studied a competition system with cooperative populations we have shown a competitive system with two coexisting species as in the ayala s experiments ayala 1969 an experimental invalidation of the principle of competitive exclusion when cooperation comes into play in addition to the partial extinctions a new stable coexistence is feasible in the example of mutualistic system with detrimental intraspecific interaction the carrying capacity becomes unstable two new stable solutions emerge at the carrying capacity of one population and at the partial extinction when an obligate mutualistic population presents detrimental intraspecific interactions it can become extinct even for a high partner population as an example of a multi species real system we have modeled a subset of microbiota abundances otus with the growth rates and the interaction matrix reported in literature alshawaqfeh et al 2017 this complex ecosystem with positive and negatives interaction coefficients all microbes are beneficial for some and harmful for others can be modeled with the simplified version presented in this paper the glv model used by alshawaqfeh et al 2017 to fit the empirical data only reproduced the experimental time intervals however at long times populations exploded or became extinct fig 7 shows the temporal evolution of the four otus modeled with eq 8 and the coexistence of all the stationary populations as summary we have shown that it is possible to model population dynamics of complex ecological systems as the product of three significant factors i a malthusian term accounting for the density dependence of the growth rate ii a effective growth rate including any type of ecological interactions for both interspecific and intraspecific relationships and iii a logistic term representing the intraspecific competition and playing the role of biological brake this factored equation of the general logistic model have been used to study some ecological systems with different types of inter and intraspecific interactions probably the best benchmark for using this model is a microbial community because this complex system involves a large number of species we have shown as an example a bacterial system of 4 populations but we have tested it with more than 10 populations with typical non polynomial equations finding stationary solutions is a very hard task however with eq 18 the non trivial stationary points are the solutions of a simple linear system and the jacobian matrix for the linear stability analysis has also a simple expression for this reason we suggest that this simple model could be used for modeling complex ecological communities made up of many biological species credit authorship contribution statement juan manuel pastor investigation methodology software writing original draft writing revised

24653,the logistic equation is the simplest way to limit the growth in population dynamics when ecological interactions come into play different types of models can be found e g for consumer resource systems the generalized lotka volterra equation is widely used to model direct competition or predator prey systems and for mutualistic systems a functional response that limits the unbounded growth due to the mutual benefit is needed usually holling s type ii based on a recent general model of population dynamics with intraspecific interactions we present a factored general logistic model of population dynamics with inter and intraspecific interactions a major advantage of this model is that it can be used for any type of interspecific ecological interaction and also for beneficial or detrimental intraspecific interaction and always in a bounded way in this study we write a general logistic model in a factored way to obtain the stationary solutions by a system of simple linear equations and we formulate the analytical expression for the jacobian matrix of all the stationary solutions for an arbitrary number of populations we also show that this simple model can be used to represent complex ecological systems as an illustration we study some examples such as a stable direct competition with intraspecific cooperation a predator prey system with cooperative preys a mutualism with harmful intraspecific interactions and a real bacterial system with 4 populations keywords ecological interaction population dynamics verhulst model logistic equation intraspecific interaction predator prey mutualism competition 1 introduction the study of populations is a mathematical approach to model the number of individuals of one or several species population dynamics tries to model the temporal evolution of such populations by means of phenomenological differential equations for the growth rate in such equations one finds positive terms representing factors that increases the growth rate and negative terms that accounts for limiting factors decreasing the growth rate ecological interactions are usually formulated as density dependent factors sometimes leading to nonlinear terms murray 1993 turchin 2003 thus when one tries to study ecosystems of many interacting species the models become systems of nonlinear equations with many interacting terms in these cases numerical simulations are usually the only way to find stationary solutions turchin 2003 the complexity of ecological systems has involved a great effort to model populations of interacting species the first principle of this discipline is well known for an isolated population the exponential growth stated by malthus and the limit to that unbounded growth proposed by verhulst as a logistic equation verhulst 1838 this equation includes a negative squared term biological brake that converts the malthusian exponential solution to a sigmoid curve 1 d x d t r x a x 2 in this model the limiting value of the population is the carrying capacity given by k r a this limiting value can be included explicitly in the equation extracting the r x factor which is known as the r k formulation pearl and reed 1920 2 d x d t r x 1 x k however ecology implies interactions with environment and with other species this is the root of complexity interactions between many elements result in unexpected and complex dynamics montoya et al 2006 the complexity of ecological systems makes it difficult to model populations dynamics with simple equations mayfield and stouffer 2017 letten and stouffer 2019 aladwani and saavedra 2019 for example much effort has been devoted to the so called stability complexity problem formulated by may 1972 but see also allesina and tang 2015 and references therein an open question is the coexistence of many competitive species that can be observed in nature which is contrary to the principle of competitive exclusion to the best of our knowledge only simple real systems with a small number of species have been successfully modeled in population dynamics interactions are usually modeled as a density dependent functional response in the growth rate lotka volterra equations represent a well studied system of two species interacting as predator and prey lotka 1925 volterra 1926 in this simple and successful model growth of both species are limited by a negative term in the functional other more detailed models have included different time scales a fast behavioral time scale and the slow time scale for reproduction as the predator prey ratio in the functional response arditi and ginzburg 1989 the generalization of this model for an arbitrary number of populations that also allows direct competition the generalized lotka volterra glv model is one of the most used models in the study of systems with several species 3 d x i d t x i x i f i x where x is the vector of the n populations and f i x is the effective growth rate given by 4 f i x r i j b i j x j where b i j represents the effect of population j on population i this relationship between populations can be positive whether an increase on population j improves the growth rate of population i negative if it implies a detriment on population i or null if the presence of population j is irrelevant for population i this general expression for the population dynamics may model different food webs or even direct competition however this formulation cannot be used to model mutualism because it can lead to an unlimited growth rate in case of beneficial interactions other proxies have been proposed where the density dependent benefit in the interaction is written as a functional response holling 1959 and this functional accounts for specific limitations in the benefit arditi and ginzburg 2012 in the case of facultative mutualism it has been shown that a stable equilibrium can be reached when mutualistic benefit occurs at low densities wolin and lawlor 1984 the most popular functional that limits the mutualistic benefit is the holling s type ii functional where this benefit is restricted by means of the handling time wright 1989 another proxy assumes a linear mutualistic functional response but a nonlinear intraspecific density dependence moore et al 2018 with a θ logistic model the linear mutualistic functional can be stabilized in order to reformulate this generalized model for mutualism garcía algarra et al 2014 proposed a logistic mutualistic model that overcomes this unbounded growth this model includes a negative term using the logistic equation idea with the interspecific interaction term within the brake term 5 x i x i r i j i b i j x j a i c i j i b i j x j x i where i runs from i 1 to n the coefficient a i has the same meaning as in eq 1 and c i is another positive coefficient of intraspecific competition in this case it is the effect of members of the same population respect to the interaction with other species associated also to a carrying capacity k i 1 c i this equation can also be written as 6 x i x i r i a i x i j i b i j x j 1 c i x i the last term of this equation resembles the verhulst s equation 2 where the vegetative growth rate is replaced by another contribution to the growth rate due to the interspecific interactions in other words each contribution to the growth rate has its own limiting term in the form of verhulst s brake a new deeply study of eq 6 stucchi et al 2020 reveals that it can be used to model systems with any kind of ecological interactions from mutualism to interspecific competition and the intraspecific interaction cooperation or cannibalism can also be included in the effective growth rate so the logistic mutualistic model eq 6 can be easily extended to include intraspecific interaction if one allows the summand j i in both sums the intraspecific interactions are generally included as competition for resources however specific intraspecific interactions such as cooperation or cannibalism are frequently omitted in population dynamics equations furthermore it has been seen that these intraspecific terms play an important role in the stability of the system turchin 2003 stucchi et al 2020 for this equation to model any type of interspecific interaction allowing competition and predator prey interactions as well as mutualism the coefficients b i j are allowed to be positive and negative according to the sign of the interaction positive for beneficial and negative for harmful interactions without any restriction on the parameter b i j eq 5 reads as 7 x i x i r i j 1 n b i j x j a i c i j 1 n b i j x j x i i 1 n where b i j represents the effect of population j over i and it can be positive negative or null and a i and c i are positive limiting coefficients in eq 7 the coefficients a i and c i both are positive constants that play the role of the logistic brake as in eq 2 a i has the same meaning of saturating the vegetative growth as in the verhulst equation and c i controls the limit of the growth due to biological interactions as it has been reported in stucchi et al 2020 this generic equation can be used to model any type of interaction even communities of several species with a combination of interspecific and intraspecific interactions as an example a nursery pollination system composed by a plant male and female insects larvae and parasitoids reported in stucchi et al 2019 however the analytical study of this equation is difficult due to the third order of the polynomial the aim of this work is to study a simplified expression of this general model stucchi et al 2020 with two important conditions to allow the inclusion of any type of ecological interaction inter and intraspecific interactions and to allow a more treatable mathematical analysis we propose a factored version of the general model where each factor has a clear ecological meaning furthermore they are first order polynomials so the task of finding stationary solutions is reduced to solving a system of linear equations and linear stability analysis is a relatively low cost computational task even for systems of many populations taking as a starting point that in nature a consolidated ecosystem is locally stable this model will be very useful for studying real multi species systems because all solutions are bounded although the new model has one parameter less than the general model in stucchi et al 2020 and therefore loses some of the interesting solutions it gains mathematical and computational simplicity in the following section we introduce a factored version of this logistic model that reduces the complexity of the equation but can produces similar dynamic behaviors our goal is the study of the stationary solutions of this model for any type of inter and intraspecific interactions and their linear stability analysis in section 3 we analyze the linear stability of the stationary solutions for one two and n populations in order to illustrate the versatility of this model in section 4 we describe four numerical examples three different ecological interactions in 2 population systems such as a direct competition with intraspecific cooperation a predator prey with cooperation among preys and a mutualistic system with negative intraspecific effects in addition we simulate a real bacterial system with four populations with beneficial and harmful interactions whose stationary solution is the coexistence of all species 2 a factored logistic model for inter and intraspecific interactions in order to simplify eq 7 an overall limit for growth rate can be assumed as a general carrying capacity and then one may write a i r i c i in such a way that the logistic term is the same for all contributions to the growth rate with this condition eq 7 can be rewritten as 8 x i x i r i j 1 n b i j x j 1 c i x i it is easy to see that this expression is a logistic equation 2 with an effective growth rate 9 r eff i r i j 1 n b i j x j note that now the functional f i has a factored form 10 f i x r eff i x 1 c i x i x i the condition for the stationary solutions is 11 r eff i x 1 x n 1 c i x i x i 0 due to this factored expression it is easy to obtain the solutions as extinctions x i 0 populations reaching their carrying capacity x i 1 c i the equilibrium points given by the condition of null effective growth rate 12 r eff i x 1 x n 0 and any combination of these partial solutions note that one can find some populations extinct some others in their carrying capacities and the rest at the equilibrium point given by the system of eq 12 this generic model allows us to write and solve the conditions for every stationary solution of a system of any number of interacting species and any combination of interactions between species next we study the analytic expression of these solutions for one and two populations for an arbitrary number of populations finding the finite stationary solutions turns out to be as simple as solve a system of linear equations one population the simplest system is only one species interacting with the environment and with itself in this case eq 11 can be written dropping the subscripts as 13 f x x r b x 1 c x 0 where b is the interaction coefficient accounting for active intraspecific interaction between individuals of the same species such as cannibalism or cooperation and c is the intraspecific competition coefficient the stationary solutions are i the extinction x 0 ii the carrying capacity x 1 c and iii a new stationary solution between them x r b as can be seen in fig 1 a as we show in the linear stability analysis section this new solution has two different meanings according to the sign of b when b 0 the intraspecific interaction is beneficial i e a cooperative system and r 0 negative vegetative growth rate this new solution set the extinction threshold i e for a population below this value cooperation cannot overcome the deficit in the resources taken from the environment and the population goes to extinction however when population is above this threshold cooperation guarantees sufficient resources to reach a positive effective growth rate increasing population up to its carrying capacity see fig 1 b on the other hand when b 0 the intraspecific interaction is detrimental i e cannibalism or harmful intraspecific interaction the new stationary solution corresponds to a stable node that set the final population below its carrying capacity this means that for a certain range of parameters active intraspecific interaction cannibalism is more limiting than the intraspecific competition otherwise intraspecific competition will set the final population i e the carrying capacity this simple model for only one population reveals that including beneficial or detrimental intraspecific interactions changes the classical behavior with the emergence of a new stationary solution the price to pay is that we have increased the degree of the polynomial two populations in the case of two populations eq 8 can be written as x 1 r 1 b 11 x 1 b 12 x 2 1 c 1 x 1 x 1 f 1 x 1 x 2 14 x 2 r 2 b 21 x 1 b 22 x 2 1 c 2 x 2 x 2 f 2 x 1 x 2 this third order system may exhibit up to nine non negative stationary solutions it is easy to see that in addition to the total extinction there are four partial extinctions when only one population remains 15 0 1 c 2 1 c 1 0 0 r 2 b 22 r 1 b 11 0 there are three possible finite stationary solutions in the carrying capacity the total carrying capacity and two partial carrying capacities when one population is in its carrying capacity and the other one has null effective growth rate 16 1 c 1 1 c 2 1 c 1 r 2 b 22 b 21 b 22 c 1 r 1 b 11 b 12 b 11 c 2 1 c 2 and finally there is a possible stationary solution for the two populations with null effective growth rate it is easy to obtain from the two linear equations eq 12 17 r 1 b 22 r 2 b 12 b 12 b 21 b 11 b 22 r 2 b 11 r 1 b 21 b 12 b 21 b 11 b 22 n populations for n populations the number of finite stationary solutions rises as 2 n from every populations in their carrying capacities 1 c 1 1 c n to all the species with null effective growth rate r eff i 0 including any combination of these two types of solutions the stationary solution for all populations with zero effective growth rate can be obtained from the system of linear equations eq 12 finite solutions can also be obtained with m populations in their carrying capacity and the remaining n m populations with zero effective growth rate solving this system of n m linear equations is a feasible task even for a large number of populations 18 r eff i r i j cc b i j c j k cc b i k x k 0 i cc where cc is the set of species in their carrying capacities the fact of having a factored expression for the growth rate makes easy to see all the solutions in a null clines diagram in such a picture the trajectory lines are limited by the parallelogram defined by the hyperplanes x i 0 and x i 1 c i in this diagram the stationary solutions are defined by the crossing of the null clines murray 1993 it is easy to see from eq 18 that the null clines corresponding to the condition of zero effective growth rate r eff i 0 are also hyperplanes so in addition to the total carrying capacity and the partial extinctions the intersections of the hyperplanes r eff i 0 with the limiting parallelogram and with other hyperplanes r eff k 0 define the rest of the finite stationary solutions as an example fig 2 shows the phase trajectories for two populations with two set of null clines orange dashed lines correspond to f 1 0 and green lines correspond to f 2 0 in addition to the total and partial extinctions and the carrying capacity 100 100 defining the limiting rectangle the oblique green line g 2 0 crosses the vertical orange line at 100 72 and both oblique lines cross at 55 33 phase trajectories around this point are spirals towards this stationary solution and then this is an stable node 3 linear stability analysis in order to study the linear stability of these finite stationary solutions the jacobian matrix can be easily obtain for any number of populations the partial derivatives of eq 10 for n species have the following structure 19 f i x i r eff i 1 2 c i x i b i i x i 1 c i x i 20 f i x j b i j x i 1 c i x i where the term r eff i may include dependencies on every species note that these expressions are simplified in the carrying capacity where the factor 1 c i x i vanishes 21 f i x i x i 1 c i r eff i 22 f i x j x i 1 c i 0 and at the null effective growth rate where the first summand in eq 19 is null 23 f i x i x i r eff 0 b i i x i 1 c i x i 24 f i x j x i r eff 0 b i j x i 1 c i x i one population for only one population to study the linear stability at the stationary points we just need to obtain the sign of its derivative at these points when the derivative is negative the stationary solution is stable and when the derivative is positive the solution is unstable the derivative of f x can be reduced to 25 d f x d x r eff 1 2 c x b x 1 c x where r eff r b x and now we can explore its sign at the three stationary solutions x 0 x 1 c and x r b it is easy to see that the solution x 0 is stable only when r 0 and the carrying capacity x 1 c is stable when r eff 0 i e r b c note that both solutions are stable at the same time when 0 r b c with b 0 the interesting point is the new stationary solution x r b in the case of b 0 cooperation this solution is unstable and at the same time extinction and carrying capacity are stable i e this new point is a saddle point that set a threshold for survival when the population is below this threshold the system is unstable and goes extinct however when the population is above this threshold cooperation guarantee the resources and populations can survive in the carrying capacity on the other hand for b 0 cannibalism this new solution is stable when b r c provided r 0 note that extinction is an unstable solution when r 0 and population increases towards its carrying capacity however with cannibalistic interaction population only reaches the new solution the carrying capacity becomes unstable that goes to zero as cannibalism becomes predominant two populations the stability condition for the total extinction solution is obtained from the jacobian matrix 26 j 0 0 r 1 0 0 r 2 therefore total extinction is a stable solution when r 1 0 and r 2 0 at the total carrying capacity 1 c 1 1 c 2 the jacobian matrix is 27 j 1 c 1 1 c 2 r eff 1 0 0 r eff 2 r 1 b 11 c 1 b 12 c 2 0 0 r 2 b 21 c 1 b 22 c 2 the condition for the total carrying capacity to be a stable solution is that both terms in the diagonal are negative i e when both effective growth rates are positive as can be expected in a mutualistic system as it is mentioned above there are four feasible partial extinctions two of them with the surviving populations in its carrying capacity and the other two with the surviving populations with null effective growth rate r eff i x j 0 r i b i i x i 0 x i r i b i i the jacobian matrix for partial extinction with the other population in its carrying capacity e g 0 1 c 2 is a mixture of the two previous jacobian matrices as follows 28 j 0 1 c 2 r 1 0 0 r eff 2 where r eff 2 is evaluated at 0 1 c 2 and symmetrically for the solution 1 c 1 0 the stationary solution 0 1 c 2 is stable as long as the species 1 s vegetative growth rate is negative and the species 2 s effective growth rate is positive r 1 0 and r 2 b 22 c 2 similar condition applies to the solution 1 c 1 0 the other partial extinctions emerge when one population goes extinct and the other one reaches null effective growth rate let us study for instance the stationary solution 0 r 2 b 22 i e when population 2 reaches zero effective growth rate let us call this value x eff 2 the first term in eq 19 becomes zero and the jacobian matrix reads 29 j 0 x eff 2 r 1 0 b 21 x eff 2 1 c 2 x eff 2 b 22 x eff 2 1 c 2 x eff 2 where x eff 2 r 2 b 22 and then the condition for linear stability is that the vegetative growth rates are r 1 0 and r 2 0 partial carrying capacities can be defined when one population reaches its carrying capacity and the other one has zero effective growth rate for example 1 c 1 x eff 2 where now x eff 2 r 2 b 22 b 21 c 1 b 22 in these cases the jacobian matrix has also a simple expression 30 j 1 c 1 x eff 2 r 1 b 11 c 1 b 12 x eff 2 0 b 21 x eff 2 1 c 2 x eff 2 b 22 x eff 2 1 c 2 x eff 2 the condition for this point to be stable is again that both diagonal terms are negative the first diagonal term is minus the effective growth rate at that point and the second diagonal term is the intraspecific interaction growth rate with the logistic term at that point note that any stationary solution satisfies x i 1 c i so the logistic term is always positive or zero so this second term is negative when the intraspecific interaction coefficient b 22 is negative i e when species 2 exhibits a detrimental intraspecific interaction cannibalism simplifying the expression b 22 x eff 2 r 2 b 21 c 1 the condition for the interspecific interaction coefficient is b 21 r 2 c 1 the same condition must be fulfilled for the solution x eff 1 1 c 2 exchanging subscripts 1 by 2 31 j x eff 1 1 c 2 b 11 x eff 1 1 c 1 x eff 1 b 12 x eff 1 1 c 1 x eff 1 0 r 2 b 22 c 2 b 21 x eff 1 finally the null effective growth rate solution x eff 1 x eff 2 17 has the jacobian matrix 32 j x eff 1 x eff 2 b 11 x 1 1 c 1 x 1 b 12 x 1 1 c 1 x 1 b 21 x 2 1 c 2 x 2 b 22 x 2 1 c 2 x 2 that can be written briefly as 33 j x eff 1 x eff 2 b 11 x 1 b 12 x 1 b 21 x 2 b 22 x 2 where x i x i 1 c i x i the eigenvalues λ 1 2 can be obtained from 34 j λ i 0 whose solutions are 35 λ 1 2 1 2 t r j t r 2 j 4 det j 1 2 b 11 x 1 b 22 x 2 b 11 x 1 b 22 x 2 2 4 b 12 b 21 x 1 x 2 1 2 b 11 x 1 b 22 x 2 b 11 x 1 2 b 22 x 2 2 2 x 1 x 2 2 b 12 b 21 b 11 b 22 n populations then the generic jacobian matrix for these finite stationary solutions has two types of row entries species i in the carrying capacity 36 j i i r eff i j i k 0 for k i species j satisfying r eff j 0 37 j j k b j k x eff j 1 c j x eff j b j k j j where j j x eff j 1 c j x eff j is the same for all columns k of the same row j so for rows corresponding to populations in the carrying capacity the generic jacobian matrix is zero except for the diagonal entry with terms equal to minus the effective growth rate and for rows corresponding to species j with null effective growth rate entries are b j k j j j 1 c i x eff j 0 r eff i 0 b j k j j b j j j j when all populations are in their carrying capacities the jacobian matrix is diagonal and the entries are the effective growth rates with a minus sign this means that this stationary solution will be locally stable when all the effective growth rates are positive 4 numerical simulations the fact of having a logistic factor in the dynamic equations guarantees a bounded evolution for populations with any set of parameters provided that the initial populations are below their carrying capacities in a phase trajectories plot all the evolutions are limited by the parallelogram defined by the hyperplanes x i 0 and x i 1 c i here we show the phase trajectories for different two species systems in the following figures we depict the null clines for both populations in orange for f 1 0 and green for f 2 0 and the intersections with filled and empty dots corresponding to stable and unstable stationary solutions respectively phase trajectories crossing these orange null clines are vertical growth rate for population 1 is zero and phase trajectories crossing the green null clines are horizontal growth rate for population 2 is zero but there are no lines crossing the limits of the parallelogram as in stucchi et al 2020 this generic model can be used to study different ecological interactions from competition to mutualism including also intraspecific interactions as cooperation or cannibalism in addition to the standard solutions for these basic ecological interactions the third order terms arising from the logistic factor allow new finite solutions that account for more complex interactions for illustrative purposes we only show some examples of interspecific ecological interactions that depict new ecological scenarios by effect of the intraspecific interactions reflecting the diversity of ecological communities this model can reproduce predator prey with cooperative preys some real predator prey systems do not exhibit large oscillations in their populations as expected from classic lotka volterra equations as an example lions wildebeest and zebras in the kruger national park south africa maintain roughly stationary or non oscillating populations over the years fay and greeff 2006 this equilibrium can be obtained when preys are numerous and they benefit from cooperation fig 3 a mimics this scenario where the stable spiral solution of the lotka volterra model not shown in this picture has been shifted to the stable node by the cooperation term in prey x axis where it becomes a stable node black dot fig 3 b depicts two time evolutions of predator and prey for two different initial conditions the blue and red squares in the phase trajectories plot prey in solid line and predator in dashed line note that the left y axis is for predators and the right y axis is for the preys the stable stationary solution in this picture is at 1000 30 as an example of large prey population and small predator population fay and greeff 2006 competition with intraspecific cooperation the general principle of competitive exclusion appears in competition models where the interspecific term is negative for both populations however this principle can be altered if populations benefit of cooperation in some occasions a positive intraspecific interaction may balance the negative effect of an interspecific interaction such as direct competition here we show that eq 14 with negative interspecific interactions may lead to a stable stationary solution by effect of intraspecific cooperation fig 4 a depicts the phase trajectories for two populations with direct competition but with the benefit of intraspecific cooperation two saddle points emerge at each carrying capacity the lines from these points to the origin are the separatrices that define the basin of attraction to the stable stationary solution in this way any initial condition between both separatrices not shown ends at the total carrying capacity for example the blue square in fig 4 a meanwhile any initial condition outside these lines ends in one of the partial extinctions according to the principle of competitive exclusion for example the red square in this case the effect of cooperation is not enough to overcome the advantage of its competitor fig 4 b shows the time evolution of these two points blue lines end in the carrying capacity because the initial point is inside the attraction basin of the total carrying capacity however the red dashed line corresponding to species 2 goes to zero because at the initial stage species 1 got some advantage over species 2 and finally the weaker goes extinct mutualism with harmful intraspecific interaction another interesting example can be observed in a mutualistic system due to intraspecific interaction in a bounded mutualistic system i e garcía algarra et al 2014 both species reach their carrying capacity because of their mutual benefit however if one of the species exhibits harmful intraspecific interaction referred to as cannibalism for example individuals fighting for a territory or males killing cubs the final stable equilibrium point may be far from its carrying capacity polis 1981 figs 5 and 6 show the effect of harmful intraspecific interactions in a obligate mutualistic system in fig 5 a the total carrying capacity becomes unstable due to the negative intraspecific interaction however the mutualistic benefits for population 1 are high enough to overcome the harmful effect so that population 1 reaches its carrying capacity the crossing of the oblique null clines defines an stationary solution corresponding to a saddle point most phase trajectories go to the right however this saddle point forces the lines for small populations of species 2 to turn around and end in the partial extinction at 10 0 fig 5 b depicts the time evolution of two populations with close initial conditions showed in picture 5 a the blue square is in the attraction basin of the carrying capacity and the red square is below the separatrix not shown red dashed line shows that population of species 2 goes extinct and species 1 decreases to its stationary state without partner however blue lines show that both populations reach the partial carrying capacity in fig 6 we show another mutualistic system but in this case the stable solution is in the carrying capacity of population 2 although the vegetative growth rate for population 2 is negative obligate mutualism note that oblique orange line in fig 6 a has a greater slope and crosses the null cline f 2 0 at the carrying capacity bacterial system of 4 populations finally we have tried to model a complex bacterial system in these systems the number of populations is usually high and the relationships between them may even depend on the species present recently some authors have developed mathematical algorithms to infer the growth rate and interaction matrix from microbiota data stein et al 2013 alshawaqfeh et al 2017 in these papers the authors have used time series datasets with abundances of operational taxonomic units referred to as otus from dna sequencing their algorithms are based on fitting the empirical data to a glv model eqs 3 and 4 so we could not use all their parameters for our equations in order to verify that eq 8 can also model complex multispecies systems we have taken the growth rates and the interaction matrix for some species from reference alshawaqfeh et al 2017 and looked for stable stationary solutions some subsets of species do not have stable solutions as an example we show in fig 7 the time evolution for 4 otus starting at random initial conditions after a transitory regime all of them reach the stable stationary solution in this example only otu2 reaches its carrying capacity the growth rates r i and the interaction parameters b i j are shown in table 1 note that the interaction matrix has positive and negative entries which means that bacterial species have beneficial interactions with some species and harmful interactions with others 5 discussion modeling ecological systems with population dynamics models has devoted much effort in the last decades however finding multi species coexistence in complex ecosystems with different types of interactions is a very difficult task on the other hand complex models fitted to achieve this goal are often mathematically hard to handle high order polynomials or with hyperbolic terms we are aware that complexity of nature cannot be modeled with simple equations and these population dynamics models are useful as benchmarks around stationary solutions consequently it is important that the model can provide feasible stationary solutions the solution space with the phase trajectories gives us an idea of the dynamic evolution with very simple equations we get only trivial and basic solutions with complex models we can obtain many stationary solutions but we must study the feasibility and the ecological meaning of that solutions a good approach can be reached with third order polynomial equations as it has been reported in stucchi et al 2020 low order polynomial equations have some advantages as the study of stationary solutions linear stability analysis phase trajectories and parameter stability without much effort the factored version of this model introduced in section 2 have two main advantages i mathematically the stationary solutions are the extinction the carrying capacity and the condition of null effective growth rate that can be obtained by solving a system of linear equations for an arbitrary number of populations and the linear stability analysis can be studied with a jacobian matrix whose entries are also the sum of linear terms in addition the stationary solutions can be found graphically as the intersection of hyperplanes as shown in figs 2 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 a ii conceptually the three factors of the growth rate have a clear ecological meaning the malthusian term the effective growth rate and the logistic term due to the intraspecific competition the fact that all ecological interactions appear as independent terms in the effective growth rate allows us to analyze the effect of each interaction with this formulation we recover the original interpretation of the logistic term on the other hand this simplified version has one parameter less and this may cause some interesting solutions to be lost moreover as the null clines are straight lines we can only have one finite solution inside the limiting rectangle defined by the carrying capacities the rest of the solutions are located on this limiting rectangle another drawback is the limitation in the initial densities they have to be less than c i 1 however for very small values of c i the model can reproduce the population dynamics for a wide range of population densities just as an illustration we have studied one example of predator prey system one example of competition two examples of mutualism and a real bacterial system with 4 populations in the predator prey system we have shown that a small cooperation effect in prey can lead the system to a stable solution with high prey population this situation can be observed in nature for example in the zebras wildebeest and lions populations reported in fay and greeff 2006 we have also studied a competition system with cooperative populations we have shown a competitive system with two coexisting species as in the ayala s experiments ayala 1969 an experimental invalidation of the principle of competitive exclusion when cooperation comes into play in addition to the partial extinctions a new stable coexistence is feasible in the example of mutualistic system with detrimental intraspecific interaction the carrying capacity becomes unstable two new stable solutions emerge at the carrying capacity of one population and at the partial extinction when an obligate mutualistic population presents detrimental intraspecific interactions it can become extinct even for a high partner population as an example of a multi species real system we have modeled a subset of microbiota abundances otus with the growth rates and the interaction matrix reported in literature alshawaqfeh et al 2017 this complex ecosystem with positive and negatives interaction coefficients all microbes are beneficial for some and harmful for others can be modeled with the simplified version presented in this paper the glv model used by alshawaqfeh et al 2017 to fit the empirical data only reproduced the experimental time intervals however at long times populations exploded or became extinct fig 7 shows the temporal evolution of the four otus modeled with eq 8 and the coexistence of all the stationary populations as summary we have shown that it is possible to model population dynamics of complex ecological systems as the product of three significant factors i a malthusian term accounting for the density dependence of the growth rate ii a effective growth rate including any type of ecological interactions for both interspecific and intraspecific relationships and iii a logistic term representing the intraspecific competition and playing the role of biological brake this factored equation of the general logistic model have been used to study some ecological systems with different types of inter and intraspecific interactions probably the best benchmark for using this model is a microbial community because this complex system involves a large number of species we have shown as an example a bacterial system of 4 populations but we have tested it with more than 10 populations with typical non polynomial equations finding stationary solutions is a very hard task however with eq 18 the non trivial stationary points are the solutions of a simple linear system and the jacobian matrix for the linear stability analysis has also a simple expression for this reason we suggest that this simple model could be used for modeling complex ecological communities made up of many biological species credit authorship contribution statement juan manuel pastor investigation methodology software writing original draft writing revised

24654,opportunistically collected species occurrence data are often used for species distribution models sdms when high quality data collected through standardized recording protocols are unavailable while opportunistic data are abundant uncertainty is usually high e g due to observer effects or a lack of metadata to increase data quality and improve model performance we filtered species records based on record attributes that provide information on the observation process or post entry data validation data filtering does not only increase the quality of species records it simultaneously reduces sample size a trade off that remains relatively unexplored by controlling for sample size in a dataset of 255 species we were able to explore the combined impact of data quality and sample size on model performance we applied three data quality filters based on observers activity the validation status of a record in the database and the detail of a submitted record and analyzed changes in auc sensitivity and specificity using maxent with and without filtering the impact of stringent filtering on model performance depended on 1 the quality of the filtered data records validated as correct and more detailed records lead to higher model performance 2 the proportional reduction in sample size caused by filtering and the remaining absolute sample size filters causing small reductions that lead to sample sizes of more than 100 presences generally benefitted model performance and 3 the taxonomic group plant and dragonfly models benefitted more from data quality filtering compared to bird and butterfly models our results also indicate that recommendations for quality filtering depend on the goal of the study e g increasing sensitivity and or specificity further research must identify what drives species sensitivity to data quality nonetheless our study confirms that large quantities of volunteer generated and opportunistically collected data can make a valuable contribution to ecological research and species conservation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords data quality filtering maxent opportunistic data presence only sample size species distribution models 1 introduction appropriate conservation measures must mitigate the alarming declines of biodiversity caused by global pressures such as climate change urban et al 2016 invasive species early et al 2016 and intensifying land use newbold et al 2015 choosing proper conservation measures requires evidence on the state of biodiversity and species distributions ideally such evidence is gathered through standardised protocols performed by trained observers and with a clear description of both data collection and project objectives kosmala et al 2016 such highly structured data however is rarely available for a wide range of species nor extensive periods or geographical areas urban et al 2016 in response less structured but bulky occurrence data with varying information content often collected by volunteers participating in citizen science initiatives theobald et al 2015 are being explored for biodiversity conservation purposes guisan et al 2013 the value of data with information on detectability or information on absences is indisputable and their applications are abundant e g for species distribution models sdms guisan and zimmermann 2000 van strien et al 2013 wood et al 2018 or red list compilations e g maes et al 2015 in contrast the value of data with little information on the observation process is uncertain and conservation applications are limited dobson et al 2020 guillera arroita et al 2015 when such unstructured occurrence data consist of occasional observations of species presences they are termed opportunistic presence only giraud et al 2016 or presence background data wang and stone 2019 they are generally used in sdms e g maxent phillips et al 2006 or point process models renner et al 2015 that contrast available environmental conditions in the study area the background with the conditions at locations where the species was observed elith et al 2011 using opportunistic presence only data for sdms has both advantages and disadvantages the main advantage is the abundance of the available data because an easy data collection leads to the coverage of a large number of species over large geographical areas at a fine scale and over potentially long periods kosmala et al 2016 online platforms and smartphone applications facilitate an easy recording of species for a volunteer observer and the number of active observers on data platforms such as irecord in the united kingdom https www brc ac uk irecord waarnemingen be in flanders northern belgium https www waarnemingen be or inaturalist worldwide https www inaturalist org is indeed growing by the hundreds e g waarnemingen be or even thousands e g inaturalist every year since the quantity and extent of this data can never be reached by standardised monitoring schemes opportunistic data can make a valuable contribution to science if processed correctly giraud et al 2016 soroye et al 2018 two major disadvantages of opportunistic presence only data limiting their application potential dobson et al 2020 guillera arroita et al 2015 however are the incapability of delivering probabilistic model outputs guillera arroita et al 2015 and a high risk of bias and error bird et al 2014 isaac and pocock 2015 the awareness of these uncertainties reflects in the scepticism towards data quality of opportunistic observations or citizen science data in general burgess et al 2017 because when disregarded in the modeling or decision making process these disadvantages can lead to misguided conservation measures isaac et al 2014 different strategies are applied to increase the quality of opportunistic datasets a first strategy is rather bottom up where the underlying protocol of a citizen science project is changed kosmala et al 2016 this requires a regime shift and takes time but can be fruitful e g ebird sullivan et al 2014 a second and promising strategy is data integration miller et al 2019 where multiple sources of opportunistic presence only data are combined lin et al 2017 or presence only data is treated as complementary to structured presence absence data robinson et al 2019 a third strategy integrated into many national citizen science databases is data validation where the species identification is verified often together with the spatial and temporal plausibility of a record it is common practice in for example ebird sullivan et al 2009 waarnemingen be swinnen et al 2018 and irecord https www brc ac uk irecord records verified however even with the best experts and state of the art methods e g image recognition it is challenging to verify thousands of records entering data repositories every day particularly those without corroborating picture evidence as a result many researchers apply a fourth strategy where data reliability is maximised by data filtering or data cleaning this can be done by error detection e g serra diaz et al 2017 outlier removal e g kallimanis et al 2017 by filtering in geographical or environmental space e g varela et al 2014 or by deleting species records based on data attributes e g rutten et al 2019 so called stringent filtering steen et al 2019 the desired effect of stringent filtering is an increase in quality by reducing bias and error steen et al 2019 yet sample size is inevitably reduced by filtering and as sample size is known to have a major influence on model performance gábor et al 2019 wisz et al 2008 stringent filtering leads to a trade off between data quality and sample size to our knowledge the combined impact of data quality and sample size in stringent filtering on the performance of sdms remains underexplored studies that explored the impact of stringent data filters found a negligible effect on bird occurrence predictions when retaining only structured survey data kamp et al 2016 or data from observers with higher expertise steen et al 2019 on the other hand predictions were more accurate when using only records validated as correct for a butterfly genus prone to misidentification vantieghem et al 2017 or by using only ebird checklists of observers who travelled larger distances to do their observations steen et al 2019 in our study we will expand on previous findings by applying different quality filters on a regional species occurrence database waarnemingen be the database consists of both structured and unstructured recordings in flanders since 2008 and currently holds more than 44 million species records and one of the densest collections of species records in europe herremans et al 2018 our aim is to identify which quality filters increase the discrimination accuracy of maxent and to formulate recommendations based on taxonomic group and data characteristics every citizen science database is unique and while the considered taxonomic groups in waarnemingen be are blessed with a relatively high proportion of quality data this might not be the case in all data repositories the properties of waarnemingen be allowed us to evaluate the impact on model performance of different changes in data quality for a wide range of changes in sample size this does not only provide more insight into the trade off between data quality and sample size in stringent filtering but also ensures the transferability of our results to datasets of lower quality and or record density 2 material and methods 2 1 dataset and quality filters we assessed the impact of data quality filtering on opportunistic citizen science data gathered in the flemish species occurrence database waarnemingen be the dataset contained both structured data or observations supported by guidelines or a protocol varying from standardized monitoring schemes to small project observations and unstructured data or incidental observations for a detailed description of our data selection and model testing procedure see section 2 2 and appendix a 161 782 structured records were separated for model testing to measure the performance of the sdms see section 2 3 another 5 547 750 unstructured records were used for model training we adopted the odmap protocol v1 0 zurell et al 2020 and describe the different steps overview data model assessment and prediction in appendix b we selected three dichotomous filters as a measure for data quality based on available metadata table a 1 the first filter activity refers to the annual average number of active recording days of an observer in the study period 2014 2019 we calculated the individual activity rate of observers including the observers with the highest number of records first and stopped when we reached the observers that cumulatively collected 80 of the data the threshold for a high activity rate was set to the first quartile of the activity rate of this group i e 92 recording days in one year we considered this a proxy for observer experience known to lead to lower rates of both false negative and false positive errors farmer et al 2012 kallimanis et al 2017 kelling et al 2015 the second filter detail reflects whether observers provide information beyond the default date location and species name such as species behaviour photographs or additional comments records submitted with more effort are of higher quality if effort is defined by the distance travelled for a checklist steen et al 2019 because we applied filters to unstructured data only we used record detail as a measure for effort instead the third filter valstat is based on the status of a record in the internal validation system of the database indicating if it was evaluated as correct or as uncertain records marked as correct are meant to contain no misidentification errors e g vantieghem et al 2017 even though an occasional human or software error might occur records marked as uncertain have either not been validated or were hard to judge correctly due to lack of additional information swinnen et al 2018 2 2 data selection records from four well studied taxonomic groups in flanders i e birds butterflies dragonflies and plants were subjected to some initial data restrictions 1 records were limited to our study area the flemish region of belgium 2 observations dated from january 2014 to september 2019 3 we included only records with sufficient geographical precision 500 metres 4 for birds only birds that breed in flanders were used vermeersch et al 2020 and 5 we removed absences zero counts and entries validated as incorrect after the initial selection we divided the data into records for model training and records for model testing also see appendix a and fig a 1 structured data were used solely for model testing and never for model training and were further reduced to high quality testing records this was done by selecting only structured records that were validated as correct and from observers with a high activity rate the model training records consisted of unstructured presence only data a data type found in many large scale datasets of opportunistic species records e g gbif https www gbif org model training records were subjected to the three quality filters and their combinations resulting in seven filtered datasets fig a 2 per species training and testing records were aggregated in a 1 1 km grid a frequently used resolution in flemish biodiversity research e g demolder et al 2014 rutten et al 2019 vantieghem et al 2017 resulting in one presence per grid cell per species this aggregation of records is also known as spatial thinning or spatial filtering a common technique to reduce spatial bias kramer schadt et al 2013 and improve model performance boria et al 2014 the high quality presences of the model testing set were complemented with absences derived from grid cells with high search effort for the associated taxonomic group but where the target species was not observed we kept only species with at least 50 presences in the testing set and at least one filtered training set with at least 100 presences this resulted in a dataset of 255 species in four taxonomic groups full list in table c 1 2 3 species distribution model we evaluated the impact of stringent filtering on the performance of maxent software version 3 4 1 implemented in the r package dismo v1 1 4 hijmans et al 2017 maxent is a commonly used presence only algorithm elith et al 2011 phillips et al 2006 which models a relative probability of occurrence based on a species presence records and background points background points are used to define the contrast between what is available in the environment and what is used by the species elith et al 2011 we included all of the 13 552 cells in our study area as background and did not adjust the background selection to correct for sampling bias e g phillips et al 2009 vollering et al 2019 to ensure comparability of our models merow et al 2013 comparability was further supported by allowing only linear quadratic and product features for every model by setting a minimum sample size of 100 to ensure that the regularization coefficient was kept to 0 05 and by using identical predictors in all maxent models the predictor set represented the range of environmental conditions in our study area and comprised twelve continuous predictors and two factor variables see table c 2 for a summary we aggregated the land use in flanders in eleven classes agriculture forest semi natural grassland scrub heathland saltmarshes wetlands dunes urban areas water and other green areas i e green areas outside the urban area that are not mapped as agricultural or natural land use poelmans and van daele 2014 the area of these classes in each 1 1 km cell was calculated and cells were removed if the cumulative area of land use was less than 50 of the total area i e cells close to regional borders we removed one class agriculture from the set because of the relatively high collinearity with other classes and because of the problem with perfect multicollinearity in compositional data aichison 2003 the ten other land use classes were used to describe the variation in the extremely fragmented landscape in flanders antrop 2004 two additional continuous predictors were the mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation bio1 and bio12 from worldclim2 respectively fick and hijmans 2017 the first factor variable was a grid cell s dominant soil texture class maréchal and tavernier 1974 a direct or indirect influencer of a species microclimate titeux et al 2009 the second was ecoregion couvreur et al 2004 which is a region with similar biotic and abiotic conditions since flanders has limited geographical and environmental gradients e g 240 km across 0 to 288 m elevation and relatively uniform climatic conditions and species use similar biotopes throughout the region we assumed that the environmental response of a species was similar across the entire study area chen et al 2020 2 4 model evaluation for model evaluation we chose three metrics the area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve auc sensitivity i e true positive rate and specificity i e true negative rate fielding and bell 1997 based on three rationales first using auc alone as a summary metric of the roc curve would lead to a loss of information about model performance jiménez valverde 2012 second these metrics are measures of model discrimination and independent of species prevalence which is unknown in presence background situations lawson et al 2014 third we evaluated our models on an external testing test that contained both presences and absences enabling a reasonable calculation of the two threshold dependent metrics sensitivity and specificity and justifying the use of these metrics for model evaluation jiménez valverde 2012 jiménez and soberón 2020 sensitivity and specificity were calculated by transforming the continuous model predictions resulting from the different training sets into a binary response the threshold was set to the value that maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity calculated on the species testing set thereby minimizing misclassification errors kaivanto 2008 the difference in model performance auc sensitivity and specificity was used to evaluate the impact of data quality filtering four choices facilitated the comparison of evaluation metrics within one species elith et al 2011 lobo et al 2008 merow et al 2013 1 an identical testing set 2 identical maxent settings features and regularization coefficient 3 identical background selection and 4 identical predictors 2 5 the impact of data quality on model performance we repeatedly 20 times selected a random sample from the unfiltered and filtered training sets at six predefined levels of 100 250 500 1000 2000 and 4000 presences also see fig a 3 model evaluation metrics were compared between training sets of constant fixed sample size but with different quality resulting from the application of the different filters for the evaluation of data quality species were divided into one of the six sample size levels based on two conditions firstly the sample size level was bounded from above by the number of available presences for all filtered training sets including the 3 filter combination activity detail valstat adv this facilitated a comparison of all filters without the influence of inter species differences secondly species were classified at the highest level possible based on the number of available presences in the original adv training set in other words sample size was kept as close as possible to the number of recorded presences in the database this way we prevented that large differences between the sample size of the unchanged training set i e the actual occurrence in the data and the fixed sample size would impact model performance hanberry et al 2012 2 6 the impact of absolute sample size on model performance for the evaluation of absolute sample size we included models from different fixed sample sizes per species we kept data quality constant by comparing results per filter and not between filters per filter species were grouped in one out of six intervals of sample size that indicate the sample size of the original training sets 100 250 or 250 500 or 500 1000 or 2000 4000 or 4000 species were thus constant across absolute sample sizes but not across filters nor intervals 2 7 the combined impact of data quality and sample size on model performance the impact on model performance of a change in data quality and a change in sample size will occur simultaneously to evaluate this combined impact we analysed 30 724 combinations of unfiltered and filtered training sets with different changes in quality and sample size we used all training sets of fixed sample size at the six predefined levels that we could obtain for each species together with the original training sets with sample size equal to the number of aggregated presences from the dataset model evaluation metrics were averaged across the 20 repetitions for the fixed sample sizes i e per species filter type and sample size level and we looked at the mean differences in model performance auc sensitivity specificity between models of an unfiltered training set and the filtered training sets to fully capture the impact of the change in sample size we assessed two sample size variables the remaining sample size after filtering and the proportional reduction in sample size the latter is defined as the proportion of presences removed from an unfiltered training set by applying a single filter or a combination of filters see fig a 3 for an example of how many different datasets we could extract for one species and filter the combined impact of data quality and sample size on the difference in model performance was assessed using generalized additive mixed models gamms with species as a random effect implemented in the mgcv r package v1 8 31 wood 2017 to account for the doubly bounded character of our response variable we rescaled auc sensitivity and specificity to fall between 0 and 1 and used the betareg family with logit link smoothing functions were used to fit both sample size variables with cubic spline method and k 5 to reduce overfitting we included interactions by allowing different smoothers per filter and by including the product of the remaining sample size and the proportional reduction in the equation per taxonomic group the model which best explained the difference in model performance while keeping model complexity low was selected by comparing the akaike s information criterion aic burnham et al 2011 of multiple a priori gamms full list in appendix f in the r package mumin v1 43 17 barton 2019 the relative importance of data quality filter type and sample size sample size after filtering and proportional reduction was assessed by comparing the proportion of explained deviance of those variables in the best model identified by our model selection we performed all analyses for the three evaluation metrics auc sensitivity and specificity across all species and within species groups and show the main results for auc in the main text all other results can be found in appendices d through h in supplementary information 1 models and statistical analyses were run in r v4 0 1 r core team 2020 3 results throughout the results section the filters will be referred to as activity a retaining records collected by observers with a high activity rate detail d retaining records that were submitted with information beyond the default date location and species name and valstat v retaining records marked as correct in the data platform s validation system 3 1 the impact of data quality on model performance fig 1 shows that for all species filtered data could deliver higher aucs than unfiltered data but with differences among sample size levels smaller sample sizes of filtered data were more likely to result in higher aucs compared to large sample sizes of filtered data at 100 presences all filters could result in a higher auc while at 250 and 500 presences valstat and detail could deliver positive results for larger sample sizes valstat and its combinations at 1000 presences or no filters at all at 2000 and 4000 presences benefitted model performance plants were most sensitive to data quality where detail and valstat and also activity at 100 presences resulted in higher aucs throughout birds were sensitive to data quality at the low and intermediate sample sizes where the best option was valstat at 500 and 1000 presences valstat alone already increased auc at 100 and 250 presences valstat had to be combined with at least one other filter for butterflies aucs increased when using activity alone or in combination with one or two other filters at 4000 presences or in combination with valstat at 1000 presences for dragonflies single filters were not powerful enough to increase auc combining detail with valstat at 500 presences or with activity at 1000 presences did deliver higher aucs similar results to auc were found for specificity but mostly for plants at small sample sizes of 100 presences all filters increased specificity and 250 presences detail valstat a d and a v increased specificity at 500 presences we noted increases in specificity for dragonflies a d and a d v and decreases in specificity for plants detail a d and d v at larger sample sizes of 1000 presences or more a higher specificity was found only for birds filter combinations data quality did not impact specificity for butterflies fig d 2 results for sensitivity showed more negative impacts of using filtered data compared to auc and specificity yet also increases in sensitivity were noted for plants at 250 presences detail and its combinations and 500 presences all filters except activity and a v and for butterflies at 4000 presences activity and its combinations a lower sensitivity was found for plants at 100 presences valstat and its combinations for dragonflies at 500 presences a d and a d v and for birds at 100 presences a d 2000 presences activity and combinations with valstat and 4000 presences detail and its combinations fig d 1 3 2 the impact of absolute sample size on model performance fig 2 shows that reducing absolute sample size beyond a certain level always impacted aucs negatively this level depended more on the original sample size than on the applied filter at lower original sample sizes 2000 presences reducing sample size by 50 did not cause significant decreases in auc for most filters with exceptions for detail valstat a d and a v at 500 to 1000 presences at larger original sample sizes 2000 presences sample size could be reduced by 75 for most filters with exceptions for valstat and d v at 2000 to 4000 presences reducing sample size to 100 presences no matter what the original sample size was always resulted in lower model performance for birds and butterflies the impact of sample size on auc was similar to that of all species fig e 3 and e 4 dragonfly and plant models appeared less sensitive to sample size fig e 5 and e 6 similar to auc the impact of smaller sample sizes on specificity was generally negative across all species with a higher tolerance for larger reductions when original sample sizes were high yet with more variation among filters fig e 2 specificity of butterfly and plant models fig e 12 and e 14 appeared more sensitive to smaller sample sizes compared to bird and dragonfly models fig e 11 and e 13 in contrast with results for auc and specificity the impact of smaller sample sizes on sensitivity is generally positive significant increases in sensitivity were more likely to occur for higher quality data filter combinations at lower original sample sizes and for lower quality data unfiltered data and single filters at higher original sample sizes fig e 1 for butterflies dragonflies and plants sensitivity generally increased fig e 8 e 9 and e 10 when specificity decreased fig e 12 e 13 and e 14 for birds this contrast was less pronounced and we even noted more decreases in sensitivity than increases when sample size was reduced fig e 7 3 3 the combined impact of data quality and sample size on model performance up to this point the absolute sample size of unfiltered and filtered data remained identical in reality however sample size usually decreases when applying quality filters therefore the impact of sample size was quantified with two variables in this section the proportional reduction in sample size and the sample size after filtering also called remaining sample size a detailed summary per species of all the filters and their impact on model performance showed that model performance mostly increased after filtering depending on the applied filter for 55 to 80 of the species for auc 49 to 55 for sensitivity and 51 to 58 for specificity but that various filter species combinations also show a negative impact on model performance table in supplementary information 2 per taxonomic group we selected the best gamm appendix f i e the model with the least parameters and a small difference in aic aic 1 compared to the top model to evaluate the combined impact of data quality and sample size on the change in model performance caused by filtering fig 3 shows the relative importance of the variables in the model for auc considering the averages across species boxplots the change in quality the filter type explained most of the variation in auc for plants and dragonflies yet with high variability in percentage deviance explained de among species the interaction between proportional reduction and sample size after filtering explained the most variation in auc for bird and butterfly models and is also important for dragonfly models for plants however more variation in auc was explained by the interaction between quality and sample size after filtering this interaction was also more important when considering the variation in sensitivity and specificity and the differences between the proportional de for the variables filter interaction rxs and interaction sxf became smaller the filter type remained the most important variable for plants for predicting both sensitivity and specificity yet with less variability among species compared to auc results fig g 1 and g 2 the predictions for auc of the best gamm are presented in fig 4 along a continuous scale of proportional reduction and for three sample sizes after filtering that we chose based on data availability 100 500 and 1000 presences predictions for sensitivity and specificity are found in appendix h the combined impact of filtering varies among taxonomic groups and we find the highest impacts for plant models auc and sensitivity and dragonfly models sensitivity with the largest differences in model performance among filters the predictions for birds and plants in fig 4 show that the best filters i e the filters leading to increases in auc can differ between remaining sample sizes confirmed by the relatively higher importance of the interaction between filter and sample size after filtering fig 3 for plants for example the best filter was a d v at small but d v at large remaining sample sizes similar patterns were detected for sensitivity birds dragonflies and plants in fig g 1 and h 1 and for specificity all groups in fig g 2 and h 2 in general filters that resulted in high quality data usually increased model performance figs 1 d 1 and d 2 the proportional reduction in sample size could also be higher for those filters before a negative impact on model performance was detected overall filtering increased aucs and sensitivity for plants i e 0 and decreased sensitivity for birds i e 0 while in other cases both increases and decreases in model performance were noted different trends described the impact of proportional reduction on model performance the shape of the trend depended on the remaining sample size with different trend slopes for all taxonomic groups and even different trend directions for birds sensitivity butterflies auc dragonflies sensitivity and specificity and plants sensitivity for auc and specificity trends at small remaining sample sizes of 100 presences were negative and filtering decreased model performance i e 0 beyond a certain maximal threshold of proportional reduction depending on the filter maximum reductions in sample size could range from 0 35 auc for birds 20 60 auc or 10 30 specificity for butterflies 55 85 auc or 35 65 specificity for dragonflies and 5 85 specificity for plants for sensitivity trends at a remaining sample size of 100 presences were positive except for birds depending on the filter reductions had to be at least 0 10 for butterflies and 35 70 for dragonflies before an increase in model performance was noted for larger remaining sample sizes of 500 and 1000 presences trends in the impact of proportional reduction on auc and specificity remained negative for birds for butterflies trends for auc flattened with increasing sample size after filtering and aucs became largely positive except for detail valstat and d v at reductions above 45 we even saw a positive trend when reductions above 70 resulted in larger sample sizes of 1000 presences for dragonflies trends were flattened for auc and specificity at larger remaining sample sizes and except in the case of specificity and valstat model performance generally increased after filtering trends even became positive for specificity at larger remaining sample sizes of 1000 presences and reductions above 20 for sensitivity however trends became more negative for dragonflies at higher remaining sample sizes and only valstat at 500 presences and reductions below 70 lead to increases in model performance 4 discussion we applied three dichotomous filters to opportunistic species records of citizen scientists as single filters and in combinations to test their impact on species distribution model sdm performance we retained records from more active observers activity detailed records i e submitted with information beyond the default date location and species name detail and validated records i e marked as correct in the data platform s validation system valstat results indicated that the impact of stringent filtering on model performance measured by changes in auc sensitivity and specificity depended on the quality of the filtered data both the proportional reduction in sample size caused by filtering and the remaining absolute sample size and the taxonomic group a recurring pattern was that specificity results true negative rates generally agreed more with auc results than sensitivity results true positive rates moreover specificity usually increased when sensitivity decreased and vice versa which happens when evaluating model predictions on an external data set jiménez valverde 2012 in the discussion that follows we will focus on auc results and we refer to the different results for specificity and sensitivity in the results section and supplementary information the reader must keep in mind that the choice of an optimal threshold for threshold dependent metrics depends on the characteristics of the sdm study e g the goal of the study or the availability of information on species prevalence jiménez valverde and lobo 2007 and that this choice might influence the recommendations for the most suited approach for quality filtering the quality of validated and detailed records was generally higher than the quality of records from more active observers luckily validation of occurrence data entering large repositories by synergies between human experts and computer intelligence has been common practice e g in ebird kelling et al 2013 the main benefits for data quality of such an internal validation system are i the quick and relatively easy identification and correction of false positive errors as they can impact model performance negatively costa et al 2015 and ii an increased observer skill by the interaction between data managers and users sullivan et al 2009 metadata cannot only hold important information to improve sdms by overcoming problems with imperfect detection e g kéry et al 2009 or other types of systematic bias e g johnston et al 2017 but our results also indicate that the very act of supplying additional information can benefit data quality we therefore agree that observer dedication and effort linked to detail are more fit measures of data quality than observer experience and recording rates linked to activity henckel et al 2020 steen et al 2019 like in several other studies on data quality it remains tough to detect changes in model performance due to observer related measures of quality e g observer skill and reporting consistency in henckel et al 2020 or observer expertise in steen et al 2019 combining multiple observer characteristics in observer profiles boakes et al 2016 isaac and pocock 2015 might be of added value here nonetheless selecting data from active observers did significantly increase data quality for eight butterfly species that were among the most observed species in our dataset we hypothesize that these common species are susceptible to misidentification by the inexperienced observer farmer et al 2012 because of their highly familiar names in dutch aglais io l gonepteryx rhamni l and vanessa atalanta l or because they are hard to distinguish from congeners pieris rapae l maniola jurtina l and pararge aegeria l vantieghem et al 2017 when deciding whether or not to filter it is not only important to consider the obtained data quality but also both the proportional reduction in sample size and the remaining absolute sample size after filtering large reductions or small remaining sample sizes do not always cause lower model performance and while we agree that small sample sizes generally lead to worse models jiménez valverde et al 2009 liu et al 2019 the relative change in sample size must not be ignored hanberry et al 2012 both measures of sample size co define which filters are suited for model performance improvement they have a limited impact on the selection of the best or worst filters based on auc results as the relative impact on auc of the different filters remained largely constant across different changes in sample size however here we must mention that when the goal is to increase sensitivity or specificity the remaining sample size after filtering does need to be considered appendix g the different drivers of model performance make the interpretation complex but also highlight the importance of analysing multiple aspects of data manipulation together gábor et al 2019 we add data quality to the list of drivers that can notably impact model performance such as species characteristics modeling technique and sample size gábor et al 2019 tessarolo et al 2014 compared to these factors previous studies found marginal importance of the impact of sampling bias gábor et al 2019 tessarolo et al 2014 and we have no reason to contest this finding based on our results but note that we partially controlled for sampling bias by spatial thinning kramer schadt et al 2013 disentangling the different drivers of model performance in stringent filtering could be more feasible in a virtual species setting hirzel et al 2001 meynard et al 2019 however we argue that the simulation of filtered data of different quality is not trivial this would require a more profound understanding of how data quality is impacted by data and species characteristics we can recommend stringent filtering for taxonomic groups where model performance is more impacted by data quality and less by sample size such as the plants and dragonflies in this study for plant models we even observed that an increase in quality can mitigate the negative impact on auc of reducing sample size to 100 presences fig e 6 and fig 4 for the other taxonomic groups this is only true below certain proportional reductions models from species with specific habitat conditions such as dragonflies are less sensitive to sample size and also profit from data quality increase such species have a more distinct link with their habitat and are easier to model compared to species with a broader niche hernandez et al 2006 nevertheless caution is needed because the impact of data quality on model performance shows large variation among plant and dragonfly species fig 3 and is different when considering other evaluation metrics appendix e for taxonomic groups where model performance is more impacted by sample size and less by data quality such as the birds and butterflies in this study we advise being more careful we observed that filtering is less beneficial for these groups probably because their abundant data already leads to relatively high model performance especially for birds unfiltered data appeared very suited for modeling and filtering did not improve aucs certainly when less than 50 of the sample size remained for these groups even filters that do not cause large reductions nor lead to a small sample size could cause model performance to decrease nonetheless choosing the right filter can mitigate the negative impact of sample size if the obtained quality is high enough e g extracting data from active observers for butterflies or combining validated and detailed records for birds in this study we focussed on the combined impact of data quality and sample size in stringent filtering but we acknowledge that other factors such as environmental filtering gabor et al 2019 scale connor et al 2018 gottschalk et al 2011 species traits hernandez et al 2006 mcpherson and jetz 2007 and sdm technique liu et al 2019 will probably impact the sensitivity of a dataset to stringent filtering as well for example the proportion of high quality data in a model training set is scale dependent because a coarse resolution gives a higher chance that at least one high quality observation falls in a grid cell spatial thinning is therefore not only a way to remove spatial bias boria et al 2014 but also to reduce other sources of uncertainty kramer schadt et al 2013 such as the presence of data with uncertain quality we also detected variation among species and as taxonomic groups still show plenty variation in species traits maes et al 2019 it might be more efficient to formulate recommendations for stringent filtering based on species traits rather than on taxonomy species prone to misidentification for example can benefit from retaining only records validated as correct based on photos supplied by the observer vantieghem et al 2017 and we have indications that for example habitat specificity mobility and popularity impact the sensitivity of a species to data quality filtering as well our recommendations are limited to the discrimination accuracy of maxent as maxent usually comes out as a relatively more robust sdm technique thibaud et al 2014 our conclusions are likely to be conservative we therefore expect at least a similar if not a larger impact of data quality filtering for other sdm techniques 5 conclusions we conclude that data quality filtering has the potential to improve predictions of species distributions especially for species where sdms are less sensitive to decreases in sample size however data quality should not be pursued at any cost because filtering can also impact model performance negatively e g for species with abundant data or when filtering leads to low sample sizes or causes high sample size reductions we encourage the further development and adoption of techniques that can increase the availability of high quality data to be able to fully profit from the benefits of opportunistic citizen science data the value of a database integrated validation system demonstrates the potential of bulky datasets from platforms and applications where the focus is on the identification and validation of species observations such as inaturalist https

24654,opportunistically collected species occurrence data are often used for species distribution models sdms when high quality data collected through standardized recording protocols are unavailable while opportunistic data are abundant uncertainty is usually high e g due to observer effects or a lack of metadata to increase data quality and improve model performance we filtered species records based on record attributes that provide information on the observation process or post entry data validation data filtering does not only increase the quality of species records it simultaneously reduces sample size a trade off that remains relatively unexplored by controlling for sample size in a dataset of 255 species we were able to explore the combined impact of data quality and sample size on model performance we applied three data quality filters based on observers activity the validation status of a record in the database and the detail of a submitted record and analyzed changes in auc sensitivity and specificity using maxent with and without filtering the impact of stringent filtering on model performance depended on 1 the quality of the filtered data records validated as correct and more detailed records lead to higher model performance 2 the proportional reduction in sample size caused by filtering and the remaining absolute sample size filters causing small reductions that lead to sample sizes of more than 100 presences generally benefitted model performance and 3 the taxonomic group plant and dragonfly models benefitted more from data quality filtering compared to bird and butterfly models our results also indicate that recommendations for quality filtering depend on the goal of the study e g increasing sensitivity and or specificity further research must identify what drives species sensitivity to data quality nonetheless our study confirms that large quantities of volunteer generated and opportunistically collected data can make a valuable contribution to ecological research and species conservation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords data quality filtering maxent opportunistic data presence only sample size species distribution models 1 introduction appropriate conservation measures must mitigate the alarming declines of biodiversity caused by global pressures such as climate change urban et al 2016 invasive species early et al 2016 and intensifying land use newbold et al 2015 choosing proper conservation measures requires evidence on the state of biodiversity and species distributions ideally such evidence is gathered through standardised protocols performed by trained observers and with a clear description of both data collection and project objectives kosmala et al 2016 such highly structured data however is rarely available for a wide range of species nor extensive periods or geographical areas urban et al 2016 in response less structured but bulky occurrence data with varying information content often collected by volunteers participating in citizen science initiatives theobald et al 2015 are being explored for biodiversity conservation purposes guisan et al 2013 the value

et al 2013 wood et al 2018 or red list compilations e g maes et al 2015 in contrast the value of data with little information on the observation process is uncertain and conservation applications are limited dobson et al 2020 guillera arroita et al 2015 when such unstructured occurrence data consist of occasional observations of species presences they are termed opportunistic presence only giraud et al 2016 or presence background data wang and stone 2019 they are generally used in sdms e g maxent phillips et al 2006 or point process models renner et al 2015 that contrast available environmental conditions in the study area the background with the conditions at locations where the species was observed elith et al 2011 using opportunistic presence only data for sdms has both advantages and disadvantages the main advantage is the abundance of the available data because an easy data collection leads to the coverage of a large number of species over large geographical areas at a fine scale and over potentially long periods kosmala et al 2016 online platforms and smartphone applications facilitate an easy recording of species for a volunteer observer and the number of active observers on data platforms such as irecord in the united kingdom https www brc ac uk irecord waarnemingen be in flanders northern belgium https www waarnemingen be or inaturalist worldwide

standardised monitoring schemes opportunistic data can make a valuable contribution to science if processed correctly giraud et al 2016 soroye et al 2018 two major disadvantages of opportunistic presence only data limiting their application potential dobson et al 2020 guillera arroita et al 2015 however are the incapability of delivering probabilistic model outputs guillera arroita et al 2015 and a high risk of bias and error bird et al 2014 isaac and pocock 2015 the awareness of these uncertainties reflects in the scepticism towards data quality of opportunistic observations or citizen science data in general burgess et al 2017 because when disregarded in the modeling or decision making process these disadvantages can lead to misguided conservation measures isaac et al 2014 different strategies are applied to increase the quality of opportunistic datasets a first strategy is rather bottom up where the underlying protocol of a citizen science project is changed kosmala et al 2016 this requires a regime shift and takes time but can be fruitful e g ebird sullivan et al 2014 a second and promising strategy is data integration miller et al 2019 where multiple sources of opportunistic presence only data are combined lin et al 2017 or presence only data is treated as complementary to structured presence absence data robinson et al 2019 a third strategy integrated into many national citizen science databases is data validation where the species identification is verified often together with the spatial and temporal plausibility of a record it is common practice in for example ebird sullivan et al 2009 waarnemingen be swinnen et al 2018 and irecord https www brc ac uk irecord records verified however even with the best experts and state of the art methods e g image recognition it is challenging to verify thousands of records entering data repositories every day particularly those without corroborating picture evidence as a result many researchers apply a fourth strategy where data reliability is maximised by data filtering or data cleaning this can be done by error detection e g serra diaz et al 2017 outlier removal e g kallimanis et al 2017 by filtering in geographical or environmental space e g varela et al 2014 or by deleting species records based on data attributes e g rutten et al 2019 so called stringent filtering steen et al 2019 the desired effect of stringent filtering is an increase in quality by reducing bias and error steen et al 2019 yet sample size is inevitably reduced by filtering and as sample size is known to have a major influence on model performance gábor et al 2019 wisz et al 2008 stringent filtering leads to a trade off between data quality and sample size to our knowledge the combined impact of data quality and sample size in stringent filtering on the performance of sdms remains underexplored studies that explored the impact of stringent data filters found a negligible effect on bird occurrence predictions when retaining only structured survey data kamp et al 2016 or data from observers with higher expertise steen et al 2019 on the other hand predictions were more accurate when using only records validated as correct for a butterfly genus prone to misidentification vantieghem et al 2017 or by using only ebird checklists of observers who travelled larger distances to do their observations steen et al 2019 in our study we will expand on previous findings by applying different quality filters on a regional species occurrence database waarnemingen be the database consists of both structured and unstructured recordings in flanders since 2008 and currently holds more than 44 million species records and one of the densest collections of species records in europe herremans et al 2018 our aim is to identify which quality filters increase the discrimination accuracy of maxent and to formulate recommendations based on taxonomic group and data characteristics every citizen science database is unique and while the considered taxonomic groups in waarnemingen be are blessed with a relatively high proportion of quality data this might not be the case in all data repositories the properties of waarnemingen be allowed us to evaluate the impact on model performance of different changes in data quality for a wide range of changes in sample size this does not only provide more insight into the trade off between data quality and sample size in stringent filtering but also ensures the transferability of our results to datasets of lower quality and or record density 2 material and methods 2 1 dataset and quality filters we assessed the impact of data quality filtering on opportunistic citizen science data gathered in the flemish species occurrence database waarnemingen be the dataset contained both structured data or observations supported by guidelines or a protocol varying from standardized monitoring schemes to small project observations and unstructured data or incidental observations for a detailed description of our data selection and model testing procedure see section 2 2 and appendix a 161 782 structured records were separated for model testing to measure the performance of the sdms see section 2 3 another 5 547 750 unstructured records were used for model training we adopted the odmap protocol v1 0 zurell et al 2020 and describe the different steps overview data model assessment and prediction in appendix b we selected three dichotomous filters as a measure for data quality based on available metadata table a 1 the first filter activity refers to the annual average number of active recording days of an observer in the study period 2014 2019 we calculated the individual activity rate of observers including the observers with the highest number of records first and stopped when we reached the observers that cumulatively collected 80 of the data the threshold for a high activity rate was set to the first quartile of the activity rate of this group i e 92 recording days in one year we considered this a proxy for observer experience known to lead to lower rates of both false negative and false positive errors farmer et al 2012 kallimanis et al 2017 kelling et al 2015 the second filter detail reflects whether observers provide information beyond the default date location and species name such as species behaviour photographs or additional comments records submitted with more effort are of higher quality if effort is defined by the distance travelled for a checklist steen et al 2019 because we applied filters to unstructured data only we used record detail as a measure for effort instead the third filter valstat is based on the status of a record in the internal validation system of the database indicating if it was evaluated as correct or as uncertain records marked as correct are meant to contain no misidentification errors e g vantieghem et al 2017 even though an occasional human or software error might occur records marked as uncertain have either not been validated or were hard to judge correctly due to lack of additional information swinnen et al 2018 2 2 data selection records from four well studied taxonomic groups in flanders i e birds butterflies dragonflies and plants were subjected to some initial data restrictions 1 records were limited to our study area the flemish region of belgium 2 observations dated from january 2014 to september 2019 3 we included only records with sufficient geographical precision 500 metres 4 for birds only birds that breed in flanders were used vermeersch et al 2020 and 5 we removed absences zero counts and entries validated as incorrect after the initial selection we divided the data into records for model training and records for model testing also see appendix a and fig a 1 structured data were used solely for model testing and never for model training and were further reduced to high quality testing records this was done by selecting only structured records that were validated as correct and from observers with a high activity rate the model training records consisted of unstructured presence only data a data type found in many large scale datasets of opportunistic species records e g gbif https www gbif org model training records were subjected to the three quality filters and their combinations resulting in seven filtered datasets fig a 2 per species training and testing records were aggregated in a 1 1 km grid a frequently used resolution in flemish biodiversity research e g demolder et al 2014 rutten et al 2019 vantieghem et al 2017 resulting in one presence per grid cell per species this aggregation of records is also known as spatial thinning or spatial filtering a common technique to reduce spatial bias kramer schadt et al 2013 and improve model performance boria et al 2014 the high quality presences of the model testing set were complemented with absences derived from grid cells with high search effort for the associated taxonomic group but where the target species was not observed we kept only species with at least 50 presences in the testing set and at least one filtered training set with at least 100 presences this resulted in a dataset of 255 species in four taxonomic groups full list in table c 1 2 3 species distribution model we evaluated the impact of stringent filtering on the performance of maxent software version 3 4 1 implemented in the r package dismo v1 1 4 hijmans et al 2017 maxent is a commonly used presence only algorithm elith et al 2011 phillips et al 2006 which models a relative probability of occurrence based on a species presence records and background points background points are used to define the contrast between what is available in the environment and what is used by the species elith et al 2011 we included all of the 13 552 cells in our study area as background and did not adjust the background selection to correct for sampling bias e g phillips et al 2009 vollering et al 2019 to ensure comparability of our models merow et al 2013 comparability was further supported by allowing only linear quadratic and product features for every model by setting a minimum sample size of 100 to ensure that the regularization coefficient was kept to 0 05 and by using identical predictors in all maxent models the predictor set represented the range of environmental conditions in our study area and comprised twelve continuous predictors and two factor variables see table c 2 for a summary we aggregated the land use in flanders in eleven classes agriculture forest semi natural grassland scrub heathland saltmarshes wetlands dunes urban areas water and other green areas i e green areas outside the urban area that are not mapped as agricultural or natural land use poelmans and van daele 2014 the area of these classes in each 1 1 km cell was calculated and cells were removed if the cumulative area of land use was less than 50 of the total area i e cells close to regional borders we removed one class agriculture from the set because of the relatively high collinearity with other classes and because of the problem with perfect multicollinearity in compositional data aichison 2003 the ten other land use classes were used to describe the variation in the extremely fragmented landscape in flanders antrop 2004 two additional continuous predictors were the mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation bio1 and bio12 from worldclim2 respectively fick and hijmans 2017 the first factor variable was a grid cell s dominant soil texture class maréchal and tavernier 1974 a direct or indirect influencer of a species microclimate titeux et al 2009 the second was ecoregion couvreur et al 2004 which is a region with similar biotic and abiotic conditions since flanders has limited geographical and environmental gradients e g 240 km across 0 to 288 m elevation and relatively uniform climatic conditions and species use similar biotopes throughout the region we assumed that the environmental response of a species was similar across the entire study area chen et al 2020 2 4 model evaluation for model evaluation we chose three metrics the area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve auc sensitivity i e true positive rate and specificity i e true negative rate fielding and bell 1997 based on three rationales first using auc alone as a summary metric of the roc curve would lead to a loss of information about model performance jiménez valverde 2012 second these metrics are measures of model discrimination and independent of species prevalence which is unknown in presence background situations lawson et al 2014 third we evaluated our models on an external testing test that contained both presences and absences enabling a reasonable calculation of the two threshold dependent metrics sensitivity and specificity and justifying the use of these metrics for model evaluation jiménez valverde 2012 jiménez and soberón 2020 sensitivity and specificity were calculated by transforming the continuous model predictions resulting from the different training sets into a binary response the threshold was set to the value that maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity calculated on the species testing set thereby minimizing misclassification errors kaivanto 2008 the difference in model performance auc sensitivity and specificity was used to evaluate the impact of data quality filtering four choices facilitated the comparison of evaluation metrics within one species elith et al 2011 lobo et al 2008 merow et al 2013 1 an identical testing set 2 identical maxent settings features and regularization coefficient 3 identical background selection and 4 identical predictors 2 5 the impact of data quality on model performance we repeatedly 20 times selected a random sample from the unfiltered and filtered training sets at six predefined levels of 100 250 500 1000 2000 and 4000 presences also see fig a 3 model evaluation metrics were compared between training sets of constant fixed sample size but with different quality resulting from the application of the different filters for the evaluation of data quality species were divided into one of the six sample size levels based on two conditions firstly the sample size level was bounded from above by the number of available presences for all filtered training sets including the 3 filter combination activity detail valstat adv this facilitated a comparison of all filters without the influence of inter species differences secondly species were classified at the highest level possible based on the number of available presences in the original adv training set in other words sample size was kept as close as possible to the number of recorded presences in the database this way we prevented that large differences between the sample size of the unchanged training set i e the actual occurrence in the data and the fixed sample size would impact model performance hanberry et al 2012 2 6 the impact of absolute sample size on model performance for the evaluation of absolute sample size we included models from different fixed sample sizes per species we kept data quality constant by comparing results per filter and not between filters per filter species were grouped in one out of six intervals of sample size that indicate the sample size of the original training sets 100 250 or 250 500 or 500 1000 or 2000 4000 or 4000 species were thus constant across absolute sample sizes but not across filters nor intervals 2 7 the combined impact of data quality and sample size on model performance the impact on model performance of a change in data quality and a change in sample size will occur simultaneously to evaluate this combined impact we analysed 30 724 combinations of unfiltered and filtered training sets with different changes in quality and sample size we used all training sets of fixed sample size at the six predefined levels that we could obtain for each species together with the original training sets with sample size equal to the number of aggregated presences from the dataset model evaluation metrics were averaged across the 20 repetitions for the fixed sample sizes i e per species filter type and sample size level and we looked at the mean differences in model performance auc sensitivity specificity between models of an unfiltered training set and the filtered training sets to fully capture the impact of the change in sample size we assessed two sample size variables the remaining sample size after filtering and the proportional reduction in sample size the latter is defined as the proportion of presences removed from an unfiltered training set by applying a single filter or a combination of filters see fig a 3 for an example of how many different datasets we could extract for one species and filter the combined impact of data quality and sample size on the difference in model performance was assessed using generalized additive mixed models gamms with species as a random effect implemented in the mgcv r package v1 8 31 wood 2017 to account for the doubly bounded character of our response variable we rescaled auc sensitivity and specificity to fall between 0 and 1 and used the betareg family with logit link smoothing functions were used to fit both sample size variables with cubic spline method and k 5 to reduce overfitting we included interactions by allowing different smoothers per filter and by including the product of the remaining sample size and the proportional reduction in the equation per taxonomic group the model which best explained the difference in model performance while keeping model complexity low was selected by comparing the akaike s information criterion aic burnham et al 2011 of multiple a priori gamms full list in appendix f in the r package mumin v1 43 17 barton 2019 the relative importance of data quality filter type and sample size sample size after filtering and proportional reduction was assessed by comparing the proportion of explained deviance of those variables in the best model identified by our model selection we performed all analyses for the three evaluation metrics auc sensitivity and specificity across all species and within species groups and show the main results for auc in the main text all other results can be found in appendices d through h in supplementary information 1 models and statistical analyses were run in r v4 0 1 r core team 2020 3 results throughout the results section the filters will be referred to as activity a retaining records collected by observers with a high activity rate detail d retaining records that were submitted with information beyond the default date location and species name and valstat v retaining records marked as correct in the data platform s validation system 3 1 the impact of data quality on model performance fig 1 shows that for all species filtered data could deliver higher aucs than unfiltered data but with differences among sample size levels smaller sample sizes of filtered data were more likely to result in higher aucs compared to large sample sizes of filtered data at 100 presences all filters could result in a higher auc while at 250 and 500 presences valstat and detail could deliver positive results for larger sample sizes valstat and its combinations at 1000 presences or no filters at all at 2000 and 4000 presences benefitted model performance plants were most sensitive to data quality where detail and valstat and also activity at 100 presences resulted in higher aucs throughout birds were sensitive to data quality at the low and intermediate sample sizes where the best option was valstat at 500 and 1000 presences valstat alone already increased auc at 100 and 250 presences valstat had to be combined with at least one other filter for butterflies aucs increased when using activity alone or in combination with one or two other filters at 4000 presences or in combination with valstat at 1000 presences for dragonflies single filters were not powerful enough to increase auc combining detail with valstat at 500 presences or with activity at 1000 presences did deliver higher aucs similar results to auc were found for specificity but mostly for plants at small sample sizes of 100 presences all filters increased specificity and 250 presences detail valstat a d and a v increased specificity at 500 presences we noted increases in specificity for dragonflies a d and a d v and decreases in specificity for plants detail a d and d v at larger sample sizes of 1000 presences or more a higher specificity was found only for birds filter combinations data quality did not impact specificity for butterflies fig d 2 results for sensitivity showed more negative impacts of using filtered data compared to auc and specificity yet also increases in sensitivity were noted for plants at 250 presences detail and its combinations and 500 presences all filters except activity and a v and for butterflies at 4000 presences activity and its combinations a lower sensitivity was found for plants at 100 presences valstat and its combinations for dragonflies at 500 presences a d and a d v and for birds at 100 presences a d 2000 presences activity and combinations with valstat and 4000 presences detail and its combinations fig d 1 3 2 the impact of absolute sample size on model performance fig 2 shows that reducing absolute sample size beyond a certain level always impacted aucs negatively this level depended more on the original sample size than on the applied filter at lower original sample sizes 2000 presences reducing sample size by 50 did not cause significant decreases in auc for most filters with exceptions for detail valstat a d and a v at 500 to 1000 presences at larger original sample sizes 2000 presences sample size could be reduced by 75 for most filters with exceptions for valstat and d v at 2000 to 4000 presences reducing sample size to 100 presences no matter what the original sample size was always resulted in lower model performance for birds and butterflies the impact of sample size on auc was similar to that of all species fig e 3 and e 4 dragonfly and plant models appeared less sensitive to sample size fig e 5 and e 6 similar to auc the impact of smaller sample sizes on specificity was generally negative across all species with a higher tolerance for larger reductions when original sample sizes were high yet with more variation among filters fig e 2 specificity of butterfly and plant models fig e 12 and e 14 appeared more sensitive to smaller sample sizes compared to bird and dragonfly models fig e 11 and e 13 in contrast with results for auc and specificity the impact of smaller sample sizes on sensitivity is generally positive significant increases in sensitivity were more likely to occur for higher quality data filter combinations at lower original sample sizes and for lower quality data unfiltered data and single filters at higher original sample sizes fig e 1 for butterflies dragonflies and plants sensitivity generally increased fig e 8 e 9 and e 10 when specificity decreased fig e 12 e 13 and e 14 for birds this contrast was less pronounced and we even noted more decreases in sensitivity than increases when sample size was reduced fig e 7 3 3 the combined impact of data quality and sample size on model performance up to this point the absolute sample size of unfiltered and filtered data remained identical in reality however sample size usually decreases when applying quality filters therefore the impact of sample size was quantified with two variables in this section the proportional reduction in sample size and the sample size after filtering also called remaining sample size a detailed summary per species of all the filters and their impact on model performance showed that model performance mostly increased after filtering depending on the applied filter for 55 to 80 of the species for auc 49 to 55 for sensitivity and 51 to 58 for specificity but that various filter species combinations also show a negative impact on model performance table in supplementary information 2 per taxonomic group we selected the best gamm appendix f i e the model with the least parameters and a small difference in aic aic 1 compared to the top model to evaluate the combined impact of data quality and sample size on the change in model performance caused by filtering fig 3 shows the relative importance of the variables in the model for auc considering the averages across species boxplots the change in quality the filter type explained most of the variation in auc for plants and dragonflies yet with high variability in percentage deviance explained de among species the interaction between proportional reduction and sample size after filtering explained the most variation in auc for bird and butterfly models and is also important for dragonfly models for plants however more variation in auc was explained by the interaction between quality and sample size after filtering this interaction was also more important when considering the variation in sensitivity and specificity and the differences between the proportional de for the variables filter interaction rxs and interaction sxf became smaller the filter type remained the most important variable for plants for predicting both sensitivity and specificity yet with less variability among species compared to auc results fig g 1 and g 2 the predictions for auc of the best gamm are presented in fig 4 along a continuous scale of proportional reduction and for three sample sizes after filtering that we chose based on data availability 100 500 and 1000 presences predictions for sensitivity and specificity are found in appendix h the combined impact of filtering varies among taxonomic groups and we find the highest impacts for plant models auc and sensitivity and dragonfly models sensitivity with the largest differences in model performance among filters the predictions for birds and plants in fig 4 show that the best filters i e the filters leading to increases in auc can differ between remaining sample sizes confirmed by the relatively higher importance of the interaction between filter and sample size after filtering fig 3 for plants for example the best filter was a d v at small but d v at large remaining sample sizes similar patterns were detected for sensitivity birds dragonflies and plants in fig g 1 and h 1 and for specificity all groups in fig g 2 and h 2 in general filters that resulted in high quality data usually increased model performance figs 1 d 1 and d 2 the proportional reduction in sample size could also be higher for those filters before a negative impact on model performance was detected overall filtering increased aucs and sensitivity for plants i e 0 and decreased sensitivity for birds i e 0 while in other cases both increases and decreases in model performance were noted different trends described the impact of proportional reduction on model performance the shape of the trend depended on the remaining sample size with different trend slopes for all taxonomic groups and even different trend directions for birds sensitivity butterflies auc dragonflies sensitivity and specificity and plants sensitivity for auc and specificity trends at small remaining sample sizes of 100 presences were negative and filtering decreased model performance i e 0 beyond a certain maximal threshold of proportional reduction depending on the filter maximum reductions in sample size could range from 0 35 auc for birds 20 60 auc or 10 30 specificity for butterflies 55 85 auc or 35 65 specificity for dragonflies and 5 85 specificity for plants for sensitivity trends at a remaining sample size of 100 presences were positive except for birds depending on the filter reductions had to be at least 0 10 for butterflies and 35 70 for dragonflies before an increase in model performance was noted for larger remaining sample sizes of 500 and 1000 presences trends in the impact of proportional reduction on auc and specificity remained negative for birds for butterflies trends for auc flattened with increasing sample size after filtering and aucs became largely positive except for detail valstat and d v at reductions above 45 we even saw a positive trend when reductions above 70 resulted in larger sample sizes of 1000 presences for dragonflies trends were flattened for auc and specificity at larger remaining sample sizes and except in the case of specificity and valstat model performance generally increased after filtering trends even became positive for specificity at larger remaining sample sizes of 1000 presences and reductions above 20 for sensitivity however trends became more negative for dragonflies at higher remaining sample sizes and only valstat at 500 presences and reductions below 70 lead to increases in model performance 4 discussion we applied three dichotomous filters to opportunistic species records of citizen scientists as single filters and in combinations to test their impact on species distribution model sdm performance we retained records from more active observers activity detailed records i e submitted with information beyond the default date location and species name detail and validated records i e marked as correct in the data platform s validation system valstat results indicated that the impact of stringent filtering on model performance measured by changes in auc sensitivity and specificity depended on the quality of the filtered data both the proportional reduction in sample size caused by filtering and the remaining absolute sample size and the taxonomic group a recurring pattern was that specificity results true negative rates generally agreed more with auc results than sensitivity results true positive rates moreover specificity usually increased when sensitivity decreased and vice versa which happens when evaluating model predictions on an external data set jiménez valverde 2012 in the discussion that follows we will focus on auc results and we refer to the different results for specificity and sensitivity in the results section and supplementary information the reader must keep in mind that the choice of an optimal threshold for threshold dependent metrics depends on the characteristics of the sdm study e g the goal of the study or the availability of information on species prevalence jiménez valverde and lobo 2007 and that this choice might influence the recommendations for the most suited approach for quality filtering the quality of validated and detailed records was generally higher than the quality of records from more active observers luckily validation of occurrence data entering large repositories by synergies between human experts and computer intelligence has been common practice e g in ebird kelling et al 2013 the main benefits for data quality of such an internal validation system are i the quick and relatively easy identification and correction of false positive errors as they can impact model performance negatively costa et al 2015 and ii an increased observer skill by the interaction between data managers and users sullivan et al 2009 metadata cannot only hold important information to improve sdms by overcoming problems with imperfect detection e g kéry et al 2009 or other types of systematic bias e g johnston et al 2017 but our results also indicate that the very act of supplying additional information can benefit data quality we therefore agree that observer dedication and effort linked to detail are more fit measures of data quality than observer experience and recording rates linked to activity henckel et al 2020 steen et al 2019 like in several other studies on data quality it remains tough to detect changes in model performance due to observer related measures of quality e g observer skill and reporting consistency in henckel et al 2020 or observer expertise in steen et al 2019 combining multiple observer characteristics in observer profiles boakes et al 2016 isaac and pocock 2015 might be of added value here nonetheless selecting data from active observers did significantly increase data quality for eight butterfly species that were among the most observed species in our dataset we hypothesize that these common species are susceptible to misidentification by the inexperienced observer farmer et al 2012 because of their highly familiar names in dutch aglais io l gonepteryx rhamni l and vanessa atalanta l or because they are hard to distinguish from congeners pieris rapae l maniola jurtina l and pararge aegeria l vantieghem et al 2017 when deciding whether or not to filter it is not only important to consider the obtained data quality but also both the proportional reduction in sample size and the remaining absolute sample size after filtering large reductions or small remaining sample sizes do not always cause lower model performance and while we agree that small sample sizes generally lead to worse models jiménez valverde et al 2009 liu et al 2019 the relative change in sample size must not be ignored hanberry et al 2012 both measures of sample size co define which filters are suited for model performance improvement they have a limited impact on the selection of the best or worst filters based on auc results as the relative impact on auc of the different filters remained largely constant across different changes in sample size however here we must mention that when the goal is to increase sensitivity or specificity the remaining sample size after filtering does need to be considered appendix g the different drivers of model performance make the interpretation complex but also highlight the importance of analysing multiple aspects of data manipulation together gábor et al 2019 we add data quality to the list of drivers that can notably impact model performance such as species characteristics modeling technique and sample size gábor et al 2019 tessarolo et al 2014 compared to these factors previous studies found marginal importance of the impact of sampling bias gábor et al 2019 tessarolo et al 2014 and we have no reason to contest this finding based on our results but note that we partially controlled for sampling bias by spatial thinning kramer schadt et al 2013 disentangling the different drivers of model performance in stringent filtering could be more feasible in a virtual species setting hirzel et al 2001 meynard et al 2019 however we argue that the simulation of filtered data of different quality is not trivial this would require a more profound understanding of how data quality is impacted by data and species characteristics we can recommend stringent filtering for taxonomic groups where model performance is more impacted by data quality and less by sample size such as the plants and dragonflies in this study for plant models we even observed that an increase in quality can mitigate the negative impact on auc of reducing sample size to 100 presences fig e 6 and fig 4 for the other taxonomic groups this is only true below certain proportional reductions models from species with specific habitat conditions such as dragonflies are less sensitive to sample size and also profit from data quality increase such species have a more distinct link with their habitat and are easier to model compared to species with a broader niche hernandez et al 2006 nevertheless caution is needed because the impact of data quality on model performance shows large variation among plant and dragonfly species fig 3 and is different when considering other evaluation metrics appendix e for taxonomic groups where model performance is more impacted by sample size and less by data quality such as the birds and butterflies in this study we advise being more careful we observed that filtering is less beneficial for these groups probably because their abundant data already leads to relatively high model performance especially for birds unfiltered data appeared very suited for modeling and filtering did not improve aucs certainly when less than 50 of the sample size remained for these groups even filters that do not cause large reductions nor lead to a small sample size could cause model performance to decrease nonetheless choosing the right filter can mitigate the negative impact of sample size if the obtained quality is high enough e g extracting data from active observers for butterflies or combining validated and detailed records for birds in this study we focussed on the combined impact of data quality and sample size in stringent filtering but we acknowledge that other factors such as environmental filtering gabor et al 2019 scale connor et al 2018 gottschalk et al 2011 species traits hernandez et al 2006 mcpherson and jetz 2007 and sdm technique liu et al 2019 will probably impact the sensitivity of a dataset to stringent filtering as well for example the proportion of high quality data in a model training set is scale dependent because a coarse resolution gives a higher chance that at least one high quality observation falls in a grid cell spatial thinning is therefore not only a way to remove spatial bias boria et al 2014 but also to reduce other sources of uncertainty kramer schadt et al 2013 such as the presence of data with uncertain quality we also detected variation among species and as taxonomic groups still show plenty variation in species traits maes et al 2019 it might be more efficient to formulate recommendations for stringent filtering based on species traits rather than on taxonomy species prone to misidentification for example can benefit from retaining only records validated as correct based on photos supplied by the observer vantieghem et al 2017 and we have indications that for example habitat specificity mobility and popularity impact the sensitivity of a species to data quality filtering as well our recommendations are limited to the discrimination accuracy of maxent as maxent usually comes out as a relatively more robust sdm technique thibaud et al 2014 our conclusions are likely to be conservative we therefore expect at least a similar if not a larger impact of data quality filtering for other sdm techniques 5 conclusions we conclude that data quality filtering has the potential to improve predictions of species distributions especially for species where sdms are less sensitive to decreases in sample size however data quality should not be pursued at any cost because filtering can also impact model performance negatively e g for species with abundant data or when filtering leads to low sample sizes or causes high sample size reductions we encourage the further development and adoption of techniques that can increase the availability of high quality data to be able to fully profit from the benefits of opportunistic citizen science data the value of a database integrated validation system demonstrates the potential of bulky datasets from platforms and applications where the focus is on the identification and validation of species observations such as inaturalist https
