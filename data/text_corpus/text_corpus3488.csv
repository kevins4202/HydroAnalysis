17440,anaerobic co digestion is an attractive option to treat food waste and waste activated sludge which is increasingly applied in real world situations as an active component in capsicum species being substantially present in food waste in many areas capsaicin has been recently demonstrated to inhibit the anaerobic co digestion however the interaction between capsaicin and anaerobic co digestion are still poorly understood this work therefore aims to deeply understand the fate and impact of capsaicin in the anaerobic co digestion experiment results showed that capsaicin was completely degraded in anaerobic co digestion by hydroxylation o demethylation dehydrogenation and doubly oxidization respectively although methane was proven to be produced from capsaicin degradation the increase in capsaicin concentration resulted in decrease in methane yield from the anaerobic co digestion with an increase of capsaicin from 2 0 7 to 68 4 mg g volatile solids vs the maximal methane yield decreased from 274 6 9 7 to 188 9 8 4 ml g vs the mechanic investigations demonstrated that the presence of capsaicin induced apoptosis probably by either altering key kinases or decreasing the intracellular nad nadh ratio which led to significant inhibitions to hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis especially acetotrophic methanogenesis illumina miseq sequencing analysis exhibited that capsaicin promoted the populations of complex organic degradation microbes such as escherichia shigella and fonticella but decreased the numbers of anaerobes relevant to hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis such as bacteroide and methanobacterium graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords capsaicin food waste waste activate sludge anaerobic co digestion methane production 1 introduction food waste fw and waste activated sludge was are two major bio solids in the world which are massively generated it is documented that more than 1 3 billion tons fw are globally produced each year li et al 2020b xu et al 2018 and the annul amount is estimated to achieve approximately 2 2 billion tons by 2025 mehariya et al 2018 in china more than 90 million tons of fw is produced each year accounting for 37 62 of municipal solid waste zhang et al 2014 as for was its amount in china is over 40 million tons per year and increases at an annual average rate of 4 75 luo et al 2020b the total amount in the world is estimated to increase to 103 million tons by 2025 yao et al 2018 fw and was contain substantial degradable substrates e g proteins carbohydrates and lipids and also several recalcitrant or toxic materials such as cellulose humus antioxidant antibiotic and heavy metals liu et al 2020a shah et al 2005 tao et al 2020 wang et al 2019a they will pose high risks to the environment if they are not treated appropriately li et al 2020a as a mature technology to effectively prevent pollution and recover energy concurrently anaerobic digestion attracts much attention liu et al 2020b luo et al 2020a compared with the mono digestion anaerobic co digestion of fw and was offers complementary benefits such as substrate variability toxicity dilution and c n ratio balance sole bundo et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 therefore it has been recently thought to be a very promising option and growingly executed in field situations nghiem et al 2017 capsaicin a major pungent ingredient in varieties of capsicums is widely used as food additives throughout the world especially in south east asian latin american countries and southwest of china kurita et al 2002 surh and lee 1995 for instance the daily consumption of capsicum spices is 5 g person in thailand monsereenusorn 1983 and 20 g person one chili pepper in mexico lópez carrillo et al 1994 the capsaicin content in capsicums usually ranges from 0 1 to 2 5 mg g parrish 1996 this indicates that capsaicin accumulation in fw could be up to 25 g kg it is known that capsaicin has a wide variety of antimicrobial effects and can interact at primary sensory neurons exerting the characteristic actions of excitation desensitization and neurotoxicity kurita et al 2002 due to this characteristic several efforts have been carried out to assess the toxicity of capsaicin to microorganisms gu et al 2019 showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations of capsaicin on streptococcus mutans actinomyces viscosus lactobacillus and streptococcus sanguis were 50 50 50 25 μg ml respectively as anaerobic co digestion is a biological process with varieties of anaerobes being involved the presence of capsaicin might also affect these microbes li et al 2016 demonstrated that when the pungency degree decreased from 1136 1 to 71 5 scoville heat units i e 11 1 to 0 7 g capsaicin kg kitchen waste the maximum methane production increased from 9 9 to 13 5 ml g vs h indicating the detrimental impact of capsaicin on anaerobic digestion yue et al 2020 recently found that n vanillylnonanamide one type of capsaicin inhibited anaerobic digestion of glycerol trioleate severely as n vanillynonanamid addition increased from 0 to 40 wt the methane yield decreased from 780 21 to 142 1 ml g total volatile solid the findings obtained by the previous investigations confirmed the detrimental effect of capsaicin and raised our concerns in terms of the toxicity of capsaicin to anaerobic co digestion considering the massive quantities of capsaicin rich wastes treated daily comprehensive and deep understanding the fate and impact of capsaicin in anaerobic co digestion is of significance to manipulate the co digesters in field situations despite the excellent work made by li et al and yue et al details of what happen in capsaicin rich co digestion systems remain largely unknown for example capsaicin as an organic it is unclear about the transformation and metabolism of capsaicin in the process of anaerobic co digestion and its interaction with anaerobes the contribution of capsaicin degradation to methane yield is also not clear moreover as anaerobic co digestion contains several processes such as disintegration hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis it is also unknown that the mechanism of capsaicin effects on each process by clarifying these questions this work aims to deeply understand the fate and impact of capsaicin in anaerobic co digestion of fw and was firstly the fate of capsaicin in the co digesters was systematically assessed then the influence of capsaicin at different concentrations on methane production was investigated finally details of how capsaicin affects methane production were explored to our knowledge this is the first study revealing the interaction between capsaicin and anaerobic co digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1 source and characteristics of fw was and inocula fw used in this work which was mainly composed of rice noodles and vegetables was withdrawn from a cafeteria in hunan university changsha china the indigestible substrates e g inorganic particles bones and chopsticks were first removed before fw was crushed into small particles 1 3 mm for further use the main characteristics of fw are

1 ts 46 7 3 5 g l and vs 38 6 2 3 g l 2 2 effect of capsaicin on methane production from anaerobic co digestion this batch test was performed in six identical serum bottles and the working volume of each bottle was 500 ml among them one was set as the blank and the other five were operated as the experimental reactors according to the literature the mixture ratio of fw to was used in this study was set as 1 1 on a vs basis mehariya et al 2018 firstly 1 5 l mixture of fw and was was evenly divided into the five experimental reactors respectively then different amounts of extra capsaicin were added into the reactors which led to the initial capsaicin content of 2 0 7 8 1 2 20 2 3 36 2 6 or 68 4 1 mg g vs it should be emphasized that no extra capsaicin was added into the first experimental reactor and 2 0 7 mg g vs was the background value in the digestion mixture to improve the uniformity of capsaicin all the mixtures were pretreated in a water bath shaker 120 rpm 60 c for 30 min huang et al 2020 when the mixtures were cooled down to room temperature each reactor received 50 ml same inocula as mentioned above the blank reactor which merely contained 50 ml inocula and 300 ml of milli q water was also conducted to test the methane productivity from the inocula alone all the reactors were flushed with high purity nitrogen for 5 min to eliminate oxygen sealed with rubber stoppers and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm at 35 1 c for 45 d ph value in all the reactors was maintained at 7 0 0 1 during the whole digestion period by 4 m hydrochloric acid or 4 m sodium hydroxide with automatic titrators in this work all the tests unless otherwise described were operated in triplicate the data reported below are net values with the values determined in the blank reactor having been subtracted during the entire digestion process the yield of methane produced was determined periodically by releasing the pressure in the serum bottle using a 300 ml glass syringe to equilibrate with the room pressure according to the method documented in the literature liu et al 2019 and the calculation of the cumulative volume of methane was detailed in our previous publication wang et al 2015 2 3 methane production from capsaicin three replicates serum bottles with a working volume of 500 ml each were carried out to assess whether capsaicin can be served as substrates to produce methane in the anaerobic co digestion process each reactor received 50 ml same inocula among them one bottle receives 300 ml of milli q water and was set as the control the other two bottles received 300 ml synthetic medium containing either 36 mg capsaicin g vs or 68 mg capsaicin g vs as the extra digested substrate all the operations were the same as depicted in section 2 2 2 4 effect of capsaicin on solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis this batch test was performed to assess the effect of capsaicin on digestion steps i e solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetoclastic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis relevant to methane production the effect of capsaicin on was solubilization was assessed in real was by comparing the variations in soluble proteins and soluble polysaccharides in the presence of different capsaicin concentrations while the impact of capsaicin on other biological processes was evaluated in synthetic media through comparing the specific degradation rates of the model substrates under different concentrations of capsaicin according to the previous study wu et al 2019 in this test fifteen replicate serum bottles were performed and divided into five groups namely test i test ii test iii test iv and test v with three in each test i three reactors with a working volume of 500 ml each were operated the three reactors first received 300 ml mixture of fw and was which capsaicin concentrations were 2 0 7 8 1 2 36 2 6 mg g vs respectively after being pretreated at 60 c for 30 min each reactor was fed with 50 ml inocula all other conditions were the same as those described above by measuring the concentrations of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the initial 2 days the effect of capsaicin on solubilization could be obtained test ii three replicate anaerobic digestion reactors were operated each reactor received 50 ml identical inocula and 300 ml same synthetic wastewater containing 5 3 g dextran in the anaerobic co digestion of this study carbohydrates are the dominate substrate used for hydrolysis and the carbohydrates in synthetic wastewater were similar to that in the co digestion substrate afterwards 0 11 and 18 mg capsaicin were respectively added into the three reactors which resulted in the initial capsaicin condition of 0 30 and 50 mg l respectively all other conditions were the same as those described above by measuring the specific degradation rate of dextran the effect of capsaicin on hydrolysis process could be indicated test ⅲ this test was operated the same as described in test ii except that the substrate i e dextran in synthetic wastewater was replaced by 2 7 g glucose respectively text ⅳ the operation of this test was performed with the same approach as described in test ii except that 1 25 g sodium acetate was employed to replace dextran in synthetic wastewater test v in this test three reactors were operated each received 50 ml identical inocula and 300 ml milli q water containing 0 11 or 18 mg capsaicin afterwards each reactor was flushed with a mixed gas 40 hydrogen 10 carbon dioxide and 50 nitrogen for 5 min to ensure that each was full of synthetic hydrogen containing gas at last all these reactors were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an incubator 120 rpm at 35 1 c 2 5 model based analysis methane production was simulated by the modified

composition in biogas was analyzed by gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector according to the method documented in the literature wang et al 2019b the concentration of capsaicin was determined using hplc according to the reference hwang et al 2017 the samples were first centrifuged at 6500 rpm at 4 c for 10 min and dried at 58 c for 48 h by vacuum drying oven then 0 2 g dried sample was weighed and dissolved in n hexane the dissolved sample was shocked for 5 min before being placed into ultrasonic machine for 10 min after the sample was re centrifuged at 2500 rpm

synthase complex acds and coenzyme m relevant to methane production were analyzed using previously reported methods grahame and demoll 1996 li et al 2015 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018a the membrane fluidity of microbial cells was determined by flow cytometry using annexin v fitc fluorescence dye according to the reference luo et al 2016 briefly the samples were centrifuged in a 50 ml tube at

16s dna genes were used 2 7 statistical analysis all the batch experiments were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance anova with least significant difference test was used to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 capsaicin variation in anaerobic co digestion fig 1 a shows the variations in hplc chromatogram of extracted mixtures taken from the reactor fed with 68 4 1 mg g vs capsaicin at different digestion times according to hplc chromatogram tested with the standard capsaicin the absorption peak of capsaicin appears at near 4 5 min fig s1 it can be seen that the absorption peak gradually declined with the digestion time which indicates that capsaicin was degraded in the anaerobic co digestion process quantitative calculation exhibits that the concentration of capsaicin in digestion mixture also decreased with the digestion with the digestion time increase from 0 to 9 d capsaicin concentration decreased from 68 4 1 to 14 2 2 4 mg g vs on 12 d digestion less than 1 mg g vs capsaicin was measured in the system suggesting that capsaicin was almost degraded in the co digestion completely the results further suggests that the specific degradation rate of capsaicin in this co digestion system is 4 1 mg g vs d similar observations were also made on other reactors fed with other capsaicin levels it is reported that capsaicin could be metabolized by crude enzyme preparations from body midgut and malpighian tubule of helicoverpa armigera and h assulta zhu et al 2020 through a co2 evolution test wang et al 2014 demonstrated that capsaicin could be biodegraded by microbes and bio converted to co2 and h2o under aerobic conditions when a filamentous fungus i e aspergillus oryzae was incubated with red pepper powder in potato dextrose broth lee et al 2015a found that capsaicin was degraded with five metabolites being obtained despite these significant researches this is the first study proving the degradation of capsaicin in anaerobic co digestion of fw and was 3 2 identification of the main metabolites of capsaicin degradation lc ms ms was used to identify the metabolites of capsaicin in anaerobic co digestion process since the fragment ions of ms ms spectrometry occurred at 10 496 min are the same to those produced from standard capsaicin fig s2 the peak occurred at 10 496 min is considered to be capsaicin on 0 d one peak was detected at 10 496 min m in lc ms chromatogram extracted the sample withdrawn from the digester fed with 68 4 1 mg g vs on 9 d this peak decreased largely and meanwhile three new peaks occurred with their retention time being 6 708 min m1 8 362 min m2 and 12 331 min m3 respectively fig 2 this confirms again that capsaicin was degraded in the anaerobic co digestion and suggests that three major metabolic products were generated from capsaicin degradation the proposed structure and details of metabolites are shown in table s1 to understand capsaicin biodegradation and identify these three metabolites the precursor ions m h m1 h m2 h m3 h and their fragmentation patterns were further determined the precursor ion peak of m h at m z 306 indicates that the molecular weight of capsaicin was 305 fig 3 a besides three fragment ions at m z 137 170 and 182 were also found in fig 3a the fragment ion at m z 137 was reported to be vanillyl portion of capsaicin resulting from cleavage of c7 n8 while the product ions at m z 170 and 182 were respectively derived from fragmentation of alkyl chain at c7 n8 and c1 c7 reilly et al 2003 analogous to capsaicin m the molecular weight of m1 was 321 due to the precursor ion peak of m1 h at m z 322 fig 3b apart from the precursor ion peak there are other four fragment ions being observed in fig 3b the presence of fragment ion at m z 137 indicated that vanilloid ring of capsaicin was not modified shifts in the product ions at m z from 182 and 170 to 198 and 186 may be owing to addition of oxygen atom 16 amu to the alkyl chain the product ion at m z 181 was likely due to loss of hydroxyl group from fragment ion at m z 198 while the appearance of fragment ion at m z 304 was probably due to loss of terminal ch2o from m z 322 based on these analyses m1 m z 322 was inferred to alkyl hydroxylated metabolite of capsaicin with its molecular structure being detailed in fig 3b it was reported that the alkyl side chain of capsaicin was susceptible to enzymatic oxidation reilly and yost 2006 and m1 was also detected as a capsaicin metabolite by aspergillus oryzae lee et al 2015a four fragment ions were observed in the ms ms spectrum of m2 fig 3c the precursor ion peak at m z 292 m2 h indicated that the molecular weight of m2 was 291 the appearance of fragment ion at m z 123 was probably owing to a net loss of 14 amu from the vanilloid ring m z 137 through demethylation of methoxy group gonzalez gil et al 2019 demonstrated that tramadol and trimethoprim can transformed to o desmethyltramadol and 4 desmethyltrimethoprim by demethylation of methoxy groups in anaerobic digestion the existences of fragment ions at m z 170 and 182 however suggested that the alkyl chain was not modified therefore m2 was inferred to be an o demethylation metabolite of capsaicin which was previously detected in capsaicin degradation catalyzed by p450 enzyme as well reilly et al 2003 the precursor ion peak at m z 336 m3 h indicated the molecular weight of m3 being 335 fig 3d which was 30 amu larger than that of capsaicin it can be seen that the fragment ion at m z 170 still existed suggesting that the alkyl chain at c7 n8 was unchanged however the fragment ion at m z 137 disappeared which suggested that the vanilloid portion of capsaicin was modified two new fragment ions at m z 184 and 140 were detected the fragment ion at m z 184 was likely produced by cleavage of alkyl chain at n8 c9 of capsaicin while the fragment ion at m z 140 may be due to loss of ch2no from the fragment ion m z 184 thus m3 was probably a doubly oxidized metabolite of dehydrogenated capsaicin and this was also determined in capsaicin bioconversion by h armigera tian et al 2019 3 3 could methane be produced from capsaicin degradation the analyses above showed that in anaerobic co digestion capsaicin was first degraded into m1 m2 and m3 by hydroxylation o demethylation dehydrogenation and doubly oxidization respectively according to the literature these three metabolites would be further hydrolyzed into amino and carboxyl compounds by amidases with the possible degradation pathway of capsaicin being proposed in fig 4 cho et al 2014 wang et al 2018 yue et al 2020 however it remains unknown whether these metabolic hydrolysates could be used for methane production in anaerobic co digestion requiring to be further clarified to figure out this possibility one batch test was operated using either inocula or inocula capsaicin as the digestion substrate with the experimental details being shown in section 2 3 it was found that about 31 0 0 9 ml methane was produced from the sole inocula whereas the corresponding value was 44 3 1 3 ml from inocula 36 mg capsaicin g vs and 59 9 1 8 ml from inocula 68 mg capsaicin g vs fig s3 this indicates that capsaicin could be served as substrate for methane production in anaerobic digestion according to eq 3 it can be calculated that 0 59 g or 826 ml of methane will be produced from 1 g capsaicin if it is completely digested suggesting that 60 and 87 ml methane should be generated from inocula 36 mg capsaicin g vs and inocula 68 mg capsaicin g vs respectively however the measured data from the two inocula capsaicin digesters were much lower than the theoretical values the possible reasons might be due to 1 incomplete utilization of capsaicin degradation intermediates and 2 inhibition of capsaicin to the activity of inocula 3 c18h27no3 10 5 h2o 11 25 ch4 6 75 co2 nh3 3 4 effect of capsaicin on methane production the cumulative methane yield during anaerobic co digestion in the presence of capsaicin at different concentrations is shown in fig 5 it can be observed that methane yield in the reactor without extra capsaicin addition i e 2 0 7 mg g vs capsaicin reactor increased with the digestion time from 1 to 34 d and no signification increase was observed after that day 34 p 0 05 the optimum digestion time for this reactor was therefore 34 d with the maximum methane yield of 274 6 9 7 ml g of vs being measured from fig 5 it was also found the increase of capsaicin affected methane production obviously with an increase of capsaicin concentration from 2 0 7 to 68 4 1 mg g vs methane yield decreased from 274 6 9 7 to 188 9 8 4 ml g vs apart from methane yield the optimum digestion time was also affected by capsaicin for example 68 4 1 mg g vs of capsaicin increased the optimum digestion time to 58 d to further understand the effect of capsaicin on anaerobic digestion from the aspect of model the modified gompertz equation was employed to estimate three kinetic parameters i e maximum methane yield potential mm methane production rate rm and lag phase time λ it can be found that the gompertz equation described the experimental data well with r2 0 99 in all the scenarios fig 5 when capsaicin concentration increased from 2 0 7 to 68 4 1 mg g vs the determined mm and rm decreased respectively from 257 4 ml g vs and 17 8 ml g vs d to 189 9 ml g vs and 6 6 ml g vs d whereas the calculated λ increased from 6 7 to 14 7 d this indicates that the increase of capsaicin not only decreased biochemical methane potential but also inhibited the rate of methane production according to the analyses above it was demonstrated that the addition of capsaicin reduced rather than improved methane yield though the addition of capsaicin provided extra substrate for anaerobes to produce methane this suggests that anaerobic co digestion from original substrates was largely inhibited by capsaicin which was in accordance with the results reported previously yue et al 2020 based on the experimental data obtained in the current work it was estimated that 50 inhibitory concentration of capsaicin to anaerobic co digestion was around 36 26 mg capsaicin g vs fig s4 since anaerobic co digestion includes several processes such as solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis the mechanism of how capsaicin affects methane production were explored in the following text 3 5 mechanism of how capsaicin inhibits anaerobic co digestion it was found that the concentrations of soluble proteins and carbohydrates increased with capsaicin concentration fig 6 a and fig 6b for example the concentrations of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the reactor fed with 2 0 7 mg g vs capsaicin were respectively 882 7 23 2 and 2695 4 25 5 mg cod l while the corresponding concentrations in the reactor fed with 68 4 1 mg g vs capsaicin were 1505 8 29 1 and 5530 2 53 2 mg cod l respectively according to the literature an increase in the fluorescence intensity indicates an increase in soluble organics in digestion liquid fig 6c xu et al 2017 there are two peaks which are respectively located at ex em of 200 250 290 320 and 250 280 380 nm being found in all the samples fig 6c the fluorescence intensity of both the peaks increased with the addition of capsaicin suggesting that an increase of capsaicin enhanced increases in soluble organics all these facts confirmed that the presence of capsaicin improved rather than reduced solubilization indicating that capsaicin may inhibit the bio processes involved in anaerobic co digestion table 1 summarizes the experiment value and model simulation value of inhibition of capsaicin on dextran glucose acetate and h2 it can be seen that the specific degradation rates of dextran glucose acetate and hydrogen in the blank i e 0 mg l capsaicin were respectively 8 07 0 26 7 00 0 30 2 85 0 14 and 0 24 0 01 mg g vs h and these values were considered the original activities of microbes relevant to hydrolysis acidogenesis acetotrophic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis respectively when 50 mg l capsaicin was added these values decreased respectively to 6 19 0 62 3 30 0 66 1 12 0 03 and 0 17 0 02 mg g vs h this suggests 50 mg l capsaicin reduced the relative activities of microbes expressed as of the original relevant to hydrolysis acidogenesis acetotrophic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis by 23 27 61 and 29 respectively similar observations were also made at 30 mg l capsaicin from table 1 it was also found that inhibition constant ks i of capsaicin to the degradation of these substrates was in the order of acetate h2 glucose dextran suggesting that the inhibition of capsaicin to these bioprocesses was in the sequence of acetotrophic methanogenesis hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis acidogenesis hydrolysis all the results showed that although capsaicin enhanced solubilization it significantly inhibited the bioprocesses of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis especially acetotrophic methanogenesis it can be understood why capsaicin inhibited methane production from anaerobic co digestion it was reported that capsaicin could induce apoptosis by either altering key kinases pramanik and srivastava 2012 or decreasing the intracellular nad nadh ratio by binding to quinone binding site of nadh dehydrogenase 1 ndh 1 lee et al 2015b yagi 1990 furthermore torrecillas et al 2015 found capsaicin molecule could establish a molecular interaction with cell membrane where the nine carbon alkyl chain of capsaicin was aligned with the phospholipid acyl chains perturbing the cooperative behavior of the phospholipid and inducing apoptosis when capsaicin entered into the anaerobic co digestion systems it could contact with the membrane and key enzymes of anaerobes or even enter into the intracellular cells these behaviors may result in inactivation of functional enzymes reduction in conversion between nad and nadh or even cell lysis fig 7 a this deduction can be supported by flow cytometry which is usually used to reflect the cell functional state the physiological status of microorganism cells can be divided into four regions among them viable cells are shown in av pi q4 early apoptotic cells are shown in av pi q3 necrotic or late apoptotic cells are shown in av pi q2 and debris and damaged cells are shown in av pi q1 it can be seen that with an increase of capsaicin from 0 to 50 mg l the fluorescence percentage of viable cells decreased from 96 7 to 78 7 while the fluorescence percentage of early apoptotic cells increased from 0 9 to 16 0 fig 7b this is the major reason for capsaicin enhancing solubilization but reducing hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis according to the data shown in table 1 it can be found that the inhibition of capsaicin to acetotrophic methanogenesis one major pathway responsible for methane production was much severer than that to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the other methane production pathway thus one might want to know why capsaicin caused different inhibitions to these two methane production pathways in acetotrophic methanogenesis acetate can be either converted into acetyl phosphate and acetyl coa catalyzed by ak and pta in turn or directly degraded to acetyl coa catalyzed by coa the generated acetyl coa is then converted into 5 methyl thmpt under the catalysis of acds in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis h2 and co2 can be converted into 5 methyl thmpt with mch and f420 being as the key enzymes fig 8 a as the same intermediate in the two pathways 5 methyl thmpt then undergoes the succession steps of 5 methyl thmpt methyl com ch4 it was found that although the presence of capsaicin inhibited the activity of all these enzymes in acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis its inhibition to coa and acds was much severer than that to others fig 8b this may explain why capsaicin caused severer inhibition to acetotrophic methanogenesis than hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis when acds catalyzes the step of acetyl coa to 5 methyl thmpt two electrons would be generated grahame and demoll 1996 in anaerobic digestion the generated electrons are generally transferred to ferredoxin by 4fe 4s clusters ligands on acds ferry 2011 previous publication demonstrated that capsaicin could be activated to an electrophilic intermediate and this intermediate could compete for the electrons available for ferredoxin utilization fig 8c surh and lee 1995 this causes reductions in the electrons transferred by 4fe 4s clusters ligands on acds which might be the reason for capsaicin severely inhibiting the activity of acds moreover it is reported that the amino group of capsaicin can be subjected to dehydration condensation reaction with carboxyl group of coa inhibiting the metabolic activity of coa yue et al 2020 3 6 effect of capsaicin on microbial community illumina miseq 16s rrna genes sequencing was performed to investigate the effect of capsaicin on microbial community by comparing the structure and abundance of microbial community between the control and experimental reactors the control reactor was fed with 2 mg g vs capsaicin co substrates while the experimental reactor was fed with 68 mg g vs capsaicin co substrates the number of operational taxonomic units was 1074 in the control reactor and 1050 in the experimental digester with 886 being shared fig s5 the alpha diversity results table s2 showed that pd index was similar in the two reactors while chao index in the control was greater than that in the experiment reactor suggesting that the increase of capsaicin reduced the microbial diversity but did not change largely the microbial structure at the phylum level the most predominant bacteria in the two reactors were firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria and actinobacteria fig s6 it is reported that several anaerobes in these phyla can degrade organic compounds e g proteins and carbohydrates wei et al 2019 and many bacteria affiliated to firmicutes and proteobacteria were volatile fatty acid producers wang et al 2017 euryarchaeota was the only archaeal phylum in the two reactors fig s6 which was known as methanogens and detected in several anaerobic digesters wei et al 2019 fig 9 displays the genus level distributions of bacteria and archaea abundances in the two reactors seven genera of bacteria which were responsible for hydrolysis and acidogenesis were detected in the two reactors for example the abundance of bacteroide which was reported to degrade carbohydrates and organic acids pang et al 2020 was measured to be 17 6 in the control but it was completely washed out in the experiment reactor the abundances of dysgonomonadacea petrimonas and macellibacteroides which were able to degrade various polysaccharides and proteins maspolim et al 2015 murakami et al 2018 xu et al 2019 reduced from 6 5 5 3 and 7 9 in the control to 3 2 2 4 and 1 2 in the experiment reactor respectively fig 9a further calculation showed that the total abundance of these genera was 42 6 in the control and 14 8 in the experiment reactor indicating that capsaicin reduced largely the number of anaerobes relevant to hydrolysis and acidogenesis it can be also seen from fig 9a that the abundance of escherichia shigella a resistant genus having ability to degrade aromatic organic pollutants cui et al 2017 vasiliadou et al 2018 increased from 1 0 in the control to 10 7 in the experiment reactor moreover the abundance of several other contaminant degradation microbes such as fonticella pirellulaceae enterococcus and herbinix cao et al 2018 fraj et al 2013 koeck et al 2016 tong et al 2017 increased with capsaicin addition as well the total abundance of potential complex organic degradation microbes increased from 20 7 in the control to 42 4 in the experiment reactor suggesting that these microbes might be capsaicin decomposers in such anaerobic co digestion systems fig 9b shows the distribution of archaea community in the two reactors the total sequences of methanogens decreased from 16313 in the control to 7592 in the experiment reactor suggested that the addition of capsaicin reduced the total archaea populations among them the abundance of methanobacterium decreased from 73 4 in the control to 64 7 in the experiment reactor however the abundances of methanobrevibacter and methanosphaera increased from 2 0 and 0 2 in the control to 9 1 and 2 2 respectively this suggest that the effect of capsaicin on different types of archaea is different and manipulation of co digesters to enrich methanobrevibacter and methanosphaera could effectively mitigate the inhibition of capsaicin to methane production the accurate reason for this different impact is unclear at the current stage more efforts are required in the future 5 conclusions this study evaluated the degradation of capsaicin in anaerobic co digestion of fw and was and explored the effect of capsaicin on methane production as well as the underlying mechanisms of capsaicin affecting methane yield the findings obtained not only advance the understanding of capsaicin involved digestion but also guide engineers to develop effective strategies in the future to manipulate anaerobic co digestion of fw and was the main conclusions are 1 capsaicin can be degraded by some microbe and used as substrate to produce methane hplc ms ms analysis that hydroxylation o demethylation dehydrogenation and doubly oxidization are involved in capsaicin degradation 2 the presence of capsaicin not only slowed the process of anaerobic co digestion but also decreased methane yield with the increase of capsaicin from 2 0 7 to 68 4 mg g vs the maximal methane yield decreased from 274 6 9 7 to 188 9 8 4 ml g vs while the methane production rate decreased from 17 76 to 6 63 ml g vs d 3 mechanism investigations revealed that the presence of capsaicin induced apoptosis which led to significant inhibitions to hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis especially acetotrophic methanogenesis 4 the presence of capsaicin enhanced the populations of complex organic degradation microbes such as escherichia shigella and fonticella but decreased the numbers of

17440,anaerobic co digestion is an attractive option to treat food waste and waste activated sludge which is increasingly applied in real world situations as an active component in capsicum species being substantially present in food waste in many areas capsaicin has been recently demonstrated to inhibit the anaerobic co digestion however the interaction between capsaicin and anaerobic co digestion are still poorly understood this work therefore aims to deeply understand the fate and impact of capsaicin in the anaerobic co digestion experiment results showed that capsaicin was completely degraded in anaerobic co digestion by hydroxylation o demethylation dehydrogenation and doubly oxidization respectively although methane was proven to be produced from capsaicin degradation the increase in capsaicin concentration resulted in decrease in methane yield from the anaerobic co digestion with an increase of capsaicin from 2 0 7 to 68 4 mg g volatile solids vs the maximal methane yield decreased from 274 6 9 7 to 188 9 8 4 ml g vs the mechanic investigations demonstrated that the presence of capsaicin induced apoptosis probably by either altering key kinases or decreasing the intracellular nad nadh ratio which led to significant inhibitions to hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis especially acetotrophic methanogenesis illumina miseq sequencing analysis exhibited that capsaicin promoted the populations of complex organic degradation microbes such as escherichia shigella and fonticella but decreased the numbers of anaerobes relevant to hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis such as bacteroide and methanobacterium graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords capsaicin food waste waste activate sludge anaerobic co digestion methane production 1 introduction food waste fw and waste activated sludge was are two major bio solids in the world which are massively generated it is documented that more than 1 3 billion tons fw are globally produced each year li et al 2020b xu et al 2018 and the annul amount is estimated to achieve approximately 2 2 billion tons by 2025 mehariya et al 2018 in china more than 90 million tons of fw is produced each year accounting for 37 62 of municipal solid waste zhang et al 2014 as for was its amount in china is over 40 million tons per year and increases at an annual average rate of 4 75 luo et al 2020b the total amount in the world is estimated to increase to 103 million tons by 2025 yao et al 2018 fw and was contain substantial degradable substrates e g proteins carbohydrates and lipids and also several recalcitrant or toxic materials such as cellulose humus antioxidant antibiotic and heavy metals liu et al 2020a shah et al 2005 tao et al 2020 wang et al 2019a they will pose high risks to the environment if they are not treated appropriately li et al 2020a as a mature technology to effectively prevent pollution and recover energy concurrently anaerobic digestion attracts much attention liu et al 2020b luo et al 2020a compared with the mono digestion anaerobic co digestion of fw and was offers complementary benefits such as substrate variability toxicity dilution and c n ratio balance sole bundo et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 therefore it has been recently thought to be a very promising option and growingly executed in field situations nghiem et al 2017 capsaicin a major pungent ingredient in varieties of capsicums is widely used as food additives throughout the world especially in south east asian latin american countries and southwest of china kurita et al 2002 surh and lee 1995 for instance the daily consumption of capsicum spices is 5 g person in thailand monsereenusorn 1983 and 20 g person one chili pepper in mexico lópez carrillo et al 1994 the capsaicin content in capsicums usually ranges from 0 1 to 2 5 mg g parrish 1996 this indicates that capsaicin accumulation in fw could be up to 25 g kg it is known that capsaicin has a wide variety of antimicrobial effects and can interact at primary sensory neurons exerting the characteristic actions of excitation desensitization and neurotoxicity kurita et al 2002 due to this characteristic several efforts have been carried out to assess the toxicity of capsaicin to microorganisms gu et al 2019 showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations of capsaicin on streptococcus mutans actinomyces viscosus lactobacillus and streptococcus sanguis were 50 50 50 25 μg ml respectively as anaerobic co digestion is a biological process with varieties of anaerobes being involved the presence of capsaicin might also affect these microbes li et al 2016 demonstrated that when the pungency degree decreased from 1136 1 to 71 5 scoville heat units i e 11 1 to 0 7 g capsaicin kg kitchen waste the maximum methane production increased from 9 9 to 13 5 ml g vs h indicating the detrimental impact of capsaicin on anaerobic digestion yue et al 2020 recently found that n vanillylnonanamide one type of capsaicin inhibited anaerobic digestion of glycerol trioleate severely as n vanillynonanamid addition increased from 0 to 40 wt the methane yield decreased from 780 21 to 142 1 ml g total volatile solid the findings obtained by the previous investigations confirmed the detrimental effect of capsaicin and raised our concerns in terms of the toxicity of capsaicin to anaerobic co digestion considering the massive quantities of capsaicin rich wastes treated daily comprehensive and deep understanding the fate and impact of capsaicin in anaerobic co digestion is of significance to manipulate the co digesters in field situations despite the excellent work made by li et al and yue et al details of what happen in capsaicin rich co digestion systems remain largely unknown for example capsaicin as an organic it is unclear about the transformation and metabolism of capsaicin in the process of anaerobic co digestion and its interaction with anaerobes the contribution of capsaicin degradation to methane yield is also not clear moreover as anaerobic co digestion contains several processes such as disintegration hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis it is also unknown that the mechanism of capsaicin effects on each process by clarifying these questions this work aims to deeply understand the fate and impact of capsaicin in anaerobic co digestion of fw and was firstly the fate of capsaicin in the co digesters was systematically assessed then the influence of capsaicin at different concentrations on methane production was investigated finally details of how capsaicin affects methane production were explored to our knowledge this is the first study revealing the interaction between capsaicin and anaerobic co digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1 source and characteristics of fw was and inocula fw used in this work which was mainly composed of rice noodles and vegetables was withdrawn from a cafeteria in hunan university changsha china the indigestible substrates e g inorganic particles bones and chopsticks were first removed before fw was crushed into small particles 1 3 mm for further use the main characteristics of fw are

1 ts 46 7 3 5 g l and vs 38 6 2 3 g l 2 2 effect of capsaicin on methane production from anaerobic co digestion this batch test was performed in six identical serum bottles and the working volume of each bottle was 500 ml among them one was set as the blank and the other five were operated as the experimental reactors according to the literature the mixture ratio of fw to was used in this study was set as 1 1 on a vs basis mehariya et al 2018 firstly 1 5 l mixture of fw and was was evenly divided into the five experimental reactors respectively then different amounts of extra capsaicin were added into the reactors which led to the initial capsaicin content of 2 0 7 8 1 2 20 2 3 36 2 6 or 68 4 1 mg g vs it should be emphasized that no extra capsaicin was added into the first experimental reactor and 2 0 7 mg g vs was the background value in the digestion mixture to improve the uniformity of capsaicin all the mixtures were pretreated in a water bath shaker 120 rpm 60 c for 30 min huang et al 2020 when the mixtures were cooled down to room temperature each reactor received 50 ml same inocula as mentioned above the blank reactor which merely contained 50 ml inocula and 300 ml of milli q water was also conducted to test the methane productivity from the inocula alone all the reactors were flushed with high purity nitrogen for 5 min to eliminate oxygen sealed with rubber stoppers and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm at 35 1 c for 45 d ph value in all the reactors was maintained at 7 0 0 1 during the whole digestion period by 4 m hydrochloric acid or 4 m sodium hydroxide with automatic titrators in this work all the tests unless otherwise described were operated in triplicate the data reported below are net values with the values determined in the blank reactor having been subtracted during the entire digestion process the yield of methane produced was determined periodically by releasing the pressure in the serum bottle using a 300 ml glass syringe to equilibrate with the room pressure according to the method documented in the literature liu et al 2019 and the calculation of the cumulative volume of methane was detailed in our previous publication wang et al 2015 2 3 methane production from capsaicin three replicates serum bottles with a working volume of 500 ml each were carried out to assess whether capsaicin can be served as substrates to produce methane in the anaerobic co digestion process each reactor received 50 ml same inocula among them one bottle receives 300 ml of milli q water and was set as the control the other two bottles received 300 ml synthetic medium containing either 36 mg capsaicin g vs or 68 mg capsaicin g vs as the extra digested substrate all the operations were the same as depicted in section 2 2 2 4 effect of capsaicin on solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis this batch test was performed to assess the effect of capsaicin on digestion steps i e solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis acetoclastic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis relevant to methane production the effect of capsaicin on was solubilization was assessed in real was by comparing the variations in soluble proteins and soluble polysaccharides in the presence of different capsaicin concentrations while the impact of capsaicin on other biological processes was evaluated in synthetic media through comparing the specific degradation rates of the model substrates under different concentrations of capsaicin according to the previous study wu et al 2019 in this test fifteen replicate serum bottles were performed and divided into five groups namely test i test ii test iii test iv and test v with three in each test i three reactors with a working volume of 500 ml each were operated the three reactors first received 300 ml mixture of fw and was which capsaicin concentrations were 2 0 7 8 1 2 36 2 6 mg g vs respectively after being pretreated at 60 c for 30 min each reactor was fed with 50 ml inocula all other conditions were the same as those described above by measuring the concentrations of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the initial 2 days the effect of capsaicin on solubilization could be obtained test ii three replicate anaerobic digestion reactors were operated each reactor received 50 ml identical inocula and 300 ml same synthetic wastewater containing 5 3 g dextran in the anaerobic co digestion of this study carbohydrates are the dominate substrate used for hydrolysis and the carbohydrates in synthetic wastewater were similar to that in the co digestion substrate afterwards 0 11 and 18 mg capsaicin were respectively added into the three reactors which resulted in the initial capsaicin condition of 0 30 and 50 mg l respectively all other conditions were the same as those described above by measuring the specific degradation rate of dextran the effect of capsaicin on hydrolysis process could be indicated test ⅲ this test was operated the same as described in test ii except that the substrate i e dextran in synthetic wastewater was replaced by 2 7 g glucose respectively text ⅳ the operation of this test was performed with the same approach as described in test ii except that 1 25 g sodium acetate was employed to replace dextran in synthetic wastewater test v in this test three reactors were operated each received 50 ml identical inocula and 300 ml milli q water containing 0 11 or 18 mg capsaicin afterwards each reactor was flushed with a mixed gas 40 hydrogen 10 carbon dioxide and 50 nitrogen for 5 min to ensure that each was full of synthetic hydrogen containing gas at last all these reactors were capped with rubber stoppers sealed and placed in an incubator 120 rpm at 35 1 c 2 5 model based analysis methane production was simulated by the modified

composition in biogas was analyzed by gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector according to the method documented in the literature wang et al 2019b the concentration of capsaicin was determined using hplc according to the reference hwang et al 2017 the samples were first centrifuged at 6500 rpm at 4 c for 10 min and dried at 58 c for 48 h by vacuum drying oven then 0 2 g dried sample was weighed and dissolved in n hexane the dissolved sample was shocked for 5 min before being placed into ultrasonic machine for 10 min after the sample was re centrifuged at 2500 rpm

synthase complex acds and coenzyme m relevant to methane production were analyzed using previously reported methods grahame and demoll 1996 li et al 2015 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2018a the membrane fluidity of microbial cells was determined by flow cytometry using annexin v fitc fluorescence dye according to the reference luo et al 2016 briefly the samples were centrifuged in a 50 ml tube at

16s dna genes were used 2 7 statistical analysis all the batch experiments were performed in triplicate an analysis of variance anova with least significant difference test was used to assess the significance of results and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 capsaicin variation in anaerobic co digestion fig 1 a shows the variations in hplc chromatogram of extracted mixtures taken from the reactor fed with 68 4 1 mg g vs capsaicin at different digestion times according to hplc chromatogram tested with the standard capsaicin the absorption peak of capsaicin appears at near 4 5 min fig s1 it can be seen that the absorption peak gradually declined with the digestion time which indicates that capsaicin was degraded in the anaerobic co digestion process quantitative calculation exhibits that the concentration of capsaicin in digestion mixture also decreased with the digestion with the digestion time increase from 0 to 9 d capsaicin concentration decreased from 68 4 1 to 14 2 2 4 mg g vs on 12 d digestion less than 1 mg g vs capsaicin was measured in the system suggesting that capsaicin was almost degraded in the co digestion completely the results further suggests that the specific degradation rate of capsaicin in this co digestion system is 4 1 mg g vs d similar observations were also made on other reactors fed with other capsaicin levels it is reported that capsaicin could be metabolized by crude enzyme preparations from body midgut and malpighian tubule of helicoverpa armigera and h assulta zhu et al 2020 through a co2 evolution test wang et al 2014 demonstrated that capsaicin could be biodegraded by microbes and bio converted to co2 and h2o under aerobic conditions when a filamentous fungus i e aspergillus oryzae was incubated with red pepper powder in potato dextrose broth lee et al 2015a found that capsaicin was degraded with five metabolites being obtained despite these significant researches this is the first study proving the degradation of capsaicin in anaerobic co digestion of fw and was 3 2 identification of the main metabolites of capsaicin degradation lc ms ms was used to identify the metabolites of capsaicin in anaerobic co digestion process since the fragment ions of ms ms spectrometry occurred at 10 496 min are the same to those produced from standard capsaicin fig s2 the peak occurred at 10 496 min is considered to be capsaicin on 0 d one peak was detected at 10 496 min m in lc ms chromatogram extracted the sample withdrawn from the digester fed with 68 4 1 mg g vs on 9 d this peak decreased largely and meanwhile three new peaks occurred with their retention time being 6 708 min m1 8 362 min m2 and 12 331 min m3 respectively fig 2 this confirms again that capsaicin was degraded in the anaerobic co digestion and suggests that three major metabolic products were generated from capsaicin degradation the proposed structure and details of metabolites are shown in table s1 to understand capsaicin biodegradation and identify these three metabolites the precursor ions m h m1 h m2 h m3 h and their fragmentation patterns were further determined the precursor ion peak of m h at m z 306 indicates that the molecular weight of capsaicin was 305 fig 3 a besides three fragment ions at m z 137 170 and 182 were also found in fig 3a the fragment ion at m z 137 was reported to be vanillyl portion of capsaicin resulting from cleavage of c7 n8 while the product ions at m z 170 and 182 were respectively derived from fragmentation of alkyl chain at c7 n8 and c1 c7 reilly et al 2003 analogous to capsaicin m the molecular weight of m1 was 321 due to the precursor ion peak of m1 h at m z 322 fig 3b apart from the precursor ion peak there are other four fragment ions being observed in fig 3b the presence of fragment ion at m z 137 indicated that vanilloid ring of capsaicin was not modified shifts in the product ions at m z from 182 and 170 to 198 and 186 may be owing to addition of oxygen atom 16 amu to the alkyl chain the product ion at m z 181 was likely due to loss of hydroxyl group from fragment ion at m z 198 while the appearance of fragment ion at m z 304 was probably due to loss of terminal ch2o from m z 322 based on these analyses m1 m z 322 was inferred to alkyl hydroxylated metabolite of capsaicin with its molecular structure being detailed in fig 3b it was reported that the alkyl side chain of capsaicin was susceptible to enzymatic oxidation reilly and yost 2006 and m1 was also detected as a capsaicin metabolite by aspergillus oryzae lee et al 2015a four fragment ions were observed in the ms ms spectrum of m2 fig 3c the precursor ion peak at m z 292 m2 h indicated that the molecular weight of m2 was 291 the appearance of fragment ion at m z 123 was probably owing to a net loss of 14 amu from the vanilloid ring m z 137 through demethylation of methoxy group gonzalez gil et al 2019 demonstrated that tramadol and trimethoprim can transformed to o desmethyltramadol and 4 desmethyltrimethoprim by demethylation of methoxy groups in anaerobic digestion the existences of fragment ions at m z 170 and 182 however suggested that the alkyl chain was not modified therefore m2 was inferred to be an o demethylation metabolite of capsaicin which was previously detected in capsaicin degradation catalyzed by p450 enzyme as well reilly et al 2003 the precursor ion peak at m z 336 m3 h indicated the molecular weight of m3 being 335 fig 3d which was 30 amu larger than that of capsaicin it can be seen that the fragment ion at m z 170 still existed suggesting that the alkyl chain at c7 n8 was unchanged however the fragment ion at m z 137 disappeared which suggested that the vanilloid portion of capsaicin was modified two new fragment ions at m z 184 and 140 were detected the fragment ion at m z 184 was likely produced by cleavage of alkyl chain at n8 c9 of capsaicin while the fragment ion at m z 140 may be due to loss of ch2no from the fragment ion m z 184 thus m3 was probably a doubly oxidized metabolite of dehydrogenated capsaicin and this was also determined in capsaicin bioconversion by h armigera tian et al 2019 3 3 could methane be produced from capsaicin degradation the analyses above showed that in anaerobic co digestion capsaicin was first degraded into m1 m2 and m3 by hydroxylation o demethylation dehydrogenation and doubly oxidization respectively according to the literature these three metabolites would be further hydrolyzed into amino and carboxyl compounds by amidases with the possible degradation pathway of capsaicin being proposed in fig 4 cho et al 2014 wang et al 2018 yue et al 2020 however it remains unknown whether these metabolic hydrolysates could be used for methane production in anaerobic co digestion requiring to be further clarified to figure out this possibility one batch test was operated using either inocula or inocula capsaicin as the digestion substrate with the experimental details being shown in section 2 3 it was found that about 31 0 0 9 ml methane was produced from the sole inocula whereas the corresponding value was 44 3 1 3 ml from inocula 36 mg capsaicin g vs and 59 9 1 8 ml from inocula 68 mg capsaicin g vs fig s3 this indicates that capsaicin could be served as substrate for methane production in anaerobic digestion according to eq 3 it can be calculated that 0 59 g or 826 ml of methane will be produced from 1 g capsaicin if it is completely digested suggesting that 60 and 87 ml methane should be generated from inocula 36 mg capsaicin g vs and inocula 68 mg capsaicin g vs respectively however the measured data from the two inocula capsaicin digesters were much lower than the theoretical values the possible reasons might be due to 1 incomplete utilization of capsaicin degradation intermediates and 2 inhibition of capsaicin to the activity of inocula 3 c18h27no3 10 5 h2o 11 25 ch4 6 75 co2 nh3 3 4 effect of capsaicin on methane production the cumulative methane yield during anaerobic co digestion in the presence of capsaicin at different concentrations is shown in fig 5 it can be observed that methane yield in the reactor without extra capsaicin addition i e 2 0 7 mg g vs capsaicin reactor increased with the digestion time from 1 to 34 d and no signification increase was observed after that day 34 p 0 05 the optimum digestion time for this reactor was therefore 34 d with the maximum methane yield of 274 6 9 7 ml g of vs being measured from fig 5 it was also found the increase of capsaicin affected methane production obviously with an increase of capsaicin concentration from 2 0 7 to 68 4 1 mg g vs methane yield decreased from 274 6 9 7 to 188 9 8 4 ml g vs apart from methane yield the optimum digestion time was also affected by capsaicin for example 68 4 1 mg g vs of capsaicin increased the optimum digestion time to 58 d to further understand the effect of capsaicin on anaerobic digestion from the aspect of model the modified gompertz equation was employed to estimate three kinetic parameters i e maximum methane yield potential mm methane production rate rm and lag phase time λ it can be found that the gompertz equation described the experimental data well with r2 0 99 in all the scenarios fig 5 when capsaicin concentration increased from 2 0 7 to 68 4 1 mg g vs the determined mm and rm decreased respectively from 257 4 ml g vs and 17 8 ml g vs d to 189 9 ml g vs and 6 6 ml g vs d whereas the calculated λ increased from 6 7 to 14 7 d this indicates that the increase of capsaicin not only decreased biochemical methane potential but also inhibited the rate of methane production according to the analyses above it was demonstrated that the addition of capsaicin reduced rather than improved methane yield though the addition of capsaicin provided extra substrate for anaerobes to produce methane this suggests that anaerobic co digestion from original substrates was largely inhibited by capsaicin which was in accordance with the results reported previously yue et al 2020 based on the experimental data obtained in the current work it was estimated that 50 inhibitory concentration of capsaicin to anaerobic co digestion was around 36 26 mg capsaicin g vs fig s4 since anaerobic co digestion includes several processes such as solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis the mechanism of how capsaicin affects methane production were explored in the following text 3 5 mechanism of how capsaicin inhibits anaerobic co digestion it was found that the concentrations of soluble proteins and carbohydrates increased with capsaicin concentration fig 6 a and fig 6b for example the concentrations of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the reactor fed with 2 0 7 mg g vs capsaicin were respectively 882 7 23 2 and 2695 4 25 5 mg cod l while the corresponding concentrations in the reactor fed with 68 4 1 mg g vs capsaicin were 1505 8 29 1 and 5530 2 53 2 mg cod l respectively according to the literature an increase in the fluorescence intensity indicates an increase in soluble organics in digestion liquid fig 6c xu et al 2017 there are two peaks which are respectively located at ex em of 200 250 290 320 and 250 280 380 nm being found in all the samples fig 6c the fluorescence intensity of both the peaks increased with the addition of capsaicin suggesting that an increase of capsaicin enhanced increases in soluble organics all these facts confirmed that the presence of capsaicin improved rather than reduced solubilization indicating that capsaicin may inhibit the bio processes involved in anaerobic co digestion table 1 summarizes the experiment value and model simulation value of inhibition of capsaicin on dextran glucose acetate and h2 it can be seen that the specific degradation rates of dextran glucose acetate and hydrogen in the blank i e 0 mg l capsaicin were respectively 8 07 0 26 7 00 0 30 2 85 0 14 and 0 24 0 01 mg g vs h and these values were considered the original activities of microbes relevant to hydrolysis acidogenesis acetotrophic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis respectively when 50 mg l capsaicin was added these values decreased respectively to 6 19 0 62 3 30 0 66 1 12 0 03 and 0 17 0 02 mg g vs h this suggests 50 mg l capsaicin reduced the relative activities of microbes expressed as of the original relevant to hydrolysis acidogenesis acetotrophic methanogenesis and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis by 23 27 61 and 29 respectively similar observations were also made at 30 mg l capsaicin from table 1 it was also found that inhibition constant ks i of capsaicin to the degradation of these substrates was in the order of acetate h2 glucose dextran suggesting that the inhibition of capsaicin to these bioprocesses was in the sequence of acetotrophic methanogenesis hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis acidogenesis hydrolysis all the results showed that although capsaicin enhanced solubilization it significantly inhibited the bioprocesses of hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis especially acetotrophic methanogenesis it can be understood why capsaicin inhibited methane production from anaerobic co digestion it was reported that capsaicin could induce apoptosis by either altering key kinases pramanik and srivastava 2012 or decreasing the intracellular nad nadh ratio by binding to quinone binding site of nadh dehydrogenase 1 ndh 1 lee et al 2015b yagi 1990 furthermore torrecillas et al 2015 found capsaicin molecule could establish a molecular interaction with cell membrane where the nine carbon alkyl chain of capsaicin was aligned with the phospholipid acyl chains perturbing the cooperative behavior of the phospholipid and inducing apoptosis when capsaicin entered into the anaerobic co digestion systems it could contact with the membrane and key enzymes of anaerobes or even enter into the intracellular cells these behaviors may result in inactivation of functional enzymes reduction in conversion between nad and nadh or even cell lysis fig 7 a this deduction can be supported by flow cytometry which is usually used to reflect the cell functional state the physiological status of microorganism cells can be divided into four regions among them viable cells are shown in av pi q4 early apoptotic cells are shown in av pi q3 necrotic or late apoptotic cells are shown in av pi q2 and debris and damaged cells are shown in av pi q1 it can be seen that with an increase of capsaicin from 0 to 50 mg l the fluorescence percentage of viable cells decreased from 96 7 to 78 7 while the fluorescence percentage of early apoptotic cells increased from 0 9 to 16 0 fig 7b this is the major reason for capsaicin enhancing solubilization but reducing hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis according to the data shown in table 1 it can be found that the inhibition of capsaicin to acetotrophic methanogenesis one major pathway responsible for methane production was much severer than that to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis the other methane production pathway thus one might want to know why capsaicin caused different inhibitions to these two methane production pathways in acetotrophic methanogenesis acetate can be either converted into acetyl phosphate and acetyl coa catalyzed by ak and pta in turn or directly degraded to acetyl coa catalyzed by coa the generated acetyl coa is then converted into 5 methyl thmpt under the catalysis of acds in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis h2 and co2 can be converted into 5 methyl thmpt with mch and f420 being as the key enzymes fig 8 a as the same intermediate in the two pathways 5 methyl thmpt then undergoes the succession steps of 5 methyl thmpt methyl com ch4 it was found that although the presence of capsaicin inhibited the activity of all these enzymes in acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis its inhibition to coa and acds was much severer than that to others fig 8b this may explain why capsaicin caused severer inhibition to acetotrophic methanogenesis than hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis when acds catalyzes the step of acetyl coa to 5 methyl thmpt two electrons would be generated grahame and demoll 1996 in anaerobic digestion the generated electrons are generally transferred to ferredoxin by 4fe 4s clusters ligands on acds ferry 2011 previous publication demonstrated that capsaicin could be activated to an electrophilic intermediate and this intermediate could compete for the electrons available for ferredoxin utilization fig 8c surh and lee 1995 this causes reductions in the electrons transferred by 4fe 4s clusters ligands on acds which might be the reason for capsaicin severely inhibiting the activity of acds moreover it is reported that the amino group of capsaicin can be subjected to dehydration condensation reaction with carboxyl group of coa inhibiting the metabolic activity of coa yue et al 2020 3 6 effect of capsaicin on microbial community illumina miseq 16s rrna genes sequencing was performed to investigate the effect of capsaicin on microbial community by comparing the structure and abundance of microbial community between the control and experimental reactors the control reactor was fed with 2 mg g vs capsaicin co substrates while the experimental reactor was fed with 68 mg g vs capsaicin co substrates the number of operational taxonomic units was 1074 in the control reactor and 1050 in the experimental digester with 886 being shared fig s5 the alpha diversity results table s2 showed that pd index was similar in the two reactors while chao index in the control was greater than that in the experiment reactor suggesting that the increase of capsaicin reduced the microbial diversity but did not change largely the microbial structure at the phylum level the most predominant bacteria in the two reactors were firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria and actinobacteria fig s6 it is reported that several anaerobes in these phyla can degrade organic compounds e g proteins and carbohydrates wei et al 2019 and many bacteria affiliated to firmicutes and proteobacteria were volatile fatty acid producers wang et al 2017 euryarchaeota was the only archaeal phylum in the two reactors fig s6 which was known as methanogens and detected in several anaerobic digesters wei et al 2019 fig 9 displays the genus level distributions of bacteria and archaea abundances in the two reactors seven genera of bacteria which were responsible for hydrolysis and acidogenesis were detected in the two reactors for example the abundance of bacteroide which was reported to degrade carbohydrates and organic acids pang et al 2020 was measured to be 17 6 in the control but it was completely washed out in the experiment reactor the abundances of dysgonomonadacea petrimonas and macellibacteroides which were able to degrade various polysaccharides and proteins maspolim et al 2015 murakami et al 2018 xu et al 2019 reduced from 6 5 5 3 and 7 9 in the control to 3 2 2 4 and 1 2 in the experiment reactor respectively fig 9a further calculation showed that the total abundance of these genera was 42 6 in the control and 14 8 in the experiment reactor indicating that capsaicin reduced largely the number of anaerobes relevant to hydrolysis and acidogenesis it can be also seen from fig 9a that the abundance of escherichia shigella a resistant genus having ability to degrade aromatic organic pollutants cui et al 2017 vasiliadou et al 2018 increased from 1 0 in the control to 10 7 in the experiment reactor moreover the abundance of several other contaminant degradation microbes such as fonticella pirellulaceae enterococcus and herbinix cao et al 2018 fraj et al 2013 koeck et al 2016 tong et al 2017 increased with capsaicin addition as well the total abundance of potential complex organic degradation microbes increased from 20 7 in the control to 42 4 in the experiment reactor suggesting that these microbes might be capsaicin decomposers in such anaerobic co digestion systems fig 9b shows the distribution of archaea community in the two reactors the total sequences of methanogens decreased from 16313 in the control to 7592 in the experiment reactor suggested that the addition of capsaicin reduced the total archaea populations among them the abundance of methanobacterium decreased from 73 4 in the control to 64 7 in the experiment reactor however the abundances of methanobrevibacter and methanosphaera increased from 2 0 and 0 2 in the control to 9 1 and 2 2 respectively this suggest that the effect of capsaicin on different types of archaea is different and manipulation of co digesters to enrich methanobrevibacter and methanosphaera could effectively mitigate the inhibition of capsaicin to methane production the accurate reason for this different impact is unclear at the current stage more efforts are required in the future 5 conclusions this study evaluated the degradation of capsaicin in anaerobic co digestion of fw and was and explored the effect of capsaicin on methane production as well as the underlying mechanisms of capsaicin affecting methane yield the findings obtained not only advance the understanding of capsaicin involved digestion but also guide engineers to develop effective strategies in the future to manipulate anaerobic co digestion of fw and was the main conclusions are 1 capsaicin can be degraded by some microbe and used as substrate to produce methane hplc ms ms analysis that hydroxylation o demethylation dehydrogenation and doubly oxidization are involved in capsaicin degradation 2 the presence of capsaicin not only slowed the process of anaerobic co digestion but also decreased methane yield with the increase of capsaicin from 2 0 7 to 68 4 mg g vs the maximal methane yield decreased from 274 6 9 7 to 188 9 8 4 ml g vs while the methane production rate decreased from 17 76 to 6 63 ml g vs d 3 mechanism investigations revealed that the presence of capsaicin induced apoptosis which led to significant inhibitions to hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis especially acetotrophic methanogenesis 4 the presence of capsaicin enhanced the populations of complex organic degradation microbes such as escherichia shigella and fonticella but decreased the numbers of anaerobes relevant to hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis such as bacteroide and methanobacterium appendix a supplementary data this file contains text s1 s3 table s1 s2 and fig s1 s6

17441,the denitrification desulfurization system can be used to remediate wastewater containing carbon nitrogen and sulfur however the relationship between autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria remains poorly understood to better understand the roles and relations of core bacteria an expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor was continuously operated under autotrophic stage i heterotrophic stage ii and mixotrophic stages iii vii conditions with a 490 day period stage iv represented the excellent s0 recovery rate 69 5 the different trophic conditions caused the obvious succession of dominant bacterial genera autotrophic environment stage i enriched mostly thiobacillus and heterotrophic environment stage ii was dominated with azoarcus and pseudomonas thauera arcobacter and azoarcus became the predominant genera under mixotrophic conditions stage iii vii strains belonged to these core genera were further isolated and all seven isolates were confirmed with denitrifying sulfur oxidation capacity heterotrophic strain hdd1 genus of thauera possessed both the highest sulfide degradation and s0 recovery rates expression levels of cbbm and glta genes were positively related with the autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions respectively nirk gene was highly expressed between log 3 7 log 4 3 during the entire run expression of both sqr and soxb genes were closely related with sulfur conversion more than 57 5 of s0 recovery rate could be obtained as sqr gene expression was greater than log 3 2 and while sulfate was the primary form as soxb gene expression higher than log 3 9 the correlation between core microbial genera was very low from network indicating a complex and non specific mutualistic network between bacterial functional groups under each nutrient condition and a stable coexistence state was possibly formed through utilizing each the secondary or waste metabolites in the mixotrophic conditions this relationship was beneficial to the stability of the microbial community structure in the denitrification desulfurization system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords correlation network denitrification desulfurization system functional gene isolation of functional bacteria microbial community structure 1 introduction sulfide and nitrogen containing contaminants are the primary toxic pollutants in municipal and industrial wastewater show et al 2013 wang et al 2019 the microbial denitrification desulfurization process could efficiently treat organic wastewater containing sulfide and nitrogen and meanwhile recover elemental sulfur by sulfide oxidation wang et al 2005 many technologies have been applied in wastewater treatment engineering base on the theory of denitrification desulfurization such as the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated process sani wang et al 2009 and the anoxic sulfide oxidizing process cai et al 2008 meanwhile many types of bioreactors have been developed and their parameters have been optimized based on the theory of denitrification desulfurization for example bioelectrochemical systems blázquez et al 2017 membrane bioreactors sahinkaya et al 2011 huang et al 2018 continuous stirred tank reactors huang et al 2015 expanded granular sludge beds egsb huang et al 2017 anaerobic baffled reactors huang et al 2015 upflow anaerobic sludge blankets huang et al 2016 huang et al 2017 sulfidogenic reactors zhang et al 2018 and etc furthermore some mathematical models surrounding denitrification desulfurization systems were built to analyse the kinetics of bacterial bioreaction liu et al 2016 xu et al 2013 klok et al 2013 since the bio denitrification could be occurred with either organics heterotrophic condition or sulfide as electron donors autotrophic condition and for most wastewater the coexistence of organic matter and sulfur mixotrophic condition is widely existed therefore fundamental understanding of the roles of and relationships between the functional bacteria in the denitrification desulfurization system is the key to mastering the efficient operation recently the high throughput sequencing has been widely applied to better understand the bacterial community structure and reveal the bioprocesses occurring in denitrification desulfurization system thauera was reported as the most abundant with a sulfide vs nitrate molar ratio of 5 6 and s conversion ratio of 84 4 huang et al 2015 azoarcus were regarded as the primary denitrification bacteria in the reactor for the simultaneous removal of sulfate and nitrate xu et al 2014 thiobacillus accounted for 45 3 of the total bacterial community in an autotrophic denitrifying sulfide removal process and pseudomonas were the most predominant under heterotrophic conditions with sulfide concentrations as high as 400 mg l zhang et al 2018 however the high throughput sequencing analysis is suitable to reveal the composition and succession of microorganism and while could not obtain accurate functional information of the bacterial genera therefore it is difficult to understand the functions and roles of the core bacteria by solely 16s rrna high throughput sequencing isolation and assessment of core microorganisms are preliminary strategies for understanding bacterial ecosystems markowitz et al 2015 lagier et al 2016 banerjee et al 2018 therefore if we can combine the isolation and identification of core bacteria it will help us to better understand the roles functions and relationships of key bacteria in the complex biological ecosystems thus in this study an egsb reactor was continuously operated under autotrophic stage i heterotrophic stage ii and mixotrophic stages iii vii conditions with a 490 day period the optimal denitrification desulfurization performance and succession of core bacterial genera were identified and seven strains belonged to the core genera were isolated and characterized the expression levels of functional genes related with carbon nitrogen and sulfur metabolic activities were analysed the interaction network among the core genera were constructed to describe the bacterial ecosystem this study provides a theoretical basis for the future construction of a highly efficient bacterial community in the denitrification desulfurization system 2 materials and method 2 1 system setup and operation conditions a plexiglas egsb reactor with a biomass retention device and a working volume of 4 l diameter 8 cm working height 80 cm was used to create the denitrification desulfurization

wastewater have been described previously huang et al 2017 naoh hcl 1 mol l was employed to maintain an influent ph of 8 0 0 3 seven operating conditions with different influent concentrations of sulfide nitrate acetate organic carbon and bicarbonate inorganic carbon were applied in this study table 1 to analyse the ecosystem functions and roles of core and non core bacteria under autotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions in the denitrification desulfurization system three nutritional conditions over seven stages were set up the first nutrient condition was autotrophic no organic carbon source was added for 42 days stage i during which the influent contained 52 1 mg l of inorganic carbon c 81 9 mg l of nitrate n and 204 3 mg l of sulfide the second nutrient condition was heterotrophic no inorganic carbon source was added for approximately 70 days stage ii the influent contained 52 9 mg l of acetate c organic carbon source 82 4 mg l of nitrate n and 202 8 mg l of sulfide the third nutritional condition was mixotrophic conditions with the addition of sodium acetate and bicarbonate as carbon sources and could be subdivided into five operational stages the influent contained 52 7 mg l of acetate c 52 5 mg l of inorganic carbon c 82 5 mg l of nitrate n and 205 2 mg l of sulfide during stage iii day 113 to day 196 the concentrations of nitrate and sulfide in stage iv were doubled those of stage iii to investigate the tolerance of pollutants by the denitrification desulfurization system and the restoration of ecosystems the influent contained 107 8 mg l of acetate c 105 9 mg l of inorganic carbon c 156 7 mg l of nitrate n and 402 3 mg l of sulfide to investigate the variation of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria in the denitrification desulfurization system and to evaluate the optimal parameters for denitrification desulfurization the ratio of inorganic to organic carbon in the influent was altered several times during stages v vii by changing the amount of bicarbonate inorganic carbon c in stages v vi and vii were 211 7 52 2 and 105 3 mg l respectively while keeping the remaining nutrient concentrations unchanged the molar ratio of acetate carbon inorganic carbon c to nitrate n was controlled at 1 2 and the molar ratio of sulfide s to nitrate n was controlled at 5 6 during all stages 2 2 analytical methods daily

conditions are shown in table 3 activated sludge was taken from the reactor to enrich and isolate the target core genera the enrichment process employed liquid stepwise dilution and a solid medium where the latter was prepared using the hungate barrel method miller and wolin 1974 50 ml of sludge was diluted to 250 ml with sterile deionized water twenty five glass beads were placed in the erlenmeyer flask and placed on a shaker at 220 r min for 24 h to prepare a sludge suspension 1 ml of the sludge suspension was pipetted and dilute to 10 4 with sterile water the cells were inoculated in a solid medium and cultured in an incubator at 30 1 c for 5 days until single colonies appeared on the medium colonies were picked transferred to a liquid isolation medium table 3 and cultured in a

conditions were altered to identify the core and non core functional bacteria in the denitrification desulfurization system the operation consisted of seven stages divided into three conditions autotrophic stage i heterotrophic stage ii and mixotrophic stages iii vii the performance of the egsb bioreactor including the concentrations of acetate organic carbon bicarbonate inorganic carbon nitrate sulfide sulfate and thiosulfate in the influent and effluent and the generation of sulfate and s0 are shown in fig 1 in stage i day 0 to day 42 bicarbonate was added as the sole carbon source with no addition of organic carbon acetate autotrophic condition the inorganic carbon removal zones were maintained at 89 9 94 7 nitrate was completely removed throughout the operation and no nitrite was detected in the effluent the concentrations of sulfide s thiosulfate s sulfate s and s0 in the effluent were 0 13 2 20 1 152 3 162 6 and 10 6 19 2 mg l respectively during stage ii heterotrophic condition acetate 180 9 mg l as an organic carbon source was fed into the influent and while no inorganic carbon was not added no acetate nitrate and nitrite were detected in the effluent indicting the complete removal capacity as similar as that in stage i sulfide was completely removed and no thiosulfate was detected in the effluent the concentration of s0 in the effluent was similar to that in the autotrophic condition 16 8 19 4 mg l and sulfate s in the effluent approached 174 7 190 5 mg l during mixotrophic conditions stages iii vii acetate and bicarbonate were simultaneously added as carbon sources but with varied concentrations under all mixotrophic conditions acetate nitrate and sulfide were completely removed when acetate was 52 7 mg l in the influent of stage iii the sulfate s in the effluent decreased from 174 7 190 5 mg l to 5 06 12 4 mg l and while s0 increased from 16 8 19 4 mg l to 107 5 126 5 mg l meanwhile only trace amounts of thiosulfate s 0 20 0 69 mg l were detected demonstrating that the addition of inorganic carbon was beneficial in controlling sulfur oxidation by increasing the generation of s0 and reducing the formation of sulfate it is noticed up to 63 8 mg l of nitrite was detected in the effluent at the beginning of stage iv for approximately 30 days day 190 to day 231 after which it became undetectable compared with stage iii the generation of sulfate and the removal of inorganic carbon in stage iv decreased from 10 0 2 8 and from 91 3 51 2 respectively and the generation of s0 increased from 57 5 69 5 when the concentration of inorganic carbon increased from 105 9 211 7 7 mg l in stage v day 267 to day 350 s0 generation decreased from 69 5 20 5 and sulfate generation increased from 2 8 60 2 in stage vi day 351 to day 406 the concentration of inorganic carbon decreased to 52 2 mg l and the removal rate of inorganic carbon was 100 additionally the generation of sulfate and s0 were 50 4 and 39 7 respectively during stage vii day 407 to day 490 the concentration of inorganic carbon was increased to 105 3 mg l the removal of inorganic carbon decreased from 91 1 44 0 and the generation of sulfate and s0 were 9 8 and 60 8 respectively 3 2 the bacterial community and core bacterial genera in denitrification desulfurization system we performed a detailed analysis of bacterial community in seven stages of the bioreactor by using the 16s rrna high throughput sequencing all sequences were clustered into 387 unique genera across the complete data set the relative abundance of all genera present at a minimum of 1 in any single sample is shown in fig 2 thiobacillus 27 4 73 8 and arcobacter 0 5 2 3 were mostly enriched in stage i and while the relative abundance of ochrobactrum decreased from 56 1 to 1 6 by the end of stage i when the carbon source was changed from inorganic to organic stage ii the dominant genera in the reactor changed drastically during the period from day 42 to day 56 thiobacillus rapidly decreased from 73 8 to 1 0 and azoarcus and pseudomonas replaced thiobacillus as the dominant genera increasing from 1 1 to 30 2 and 1 2 to 60 7 respectively as the nutrient conditions became mixotrophic stage iii vii thauera gradually became the dominant species accounting for up to 55 4 the relative abundance of pseudomonas decreased from 60 7 40 2 to 2 0 0 5 the other dominant species in stage iii were azoarcus 4 9 34 9 arcobacter 4 9 34 9 and ochrobactrum 1 0 18 7 when the concentration of sulfide in the influent was doubled stage iv arcobacter gradually became the dominant species increasing from 4 9 34 9 in stage iii to 54 0 61 8 in stage iv in the early phase of stage iv the relative abundance of pseudomonas increased significantly to 28 6 day 210 and then gradually decreased to 1 0 day 224 additionally the relative abundance of thiobacillus grew slowly with an initial abundance of 1 0 in stage iv and a final abundance of 10 9 other comparatively dominant species in stage iv were azoarcus 2 6 8 6 thauera 5 4 14 1 ochrobactrum 1 1 8 0 alkaliflexus 1 0 4 0 and anaerolineaceae uncultured 1 1 5 9 when the influent concentration of inorganic carbon was increased to 211 7 mg l during stage v azoarcus 20 4 39 6 arcobacter 16 0 31 9 and thiobacillus 16 0 31 3 became the dominant species when the influent concentration of inorganic carbon was subsequently reduced to 52 2 mg l during stage vi thauera 29 3 37 9 azoarcus 8 4 17 7 and arcobacter 30 7 34 5 replaced thiobacillus as the dominant species when the concentration of inorganic carbon was increased to 105 3 mg l during stage vii arcobacter 34 5 47 1 became a comparatively dominant species compared to the other core species azoarcus was 5 6 19 2 pseudomonas was 1 0 1 3 thauera was 8 0 11 7 thiobacillus was 6 2 11 7 ochrobactrum was 1 0 1 2 alkaliflexus was 1 8 4 9 and anaerolineaceae uncultured was 1 7 3 8 the genera thauera arcobacter pseudomonas azoarcus ochrobactrum alkaliflexus thiobacillus and anaerolineaceae uncultured were ubiquitous and abundant under autotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions with a total abundance of 82 0 99 5 these eight genera were considered as the core bacterial genera in the denitrification desulfurization system in contrast the abundance of the non core genera was in the range 0 0 11 2 fig 2 3 3 pca and cca diagram analysis and bacterial diversity fig 3 shows the differences between bacterial community structures under different nutrient conditions to reduce statistical deviation all the sequencing samples were subsampled at the genus level and the subsample results were used for pca analysis fig 3a the samples under autotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions showed the clear differentiation cca diagram fig 3b was applied to assess the correlation between the bacterial genera and reactor conditions of s0 generation no3 removal acetate removal inorganic carbon removal and so4 2 generation anoxynatronum pseudomonas and desulfurivibro correlated with sulfate generation arcobacter thauera thermovirga sulfurovum paracoccus and aminivibrio correlated with s0 generation desulfofustis correlated with inorganic carbon removal and melloribacter desulfuromonas and chlorobiaceae norank correlated with acetate removal thauera showed the closest correlation to nitrate removal fig 3c shows the bacterial diversity of all samples the lowest bacterial diversity was observed under autotrophic conditions stage i confirming by a shannon index within 1 08 1 29 and a simpson index within 0 18 0 26 compared with stage iii mixotrophic stage ii heterotrophic showed little change on the shannon index however the simpson index fluctuated significantly the trend of both α diversity indices tended to be stable and the chao1 index commonly used in ecology to estimate the total number of species showed a similar trend indicating that the diversity and community structure of the mixotrophic conditions were more stable than the autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions 3 4 activities of functional genes under different trophic conditions we used quantitative reverse transcription pcr to investigate the functional gene activities of carbon nitrogen and sulfur metabolic pathways in denitrification desulfurization systems under the different trophic conditions fig 4 the glta gene which encodes citrate synthase in the tricarboxylic acid cycle was used to indicate the activity of heterotrophic metabolism in denitrification desulfurization systems under autotrophic conditions stage i the copy numbers of glta ranged from log 1 9 to log 2 1 the copy number of glta gradually increased with the addition of acetate stages ii vii to log 4 1 log 4 7 during stages ii and iii as the concentration of acetate was doubled the copy number of glta gene increased to log 6 1 log 6 6 indicating an increase in heterotrophic metabolic activity during the entire experimental run the copy number of the cbbm gene was between log 1 4 and log 5 9 varying with the concentration of inorganic carbon in the influent during stage ii without inorganic carbon addition the copy number of the cbbm gene decreased from log 3 8 log 4 1 in stage i to log 1 4 log 1 7 as the concentration of inorganic carbon increased in stage iii the copy number of cbbm gene increased to log 3 4 log 3 8 when the concentration of inorganic carbon in influent was increased to 31 7 mg l the copy number of cbbm gene approached its highest level log 5 5 5 9 as the influent concentration of inorganic carbon was reduced to 8 2 mg l in stage vi the copy number of cbbm gene decreased to log 2 3 log 2 8 when the influent concentration of inorganic carbon returned back to 16 4 mg l the copy number of cbbm increased to log 3 5 log 3 8 expression levels of cbbm gene was closely related with addition of inorganic carbon representing the metabolic activity of autotrophic bacteria the copy number of the nirk gene was primarily within log 3 7 log 4 3 during the entire run only during stage iv when the concentration of influent pollutants sulfide doubled did the copy number of the nirk gene decrease to log 1 1 before gradually recovering to log 4 0 the increase in concentration of sulfide reduced the metabolic activity of denitrification the expressed copy number of the sqr gene was the highest during stages iii iv and vii reaching between log 3 2 and log 4 6 in the remaining stages the copy number was maintained within log 1 3 log 2 9 there was no significant change during stages i and ii log 1 3 log 1 8 stage v showed a slight increase compared with stages i ii and vi reaching log 1 6 log 2 1 the copy number of the soxb gene was within log 3 9 log 4 7 during stages i and ii decreased to log 2 3 log 2 8 in stage iii and reached the lowest level log 0 3 0 7 during stage iv the soxb gene copy number increased to log 4 0 4 8 in stages v and vi and decreased to log 1 2 1 8 in stage vii the changes in the sqr gene and soxb gene copy numbers were closely related to the forms of sulfur in the effluent when the copy number of sqr gene was greater than log 3 2 the elemental sulfur production rate was higher than 57 5 when the copy number of soxb was greater than log 3 9 sulfate 6 was the primary form of sulfur in the effluent 3 5 characteristics of core bacteria from the denitrification desulfurization system strains belonged to the core genera were further isolated and characterised six isolated strains hdd1 hdd6 could utilise carbohydrate and sulfide as electron donors for nitrate reduction however they neither grew nor performed denitrification without organic carbon table 4 strain add1 was an autotrophic denitrifier that could not utilise acetate or lactate as a carbon source table 4 the sulfide degradation rates of these facultative autotrophic strains in sulfide medium were as follows hdd1 hdd2 hdd3 hdd6 hdd4 hdd5 add1 fig 5a the corresponding growth rates of the strains in the sulfide medium were hdd1 hdd3 hdd2 hdd4 hdd5 hdd6 add1 fig 5b the yield of elemental sulfur per od600nm per hour was counted fig 5c hdd1 had the highest yield of elemental sulfur for every od600nm per hour of all the isolates 12 5 mg od600nm h between the 3rd and 5th hour in contrast add1 had the lowest elemental sulfur for per od600nm per hour ranging from 0 08 0 68 mg od600nm h all heterotrophic strains could remove 103 6 109 7 mg l of nitrate n 90 4 100 by oxidising most of the fed 203 9 210 0mg l of sulfide 98 2 into elementary sulfur or sulfate acetate was simultaneously consumed at high efficiencies 91 3 table 5 add1 removed 76 8 of nitrate and 75 2 of sulfide within 60 h table 5 3 6 ecological network analysis of denitrification and desulfurization systems high throughput sequencing and pure culture experiments furthered our understanding of the microbial community structure and function within the denitrification desulfurization system but do not explain the relationship among functional bacteria thus a correlation network was built to analyse the relationship between these organisms the bacterial network provides a snapshot of the time and space of an ecosystem in two parts nodes and edges a node usually represents an organism and an edge represents a statistically significant association between nodes organisms the number of edges connected to a node is the degree of the node the relative abundances of the dominant genera in all samples were collected and subjected to pearson correlation analysis fig 6a and the evolutionary relationships of the dominant genera were analysed fig 6b arcobacter azoarcus thauera thiobacillus and pseudomonas had the highest relative abundance throughout the operational period of the reactor which confirms that they were the core genera of the denitrification desulfurization system among the correlation networks correlation value r 0 6 thauera had the highest correlation with aminivibro anaerolineaceae uncultured paracoccus sulfurovum and halthiobacillaceae norank the phylogenetic tree analysis results revealed that thauera and azoarcus have a close evolutionary relationship 4 discussion because of the presence of nitrogen and sulfur compounds with different valences in the denitrification desulfurization system the relationship between bacteria is complex through the sequential study of this system several ecological phenomena such as functional redundancy highly simplified functional flora and sporadic expansion of organismal groups were observed when organic and inorganic carbon were simultaneously available bacteria used multiple carbon sources decreasing diversity and bacterial community composition fluctuations which was conducive to the stability of the microbial community structure functional redundancy was detected in the denitrification desulfurization system thus the richness of bacterial diversity increased temporal stability for example when the culture condition was changed to mixotrophic conditions condition iii the abundance of azoarcus gradually declined from 34 9 at day 126 to 4 9 at day 168 before slowly increasing again from 4 9 on day 168 to 17 7 on day 196 over the course of the reactor run the proportion of dominant organisms increased and the abundance of other functional bacteria shrank for example the relative abundance of thiobacillus in condition i reached 73 8 at day 42 whereas ochrobactrum accounted for only 1 6 in this initial stage the relative abundances of the remaining bacteria were lower however the abundance of ochrobactrum rose to approximately 18 7 during stage iii day 154 to day 168 functional overlap and therefore high functional redundancy of bacteria in denitrification desulfurization was considerable even during the transition processes between different nutrient conditions corresponding to the functional redundancy phenomenon the bacterial community structure in the system was highly simplified that is a few core organisms performed the primary system functions under each operating condition e g thiobacillus under autotrophic conditions azoarcus and pseudomonas under heterotrophic conditions and azoarcus thauera arcobacter and thiobacillus under mixotrophic conditions moreover the majority of bacteria maintained a stable relative abundance over the course of the experiment but often exhibited episodes of expansion or contraction for example azoarcus in stage iii achieved a relative abundance of 34 9 day 126 at the beginning of this stage falling to a relative abundance of 5 2 4 9 between day 154 and 168 and then increasing to 17 7 on day 196 the relative abundance of ochrobactrum in the middle of stage iii increased rapidly to 18 7 whereas the relative abundance at the beginning and end of this stage was only 1 0 3 7 the undulation of a phenomenon over a longer period is driven by direct positive and negative effects of microorganisms and environmental stress factors because of the aforementioned ecological phenomena in the denitrification desulfurization system bacteria had to be isolated to verify if thauera arcobacter azoarcus ochrobactrum and the other dominant bacterial genera possessed the hypothesised denitrification and desulfurization functions two of the isolated hdd strains pseudomonas sp hdd4 and azoarcus sp hdd3 were extremely similar to those reported previously pseudomonas stutzeri and azoarcus taiwanensis nsc3 both of which have demonstrated the sulfide oxidising ability under denitrifying conditions lee et al 2014 although the genera thauera arcobacter and ochrobactrum were previously known as functional bacteria in denitrification desulfurization systems huang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the previously isolated thauera sp hdd1 arcobacter sp hdd2 ochrobactrum sp hdd5 and alkaliflexus sp hdd6 had never been reported as present in wastewater treatment plants moreover this is the first report confirming the ability of thauera arcobacter and alkaliflexus to oxidise sulfide furthermore although members of azoarcus are well known nitrogen fixing bacteria their heterotrophic denitrification desulfurization function had not been previously recognised physiological characterisation of our isolate found it to be efficient at desulfurization second only to thauera sp mz1t hdd1 with maximum removal efficiency per hour reaching 1 7 mg od600nm these representatives of the seven isolates all secrete elemental sulfur confirming that elemental sulfur is an intermediate product from the process of sulfide oxidation to sulfate mora et al 2016 the batch culture time series data confirmed a lag period 10 h for the add strain during desulfurization however no delay was observed in any of the hdd strains suggesting that the latter favoured desulfurization in the denitrification desulfurization system the hdd1 hdd2 and hdd3 strains are most effective facultative heterotrophic desulfurization denitrifiers identified in this study the success of the selective culturing method presented in this report is efficient and easily implemented and may lessen the amount of work required to isolate low abundance functional bacterial strains table 6 the correlation between core microbial genera under each condition was very low from correlation network analysis verifying that the core bacteria were different under autotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions and indicating that there was a complex and non specific mutualistic network between bacterial functional groups under each nutrient condition a stable coexistence state was formed through synergy by utilising each the secondary or waste metabolites in the denitrification desulfurization system therefore we propose an interaction model between autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria in the denitrification desulfurization system fig 7 autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria perform denitrification and sulfur oxidation metabolism fig 5 tables 4 and 5 when organic carbon and inorganic carbon coexist microorganisms utilise increasingly varied types of carbon sources reducing fluctuations in diversity and species composition which benefits the stability of the microbial community structure the final ecological strategy of functional bacteria in denitrification desulfurization is a symbiotic relationship heterotrophic bacteria decompose organic matter into co2 which in turn supplies autotrophic bacteria that perform critical functions for denitrification desulfurization systems by providing fixed carbon autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria can oxidise h2s to elemental sulfur s0 which they deposit as either intracellular or extracellular granules for later use as an electron donor a variety of inorganic compounds can be used as electron donors e g sulfide ammonium and hydrogen and electron acceptors e g oxygen elemental sulfur and nitrate the energy yield depends on the thermodynamics of the redox couple and on the biochemistry of the pathways utilised mixotrophic organisms can simultaneously use several metabolic strategies e g incorporating organic carbon into cellular material using light and or inorganic chemical energy sources or can switch between different strategies therefore mixotrophic bacteria using such pathways have a competitive advantage over obligate autotrophs or heterotrophs 5 conclusion over the course of this experiment the nutrient conditions of the reactor operation were periodically altered switching from autotrophic to heterotrophic to mixotrophic conditions with different concentrations of inorganic carbon and pollutant sulfide in the influent under mixotrophic conditions high throughput sequencing qrt pcr targeted screening for specific functional bacterial taxonomic groups and characterisation to identify functional microbial roles and interactions in denitrification desulfurization systems was utilised we found that the genera thauera arcobacter pseudomonas azoarcus ochrobactrum alkaliflexus thiobacillus and anaerolineaceae uncultured formed the core bacteria of the denitrification desulfurization system these eight core bacterial genera except for anaerolineaceae uncultured oxidise sulfide to elemental sulfur through denitrification additionally the final oxidised form s of sulfide elemental sulfur or sulfate depends on the ratio of autotrophic bacteria to heterotrophic bacteria in the system this study will help improve the efficiency of system processing through microbial community regulation or bioaugmentation declaration of competing

17441,the denitrification desulfurization system can be used to remediate wastewater containing carbon nitrogen and sulfur however the relationship between autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria remains poorly understood to better understand the roles and relations of core bacteria an expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor was continuously operated under autotrophic stage i heterotrophic stage ii and mixotrophic stages iii vii conditions with a 490 day period stage iv represented the excellent s0 recovery rate 69 5 the different trophic conditions caused the obvious succession of dominant bacterial genera autotrophic environment stage i enriched mostly thiobacillus and heterotrophic environment stage ii was dominated with azoarcus and pseudomonas thauera arcobacter and azoarcus became the predominant genera under mixotrophic conditions stage iii vii strains belonged to these core genera were further isolated and all seven isolates were confirmed with denitrifying sulfur oxidation capacity heterotrophic strain hdd1 genus of thauera possessed both the highest sulfide degradation and s0 recovery rates expression levels of cbbm and glta genes were positively related with the autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions respectively nirk gene was highly expressed between log 3 7 log 4 3 during the entire run expression of both sqr and soxb genes were closely related with sulfur conversion more than 57 5 of s0 recovery rate could be obtained as sqr gene expression was greater than log 3 2 and while sulfate was the primary form as soxb gene expression higher than log 3 9 the correlation between core microbial genera was very low from network indicating a complex and non specific mutualistic network between bacterial functional groups under each nutrient condition and a stable coexistence state was possibly formed through utilizing each the secondary or waste metabolites in the mixotrophic conditions this relationship was beneficial to the stability of the microbial community structure in the denitrification desulfurization system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords correlation network denitrification desulfurization system functional gene isolation of functional bacteria microbial community structure 1 introduction sulfide and nitrogen containing contaminants are the primary toxic pollutants in municipal and industrial wastewater show et al 2013 wang et al 2019 the microbial denitrification desulfurization process could efficiently treat organic wastewater containing sulfide and nitrogen and meanwhile recover elemental sulfur by sulfide oxidation wang et al 2005 many technologies have been applied in wastewater treatment engineering base on the theory of denitrification desulfurization such as the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated process sani wang et al 2009 and the anoxic sulfide oxidizing process cai et al 2008 meanwhile many types of bioreactors have been developed and their parameters have been optimized based on the theory of denitrification desulfurization for example bioelectrochemical systems blázquez et al 2017 membrane bioreactors sahinkaya et al 2011 huang et al 2018 continuous stirred tank reactors huang et al 2015 expanded granular sludge beds egsb huang et al 2017 anaerobic baffled reactors huang et al 2015 upflow anaerobic sludge blankets huang et al 2016 huang et al 2017 sulfidogenic reactors zhang et al 2018 and etc furthermore some mathematical models surrounding denitrification desulfurization systems were built to analyse the kinetics of bacterial bioreaction liu et al 2016 xu et al 2013 klok et al 2013 since the bio denitrification could be occurred with either organics heterotrophic condition or sulfide as electron donors autotrophic condition and for most wastewater the coexistence of organic matter and sulfur mixotrophic condition is widely existed therefore fundamental understanding of the roles of and relationships between the functional bacteria in the denitrification desulfurization system is the key to mastering the efficient operation recently the high throughput sequencing has been widely applied to better understand the bacterial community structure and reveal the bioprocesses occurring in denitrification desulfurization system thauera was reported as the most abundant with a sulfide vs nitrate molar ratio of 5 6 and s conversion ratio of 84 4 huang et al 2015 azoarcus were regarded as the primary denitrification bacteria in the reactor for the simultaneous removal of sulfate and nitrate xu et al 2014 thiobacillus accounted for 45 3 of the total bacterial community in an autotrophic denitrifying sulfide removal process and pseudomonas were the most predominant under heterotrophic conditions with sulfide concentrations as high as 400 mg l zhang et al 2018 however the high throughput sequencing analysis is suitable to reveal the composition and succession of microorganism and while could not obtain accurate functional information of the bacterial genera therefore it is difficult to understand the functions and roles of the core bacteria by solely 16s rrna high throughput sequencing isolation and assessment of core microorganisms are preliminary strategies for understanding bacterial ecosystems markowitz et al 2015 lagier et al 2016 banerjee et al 2018 therefore if we can combine the isolation and identification of core bacteria it will help us to better understand the roles functions and relationships of key bacteria in the complex biological ecosystems thus in this study an egsb reactor was continuously operated under autotrophic stage i heterotrophic stage ii and mixotrophic stages iii vii conditions with a 490 day period the optimal denitrification desulfurization performance and succession of core bacterial genera were identified and seven strains belonged to the core genera were isolated and characterized the expression levels of functional genes related with carbon nitrogen and sulfur metabolic activities were analysed the interaction network among the core genera were constructed to describe the bacterial ecosystem this study provides a theoretical basis for the future construction of a highly efficient bacterial community in the denitrification desulfurization system 2 materials and method 2 1 system setup and

of acetate c 105 9 mg l of inorganic carbon c 156 7 mg l of nitrate n and 402 3 mg l of sulfide to investigate the variation of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria in the denitrification desulfurization system and to evaluate the optimal parameters for denitrification desulfurization the ratio of inorganic to organic carbon in the influent was altered several times during stages v vii by changing the amount of bicarbonate inorganic carbon c in stages v vi and vii were 211 7 52 2 and 105 3 mg l respectively while keeping the remaining nutrient concentrations unchanged the molar ratio of acetate carbon inorganic carbon c to nitrate n was controlled at 1 2 and the molar ratio of sulfide s to nitrate n was controlled at 5 6 during all stages 2 2 analytical methods daily

cultivation conditions and medium components of the core genera we utilized the web of komodo oberhardt et al 2015 http komodo modelseed org the input parameter of predict medium set as is organism aerobic select as no does organism grow in saltly media selects as no maximal phylogenetic distance selects as 0 04 blast identities low limit select as 85 0 the predicted or verified cultivation

conditions were altered to identify the core and non core functional bacteria in the denitrification desulfurization system the operation consisted of seven stages divided into three conditions autotrophic stage i heterotrophic stage ii and mixotrophic stages iii vii the performance of the egsb bioreactor including the concentrations of acetate organic carbon bicarbonate inorganic carbon nitrate sulfide sulfate and thiosulfate in the influent and effluent and the generation of sulfate and s0 are shown in fig 1 in stage i day 0 to day 42 bicarbonate was added as the sole carbon source with no addition of organic carbon acetate autotrophic condition the inorganic carbon removal zones were maintained at 89 9 94 7 nitrate was completely removed throughout the operation and no nitrite was detected in the effluent the concentrations of sulfide s thiosulfate s sulfate s and s0 in the effluent were 0 13 2 20 1 152 3 162 6 and 10 6 19 2 mg l respectively during stage ii heterotrophic condition acetate 180 9 mg l as an organic carbon source was fed into the influent and while no inorganic carbon was not added no acetate nitrate and nitrite were detected in the effluent indicting the complete removal capacity as similar as that in stage i sulfide was completely removed and no thiosulfate was detected in the effluent the concentration of s0 in the effluent was similar to that in the autotrophic condition 16 8 19 4 mg l and sulfate s in the effluent approached 174 7 190 5 mg l during mixotrophic conditions stages iii vii acetate and bicarbonate were simultaneously added as carbon sources but with varied concentrations under all mixotrophic conditions acetate nitrate and sulfide were completely removed when acetate was 52 7 mg l in the influent of stage iii the sulfate s in the effluent decreased from 174 7 190 5 mg l to 5 06 12 4 mg l and while s0 increased from 16 8 19 4 mg l to 107 5 126 5 mg l meanwhile only trace amounts of thiosulfate s 0 20 0 69 mg l were detected demonstrating that the addition of inorganic carbon was beneficial in controlling sulfur oxidation by increasing the generation of s0 and reducing the formation of sulfate it is noticed up to 63 8 mg l of nitrite was detected in the effluent at the beginning of stage iv for approximately 30 days day 190 to day 231 after which it became undetectable compared with stage iii the generation of sulfate and the removal of inorganic carbon in stage iv decreased from 10 0 2 8 and from 91 3 51 2 respectively and the generation of s0 increased from 57 5 69 5 when the concentration of inorganic carbon increased from 105 9 211 7 7 mg l in stage v day 267 to day 350 s0 generation decreased from 69 5 20 5 and sulfate generation increased from 2 8 60 2 in stage vi day 351 to day 406 the concentration of inorganic carbon decreased to 52 2 mg l and the removal rate of inorganic carbon was 100 additionally the generation of sulfate and s0 were 50 4 and 39 7 respectively during stage vii day 407 to day 490 the concentration of inorganic carbon was increased to 105 3 mg l the removal of inorganic carbon decreased from 91 1 44 0 and the generation of sulfate and s0 were 9 8 and 60 8 respectively 3 2 the bacterial community and core bacterial genera in denitrification desulfurization system we performed a detailed analysis of bacterial community in seven stages of the bioreactor by using the 16s rrna high throughput sequencing all sequences were clustered into 387 unique genera across the complete data set the relative abundance of all genera present at a minimum of 1 in any single sample is shown in fig 2 thiobacillus 27 4 73 8 and arcobacter 0 5 2 3 were mostly enriched in stage i and while the relative abundance of ochrobactrum decreased from 56 1 to 1 6 by the end of stage i when the carbon source was changed from inorganic to organic stage ii the dominant genera in the reactor changed drastically during the period from day 42 to day 56 thiobacillus rapidly decreased from 73 8 to 1 0 and azoarcus and pseudomonas replaced thiobacillus as the dominant genera increasing from 1 1 to 30 2 and 1 2 to 60 7 respectively as the nutrient conditions became mixotrophic stage iii vii thauera gradually became the dominant species accounting for up to 55 4 the relative abundance of pseudomonas decreased from 60 7 40 2 to 2 0 0 5 the other dominant species in stage iii were azoarcus 4 9 34 9 arcobacter 4 9 34 9 and ochrobactrum 1 0 18 7 when the concentration of sulfide in the influent was doubled stage iv arcobacter gradually became the dominant species increasing from 4 9 34 9 in stage iii to 54 0 61 8 in stage iv in the early phase of stage iv the relative abundance of pseudomonas increased significantly to 28 6 day 210 and then gradually decreased to 1 0 day 224 additionally the relative abundance of thiobacillus grew slowly with an initial abundance of 1 0 in stage iv and a final abundance of 10 9 other comparatively dominant species in stage iv were azoarcus 2 6 8 6 thauera 5 4 14 1 ochrobactrum 1 1 8 0 alkaliflexus 1 0 4 0 and anaerolineaceae uncultured 1 1 5 9 when the influent concentration of inorganic carbon was increased to 211 7 mg l during stage v azoarcus 20 4 39 6 arcobacter 16 0 31 9 and thiobacillus 16 0 31 3 became the dominant species when the influent concentration of inorganic carbon was subsequently reduced to 52 2 mg l during stage vi thauera 29 3 37 9 azoarcus 8 4 17 7 and arcobacter 30 7 34 5 replaced thiobacillus as the dominant species when the concentration of inorganic carbon was increased to 105 3 mg l during stage vii arcobacter 34 5 47 1 became a comparatively dominant species compared to the other core species azoarcus was 5 6 19 2 pseudomonas was 1 0 1 3 thauera was 8 0 11 7 thiobacillus was 6 2 11 7 ochrobactrum was 1 0 1 2 alkaliflexus was 1 8 4 9 and anaerolineaceae uncultured was 1 7 3 8 the genera thauera arcobacter pseudomonas azoarcus ochrobactrum alkaliflexus thiobacillus and anaerolineaceae uncultured were ubiquitous and abundant under autotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions with a total abundance of 82 0 99 5 these eight genera were considered as the core bacterial genera in the denitrification desulfurization system in contrast the abundance of the non core genera was in the range 0 0 11 2 fig 2 3 3 pca and cca diagram analysis and bacterial diversity fig 3 shows the differences between bacterial community structures under different nutrient conditions to reduce statistical deviation all the sequencing samples were subsampled at the genus level and the subsample results were used for pca analysis fig 3a the samples under autotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions showed the clear differentiation cca diagram fig 3b was applied to assess the correlation between the bacterial genera and reactor conditions of s0 generation no3 removal acetate removal inorganic carbon removal and so4 2 generation anoxynatronum pseudomonas and desulfurivibro correlated with sulfate generation arcobacter thauera thermovirga sulfurovum paracoccus and aminivibrio correlated with s0 generation desulfofustis correlated with inorganic carbon removal and melloribacter desulfuromonas and chlorobiaceae norank correlated with acetate removal thauera showed the closest correlation to nitrate removal fig 3c shows the bacterial diversity of all samples the lowest bacterial diversity was observed under autotrophic conditions stage i confirming by a shannon index within 1 08 1 29 and a simpson index within 0 18 0 26 compared with stage iii mixotrophic stage ii heterotrophic showed little change on the shannon index however the simpson index fluctuated significantly the trend of both α diversity indices tended to be stable and the chao1 index commonly used in ecology to estimate the total number of species showed a similar trend indicating that the diversity and community structure of the mixotrophic conditions were more stable than the autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions 3 4 activities of functional genes under different trophic conditions we used quantitative reverse transcription pcr to investigate the functional gene activities of carbon nitrogen and sulfur metabolic pathways in denitrification desulfurization systems under the different trophic conditions fig 4 the glta gene which encodes citrate synthase in the tricarboxylic acid cycle was used to indicate the activity of heterotrophic metabolism in denitrification desulfurization systems under autotrophic conditions stage i the copy numbers of glta ranged from log 1 9 to log 2 1 the copy number of glta gradually increased with the addition of acetate stages ii vii to log 4 1 log 4 7 during stages ii and iii as the concentration of acetate was doubled the copy number of glta gene increased to log 6 1 log 6 6 indicating an increase in heterotrophic metabolic activity during the entire experimental run the copy number of the cbbm gene was between log 1 4 and log 5 9 varying with the concentration of inorganic carbon in the influent during stage ii without inorganic carbon addition the copy number of the cbbm gene decreased from log 3 8 log 4 1 in stage i to log 1 4 log 1 7 as the concentration of inorganic carbon increased in stage iii the copy number of cbbm gene increased to log 3 4 log 3 8 when the concentration of inorganic carbon in influent was increased to 31 7 mg l the copy number of cbbm gene approached its highest level log 5 5 5 9 as the influent concentration of inorganic carbon was reduced to 8 2 mg l in stage vi the copy number of cbbm gene decreased to log 2 3 log 2 8 when the influent concentration of inorganic carbon returned back to 16 4 mg l the copy number of cbbm increased to log 3 5 log 3 8 expression levels of cbbm gene was closely related with addition of inorganic carbon representing the metabolic activity of autotrophic bacteria the copy number of the nirk gene was primarily within log 3 7 log 4 3 during the entire run only during stage iv when the concentration of influent pollutants sulfide doubled did the copy number of the nirk gene decrease to log 1 1 before gradually recovering to log 4 0 the increase in concentration of sulfide reduced the metabolic activity of denitrification the expressed copy number of the sqr gene was the highest during stages iii iv and vii reaching between log 3 2 and log 4 6 in the remaining stages the copy number was maintained within log 1 3 log 2 9 there was no significant change during stages i and ii log 1 3 log 1 8 stage v showed a slight increase compared with stages i ii and vi reaching log 1 6 log 2 1 the copy number of the soxb gene was within log 3 9 log 4 7 during stages i and ii decreased to log 2 3 log 2 8 in stage iii and reached the lowest level log 0 3 0 7 during stage iv the soxb gene copy number increased to log 4 0 4 8 in stages v and vi and decreased to log 1 2 1 8 in stage vii the changes in the sqr gene and soxb gene copy numbers were closely related to the forms of sulfur in the effluent when the copy number of sqr gene was greater than log 3 2 the elemental sulfur production rate was higher than 57 5 when the copy number of soxb was greater than log 3 9 sulfate 6 was the primary form of sulfur in the effluent 3 5 characteristics of core bacteria from the denitrification desulfurization system strains belonged to the core genera were further isolated and characterised six isolated strains hdd1 hdd6 could utilise carbohydrate and sulfide as electron donors for nitrate reduction however they neither grew nor performed denitrification without organic carbon table 4 strain add1 was an autotrophic denitrifier that could not utilise acetate or lactate as a carbon source table 4 the sulfide degradation rates of these facultative autotrophic strains in sulfide medium were as follows hdd1 hdd2 hdd3 hdd6 hdd4 hdd5 add1 fig 5a the corresponding growth rates of the strains in the sulfide medium were hdd1 hdd3 hdd2 hdd4 hdd5 hdd6 add1 fig 5b the yield of elemental sulfur per od600nm per hour was counted fig 5c hdd1 had the highest yield of elemental sulfur for every od600nm per hour of all the isolates 12 5 mg od600nm h between the 3rd and 5th hour in contrast add1 had the lowest elemental sulfur for per od600nm per hour ranging from 0 08 0 68 mg od600nm h all heterotrophic strains could remove 103 6 109 7 mg l of nitrate n 90 4 100 by oxidising most of the fed 203 9 210 0mg l of sulfide 98 2 into elementary sulfur or sulfate acetate was simultaneously consumed at high efficiencies 91 3 table 5 add1 removed 76 8 of nitrate and 75 2 of sulfide within 60 h table 5 3 6 ecological network analysis of denitrification and desulfurization systems high throughput sequencing and pure culture experiments furthered our understanding of the microbial community structure and function within the denitrification desulfurization system but do not explain the relationship among functional bacteria thus a correlation network was built to analyse the relationship between these organisms the bacterial network provides a snapshot of the time and space of an ecosystem in two parts nodes and edges a node usually represents an organism and an edge represents a statistically significant association between nodes organisms the number of edges connected to a node is the degree of the node the relative abundances of the dominant genera in all samples were collected and subjected to pearson correlation analysis fig 6a and the evolutionary relationships of the dominant genera were analysed fig 6b arcobacter azoarcus thauera thiobacillus and pseudomonas had the highest relative abundance throughout the operational period of the reactor which confirms that they were the core genera of the denitrification desulfurization system among the correlation networks correlation value r 0 6 thauera had the highest correlation with aminivibro anaerolineaceae uncultured paracoccus sulfurovum and halthiobacillaceae norank the phylogenetic tree analysis results revealed that thauera and azoarcus have a close evolutionary relationship 4 discussion because of the presence of nitrogen and sulfur compounds with different valences in the denitrification desulfurization system the relationship between bacteria is complex through the sequential study of this system several ecological phenomena such as functional redundancy highly simplified functional flora and sporadic expansion of organismal groups were observed when organic and inorganic carbon were simultaneously available bacteria used multiple carbon sources decreasing diversity and bacterial community composition fluctuations which was conducive to the stability of the microbial community structure functional redundancy was detected in the denitrification desulfurization system thus the richness of bacterial diversity increased temporal stability for example when the culture condition was changed to mixotrophic conditions condition iii the abundance of azoarcus gradually declined from 34 9 at day 126 to 4 9 at day 168 before slowly increasing again from 4 9 on day 168 to 17 7 on day 196 over the course of the reactor run the proportion of dominant organisms increased and the abundance of other functional bacteria shrank for example the relative abundance of thiobacillus in condition i reached 73 8 at day 42 whereas ochrobactrum accounted for only 1 6 in this initial stage the relative abundances of the remaining bacteria were lower however the abundance of ochrobactrum rose to approximately 18 7 during stage iii day 154 to day 168 functional overlap and therefore high functional redundancy of bacteria in denitrification desulfurization was considerable even during the transition processes between different nutrient conditions corresponding to the functional redundancy phenomenon the bacterial community structure in the system was highly simplified that is a few core organisms performed the primary system functions under each operating condition e g thiobacillus under autotrophic conditions azoarcus and pseudomonas under heterotrophic conditions and azoarcus thauera arcobacter and thiobacillus under mixotrophic conditions moreover the majority of bacteria maintained a stable relative abundance over the course of the experiment but often exhibited episodes of expansion or contraction for example azoarcus in stage iii achieved a relative abundance of 34 9 day 126 at the beginning of this stage falling to a relative abundance of 5 2 4 9 between day 154 and 168 and then increasing to 17 7 on day 196 the relative abundance of ochrobactrum in the middle of stage iii increased rapidly to 18 7 whereas the relative abundance at the beginning and end of this stage was only 1 0 3 7 the undulation of a phenomenon over a longer period is driven by direct positive and negative effects of microorganisms and environmental stress factors because of the aforementioned ecological phenomena in the denitrification desulfurization system bacteria had to be isolated to verify if thauera arcobacter azoarcus ochrobactrum and the other dominant bacterial genera possessed the hypothesised denitrification and desulfurization functions two of the isolated hdd strains pseudomonas sp hdd4 and azoarcus sp hdd3 were extremely similar to those reported previously pseudomonas stutzeri and azoarcus taiwanensis nsc3 both of which have demonstrated the sulfide oxidising ability under denitrifying conditions lee et al 2014 although the genera thauera arcobacter and ochrobactrum were previously known as functional bacteria in denitrification desulfurization systems huang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the previously isolated thauera sp hdd1 arcobacter sp hdd2 ochrobactrum sp hdd5 and alkaliflexus sp hdd6 had never been reported as present in wastewater treatment plants moreover this is the first report confirming the ability of thauera arcobacter and alkaliflexus to oxidise sulfide furthermore although members of azoarcus are well known nitrogen fixing bacteria their heterotrophic denitrification desulfurization function had not been previously recognised physiological characterisation of our isolate found it to be efficient at desulfurization second only to thauera sp mz1t hdd1 with maximum removal efficiency per hour reaching 1 7 mg od600nm these representatives of the seven isolates all secrete elemental sulfur confirming that elemental sulfur is an intermediate product from the process of sulfide oxidation to sulfate mora et al 2016 the batch culture time series data confirmed a lag period 10 h for the add strain during desulfurization however no delay was observed in any of the hdd strains suggesting that the latter favoured desulfurization in the denitrification desulfurization system the hdd1 hdd2 and hdd3 strains are most effective facultative heterotrophic desulfurization denitrifiers identified in this study the success of the selective culturing method presented in this report is efficient and easily implemented and may lessen the amount of work required to isolate low abundance functional bacterial strains table 6 the correlation between core microbial genera under each condition was very low from correlation network analysis verifying that the core bacteria were different under autotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions and indicating that there was a complex and non specific mutualistic network between bacterial functional groups under each nutrient condition a stable coexistence state was formed through synergy by utilising each the secondary or waste metabolites in the denitrification desulfurization system therefore we propose an interaction model between autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria in the denitrification desulfurization system fig 7 autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria perform denitrification and sulfur oxidation metabolism fig 5 tables 4 and 5 when organic carbon and inorganic carbon coexist microorganisms utilise increasingly varied types of carbon sources reducing fluctuations in diversity and species composition which benefits the stability of the microbial community structure the final ecological strategy of functional bacteria in denitrification desulfurization is a symbiotic relationship heterotrophic bacteria decompose organic matter into co2 which in turn supplies autotrophic bacteria that perform critical functions for denitrification desulfurization systems by providing fixed carbon autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria can oxidise h2s to elemental sulfur s0 which they deposit as either intracellular or extracellular granules for later use as an electron donor a variety of inorganic compounds can be used as electron donors e g sulfide ammonium and hydrogen and electron acceptors e g oxygen elemental sulfur and nitrate the energy yield depends on the thermodynamics of the redox couple and on the biochemistry of the pathways utilised mixotrophic organisms can simultaneously use several metabolic strategies e g incorporating organic carbon into cellular material using light and or inorganic chemical energy sources or can switch between different strategies therefore mixotrophic bacteria using such pathways have a competitive advantage over obligate autotrophs or heterotrophs 5 conclusion over the course of this experiment the nutrient conditions of the reactor operation were periodically altered switching from autotrophic to heterotrophic to mixotrophic conditions with different concentrations of inorganic carbon and pollutant sulfide in the influent under mixotrophic conditions high throughput sequencing qrt pcr targeted screening for specific functional bacterial taxonomic groups and characterisation to identify functional microbial roles and interactions in denitrification desulfurization systems was utilised we found that the genera thauera arcobacter pseudomonas azoarcus ochrobactrum alkaliflexus thiobacillus and anaerolineaceae uncultured formed the core bacteria of the denitrification desulfurization system these eight core bacterial genera except for anaerolineaceae uncultured oxidise sulfide to elemental sulfur through denitrification additionally the final oxidised form s of sulfide elemental sulfur or sulfate depends on the ratio of autotrophic bacteria to heterotrophic bacteria in the system this study will help improve the efficiency of system processing through microbial community regulation or bioaugmentation declaration of competing

17442,real time hydraulic modelling can be used to address a wide range of issues in a foul sewer system and hence can help improve its daily operation and maintenance however the current bottleneck within real time fss modelling is the lack of spatio temporal inflow data to address the problem this paper proposes a new method to develop real time fss models driven by water consumption data from associated water distribution systems wdss as they often have a proportionally larger number of sensors within the proposed method the relationship between fss manholes and wds water consumption nodes are determined based on their underlying physical connections an optimization approach is subsequently proposed to identify the transfer factor k between nodal water consumption and fss manhole inflows based on historical observations these identified k values combined with the acquired real time nodal water consumption data drive the fss real time modelling the proposed method is applied to two real fsss the results obtained show that it can produce simulated sewer flows and manhole water depths matching well with observations at the monitoring locations the proposed method achieved high r 2 nse and kge kling gupta efficiency values of 0 99 0 88 and 0 92 respectively it is anticipated that real time models developed by the proposed method can be used for improved fss management and operation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords foul sewer system water consumption data real time models water distribution system 1 introduction sewer networks are traditionally designed to collect wastewater from residential commericaland or industrial clients or possible stormwater from urban surfaces due torainfall events collected wastewater is transported then downstream to wastewater treatment plants wwtps or released directly into rivers bailey et al 2019 these sewer networks are often called combined sewer systems csss which have been widely used in large cities around the world li et al 2014 in recent years there is a growing trend in separating csss into independent storm drainage systems and foul sewer systems fsss schilperoort et al 2013 the former are used to convey urban runoff solely to surface water bodies e g rivers and the latter deliver sewerage collected from houses and commercial buildings before being conveyed to treatment facilities such a separation is mainly driven by the purpose to improving urban water environments as combined sewer overflows csos black and endreny 2006 would inevitably threaten the ecological health of the receiving water joseph duran et al 2015 over the past decade many fsss around the world have experienced significant changes due to population growth and quick urbanization which is especially the case in many developing countries such as china sweetapple et al 2018 these changes are mainly represented by the expanded spatial scales of fsss the increased complexity in their topology structures and the aged systems rokstad and ugarelli 2015 huang et al 2018 this consequently results in significant challenges difficulties for effective fss management and operation and hence many issues exist garda et al 2016 a typical issue is the deposits in the fsss including sediments seco et al 2018 fat oil and grease fog liu et al 2016 and toilet papers eren and karadagli 2012 all those deposits can directly affect flow capacity of the sewers causing overflows from csos and manholes as well as potential water quality issues e g odor issues liu et al 2016 talaiekhozani et al 2016 another common issue is the illicit discharges from local factories irvine et al 2011 banik et al 2017 where these discharges often contain toxic substances e g heavy metals that are often beyond the processing capacity of the downstream wwtps this therefore can result in functional failures of wwtps and consequently significant contamination of the receiving water body mccall et al 2016 in addition to issues of deposits and illicit discharges leaks of the sewers groundwater infiltration and illicit connections between fsss and stormwater pipes are frequently reported inducing serious contamination to the surrounding water environments lepot et al 2017 beheshti and saegrov 2019 the issues mentioned above have appreciably affected the urban water environments due to the resultant overflows from csos manholes and leaks of fsss one way to address these issues is the placement of sensors within the fss to monitor the water depths and sewer flows thereby triggeringa warning when the observations are significantly higher or lower than the historical data ahm et al 2016 however due to the high purchase cost and intensive maintenance efforts associated with these sensors the monitoring network is often sparse for the majority of the fsss kleidorfer et al 2012 consequently a warning associated with the potential issues e g overflows or leaks can be only available for the very limited number of fss locations in the proximity of sensors in addition the abnormal observations at the monitoring locations may be caused by sudden discharges increases caused by the water users rather than the illicit discharges resulting in a potentially high likelihood of false warning koch et al 2011 more importantly relying solely on the observations from the sewer sensors cannot offer predictions on the hydraulic status of the entire fss in future bruen and yang 2006 to this end real time sewer hydraulic modelling can be promising in addressing the issues associated with the fsss as mentioned above where the hydraulic variables such as water depths and sewer flows across the entire fss are simulated in real time these simulations combined with observations at the monitoring locations can be used to deduce whether leaks illicit discharges deposits and illicit connections exist in the fss as well as facilitate the localization of such events manhole inflow data i e sewer discharges of the water users at a high time resolution say every 30 minutes is the key to enable the development of a real time fss hydraulic model however discharge data of such a high temporal and spatial resolution are typically unavailable in engineering practice resulting in a large challenge for real time modeling of fss breinholt et al 2013 to deal with this problem a widely used approach is to calibrate a model to estimate manhole inflows with the aid of limited in sewer observations korving and clemens 2005 while some calibration methods are available in the literature e g di pierro et al 2005 khu et al 2006 broekhuizen et al 2020 they mainly focus on calibrating the underlying rainfall runoff relationship for the combined sewer systems in an off line manner thereby predicting the floods or sewer overflows caused by rainfall these previously published methods therefore cannot be used or at least are difficult to estimate fss manhole inflows in real time the real time management of the fss has received great attention over the past few decades with the main focus on system real time control based on observations schütze et al 2002 sara et al 2020 more specifically real time control is defined as a timely operation of an fss based on continuously monitored process data those data are water levels and sewer flows in the system with operations including the activation of pumps sluice gates and weirs used to improve system performance e g reduce the overflows schütze et al 2003 however these real time control studies operated the hydraulic facilities e g pumps with the aid of system observations rather than fss simulations and hence they differ significantly from the real time fss hydraulic modelling which is the aim of the present study the main difficulty associated with the calibration of fss manhole inflows based on the limited number of monitoring sites is the equifinality khu et al 2006 more specifically a large number of manhole inflow combinations can produce similar agreements between simulated and observed water levels at monitoring locations as a result it is very difficult if not impossible to identify a particular parameter set i e manhole inflow combination that can represent the true underlying spatial distribution of the discharges from water users into the fss to address the equifinality issue this paper proposes a new method to enable the development of real time fss hydraulic model within the proposed method the fss model is integrated with its corresponding water distribution system wds hydraulic model for the same area being considered such a model integration approach is possible as the wds models have already been widely used walski et al 2003 in addition the number of sensors e g smart demand meters pressure sensors and flow meters deployed in the wdss can be large which is at least partly driven by the quick developments of the internet of things in recent years zheng et al 2018 such a dense sensor network can greatly facilitate the estimation of real time nodal water consumption for the wds models as demonstrated in previous studies creaco et al 2019 this is especially the case in recent years as smart demand meters have been increasingly used in many wdss providing water consumption data for many users not only large users but also residential users in a real time manner typically every 15 or 30 minutes creaco et al 2018 such near real time and high density spatial water consumption data can be assimilated with the limited in sewer observations to develop a real time fss hydraulic model this is the key feature and novelty of the method presented in this paper the concept of incorporating water consumption data into fss modeling can be dated back to bruke et al 1986 where an fss model was calibrated using monthly water use records more recently bailey et al 2019 presented a new fss model where the stochastically simulated water demands were imported into the sewer networkmodel while these limited previous studies have made great contributions in assimilating water use records into fss modelling mainly used for fss design purpose the water consumption data used are either collected manually at a very low time resolution e g monthly bruke et al 1986 or provided by a stochastic simulator bailey et al 2019 consequently these data cannot represent the true underlying temporal and spatial variations of the manhole inflows therefore they cannot be used to develop real time fss models which is the focus of this study the key feature of the proposed method is that the real time fss model is developed using a large number of existing sensors within the wdss this implies that it is not necessary to deploy a large number of sewer sensors which is often very expensive in terms of both sensor purchases and maintenance to enable real time sewer modelling making the proposed method attractive for practical applications this paper is organized as follows the proposed methodology is described in section 2 followed by the descriptions of the case studies considered in section 3 results and discussions are given in section 4 finally the conclusion section section 5 shows the main observations and implications of this paper 2 methodology 2 1 the overall modelling concept fig 1 illustrates the overall concept of the proposed method where a foul sewer system fss and a water distribution system wds for a small area are presented typically raw water from reservoirs or rivesis pumped into the water treatment plants in order to improve water quality to a required standard wu et al 2011 subsequently the treated water isconveyed to the wds satisfying demands for various users including residents schools hospitals industrial and commercial buildings as shown in fig 1 to ensure water supply safety sensors are often deployed in the wds fig 1 including pressure sensors flow meters and smart demand meters the latter have been increasingly being deployed in recent years to monitor water consumptions for the users in a near real time manner creaco et al 2018 consequently such a dense sensor network enables the development of real time wds modelling which has been an important trend within the water supply domain both research and industry due to its great merits in facilitating effective system management as highlighted in creaco et al 2019 inherently local residents or commercial industrial users discharge sewage after water consumption as illustrated in fig 1 sewer pipes collect and convey the sewage to downstream wastewater treatment plants with a limited number of water depth or sewer flow sensors installed to monitor hydraulic state of the system consequently the following equation can be used to represent the underlying relationship between water consumption and sewage discharge for user i 1 d i f q i k i t i where d i is the sewer discharge rate of user i i e manhole inflow rate resulting from its water consumption q i taken from the wds t i represents the time delay i e the time between the clean water entering the user property and the time it reaches the local sewer network k i is the transfer factor for user i representing the proportion of supplied water that ends up in the local sewer network k i typically has a value between 0 7 and 1 0 behzadian and kapelan 2015 equation 1 represents the fundamentalrule assumption in the proposed method used tobuild the connections between the wds water consumption data and the fss manhole inflows fig 2 presents the overall methodology of the proposed method with two modules involved the first module consists of three phases which are carried only once in an offline manner and the second module involves only the fourth phase phase 4 of the proposed method which runs in real time the details are given below phase 1 integrate the wds and fss models carry out once within this phase the fss and wds models are developed withhydraulic facility information e g water supply pipes tanks sewer pipes taken from external sources such as the gis or asset management system this is followed by the building of the connections between each wds demand node and the fss manhole based on the spatial distance with details given in section 2 2 phase 2 calibrate nodal water consumptions of the wds it should be highlighted that the calibration of thenodal water consumptions in phase 2 is conducted offline which is used to provide data for phase 3 more specifically based on a particular time period of historical data from pressures sensors flow meters and smart demand meters deployed in the wds the nodal water consumption without smart demand meters are estimated for a given time resolution often equals the time resolution of the flow or pressure sensors with details given in section 2 3 phase 3 estimate the transfer factor k for each manhole of the fss according to the identified relationship between wds nodes and the fss manholes in phase 1 as well as the calibrated nodal water consumptions in phase 2 the transfer factor k is determined for this an evolutionary algorithm ea is applied with the objective function defined in eqs 9 13 and using sewer observations with details given in section 2 4 phase 4 model the fss in a real time manner data from pressure sensors flow meters and the available smart demand meters in the wds are acquired at current time t these data are used as the inputs for the real time wds modelling to estimate water consumption for each node qi within the wds section 2 3 eq 1 is subsequently used to update the manhole inflows di based on the known qi and identified k values phase 3 finally the fss is modelled by updating manhole inflows di in real time this offers short term hydraulic predictions water depths at manholes and flow rates in sewer pipes of the entire fss with a particular time resolution if say every 30 minutes used in this paper it is noted that a few assumptions are made in the proposed method with the justification given below i given that the proposed fss real time modelling method is driven by water consumption data from the wds the number of available smart demand meters in the wds is important to ensure the high accuracy of the fss simulations for the two case studies considered in this paper the number of smart demand meters is reasonably high making them perfectly suited for the demonstration of the proposed method however some wdss may have relatively low coverage of the smart demand meters e g only installed for large demand users while such a case would not affect the application of the proposed method the accuracy of the wds nodal water consumption values and the fss real time simulations can be affected however it is anticipated that smart demand meters areincreasingly used by water utilities as a result of the quick developments in the internet of things zheng et al 2018 creaco et al 2019 and hence the applicability of the proposed method is only going to grow ii the proposed method assumes that observations from the wds and fss sensors including smart demand meters are accurate within the applications in this study however in reality observation errors can exist due to the sensor malfunctions or signal transmission issues therefore it is necessary to incorporate the potential observation errors into the modelling framework although that is an important study direction it is beyond the scope of the paperand will be the focus of future work iii as shown in eq 1 the time t i implies that the nodal water consumption q i estimated at time t using the smart demand meter or the real time calibration method section 2 3 should correspond to the manhole inflow at time t t i the value of t i can be dependent on the particular user properties including the characteristics of the water supply area associated with the demand node as well as the physical characteristics e g length and slopes of the connecting sewer pipes between users and the corresponding manholes in this study t i is ignored as this value is typically small ranging from several minutes up to 15 minutes for many cases wu et al 2011 this assumption is considered valid in our study as the time resolution used for real time fss modelling in this paper is lower i e 30 minutes iv in this study a linear transfer function with a constant factor of k is proposed to describe the underlying relationship between nodal water consumption and manhole inflows while being simple in practical implementation the transfer function and the k factor can be affected by not only the time delay t i in eq 1 but also the infiltration inflows and the properties of water users more specifically the transfer function may be different between the water users with or without smart demand meters and the k factor may vary temporally or even vary as a function of change in the type of water users these influences need further consideration in future study along this research line 2 2 integrate the fss and wds models typically fss and wds models are developed with the aid of the geographic information system gis or the asset management system for the analyzed area behzadian and kapelan 2015 huang et al 2018 the details e g locations and length of various system components including pipes tanks valves and pumps can be taken from the gis this is often followed by system skeletonization in which many facilities mainly small pipes are removed or simplified without significantly affecting the hydraulic properties of the original full system huang et al 2020 to enable the practical application of eq 1 it is important to build the connection between each demand node i representing the water consumption in the wds model and the manhole representing the facility to collect the sewages in the fss model such a connection indicates that the consumptionat the demand node iis received by its associated manhole to this end the wds and fss models are integrated within their development processes in this study fig 3 illustrates the proposed integration method where a water demand node in the wds model is assigned to the manhole of the fss model within a shortest distance from each other the rationale behind this is that manholes are often built near the water users nodes in the wds model to collect their sewerage discharges consequently two cases are available as shown in fig 3 which are i one demand node is assigned to a manhole and ii multiple demand nodes are assigned to a single manhole in addition to these two relatively simple cases in practice one demand node can be associated with multiple manholes which is possible when this demand node represents many users however it is difficult to determine the proportion of the total discharge associated with each relevant manhole for the sake of simplicity a single manhole with the minimum spatial distance to this demand node is selected to deliver the total discharge while such a simplification can cause an unrealistic hydraulic status in a very small area relative to the original full system its impact on the overall results can be negligible since each demand node say node i in the wds is assigned to a particular manhole in the fss model the water consumptionof this node q i is considered as the approximate manhole inflows d i their underlying flow relationship needs to be further accurately determined with the incorporation of the transfer factor k i as shown in eq 1 it is noted that when a higher level of accuracy is neededfor a practical application individual water consumption and sewer connections could be identified if required this will lead to a slight modification on the wds and fss model topologies which can better reflect the flows of supplied drinking water and generated wastewater by different users 2 3 calibrate nodal water consumption based on historical observations based on the built connections between each wds node and its corresponding fss manhole as described in section 2 2 nodal water consumption is the driver for triggering the real time fss modelling in the wdss many smart demand meters can be available providing near real time water consumption data if say every 15 minutes or 30 minutes for wds nodes users especially for water users with large demand however in practice it may not be necessary to have smart meters installed at each demand node and hence this study adopts a calibration method to enable the estimation of water consumption at the nodes without smart demand meters in this study the numerical approach described in zhang et al 2018 is selected to calibrate the nodal water consumptions due to its demonstrated efficiency the objective function of this adopted numerical method is formulated as the weighted sum of squared differences between the field observed and model simulated responses pressuresand flows at monitoring points in the wds within a particular time period i e the time resolution of the monitoring data i e as follows 2 min f q i 1 n h w h i h i o h i q 2 j 1 n f w q j q j o q j q 2 h o h q q o q q t w h o h q q o q q where q is the vector of nodal water consumptionsin the wds including known water consumption data at nodes with smart demand meters and unknown nodal water consumption data n h and n f are the numbers of observed nodal pressures and pipe flows respectively w h i and w q j are the weighting factorsfor observed pressuresat the i t h node and observed flows at the j t h pipe respectively where w h i 1 h i o 2 and w q j 1 q j o 2 are used in this study following kun et al 2015 and zhang et al 2018 h i o and h i q are the observed and simulated pressures at the i t h node respectively q j o and q j q are the observed and simulated flowsat the j t h piperespectively eq 2 can be expressed in the matrix form see above by using h o h 1 o h 2 o h n h o t q o q 1 o q 2 o q n f o t h q h 1 q h 2 q h n h

where δ h h o h q and δ q q o q q are the differences between the observed and simulated values of nodal pressures and pipe flows respectively j h h q q and j q q q q are the jacobian matrix with details given in zhang et al 2018 since eq 2 is a convex function kun et al 2015 the minimum objective value of eq 2 can be obtained when its first order derivative eq 3 equals to zero that is 4 d f q δ q d δ q 2 j h j q t w δ h j h δ q δ q j q δ q 0 by solving eq 4 δ q can be obtained as follows 5 δ q j h j q t w j h j q 1 j h j q t w δ h δ q 6 q s 1 q s δ q s where s 0 1 s is the iteration number s is the maximum allowed number of iterations it is highlighted that the water consumption at nodes with smart demand meters are known within the entire calibration process and hence δ q is only considered for the nodes without smart meters to ensure the estimated nodal water consumption valuesare practically meaningful the domain knowledge has been incorporated within the calibration process in this study as shown below wu et al 2010 7 q i s 1 q i min if q i s 1 q i min q i max if q i s 1 q i max q i s 1 others where q i min 1 p q i i n i t i a l and q i max 1 p q i i n i t i a l are the minimum and maximum allowed water consumptions at node i respectively p is the percentage generally within 10 20 in practice zhang et al 2018 q i i n i t i a l is estimated using 8 q i init ial l i l t l m q t q m where l i is the length of the pipe associated with node i l t and l m is the total pipe length of all nodes and the length of pipes associated with smart demand meters respectively q t is the total water consumption of the wds over a given time period e g 30 minutes which is estimated based on the flow meters installed at the outlet of the water treatment plants and volume changes in the tanks if available q m is the sum of the water consumption values measured by the available smart demand meters within the wds over a given time period the calibration process at each time period i e the time resolution of the monitoring data e g 30 minutes is executed by iteratively updating δ q in eq 6 until the maximum value of vector δ q is smaller than a given threshold value ε e g ε 0 1 the entire calibration process is executed again once the monitoring data from sensors are updated representing a real time hydraulic calibration for the wds it is noted that the pipe resistance coefficients are not calibrated in a real time manner as these values are not likelyto changeover a short time period kun et al 2016 2 4 estimate the transfer factor k for each fss manhole as stated in eq 1 the nodal consumption data determined in section 2 3 q i cannot be directly taken as the manhole inflows d i due to the inevitable loss during the transporting process within the facilities of the users behzadian and kapelan 2015 in this study a transfer factor k i is used to represent the proportion of water consumption used by node i that has been collected by its corresponding manhole such a factor can vary as a function of the properties of the water users such as user types commercial users or common resident users and habits of water usages bailey et al 2019 therefore the transfer factor needs to be calibrated for each demand node based on the nodal water consumption data and the sewer observations e g sewer flow rates or water depth in the manholes in the fss in this study the transfer factor k i associated with each demand node is considered to be approximately constant over time because the user properties are overall constant over a short time period bailey et al 2019 to calibrate the transfer factor k k 1 k 2 k n t of the entire fss with a total of n manholes with external inflows the following objective function is defined 9 min f k t t w t i 1 m g h i o

t k i q i t 13 k i min k i k i max i 1 2 n where t is the time period with observations used for fss calibration t w is the warming up time period for model setting up guo et al 2020 m andn are the numbers of observed water depths at the manholes and flow rates in the sewer pipes respectively h i o t and f j o t are observed water depth at manhole iand observed flow rate at sewer pipe j at time t respectively h i s t and f j s t are simulated water depth at manhole iand simulated flow rate at sewer pipe j at time t respectively g is a linear function used to convert water depths and pipe flow rates into the same scale thereby enabling both terms in the right side of eq 9 are approximately equivalent in terms of the objective function value h i s h i s t 1 h i s t 2 h i s t is a vector representing the simulated water depths of manhole i over the entire time period of t f j s f j s t 1 f j s t 2 f j s t is a vector representing the simulated sewer flow rates of pipe j over the entire time period of t d t is a t n matrix representing the inflows of all manholes across the total time period of t the values of h i s and f i s are computed using f s d t as shown in eq 11 in this study a simulation package called storm water management model swmm rossman 2010 is employed to calculate h i s and f i s in eq 12 d i t is the inflow rate of manhole i at time t and q i t is the water consumption of node i at time t determined by real time wds modelling as described in section 2 3 k i min and k i max are the minimum and maximum allowable values of k i which can be determined by engineering experience in this study the value of k i min 0 7 is used for all wds demand nodes regardless of whether these are metered or not the value of k i max 1 0 is used for wds nodes with smart demand meters and k i max 1 3 is used for wds nodes without smart meters this is because water consumptions of nodes without smart meters are calibrated using the method described in section 2 3 and hence the identified values can to a certain extentdeviate from the true water consumption values to mitigate thispotential impact the maximum value of the transfer factor for these nodes is increased to 1 3 in this paper an evolutionary algorithm ea zheng et al 2017 combined with the swmm modelling software is employed to solve the optimization problem defined in eqs 9 13 while different eas are available in the literature borg hadkaand reed 2013 methodis used in this study due to its well demonstrated performance in dealing with complex water resources optimization problems additional algorithm details are given in section 3 2 in the proposed fss calibration method manhole inflows are considered as the only calibration parameters due to their large temporal and spatial variations with which the transfer factor k for each manhole can be estimated it should be noted that manning s roughness coefficients of the sewer pipes can also affect the hydraulics of the fss however previous studies have shown that the impacts of the small to moderate variation in manning s roughness coefficients of sewer pipes are limited rossman and huber 2017 in addition the physical pipe properties e g pipe ages and materials that affect the manning s roughness coefficient are unlikely to vary in a short time period zhang et al 2018 and hence it is not considered within the real time fss modelling it is highlighted that the values of k k 1 k 2 k n t are calibrated using a particular time period of historical water consumption data and in sewer observations in an offline manner carried out once as shown in fig 2 2 5 model the fss in real time it is noted that phases 1 3 in sections 2 2 2 4 are carried offline in the offline module as shown in fig 2 aimed to identify the transfer factors between the wds nodal water consumptions and the fss manhole inflows this is followed by the real time fss modelling real time module of the proposed method in fig 2 with the following steps step 1 collect the data from pressure sensors flow meters and the available smart demand meters in the wds at current time t step 2 estimate the water consumption for each wds node without smart demand meters qi t in eq 1 using the method described in section 2 3 phase 2 based on the observations from step 1 step 3 update the manhole inflow di t based on qi t and the identified transfer factor k in phase 3 of the offline module using eq 1 step 4 run the fss hydraulic model based on the manhole inflow di t producing the water depths and sewer flows for the entire fss within the time resolutions 30 minutes in this study this is followed by moving to step 1 at t t δ t where δ t is the time resolution of the fss modelling δ t 30 minutes in this study 2 6 metrics used for performance evaluation five statistical metrics are used in this paper to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in simulating the fss hydraulic variables they are the absolute percentage error ape the mean absolute percentage error mape the coefficient of determination r 2 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse and the kling gupta efficiency kge these five metrics are selected due to their wide applications in assessing the model performance within the water resources domain mu et al 2020 the ape between the i t h observation y i and its corresponding simulation y i is defined as 14 a p e y i y i y i 100 15 m a p e 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 where n is thetotal number of data points as shown in eqs 14 and 15 a lower value of ape or mape indicate an overall better model performance the r 2 is a goodness of fit measure for linear regression models which can be mathematically described as gujarati et al 2009 16 r 2 i 1 n y i y y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y represents the mean of the observations and y is the mean of the simulations a large value of r 2 represents a better model performance the nseis defined as follows nash and sutcliffe 1970 with a larger value implying a better model performance 17 n s e 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 the kge metric is mathematically described as follows knoben et al 2019 18 k g e 1 r 1 2 σ s i m σ o b s 1 2 μ s i m μ o b s 1 2 where r is the linear correlation between observations and simulations σ s i m and σ o b s are the standard deviation in simulations and observations respectively μ s i m and μ o b s are the mean of simulations and observations respectively a large value of kge means that the simulations can match observations better with kge 1 representing the best model performance 3 case studies 3 1 case study description two real world fsss in china the benk network bkn and the xiuzhou network xzn are selected as case studies to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method these two fsss are selected as their associated wdss have good coverage of monitoring sensors especially the smart demand meters in addition bkn and xzn respectively represent scales of a relatively small region and atown aimed to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method in handling the fsss with differentcomplexity levels bkn consists of one outlet 64 manholes and 64 sewer pipes fig 4 delivering the wastewater for the users with water supplied by a wds referred to as wds bnk wds bnk is composed of one reservoir 65 nodes and 93 pipes as well as one flow meter three pressure sensors and 40 smart water demand meters fig 4 providing approximately 4 800 m3 of water per day as shown in fig 4 one in sewer flow meter and three water depth sensors with a 30 minute time resolution have been installed in bkn with an average discharge of about 4 100 m3 day the dotted arrow lines in fig 4 represent the receiving manhole for each demand node determined based on the spatial distances observations from the wds bnk and bnk sensors are recorded for consecutive 31 days without rainfall or snowfall events in winter with a 30 minute time resolution the xzn system is a large scale complex fss in jiaxing city with a total length of approximately 86 km and an average discharge of about 21 500 m3 day the layout of the xzn network is shown in fig 5 consisting of one outlet 1 214 manholes and 1 214 sewer pipes as shown in fig 5 three flow meters and eight water depth sensors have been installed in this fss the wds that supplies water demands for this area refereed as wds xzn has one reservoir one pump station 1 119 nodes and 1 137 water consumption pipes as shown in fig 6 in the wds xzn network five flow meters eight pressure sensors and 525 smart demand meters are deployed as illustrated in fig 6 the wds xzn networksupplies approximately 23 150 m3 per day for a population about 107 500 living in this area within the jiaxing city as the same for the bkn network the data from the wds xzn and xzn sensors are recorded for consecutive 31 days without rainfall or snowfall events in winter with a 30 minute time resolution 3 2 implementation of the proposed method the epanet2 0 and swmm5 1 rossman 2000 2010 were used as wds and fss hydraulic simulation model respectively in this study for both case studies historical data of the first 17 consecutive days from wds sensors with a 30 minute time resolution were used to estimate the water consumptions of nodes without smart meters this led to a total of 816 17 24 2 time periods with nodal water consumptionsto be calibrated for each wds these estimated nodal water consumption data were subsequently used to identify the transfer factors kof the fss based on sewer observations at the first 17 days the wds and fss sewer observations of the remaining 14 days 14 24 2 data points used for model validation were used to run the real time fss models with a 30 minute time resolution in other words the first set of wds observations at the validation period the last 14 days was considered as the observations at time t in the real time module of fig 2 δ t 30 minutes followed by the execution of the four steps in section 2 5 for the nodal water consumption calibration the termination error was set as max δ q 0 1 eq 6 the maximum allowed iterations was s 100 eq 6 and the adjustment range of nodal water consumptions was p 20 for each wds eq 7 for the wds bnk fig 4 observations of the first 17 days from two pressure sensors h1 and h3 and the flow meter f1 were used for calibration and the records of pressure sensor h2 were used for validation for the wds xzn fig 6 observations of the first 17 days from h1 h3 h4 h6 and h8 pressure sensors as well as f2 f3 f4 and f5 flow meters were utilized for model calibration and the records of h2 h5 h7 and f1 were used for validation the first three days were considered as the warming up time period for the fss model setting up as stated in eq 9 i e tw 3 days the observations of the next 14 days were used for fss model calibration and the remaining observations of 14 days were utilized for validating the performance of the real time fss models the linear scale function g in eq 9 for each case study is defined as 17 g x x x min x max x min where x represents the observed or simulated values at monitoring points x min and x max are the lower and upper bounds respectively these two parameters for each monitoring point are determined by analyzing historical observation data over 14 days i e the calibration time period in this paper the evolutionary algorithm borg hadkaand reed 2013 was selected to solve the proposed calibration problem defined in eqs 9 13 due to its great performance in handling complex urban water resources and engineering optimization problems reed et al 2013 zheng et al 2016 the initial population size of borg applied to bkn and xzn case studieswere 500 and 1 000 respectively and the maximum allowable iterations are 50 000 for both case studies the default values of the other parameters of borg were used in this study as they have been validated throughvarious applications wang et al 2014 five borg runs with different random number seeds were applied to each case study and the results showed that the final optimization results were overall similar across different runs therefore the results of a typical borg run were presented to enable discussions for each of the two fss case studies 4 results and discussions 4 1 calibration results of wds nodal water consumptions for each fss case study nodal water consumptions of its associated wds need to be calibrated at each time period resulting in a total of 816 calibration runs using the calibration method as described in section 2 3 the resultant time consumption was approximately 25 seconds and 10 minutes for wds bkn and wds xzn systems respectively on a pc with a 2 60 ghz intel core i9 7980xe and 2 gb of ram fig 7 shows the density plot of the errors between observations and simulations at the monitoring locations for both case studies it is seen that for the wds bkn case more than 90 of the absolute errors aes is less than 0 30m for each pressure monitoring point including the h2 sensor used for model validation with the maximum ae being 0 32m across the three pressure monitoring points in terms of flow more about 93 of absolute percentage errors apes are smaller than 1 5 with the maximum ape being 2 40 as shown in fig 7 a b for the wds xzn fig 7 c d the differences between the simulated and observed pressurevalues at the eight monitoring locations are negligible including h2 h5 and h7 used for validation with all aesbeing lower than 0 4m relative to pressure the deviations between the flow simulations and observations are slightly larger fig 7 d with the majority of apes smaller than 5 and the maximum ape being 9 8 f1 used for validation to further demonstrate the quality of calibration results the criteria defined in walski et al 2003 were used to verify the simulation accuracies as stated in walski et al 2003 a satisfactory wds model calibration should ensure 85 of pressureerrors within 0 2m 100 of pressure errors within 0 5 m trunk main flow errors flows more than 10 of the total demands within 5 and the other flow errors within 10 the calibration results of the two wdss satisfied these criteria implying that the calibration was successful as the resultant nodal water consumptions can reproduce the overall hydraulics of the wds fig 8 presents the nodal water consumptions over the 31 days with a resolution of 30 minute for the two wdss a for the wds bkn and b for wds xzn where the grey solid lines represent the calibrated nodal water consumptions and the orange dotted lines indicate the nodal water consumptions measured by smart demand meters despite some variations all the nodal water consumptions exhibited an overall similar trend for both wdss with two peak demand periods occurring at each demand node as shown in fig 8 which matches well with the typical water use properties zhang et al 2018 4 2 estimated transfer factor values fig 9 shows the distribution of the probability density of the identified transfer factor k values for all manholes of the bkn and xzn based on the historical data over the first 17 calibration days observations of the first three days were used as model setting up such an optimization section 2 4 took 4 86 and 56 hours respectively based on the same computing platform as mentioned above it can be seen that the majority of k values is within the range of 0 7 1 0 for the bkn and xzn with a mean value of 0 83 and 0 92 respectively meaning that around 83 and 92 of the total water consumptions have been collected by the fss of bkn and xzn in this area respectively this demonstrates that the calibrated k values for all manholes were overall practically meaningful behzadian and kapelan 2015 it is noted that around 10 and 28 calibrated k values were greater than 1 as shown in fig 9 such values were only allowed for the wds nodes without smart demand sensors and hence their nodal water consumptions were estimated using the calibration method described in section 2 3 while fig 7 showed that the calibration results can reproduce the overall hydraulics of the wds at the monitoring locations the calibrated nodal water consumptions might inevitably deviate from the true values at a certain extent zhang et al 2018 to mitigate this potential impact the value of k for the fss manholes associated with wds nodes without smart demand meters was allowed to have a range between 0 7 and 1 3 as previously stated this led to that a proportion of k values were greater than 1 as shown in fig 9 fig 10 shows the fss calibrated results the first17 days corresponding to the transfer factor values presented in fig 9 it is seen that the simulated flows in c1 in the small bkn case study matched well with the observations fig 10 a where all ape values were lower than 5 0 and the mean ape value was 1 16 for the xzn case study fig 10 e the maximum and the mean ape values between simulations and observations within the calibration period at the c3 monitoring location were 13 68 and 3 02 respectively therefore it can be deduced that the simulations matched well with the observations for such a large xzn case study while the ape values during the period with relatively low sewer flows were proportionally large their corresponding absolute errors aes were low overall as shown in fig 10 c f for example the maximum aevalue was 1 88 l s for the bkn case study with an average flow of 48 47 l s in c1 fig 10 c the averageae value was 9 58 l s for the xzn case study with an average flow of 255 10 l s in c3 fig 10 f tables 1 and 2 present the values of the performance metrics applied to the simulations and observations at monitoring locations for both case studies as shown in this table for the bkn case study the averaged values of mape r2 nse and kge over four different monitoring locations within the calibration period are 3 61 0 99 0 94 and 0 94 respectively for the large xzn case study the averaged values of mape r2 nse and kge over 11 different monitoring locations within the calibration period are 4 98 0 98 0 89 and 0 93 respectively this implied that fss calibration aimed to estimate the transfer factor was overall successful 4 3 performance of the real time fss modelling results in the calibration period demonstrated that the proposed method was capable of identifying suitable transfer factors that can match well simulations and observations at the monitoring locations this section validated the performance of the real time fss models driven by the wds consumption data in modelling the sewer hydraulics and such a performance evaluation was conducted using the observations from the 17th to the 31st days i e validation period the steps of the real time fss modelling were presented in fig 2 real time module figs 11 and 12 show the observations versus observations of the monitoring locations every 30 minutes within the validation period for both case studies it is seen from fig 11 that the sewer flow and the water depth simulations matched well with the observations within the validation period at the four monitoring locations c1 m1 m2 and m3 in the bkn case study more specifically the maximum flow apevalue was 4 91 and the maximum absolute error of water depth was 0 7cm across m1 m2 and m3 locations similarly the differences between the simulation and observations for c1 c2 m1 and m5 monitoring locations were also matched very well for the xzn case study as shown in fig 12 for this large fss the maximum flow ape value was 13 45 and the maximum absolute error of water depth was 1 4cm similar observations can be made for other monitoring locations the values of performance metrics applied to the observations and simulations within the validation period for both case studies are also presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively as shown in these two tables the averaged values of mape r2 nse and kge over four different monitoring locations within the validation period are 3 63 0 99 0 94 and 0 93 respectively for the bkn case study the averaged values of mape r2 nse and kge over four different monitoring locations within the validation period are 5 23 0 97 0 88 and 0 92 respectively for the xzn case study overall the performance of the fss models within the validation period was similar or slightly worse than the calibration period for both case studies see tables 1 and 2 this indicated that i there was a low likelihood of over fitting within the calibration process due to the similar performance between the calibration and validation period and ii the real time fss models driven by wds water consumption data were effective in accurately simulating the sewer hydraulics at a high time resolution every 30 minutes the real time model was able to offer a great opportunity to enable the comparison between the simulations and observations at monitoring locations at a very high time resolution every 30 minutes in this paper followed by a warning trigger if large deviations between the simulations and observations were observed more specifically a threshold can be determined by long term historical data for each monitoring location as did in qi et al 2018 if the deviations between the simulations and observations at a particular monitoring location go beyond the specified range a warning can be triggered efficiently it should be highlighted that since the real time fss model developed using the proposed method has already accounted for the inflow variation caused by the change in water consumption the false warning rate is expected to be significantly reduced therefore the proposed real time fss model can be a useful tool for the development of an efficient warning system aimed to detect the potential hydraulic issues e g leaks and illicit inflows for the fsss in addition to providing accurate simulations at the monitoring locations the proposed method was also able to produce real time simulations for the manholes and sewer pipes without monitoring sensors while the accuracies of these simulations cannot be directly evaluated due to the unavailability of observations it can be anticipated that they can reasonably represent the true hydraulics of the manholes and sewer pipes without monitoring sensors this was because the real time fss model was driven by the water consumption data from the water distribution system where nodal water consumptions were either measured by smart demand meters or estimated with the aid of an intensive sensor pressure and flow sensors coverage as shown in fig 13 water depths of 10 manholes near m5 sensor of the xzn case study over a typical day within the validation period exhibited a similar and reasonable trend these accurate hydraulic simulations at the manholes and pipes without monitoring sensors can be useful to enable the efficient localization of leaks deposits or illicit inflows through comparing the simulations with the sampled observations from the field survey 5 conclusion this paper proposes a novel method to develop a real time foul sewer system fss model driven by water consumption data from its associated water distribution system wds that often has a large number of sensors such as pressure sensors flow meters and smart demand meters within the proposed method the fss and the wds models are integrated to build physical connections between water consumption nodes and their corresponding manholes based on spatial distances this is followed by a proposal of an optimization approach to identify the transfer factor k between nodal water consumptions and fss manhole inflows according to historical observations subsequently real time nodal water consumption data are acquired using an efficient calibration approach based on the dense sensors in the wds finally these nodal water consumption data combined with the identified k values drive the fss real time modelling two real fss case studies the smaller bkn with 64 sewer pipes and 64 manholes and the large zxn case study with 1214 sewer pipes and 1214 manholes have been used to test validate and demonstrate the proposed method the results obtaineddemonstrate that the proposed method can produce real time predictionsof water depths and flows that are in good agreements with the corresponding observations at monitoring locations the evidence for this can be found in the high mean values of r2 nse and kge metrics obtained across different monitoring locations which are 0 99 0 94 and 0 93 of the small bnk case study and 0 97 0 88 and 0 92 for the large xzn case study respectively in addition to providing accurate simulations at the monitoring locations the proposed method is expected to produce reasonable real time simulations for the manholes and sewer pipes without monitoring sensors this deduction is based on that the real time fss model is driven by the wds water consumption data that are either measured by smart demand meters or estimated based on a large number of sensors pressure and flow sensors this implies that the equifinality problem can be successfully addressed by using the proposed method therefore the developed real time fss model offers an important tool to facilitate effective and efficient foul sewer system management and operation finally it is acknowledged that the proposed method is developed ignoring a number of uncertainties that exist in reality these include potential inaccuracies of wds and fss sensor measurements e g smart demand meters water depth sensors flow sensors the potential impacts of the ignorance of the water travelling time within the user property and the influence of the variation in manning s coefficients of the sewer pipes these uncertainties need to be more systematically

17442,real time hydraulic modelling can be used to address a wide range of issues in a foul sewer system and hence can help improve its daily operation and maintenance however the current bottleneck within real time fss modelling is the lack of spatio temporal inflow data to address the problem this paper proposes a new method to develop real time fss models driven by water consumption data from associated water distribution systems wdss as they often have a proportionally larger number of sensors within the proposed method the relationship between fss manholes and wds water consumption nodes are determined based on their underlying physical connections an optimization approach is subsequently proposed to identify the transfer factor k between nodal water consumption and fss manhole inflows based on historical observations these identified k values combined with the acquired real time nodal water consumption data drive the fss real time modelling the proposed method is applied to two real fsss the results obtained show that it can produce simulated sewer flows and manhole water depths matching well with observations at the monitoring locations the proposed method achieved high r 2 nse and kge kling gupta efficiency values of 0 99 0 88 and 0 92 respectively it is anticipated that real time models developed by the proposed method can be used for improved fss management and operation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords foul sewer system water consumption data real time models water distribution system 1 introduction sewer networks are traditionally designed to collect wastewater from residential commericaland or industrial clients or possible stormwater from urban surfaces due torainfall events collected wastewater is transported then downstream to wastewater treatment plants wwtps or released directly into rivers bailey et al 2019 these sewer networks are often called combined sewer systems csss which have been widely used in large cities around the world li et al 2014 in recent years there is a growing trend in separating csss into independent storm drainage systems and foul sewer systems fsss schilperoort et al 2013 the former are used to convey urban runoff solely to surface water bodies e g rivers and the latter deliver sewerage collected from houses and commercial buildings before being conveyed to treatment facilities such a separation is mainly driven by the purpose to improving urban water environments as combined sewer overflows csos black and endreny 2006 would inevitably threaten the ecological health of the receiving water joseph duran et al 2015 over the past decade many fsss around the world have experienced significant changes due to population growth and quick urbanization which is especially the case in many developing countries such as china sweetapple et al 2018 these changes are mainly represented by the expanded spatial scales of fsss the increased complexity in their topology structures and the aged systems rokstad and ugarelli 2015 huang et al 2018 this consequently results in significant challenges difficulties for effective fss management and operation and hence many issues exist garda et al 2016 a typical issue is the deposits in the fsss including sediments seco et al 2018 fat oil and grease fog liu et al 2016 and toilet papers eren and karadagli 2012 all those deposits can directly affect flow capacity of the sewers causing overflows from csos and manholes as well as potential water quality issues e g odor issues liu et al 2016 talaiekhozani et al 2016 another common issue is the illicit discharges from local factories irvine et al 2011 banik et al 2017 where these discharges often contain toxic substances e g heavy metals that are often beyond the processing capacity of the downstream wwtps this therefore can result in functional failures of wwtps and consequently significant contamination of the receiving water body mccall et al 2016 in addition to issues of deposits and illicit discharges leaks of the sewers groundwater infiltration and illicit connections between fsss and stormwater pipes are frequently reported inducing serious contamination to the surrounding water environments lepot et al 2017 beheshti and saegrov 2019 the issues mentioned above have appreciably affected the urban water environments due to the resultant overflows from csos manholes and leaks of fsss one way to address these issues is the placement of sensors within the fss to monitor the water depths and sewer flows thereby triggeringa warning when the observations are significantly higher or lower than the historical data ahm et al 2016 however due to the high purchase cost and intensive maintenance efforts associated with these sensors the monitoring network is often sparse for the majority of the fsss kleidorfer et al 2012 consequently a warning associated with the potential issues e g overflows or leaks can be only available for the very limited number of fss locations in the proximity of sensors in addition the abnormal observations at the monitoring locations may be caused by sudden discharges increases caused by the water users rather than the illicit discharges resulting in a potentially high likelihood of false warning koch et al 2011 more importantly relying solely on the observations from the sewer sensors cannot offer predictions on the hydraulic status of the entire fss in future bruen and yang 2006 to this end real time sewer hydraulic modelling can be promising in addressing the issues associated with the fsss as mentioned above where the hydraulic variables such as water depths and sewer flows across the entire fss are simulated in real time these simulations combined with observations at the monitoring locations can be used to deduce whether leaks illicit discharges deposits and illicit connections exist in the fss as well as facilitate the localization of such events manhole inflow data i e sewer discharges of the water users at a high time resolution say every 30 minutes is the key to enable the development of a real time fss hydraulic model however discharge data of such a high temporal and spatial resolution are typically unavailable in engineering practice resulting in a large challenge for real time modeling of fss breinholt et al 2013 to deal with this problem a widely used approach is to calibrate a model to estimate manhole inflows with the aid of limited in sewer observations korving and clemens 2005 while some calibration methods are available in the literature e g di pierro et al 2005 khu et al 2006 broekhuizen et al 2020 they mainly focus on calibrating the underlying rainfall runoff relationship for the combined sewer systems in an off line manner thereby predicting the floods or sewer overflows caused by rainfall these previously published methods therefore cannot be used or at least are difficult to estimate fss manhole inflows in real time the real time management of the fss has received great attention over the past few decades with the main focus on system real time control based on observations schütze et al 2002 sara et al 2020 more specifically real time control is defined as a timely operation of an fss based on continuously monitored process data those data are water levels and sewer flows in the system with operations including the activation of pumps sluice gates and weirs used to improve system performance e g reduce the overflows schütze et al 2003 however these real time control studies operated the hydraulic facilities e g pumps with the aid of system observations rather than fss simulations and hence they differ significantly from the real time fss hydraulic modelling which is the aim of the present study the main difficulty associated with the calibration of fss manhole inflows based on the limited number of monitoring sites is the equifinality khu et al 2006 more specifically a large number of manhole inflow combinations can produce similar agreements between simulated and observed water levels at monitoring locations as a result it is very difficult if not impossible to identify a particular parameter set i e manhole inflow combination that can represent the true underlying spatial distribution of the discharges from water users into the fss to address the equifinality issue this paper proposes a new method to enable the development of real time fss hydraulic model within the proposed method the fss model is integrated with its corresponding water distribution system wds hydraulic model for the same area being considered such a model integration approach is possible as the wds models have already been widely used walski et al 2003 in addition the number of sensors e g smart demand meters pressure sensors and flow meters deployed in the wdss can be large which is at least partly driven by the quick developments of the internet of things in recent years zheng et al 2018 such a dense sensor network can greatly facilitate the estimation of real time nodal water consumption for the wds models as demonstrated in previous studies creaco et al 2019 this is especially the case in recent years as smart demand meters have been increasingly used in many wdss providing water consumption data for many users not only large users but also residential users in a real time manner typically every 15 or 30 minutes creaco et al 2018 such near real time and high density spatial water consumption data can be assimilated with the limited in sewer observations to develop a real time fss hydraulic model this is the key feature and novelty of the method presented in this paper the concept of incorporating water consumption data into fss modeling can be dated back to bruke et al 1986 where an fss model was calibrated using monthly water use records more recently bailey et al 2019 presented a new fss model where the stochastically simulated water demands were imported into the sewer networkmodel while these limited previous studies have made great contributions in assimilating water use records into fss modelling mainly used for fss design purpose the water consumption data used are either collected manually at a very low time resolution e g monthly bruke et al 1986 or provided by a stochastic simulator bailey et al 2019 consequently these data cannot represent the true underlying temporal and spatial variations of the manhole inflows therefore they cannot be used to develop real time fss models which is the focus of this study the key feature of the proposed method is that the real time fss model is developed using a large number of existing sensors within the wdss this implies that it is not necessary to deploy a large number of sewer sensors which is often very expensive in terms of both sensor purchases and maintenance to enable real time sewer modelling making the proposed method attractive for practical applications this paper is organized as follows the proposed methodology is described in section 2 followed by the descriptions of the case studies considered in section 3 results and discussions are given in section 4 finally the conclusion section section 5 shows the main observations and implications of this paper 2 methodology 2 1 the overall modelling concept fig 1 illustrates the overall concept of the proposed method where a foul sewer system fss and a water distribution system wds for a small area are presented typically raw water from reservoirs or rivesis pumped into the water treatment plants in order to improve water quality to a required standard wu et al 2011 subsequently the treated water isconveyed to the wds satisfying demands for various users including residents schools hospitals industrial and commercial buildings as shown in fig 1 to ensure water supply safety sensors are often deployed in the wds fig 1 including pressure sensors flow meters and smart demand meters the latter have been increasingly being deployed in recent years to monitor water consumptions for the users in a near real time manner creaco et al 2018 consequently such a dense sensor network enables the development of real time wds modelling which has been an important trend within the water supply domain both research and industry due to its great merits in facilitating effective system management as highlighted in creaco et al 2019 inherently local residents or commercial industrial users discharge sewage after water consumption as illustrated in fig 1 sewer pipes collect and convey the sewage to downstream wastewater treatment plants with a limited number of water depth or sewer flow sensors installed to monitor hydraulic state of the system consequently the following equation can be used to represent the underlying relationship between water consumption and sewage discharge for user i 1 d i f q i k i t i where d i is the sewer discharge rate of user i i e manhole inflow rate resulting from its water consumption q i taken from the wds t i represents the time delay i e the time between the clean water entering the user property and the time it reaches the local sewer network k i is the transfer factor for user i representing the proportion of supplied water that ends up in the local sewer network k i typically has a value between 0 7 and 1 0 behzadian and kapelan 2015 equation 1 represents the fundamentalrule assumption in the proposed method used tobuild the connections between the wds water consumption data and the fss manhole inflows fig 2 presents the overall methodology of the proposed method with two modules involved the first module consists of three phases which are carried only once in an offline manner and the second module involves only the fourth phase phase 4 of the proposed method which runs in real time the details are given below phase 1 integrate the wds and fss models carry out once within this phase the fss and wds models are developed withhydraulic facility information e g water supply pipes tanks sewer pipes taken from external sources such as the gis or asset management system this is followed by the building of the connections between each wds demand node and the fss manhole based on the spatial distance with details given in section 2 2 phase 2 calibrate nodal water consumptions of the wds it should be highlighted that the calibration of thenodal water consumptions in phase 2 is conducted offline which is used to provide data for phase 3 more specifically based on a particular time period of historical data from pressures sensors flow meters and smart demand meters deployed in the wds the nodal water consumption without smart demand meters are estimated for a given time resolution often equals the time resolution of the flow or pressure sensors with details given in section 2 3 phase 3 estimate the transfer factor k for each manhole of the fss according to the identified relationship between wds nodes and the fss manholes in phase 1 as well as the calibrated nodal water consumptions in phase 2 the transfer factor k is determined for this an evolutionary algorithm ea is applied with the objective function defined in eqs 9 13 and using sewer observations with details given in section 2 4 phase 4 model the fss in a real time manner data from pressure sensors flow meters and the available smart demand meters in the wds are acquired at current time t these data are used as the inputs for the real time wds modelling to estimate water consumption for each node qi within the wds section 2 3 eq 1 is subsequently used to update the manhole inflows di based on the known qi and identified k values phase 3 finally the fss is modelled by updating manhole inflows di in real time this offers short term hydraulic predictions water depths at manholes and flow rates in sewer pipes of the entire fss with a particular time resolution if say every 30 minutes used in this paper it is noted that a few assumptions are made in the proposed method with the justification given below i given that the proposed fss real time modelling method is driven by water consumption data from the wds the number of available smart demand meters in the wds is important to ensure the high accuracy of the fss simulations for the two case studies considered in this paper the number of smart demand meters is reasonably high making them perfectly suited for the demonstration of the proposed method however some wdss may have relatively low coverage of the smart demand meters e g only installed for large demand users while such a case would not affect the application of the proposed method the accuracy of the wds nodal water consumption values and the fss real time simulations can be affected however it is anticipated that smart demand meters areincreasingly used by water utilities as a result of the quick developments in the internet of things zheng et al 2018 creaco et al 2019 and hence the applicability of the proposed method is only going to grow ii the proposed method assumes that observations from the wds and fss sensors including smart demand meters are accurate within the applications in this study however in reality observation errors can exist due to the sensor malfunctions or signal transmission issues therefore it is necessary to incorporate the potential observation errors into the modelling framework although that is an important study direction it is beyond the scope of the paperand will be the focus of future work iii as shown in eq 1 the time t i implies that the nodal water consumption q i estimated at time t using the smart demand meter or the real time calibration method section 2 3 should correspond to the manhole inflow at time t t i the value of t i can be dependent on the particular user properties including the characteristics of the water supply area associated with the demand node as well as the physical characteristics e g length and slopes of the connecting sewer pipes between users and the corresponding manholes in this study t i is ignored as this value is typically small ranging from several minutes up to 15 minutes for many cases wu et al 2011 this assumption is considered valid in our study as the time resolution used for real time fss modelling in this paper is lower i e 30 minutes iv in this study a linear transfer function with a constant factor of k is proposed to describe the underlying relationship between nodal water consumption and manhole inflows while being simple in practical implementation the transfer function and the k factor can be affected by not only the time delay t i in eq 1 but also the infiltration inflows and the properties of water users more specifically the transfer function may be different between the water users with or without smart demand meters and the k factor may vary temporally or even vary as a function of change in the type of water users these influences need further consideration in future study along this research line 2 2 integrate the fss and wds models typically fss and wds models are developed with the aid of the geographic information system gis or the asset management system for the analyzed area behzadian and kapelan 2015 huang et al 2018 the details e g locations and length of various system components including pipes tanks valves and pumps can be taken from the gis this is often followed by system skeletonization in which many facilities mainly small pipes are removed or simplified without significantly affecting the hydraulic properties of the original full system huang et al 2020 to enable the practical application of eq 1 it is important to build the connection between each demand node i representing the water consumption in the wds model and the manhole representing the facility to collect the sewages in the fss model such a connection indicates that the consumptionat the demand node iis received by its associated manhole to this end the wds and fss models are integrated within their development processes in this study fig 3 illustrates the proposed integration method where a water demand node in the wds model is assigned to the manhole of the fss model within a shortest distance from each other the rationale behind this is that manholes are often built near the water users nodes in the wds model to collect their sewerage discharges consequently two cases are available as shown in fig 3 which are i one demand node is assigned to a manhole and ii multiple demand nodes are assigned to a single manhole in addition to these two relatively simple cases in practice one demand node can be associated with multiple manholes which is possible when this demand node represents many users however it is difficult to determine the proportion of the total discharge associated with each relevant manhole for the sake of simplicity a single manhole with the minimum spatial distance to this demand node is selected to deliver the total discharge while such a simplification can cause an unrealistic hydraulic status in a very small area relative to the original full system its impact on the overall results can be negligible since each demand node say node i in the wds is assigned to a particular manhole in the fss model the water consumptionof this node q i is considered as the approximate manhole inflows d i their underlying flow relationship needs to be further accurately determined with the incorporation of the transfer factor k i as shown in eq 1 it is noted that when a higher level of accuracy is neededfor a practical application individual water consumption and sewer connections could be identified if required this will lead to a slight modification on the wds and fss model topologies which can better reflect the flows of supplied drinking water and generated wastewater by different users 2 3 calibrate nodal water consumption based on historical observations based on the built connections between each wds node and its corresponding fss manhole as described in section 2 2 nodal water consumption is the driver for triggering the real time fss modelling in the wdss many smart demand meters can be available providing near real time water consumption data if say every 15 minutes or 30 minutes for wds nodes users especially for water users with large demand however in practice it may not be necessary to have smart meters installed at each demand node and hence this study adopts a calibration method to enable the estimation of water consumption at the nodes without smart demand meters in this study the numerical approach described in zhang et al 2018 is selected to calibrate the nodal water consumptions due to its demonstrated efficiency the objective function of this adopted numerical method is formulated as the weighted sum of squared differences between the field observed and model simulated responses pressuresand flows at monitoring points in the wds within a particular time period i e the time resolution of the monitoring data i e as follows 2 min f q i 1 n h w h i h i o h i q 2 j 1 n f w q j q j o q j q 2 h o h q q o q q t w h o h q q o q q where q is the vector of nodal water consumptionsin the wds including known water consumption data at nodes with smart demand meters and unknown nodal water consumption data n h and n f are the numbers of observed nodal pressures and pipe flows respectively w h i and w q j are the weighting factorsfor observed pressuresat the i t h node and observed flows at the j t h pipe respectively where w h i 1 h i o 2 and w q j 1 q j o 2 are used in this study following kun et al 2015 and zhang et al 2018 h i o and h i q are the observed and simulated pressures at the i t h node respectively q j o and q j q are the observed and simulated flowsat the j t h piperespectively eq 2 can be expressed in the matrix form see above by using h o h 1 o h 2 o h n h o t q o q 1 o q 2 o q n f o t h q h 1 q h 2 q h n h

where δ h h o h q and δ q q o q q are the differences between the observed and simulated values of nodal pressures and pipe flows respectively j h h q q and j q q q q are the jacobian matrix with details given in zhang et al 2018 since eq 2 is a convex function kun et al 2015 the minimum objective value of eq 2 can be obtained when its first order derivative eq 3 equals to zero that is 4 d f q δ q d δ q 2 j h j q t w δ h j h δ q δ q j q δ q 0 by solving eq 4 δ q can be obtained as follows 5 δ q j h j q t w j h j q 1 j h j q t w δ h δ q 6 q s 1 q s δ q s where s 0 1 s is the iteration number s is the maximum allowed number of iterations it is highlighted that the water consumption at nodes with smart demand meters are known within the entire calibration process and hence δ q is only considered for the nodes without smart meters to ensure the estimated nodal water consumption valuesare practically meaningful the domain knowledge has been incorporated within the calibration process in this study as shown below wu et al 2010 7 q i s 1 q i min if q i s 1 q i min q i max if q i s 1 q i max q i s 1 others where q i min 1 p q i i n i t i a l and q i max 1 p q i i n i t i a l are the minimum and maximum allowed water consumptions at node i respectively p is the percentage generally within 10 20 in practice zhang et al 2018 q i i n i t i a l is estimated using 8 q i init ial l i l t l m q t q m where l i is the length of the pipe associated with node i l t and l m is the total pipe length of all nodes and the length of pipes associated with smart demand meters respectively q t is the total water consumption of the wds over a given time period e g 30 minutes which is estimated based on the flow meters installed at the outlet of the water treatment plants and volume changes in the tanks if available q m is the sum of the water consumption values measured by the available smart demand meters within the wds over a given time period the calibration process at each time period i e the time resolution of the monitoring data e g 30 minutes is executed by iteratively updating δ q in eq 6 until the maximum value of vector δ q is smaller than a given threshold value ε e g ε 0 1 the entire calibration process is executed again once the monitoring data from sensors are updated representing a real time hydraulic calibration for the wds it is noted that the pipe resistance coefficients are not calibrated in a real time manner as these values are not likelyto changeover a short time period kun et al 2016 2 4 estimate the transfer factor k for each fss manhole as stated in eq 1 the nodal consumption data determined in section 2 3 q i cannot be directly taken as the manhole inflows d i due to the inevitable loss during the transporting process within the facilities of the users behzadian and kapelan 2015 in this study a transfer factor k i is used to represent the proportion of water consumption used by node i that has been collected by its corresponding manhole such a factor can vary as a function of the properties of the water users such as user types commercial users or common resident users and habits of water usages bailey et al 2019 therefore the transfer factor needs to be calibrated for each demand node based on the nodal water consumption data and the sewer observations e g sewer flow rates or water depth in the manholes in the fss in this study the transfer factor k i associated with each demand node is considered to be approximately constant over time because the user properties are overall constant over a short time period bailey et al 2019 to calibrate the transfer factor k k 1 k 2 k n t of the entire fss with a total of n manholes with external inflows the following objective function is defined 9 min f k t t w t i 1 m g h i o

numbers of observed water depths at the manholes and flow rates in the sewer pipes respectively h i o t and f j o t are observed water depth at manhole iand observed flow rate at sewer pipe j at time

entire time period of t d t is a t n matrix representing the inflows of all manholes across the total time period of t the values of h i s and f i s are computed using f s d t as shown in eq 11 in this study a simulation package called storm water management model swmm rossman 2010 is employed to calculate h i s and f i s in eq 12 d i t is the inflow rate of manhole i at time t and q i t is the water consumption of node i at time t determined by real time wds modelling as described in section 2 3 k i min and k i max are the minimum and maximum allowable values of k i which can be determined by engineering experience in this study the value of k i min 0 7 is used for all wds demand nodes regardless of whether these are metered or not the value of k i max 1 0 is used for wds nodes with smart demand meters and k i max 1 3 is used for wds nodes without smart meters this is because water consumptions of nodes without smart meters are calibrated using the method described in section 2 3 and hence the identified values can to a certain extentdeviate from the true water consumption values to mitigate thispotential impact the maximum value of the transfer factor for these nodes is increased to 1 3 in this paper an evolutionary algorithm ea zheng et al 2017 combined with the swmm modelling software is employed to solve the optimization problem defined in eqs 9 13 while different eas are available in the literature borg hadkaand reed 2013 methodis used in this study due to its well demonstrated performance in dealing with complex water resources optimization problems additional algorithm details are given in section 3 2 in the proposed fss calibration method manhole inflows are considered as the only calibration parameters due to their large temporal and spatial variations with which the transfer factor k for each manhole can be estimated it should be noted that manning s roughness coefficients of the sewer pipes can also affect the hydraulics of the fss however previous studies have shown that the impacts of the small to moderate variation in manning s roughness coefficients of sewer pipes are limited rossman and huber 2017 in addition the physical pipe properties e g pipe ages and materials that affect the manning s roughness coefficient are unlikely to vary in a short time period zhang et al 2018 and hence it is not considered within the real time fss modelling it is highlighted that the values of k k 1 k 2 k n t are calibrated using a particular time period of historical water consumption data and in sewer observations in an offline manner carried out once as shown in fig 2 2 5 model the fss in real time it is noted that phases 1 3 in sections 2 2 2 4 are carried offline in the offline module as shown in fig 2 aimed to identify the transfer factors between the wds nodal water consumptions and the fss manhole inflows this is followed by the real time fss modelling real time module of the proposed method in fig 2 with the following steps step 1 collect the data from pressure sensors flow meters and the available smart demand meters in the wds at current time t step 2 estimate the water consumption for each wds node without smart demand meters qi t in eq 1 using the method described in section 2 3 phase 2 based on the observations from step 1 step 3 update the manhole inflow di t based on qi t and the identified transfer factor k in phase 3 of the offline module using eq 1 step 4 run the fss hydraulic model based on the manhole inflow di t producing the water depths and sewer flows for the entire fss within the time resolutions 30 minutes in this study this is followed by moving to step 1 at t t δ t where δ t is the time resolution of the fss modelling δ t 30 minutes in this study 2 6 metrics used for performance evaluation five statistical metrics are used in this paper to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in simulating the fss hydraulic variables they are the absolute percentage error ape the mean absolute percentage error mape the coefficient of determination r 2 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse and the kling gupta efficiency kge these five metrics are selected due to their wide applications in assessing the model performance within the water resources domain mu et al 2020 the ape between the i t h observation y i and its corresponding simulation y i is defined as 14 a p e y i y i y i 100 15 m a p e 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i 100 where n is thetotal number of data points as shown in eqs 14 and 15 a lower value of ape or mape indicate an overall better model performance the r 2 is a goodness of fit measure for linear regression models which can be mathematically described as gujarati et al 2009 16 r 2 i 1 n y i y y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y represents the mean of the observations and y is the mean of the simulations a large value of r 2 represents a better model performance the nseis defined as follows nash and sutcliffe 1970 with a larger value implying a better model performance 17 n s e 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 the kge metric is mathematically described as follows knoben et al 2019 18 k g e 1 r 1 2 σ s i m σ o b s 1 2 μ s i m μ o b s 1 2 where r is the linear correlation between observations and simulations σ s i m and σ o b s are the standard deviation in simulations and observations respectively μ s i m and μ o b s are the mean of simulations and observations respectively a large value of kge means that the simulations can match observations better with kge 1 representing the best model performance 3 case studies 3 1 case study description two real world fsss in china the benk network bkn and the xiuzhou network xzn are selected as case studies to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method these two fsss are selected as their associated wdss have good coverage of monitoring sensors especially the smart demand meters in addition bkn and xzn respectively represent scales of a relatively small region and atown aimed to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method in handling the fsss with differentcomplexity levels bkn consists of one outlet 64 manholes and 64 sewer pipes fig 4 delivering the wastewater for the users with water supplied by a wds referred to as wds bnk wds bnk is composed of one reservoir 65 nodes and 93 pipes as well as one flow meter three pressure sensors and 40 smart water demand meters fig 4 providing approximately 4 800 m3 of water per day as shown in fig 4 one in sewer flow meter and three water depth sensors with a 30 minute time resolution have been installed in bkn with an average discharge of about 4 100 m3 day the dotted arrow lines in fig 4 represent the receiving manhole for each demand node determined based on the spatial distances observations from the wds bnk and bnk sensors are recorded for consecutive 31 days without rainfall or snowfall events in winter with a 30 minute time resolution the xzn system is a large scale complex fss in jiaxing city with a total length of approximately 86 km and an average discharge of about 21 500 m3 day the layout of the xzn network is shown in fig 5 consisting of one outlet 1 214 manholes and 1 214 sewer pipes as shown in fig 5 three flow meters and eight water depth sensors have been installed in this fss the wds that supplies water demands for this area refereed as wds xzn has one reservoir one pump station 1 119 nodes and 1 137 water consumption pipes as shown in fig 6 in the wds xzn network five flow meters eight pressure sensors and 525 smart demand meters are deployed as illustrated in fig 6 the wds xzn networksupplies approximately 23 150 m3 per day for a population about 107 500 living in this area within the jiaxing city as the same for the bkn network the data from the wds xzn and xzn sensors are recorded for consecutive 31 days without rainfall or snowfall events in winter with a 30 minute time resolution 3 2 implementation of the proposed method the epanet2 0 and swmm5 1 rossman 2000 2010 were used as wds and fss hydraulic simulation model respectively in this study for both case studies historical data of the first 17 consecutive days from wds sensors with a 30 minute time resolution were used to estimate the water consumptions of nodes without smart meters this led to a total of 816 17 24 2 time periods with nodal water consumptionsto be calibrated for each wds these estimated nodal water consumption data were subsequently used to identify the transfer factors kof the fss based on sewer observations at the first 17 days the wds and fss sewer observations of the remaining 14 days 14 24 2 data points used for model validation were used to run the real time fss models with a 30 minute time resolution in other words the first set of wds observations at the validation period the last 14 days was considered as the observations at time t in the real time module of fig 2 δ t 30 minutes followed by the execution of the four steps in section 2 5 for the nodal water consumption calibration the termination error was set as max δ q 0 1 eq 6 the maximum allowed iterations was s 100 eq 6 and the adjustment range of nodal water consumptions was p 20 for each wds eq 7 for the wds bnk fig 4 observations of the first 17 days from two pressure sensors h1 and h3 and the flow meter f1 were used for calibration and the records of pressure sensor h2 were used for validation for the wds xzn fig 6 observations of the first 17 days from h1 h3 h4 h6 and h8 pressure sensors as well as f2 f3 f4 and f5 flow meters were utilized for model calibration and the records of h2 h5 h7 and f1 were used for validation the first three days were considered as the warming up time period for the fss model setting up as stated in eq 9 i e tw 3 days the observations of the next 14 days were used for fss model calibration and the remaining observations of 14 days were utilized for validating the performance of the real time fss models the linear scale function g in eq 9 for each case study is defined as 17 g x x x min x max x min where x represents the observed or simulated values at monitoring points x min and x max are the lower and upper bounds respectively these two parameters for each monitoring point are determined by analyzing historical observation data over 14 days i e the calibration time period in this paper the evolutionary algorithm borg hadkaand reed 2013 was selected to solve the proposed calibration problem defined in eqs 9 13 due to its great performance in handling complex urban water resources and engineering optimization problems reed et al 2013 zheng et al 2016 the initial population size of borg applied to bkn and xzn case studieswere 500 and 1 000 respectively and the maximum allowable iterations are 50 000 for both case studies the default values of the other parameters of borg were used in this study as they have been validated throughvarious applications wang et al 2014 five borg runs with different random number seeds were applied to each case study and the results showed that the final optimization results were overall similar across different runs therefore the results of a typical borg run were presented to enable discussions for each of the two fss case studies 4 results and discussions 4 1 calibration results of wds nodal water consumptions for each fss case study nodal water consumptions of its associated wds need to be calibrated at each time period resulting in a total of 816 calibration runs using the calibration method as described in section 2 3 the resultant time consumption was approximately 25 seconds and 10 minutes for wds bkn and wds xzn systems respectively on a pc with a 2 60 ghz intel core i9 7980xe and 2 gb of ram fig 7 shows the density plot of the errors between observations and simulations at the monitoring locations for both case studies it is seen that for the wds bkn case more than 90 of the absolute errors aes is less than 0 30m for each pressure monitoring point including the h2 sensor used for model validation with the maximum ae being 0 32m across the three pressure monitoring points in terms of flow more about 93 of absolute percentage errors apes are smaller than 1 5 with the maximum ape being 2 40 as shown in fig 7 a b for the wds xzn fig 7 c d the differences between the simulated and observed pressurevalues at the eight monitoring locations are negligible including h2 h5 and h7 used for validation with all aesbeing lower than 0 4m relative to pressure the deviations between the flow simulations and observations are slightly larger fig 7 d with the majority of apes smaller than 5 and the maximum ape being 9 8 f1 used for validation to further demonstrate the quality of calibration results the criteria defined in walski et al 2003 were used to verify the simulation accuracies as stated in walski et al 2003 a satisfactory wds model calibration should ensure 85 of pressureerrors within 0 2m 100 of pressure errors within 0 5 m trunk main flow errors flows more than 10 of the total demands within 5 and the other flow errors within 10 the calibration results of the two wdss satisfied these criteria implying that the calibration was successful as the resultant nodal water consumptions can reproduce the overall hydraulics of the wds fig 8 presents the nodal water consumptions over the 31 days with a resolution of 30 minute for the two wdss a for the wds bkn and b for wds xzn where the grey solid lines represent the calibrated nodal water consumptions and the orange dotted lines indicate the nodal water consumptions measured by smart demand meters despite some variations all the nodal water consumptions exhibited an overall similar trend for both wdss with two peak demand periods occurring at each demand node as shown in fig 8 which matches well with the typical water use properties zhang et al 2018 4 2 estimated transfer factor values fig 9 shows the distribution of the probability density of the identified transfer factor k values for all manholes of the bkn and xzn based on the historical data over the first 17 calibration days observations of the first three days were used as model setting up such an optimization section 2 4 took 4 86 and 56 hours respectively based on the same computing platform as mentioned above it can be seen that the majority of k values is within the range of 0 7 1 0 for the bkn and xzn with a mean value of 0 83 and 0 92 respectively meaning that around 83 and 92 of the total water consumptions have been collected by the fss of bkn and xzn in this area respectively this demonstrates that the calibrated k values for all manholes were overall practically meaningful behzadian and kapelan 2015 it is noted that around 10 and 28 calibrated k values were greater than 1 as shown in fig 9 such values were only allowed for the wds nodes without smart demand sensors and hence their nodal water consumptions were estimated using the calibration method described in section 2 3 while fig 7 showed that the calibration results can reproduce the overall hydraulics of the wds at the monitoring locations the calibrated nodal water consumptions might inevitably deviate from the true values at a certain extent zhang et al 2018 to mitigate this potential impact the value of k for the fss manholes associated with wds nodes without smart demand meters was allowed to have a range between 0 7 and 1 3 as previously stated this led to that a proportion of k values were greater than 1 as shown in fig 9 fig 10 shows the fss calibrated results the first17 days corresponding to the transfer factor values presented in fig 9 it is seen that the simulated flows in c1 in the small bkn case study matched well with the observations fig 10 a where all ape values were lower than 5 0 and the mean ape value was 1 16 for the xzn case study fig 10 e the maximum and the mean ape values between simulations and observations within the calibration period at the c3 monitoring location were 13 68 and 3 02 respectively therefore it can be deduced that the simulations matched well with the observations for such a large xzn case study while the ape values during the period with relatively low sewer flows were proportionally large their corresponding absolute errors aes were low overall as shown in fig 10 c f for example the maximum aevalue was 1 88 l s for the bkn case study with an average flow of 48 47 l s in c1 fig 10 c the averageae value was 9 58 l s for the xzn case study with an average flow of 255 10 l s in c3 fig 10 f tables 1 and 2 present the values of the performance metrics applied to the simulations and observations at monitoring locations for both case studies as shown in this table for the bkn case study the averaged values of mape r2 nse and kge over four different monitoring locations within the calibration period are 3 61 0 99 0 94 and 0 94 respectively for the large xzn case study the averaged values of mape r2 nse and kge over 11 different monitoring locations within the calibration period are 4 98 0 98 0 89 and 0 93 respectively this implied that fss calibration aimed to estimate the transfer factor was overall successful 4 3 performance of the real time fss modelling results in the calibration period demonstrated that the proposed method was capable of identifying suitable transfer factors that can match well simulations and observations at the monitoring locations this section validated the performance of the real time fss models driven by the wds consumption data in modelling the sewer hydraulics and such a performance evaluation was conducted using the observations from the 17th to the 31st days i e validation period the steps of the real time fss modelling were presented in fig 2 real time module figs 11 and 12 show the observations versus observations of the monitoring locations every 30 minutes within the validation period for both case studies it is seen from fig 11 that the sewer flow and the water depth simulations matched well with the observations within the validation period at the four monitoring locations c1 m1 m2 and m3 in the bkn case study more specifically the maximum flow apevalue was 4 91 and the maximum absolute error of water depth was 0 7cm across m1 m2 and m3 locations similarly the differences between the simulation and observations for c1 c2 m1 and m5 monitoring locations were also matched very well for the xzn case study as shown in fig 12 for this large fss the maximum flow ape value was 13 45 and the maximum absolute error of water depth was 1 4cm similar observations can be made for other monitoring locations the values of performance metrics applied to the observations and simulations within the validation period for both case studies are also presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively as shown in these two tables the averaged values of mape r2 nse and kge over four different monitoring locations within the validation period are 3 63 0 99 0 94 and 0 93 respectively for the bkn case study the averaged values of mape r2 nse and kge over four different monitoring locations within the validation period are 5 23 0 97 0 88 and 0 92 respectively for the xzn case study overall the performance of the fss models within the validation period was similar or slightly worse than the calibration period for both case studies see tables 1 and 2 this indicated that i there was a low likelihood of over fitting within the calibration process due to the similar performance between the calibration and validation period and ii the real time fss models driven by wds water consumption data were effective in accurately simulating the sewer hydraulics at a high time resolution every 30 minutes the real time model was able to offer a great opportunity to enable the comparison between the simulations and observations at monitoring locations at a very high time resolution every 30 minutes in this paper followed by a warning trigger if large deviations between the simulations and observations were observed more specifically a threshold can be determined by long term historical data for each monitoring location as did in qi et al 2018 if the deviations between the simulations and observations at a particular monitoring location go beyond the specified range a warning can be triggered efficiently it should be highlighted that since the real time fss model developed using the proposed method has already accounted for the inflow variation caused by the change in water consumption the false warning rate is expected to be significantly reduced therefore the proposed real time fss model can be a useful tool for the development of an efficient warning system aimed to detect the potential hydraulic issues e g leaks and illicit inflows for the fsss in addition to providing accurate simulations at the monitoring locations the proposed method was also able to produce real time simulations for the manholes and sewer pipes without monitoring sensors while the accuracies of these simulations cannot be directly evaluated due to the unavailability of observations it can be anticipated that they can reasonably represent the true hydraulics of the manholes and sewer pipes without monitoring sensors this was because the real time fss model was driven by the water consumption data from the water distribution system where nodal water consumptions were either measured by smart demand meters or estimated with the aid of an intensive sensor pressure and flow sensors coverage as shown in fig 13 water depths of 10 manholes near m5 sensor of the xzn case study over a typical day within the validation period exhibited a similar and reasonable trend these accurate hydraulic simulations at the manholes and pipes without monitoring sensors can be useful to enable the efficient localization of leaks deposits or illicit inflows through comparing the simulations with the sampled observations from the field survey 5 conclusion this paper proposes a novel method to develop a real time foul sewer system fss model driven by water consumption data from its associated water distribution system wds that often has a large number of sensors such as pressure sensors flow meters and smart demand meters within the proposed method the fss and the wds models are integrated to build physical connections between water consumption nodes and their corresponding manholes based on spatial distances this is followed by a proposal of an optimization approach to identify the transfer factor k between nodal water consumptions and fss manhole inflows according to historical observations subsequently real time nodal water consumption data are acquired using an efficient calibration approach based on the dense sensors in the wds finally these nodal water consumption data combined with the identified k values drive the fss real time modelling two real fss case studies the smaller bkn with 64 sewer pipes and 64 manholes and the large zxn case study with 1214 sewer pipes and 1214 manholes have been used to test validate and demonstrate the proposed method the results obtaineddemonstrate that the proposed method can produce real time predictionsof water depths and flows that are in good agreements with the corresponding observations at monitoring locations the evidence for this can be found in the high mean values of r2 nse and kge metrics obtained across different monitoring locations which are 0 99 0 94 and 0 93 of the small bnk case study and 0 97 0 88 and 0 92 for the large xzn case study respectively in addition to providing accurate simulations at the monitoring locations the proposed method is expected to produce reasonable real time simulations for the manholes and sewer pipes without monitoring sensors this deduction is based on that the real time fss model is driven by the wds water consumption data that are either measured by smart demand meters or estimated based on a large number of sensors pressure and flow sensors this implies that the equifinality problem can be successfully addressed by using the proposed method therefore the developed real time fss model offers an important tool to facilitate effective and efficient foul sewer system management and operation finally it is acknowledged that the proposed method is developed ignoring a number of uncertainties that exist in reality these include potential inaccuracies of wds and fss sensor measurements e g smart demand meters water depth sensors flow sensors the potential impacts of the ignorance of the water travelling time within the user property and the influence of the variation in manning s coefficients of the sewer pipes these uncertainties need to be more systematically

17443,humans and animals are frequently exposed to pfas per and polyfluoroalkyl substances through drinking water and food however no therapeutic sorbent strategies have been developed to mitigate this problem montmorillonites amended with the common nutrients carnitine and choline were characterized for their ability to bind 4 representative pfas pfoa pfos genx and pfbs adsorption desorption isothermal analysis showed that pfoa pfos and a mixture of the two fit the langmuir model with high binding capacity affinity and enthalpy at conditions simulating the stomach a low percentage of desorption occurred at conditions simulating the intestine the results suggested that hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding were responsible for sequestering pfas into clay interlayers molecular dynamics md simulations suggested the key mode of interaction of pfas was through fluorinated carbon chains and confirmed that pfoa and pfos had enhanced binding to amended clays compared to genx and pfbs the safety and efficacy of amended montmorillonite clays were confirmed in hydra vulgaris where a mixture of amended sorbents delivered the highest protection against a pfas

simulations 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have been extensively used in numerous consumer and industrial products such as firefighting foams stain preventives electronics clothing cookware and lubricants due to their high thermal stability and water dust and oil repellency us environmental protection agency epa 2017a however the high persistency bioaccumulation and widespread use of pfas have resulted in their ubiquitous distribution in the environment epa 2017a the cdc s national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes reported that detectable pfas concentrations were found at a frequency of 97 in 1682 blood samples from non institutionalized american civilian residents lewis et al 2015 among pfas pfoa perfluorooctanoic acid and pfos perfluorooctanesulfonic acid have been widely found in sediment sludge municipal wastewater coastal water and even tap water epa 2016 2017a because of their low pka values pfos and pfoa predominantly exist as anions in environmentally relevant scenarios itrc 2017 furthermore pfoa and pfos have been shown to co occur in a variety of drinking water sources epa 2016 2017a to decrease the use of the highly persistent and cumulative pfoa and pfos short chain pfas congeners including genx hexafluoropropylene oxide and pfbs perfluorobutane sulfonic acid were introduced as alternatives itrc 2017 however the hydrophobic chain and hydrophilic functional groups allow pfas residues to be easily transported in an aquatic environment and adsorbed onto the surfaces of environmental solid matrices shih and wang 2013 this problem can be exacerbated during disasters such as floods chemical spills and fires where chemicals such as pfas can be mobilized and redistributed in the environment further threatening the safety of drinking water and food supplies wang and phillips 2019 many studies have reported that the adsorption and purification of wastewater containing pfas can be economically feasible and effective zhang et al 2019 among conventional sorbents powdered activated carbon ac has been shown to have the highest adsorption ability and as early as 2005 the 3m company reported 99 removal of pfos using ac fujii et al 2007 however a major route for human and animal exposure to pfas is through the ingestion of pfas contaminated drinking water fish food packaged or processed with pfas containing materials and crops grown in contaminated soil or water atsdr 2019 crone et al 2019 epa 2017a b once pfas especially long chain pfas is consumed by animals and humans it is absorbed accumulated and can be biomagnified through the food chain causing adverse health effects such as cancer immune system dysfunction and liver damage atsdr 2018 however there are no reported strategies that can reduce unintended exposures through consumption of pfas and pfas mixtures in contaminated drinking water and foods it was reported that minerals played important roles in the pfas sorption process in groundwater systems the fate and transport of pfas have a strong dependence on interactions with surrounding mineral surfaces higgins and luthy 2006 montmorillonite is a common form of hydrated aluminum oxide that usually exists as fine grained constituents in soils and sediments importantly calcium montmorillonite has been shown to be safe for the consumption of humans and animals based on multiple clinical trials and animal intervention studies phillips et al 2019 to further enhance the lipophilicity of the clay surfaces montmorillonite clay was amended with l carnitine mont carnitine or choline mont choline which are natural nutrients that are commonly included in dietary supplements mont carnitine and mont choline have been previously shown to adsorb lipophilic chemicals such as aflatoxin benzo a pyrene plasticizers and pesticides cruz guzman et al 2004 orr et al 2020 wang et al 2017 2019 thus they were tested in this study for the adsorption of important pfas chemicals and common mixtures the mechanism of this strategy involves the ingestion of sorbent and the adsorption of pfas by the sorbent in the stomach and intestines resulting in reduced pfas bioavailability the overall objective of this study was to investigate the binding of 4 common pfas to the active surfaces of carnitine and choline amended montmorillonite clays versus the parent clay

system woodridge il usa 2 2 determination of phpzc the ph of point of zero charge phpzc was measured in this study since it has been previously reported to closely affect the binding affinity of pfoa and pfos zhi and liu 2016 as previously described by park et al 2020 100 mg of sorbents were added into 20 ml 0 1 m nacl solutions with different initial ph values ranging from 2 to 11 adjusted with 0 5 n hcl or naoh solutions before making the solution distilled and deionized water was boiled to remove dissolved co2 sealed vials were shaken for 48 hr at 200 rpm at room temperature subsequently the final ph of the supernatant of the solution was measured when sorbents were completely settled if the ph of the nacl solution did not change after contact with sorbent that ph was selected as phpzc of the sorbent 2 3 chemical analysis pfas was analyzed using a waters acquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer lc ms ms equipped with triple quadrupole liang and chang 2019 roberts et al 2017 an acquity beh c18 column 2 1 50 mm 1 7 μm was used for separation and kept at 40 c in the column oven a gradient elution using 20 mm ammonium acetate eluent a and acetonitrile eluent b was carried out at a flow rate of 0 6 ml min the gradient program for elution was 10 eluent b initial 10 55 0 to 0 1 min 55 99 0 1 to 4 5 min 99 4 5 to 5 min and 99 10 5 to 6 5 min the injection volume was 10 μl for each analysis the mass spectrometer was used with an electrospray ionization interface esi and operated in a negative ion mode the spray voltage was maintained at 4 5 kv the source temperature was kept at 450 c the monitored precursor and product ions m z for pfoa pfos genx and pfbs were 413 to 369 499 to 80 285 to 168 9 and 298 9 to 80 respectively the cone voltage kv for pfoa pfos genx and pfbs was 25 40 20 and 35 respectively the mass spectrometer was operated under multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode nitrogen gas was used as the collision and curtain gas and argon gas was used as the nebulizer and heater gas empower analyst software was used to control the lc ms ms system and acquire the data 2 4 adsorption isotherms pfas solutions including pfoa pfos genx and pfbs at a concentration of 5 ppm µg ml were individually prepared from pure crystals in ph 2 distilled water which is the average stomach ph the concentrations were set based on previous literature zhi and liu 2016 screening results and the optimal ratio of sorbent pfas to achieve equilibrium saturation on isotherm plots each sorbent at 0 0005 was then added to a concentration gradient from 5 to 100 of 5 ml of pfas solution controls included 5 ml of blank solution ph 2 water pfas solution and sorbent suspension all samples were vibrated at 1000 rpm and 37 c or 24 c using an ika electric shaker vibrax vxr basic werke germany for 2 hr as 2 hr is the average digestion time in a human stomach the sorbent pfas complex was then separated from solution by centrifugation at 2000 g for 20 min and the supernatant was analyzed by lc ms ms 2 5 desorption isotherms the desorption of pfas from the surface of sorbents was tested in a simulated intestine model at the end of adsorption experiments pfas loaded sorbents were separated from the aqueous solutions and rinsed once with ph 7 water to washout unbound pfas and traces of acid the tubes were then filled with 5 ml of ph 7 water solution and shaken at 200 rpm and 37 c for 48 hr on a rocking platform vmr pa usa the 48 hr equilibration time was chosen based on the maximum duration of digestion in human intestines then the suspensions were centrifuged at 2000 g for 20 min and an aliquot of supernatant was extracted for analysis desorbed pfas concentrations were detected at the end of the desorption experiment and the amount of pfas that remained bound on sorbents was determined as the difference between the initial adsorbed and the desorbed amount for both adsorption and desorption the dry weight of sorbents before and after the experiments were determined for selected concentrations and no significant change was observed the potential variability in the amount of pfas adsorbed and desorbed to clay surfaces based on isothermal data calculations was less than 4 relative standard deviation 2 6 data calculations and curve fitting pfas detected by lc ms ms was calculated to determine the free pfas concentrations in solution in the adsorption study the quantity of bound pfas was calculated by the concentration difference between control and test groups and expressed as mol kg on the isotherm plots the amount of pfas that remained bound in the desorption study was derived from the difference between the initial amount bound in the adsorption and the dissociation in the solution table curve 2d was used to plot these data and derive values for the variable parameters the adsorption and desorption isotherms were plotted by well established langmuir or freundlich models based on the equation that fit the data with highest correlation coefficients and randomness of the residuals from triplicate analyses grant and phillips 1998 the langmuir isotherm describes monolayer

investigated through quintet 50 ns md simulations and subsequent structural analysis using in house fortran programs analogous to our previous studies wang et al 2019a the deprotonated states of pfos and pfbs were investigated since their pka values can be as low as 3 which is significantly below the ph in the md simulations ph 2 while the deprotonated pfoa pfoa nh is the main form in the environment it is important to investigate both the deprotonated pfoa nh and protonated pfoa h congeners of pfoa since previous studies reported a wide range of possible pka values 0 5 3 8 burns et al 2008 steinle darling et al 2008 vierke et al 2013 additionally due to the pka values of genx 2 8 3 8 both protonated genx h and deprotonated genx nh forms were investigated the ratio of different protonation states between pfoa h and pfoa nh or genx h and genx nh was not considered which was beyond the scope of our investigation thus a total of 12 simulation systems were computationally investigated corresponding to each of the 6 pfas forms in the presence of the parent clay and mont carnitine independently in the structural analysis the propensity of pfas binding to clays was evaluated through 1 binding percentage calculations and 2 prominent binding modes determined based on which chemical groups of pfas as shown in figure s1 interact with the clays the md simulations and subsequent structural analysis are described in detail in the supporting information 2 8 hydra assay hydra vulgaris were obtained from environment canada montreal qc and maintained at 18 c using a hydra classification method the morphology of hydra was rated over time as an indicator of solution toxicity the morphological scoring of hydra was objective and repeatable dash et al 2012 hearon et al 2020 the hydra response was scored after exposure to pfas with and without sorbent inclusion the assay included closely monitoring mature and non budding hydra at 0 4 20 28 44 68 and 92 hr without changing solutions during testing hydra medium was included as a control pfas dose response groups consisted of pfoa pfos and a mixture of pfoa and pfos at a gradient of concentrations to determine the minimum effective doses that resulted in 100 mortality of hydra in 92 hr individual sorbents and a sorbent mixture of equal amounts of amended clays were added to the pfas solutions at 0 02 inclusion rate all solutions were mixed at 1000 rpm for 2 hr and centrifuged at 2000 g for 20 min prior to exposure of hydra in pyrex dishes three hydra colonies in each group were exposed to 4 ml of test medium at 18 c the average score for each group was used to determine the toxicity rating at each time point a two way t test was used to determine statistical significance each experiment was independently conducted in triplicate to derive means and standard deviations for the toxicity scores from the hydra assay these were then used to calculate the t value using a tukey test and p value results were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion clays have been used as ancient medicine for diarrhea cholera bacterial infections and mitigation of poisonings for centuries eating clay has been a global practice that exists among humans as well as numerous animal species in previous intervention studies and clinical trials in the us and africa calcium montmorillonite clay was shown to be safe for human and animal consumption however the clay had a preference for binding aflatoxins and certain hydrophilic chemicals phillips et al 2019 wang et al 2019 to enhance its ability to bind diverse environmental chemicals we amended the interlayer with l carnitine and choline to increase interlayer spacing figure s2 and hydrophobicity of the clay surfaces a 7 point standard curve for each pfas was constructed using concentrations ranging from the limit of detection lod to 10 ppm lod was determined to be 10 ppb with a signal to noise ratio equal to 3 the calibration solutions were prepared daily and verified before running test samples the linearity r2 in all cases was 1 r2 0 99 3 1 adsorption analyses adsorption isotherms were conducted using a simulated stomach model at ph 2 and 37 c for 2 hr to simulate the average duration of the digestion process in the stomach isothermal data reflecting the sorption of pfoa and pfos onto clay surfaces were plotted as a langmuir model based on their r2 values as shown in fig 1 a and 1b the adsorption plots of pfoa and pfos binding onto parent montmorillonites exhibited good fit to a langmuir model based on correlation coefficients and a curved shape suggesting the presence of monolayer binding and saturable active sites the binding of pfoa and pfos onto parent montmorillonite clay showed high capacities equal to 0 31 and 0 58 mol kg and high affinities equal to 5 37e5 and 1 81e5 respectively within md simulations the binding percentages of deprotonated pfoa nh and pfos onto parent clay were 20 3 and 18 2 respectively fig 2 this agrees with the higher affinity of pfoa versus pfos observed in the isothermal studies the higher binding propensity of pfoa h could be facilitated by hydrogen bonding to the clay interlayer fig s3 furthermore our isothermal results indicated that amendments of montmorillonite clay with carnitine and choline enhanced the binding capacity for pfoa to 0 43 and 0 34 mol kg compared to parent clay similarly pfos binding capacity was increased for mont carnitine qmax 0 73 mol kg and mont choline qmax 0 75 mol kg compared to parent montmorillonite fig 1a and 1b the improved binding of mont carnitine for pfoa both pfoa nh and pfoa h and pfos was also observed within md simulations where mont carnitine showed significantly higher binding percentages than the parent clay fig 2 this improvement of mont carnitine was more pronounced for protonated pfoa h than deprotonated pfoa nh presumably due to the neutral charge on pfoa h both pfoa and pfos were shown to bind to carnitine directly or bind to clay interlayer and carnitine simultaneously fig 2 this enhancement in pfoa and pfos binding from the addition of l carnitine and choline at acidic ph may involve the exchange of inorganic cations and an increase of the hydrophobicity at interlayer surfaces resulting in a reduction of polar charge and more hydrophobic surfaces that facilitate the binding of pfas to further investigate the hydrophobic interaction short chain pfas including genx and pfbs were tested by isothermal analysis contrary to the isothermal plots of pfoa and pfos the binding of genx and pfbs was best described by a freundlich partitioning model as suggested by the r2 and the plots in fig 1c and 1d this indicated heterogeneous binding sites the lack of a saturable specific site on the clay surfaces and a partitioning interaction according to the md simulations genx both genx h and genx nh and pfbs bind both in the interlayer and at basal surface sites on the clay supporting the heterogenous binding shown in the freundlich isotherms while the protonated genx genx h binds to the parent clay with a similar propensity as pfoa and pfos the deprotonated genx genx nh and pfbs bind with less propensity fig s4 although mont carnitine slightly enhanced the binding of genx and pfbs pfoa and pfos showed higher binding to both parent and carnitine amended clays compared to genx and pfbs fig 2 this trend complies with experimental results showing that pfoa and pfos bind to the clay through homogenous adsorption with saturable capacity while genx and pfbs bind to the clay through heterogeneous surface adsorption and partitioning activity the decrease of homogenous binding sites and the lack of a qmax for genx and pfbs could be due to less hydrophobicity compared to long chain pfas the prominent binding modes of genx and pfbs to parent and mont carnitine clays are presented in fig s4 and s5 respectively the extensive use and widespread distribution of pfas are long standing especially for the legacy pfoa and pfos that are highly persistent the scientific literature has shown the co occurrence of pfoa and pfos in drinking water at the same time and location epa 2016 2017a therefore isothermal analysis was conducted with co exposure to equal concentrations of pfoa and pfos results in fig 3 showed that adsorption of the mixture onto amended montmorillonites maintained a good fit to the langmuir model with slightly lower qmax values compared to exposure to individual pfas despite the slight decrease binding onto mont carnitine and mont choline remained high with qmax equal to 0 42 and 0 31 mol kg for pfoa and 0 71 and 0 69 mol kg for pfos respectively similar to isotherms with individual toxicants in fig 1 adsorption of pfos showed higher binding capacity than pfoa which is consistent with the literature yu and hu 2011 zhao et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 this was possibly attributed to the higher water solubility of pfoa and its higher attraction to water molecules versus pfos cooney 1998 as part of this study it was important to gain insight into the thermodynamics of toxicant surface interactions the enthalpy heat of sorption δh can be calculated from kd values of isotherms run at different temperatures i e 37 c and 24 c fig 4 it is directly relevant to the tightness of toxicant clay interactions and can help with the derivation of mechanistic information in particular the sorption of compounds to a surface can be categorized as either physisorption or chemisorption based on δh calculated enthalpies δh for pfoa onto montmorillonite mont carnitine and mont choline were equal to 57 96 6 and 77 7 kj mol respectively enthalpies for pfos were 43 1 50 6 and 41 3 kj mol for montmorillonite mont carnitine and mont choline respectively these high enthalpy absolute values 20 kj mol indicated that pfoa and pfos were tightly bound to clay surfaces which is consistent with the langmuir model for the isothermal interaction adsorption parameters for pfas clay interactions are shown in table 1 all of the correlation coefficient values for the langmuir and freundlich models were greater than 0 8 also the standard deviations were lower than 4 and all points had small deviations from the plots supporting the validity of these models for describing the pfas adsorption process blank controls for each pfas without sorbent were performed and confirmed that pfas precipitation did not occur and was not associated with pfas sorption 3 2 major binding sites and modes clays were heat treated to determine the importance of interlayer surfaces in the binding of pfoa and pfos heating clays at 200 c and 800 c have been shown to significantly collapse the interlayer surfaces thus reducing the amount of total binding sites available the isothermal plot in fig 5 shows that the adsorption regressed to a freundlich trend for heat collapsed clays without a qmax value r2 0 92 the values of distribution constants were significantly decreased from 105 in intact clays to less than 102 p 0 01 this result indicates that the interlayer was a major binding site that contributed to saturable and homogenous binding possibly explaining higher binding of pfoa and pfos onto amended clays due to their higher interlayer spacing fig s2 jaynes and zartman 2011 the binding on the remaining basal surfaces and edge sites was minor and showed a partitioning activity also previous xrd analysis indicated the adsorption of pfos in the interlayer of a sodium montmorillonite clay with increased d001 spacing zhou et al 2010 within the md simulations structural analysis of the binding instances of the deprotonated pfoa nh and pfos showed that both molecules are predominantly bound to the parent clay interlayer through hydrophobic interactions with the fluorinated carbon chains specifically in 79 of the binding instances pfoa nh interacted with the clay through the terminal end of its fluorinated carbon chains fig 6 a encircled in green while 19 of pfoa nh interacted through the entire fluorinated carbon chain fig 6a encircled in blue similar to pfoa nh in 52 of the binding instances pfos interacted with the clay through the terminal end of its fluorinated carbon chains fig 6b encircled in green while 20 of pfos interacted at basal sites of clay through the entire fluorinated carbon chains fig 6b encircled in blue it is worth noting that the number of basal binding instances of pfos may be overestimated by the modeled system this result shows that pfoa nh and pfos mainly bind to the clay surfaces through hydrophobic tails suggesting that hydrophobic interaction is the major binding mechanism for montmorillonite clay which agrees with the earlier conclusion the higher binding of toxicants at the terminal end of the fluorinated carbon chain could be related to electrostatic interaction between partially negative fluorines and positive clay surfaces at ph 2 besides hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonding could also contribute to the higher binding onto amended clays according to md simulations in 42 of assisted binding instances protonated and deprotonated pfoa bind to mont carnitine by hydrogen bonds between its carboxyl group and the carboxyl or hydroxyl group on carnitine in this binding mode pfoa was shown to simultaneously bind to clay interlayers through the terminal end of its fluorinated carbon chain fig 6c and s3c pfoa also participated in assisted binding to mont carnitine through either the terminal end of its fluorinated carbon chain fig 6c and s3d 29 of assisted binding instances or the mid portion of its fluorinated carbon chain fig 6c and s3e 27 of assisted binding instances similarly pfos predominantly participated in assisted binding to mont carnitine by forming hydrogen bonds between its sulfonate group 45 of assisted binding instances fluorinated carbon chain or the terminal end of its fluorinated carbon chain 22 of assisted binding instances and the hydroxyl group of amending carnitine fig 6d 3 3 desorption analysis besides the high capacity and high affinity for binding in stomach conditions stability and tightness of the adsorption complex are important in the evaluation of the potential for pfas dissociation in conditions simulating the intestine therefore desorption studies were run using pfas loaded sorbents following the adsorption study and these were suspended in ph 7 water and incubated at 37 c for 48 hr to simulate the intestine the amount of pfas remaining bound after dissociation qmax was calculated from the difference between the maximum adsorption value qmax and the dissociated concentration in the solution the qmax values were lower compared to qmax values of their adsorption isotherms the point of zero charge pzc of mont carnitine and mont choline were determined to be ph 9 3 and 10 respectively therefore the overall positive charge on the surfaces of these amended clays may result from the solution at a ph lower than phpzc and oversaturation during cation exchange the protonated surfaces on amended clays attracted pfas that is negatively charged therefore the increase of solution ph from 2 to 7 can decrease the positive sites on the clay surfaces resulting in the desorption of pfoa and pfos with reduced qmax and kd from the results in fig 7 adsorption isotherms after desorption of pfoa and pfos from amended clays maintained a langmuir shape as suggested by r2 0 9 table 2 indicating the persistence of saturable binding sites during the dissociation the desorption percentages are less than 12 for both pfoa and pfos all these suggest that only a small amount of bound pfas was dissociated from the binding complex in the intestine model these results further indicate that pfoa and pfos binding to amended clays involve tight interactions and the complex is expected to be stable and not easily desorbed in the intestine the consistently higher binding affinity in mont choline compared to mont carnitine in all adsorption isotherms possibly resulted from the slightly higher phpzc of mont choline 10 since phpzc was reported to closely correlate to pfas binding affinity zhi and liu 2016 3 4 hydra assay hydra vulgaris is very sensitive to environmental toxins and has been widely used as an indicator of toxicity it has accurately predicted the safety and efficacy of toxin binding sorbents from diverse in vivo studies afriyie gyawu et al 2005 marroquin cardona et al 2009 wang et al 2019b wang and phillips 2020 it has also been utilized along with an in vitro gastrointestinal model lemke et al 2001 wang et al 2020 and in silico md simulations orr et al 2020 for obtaining fundamental insight and for screening and validation purposes the toxicities of individual pfoa and pfos and a mixture of pfoa and pfos were determined by the hydra vulgaris assay using minimum effective doses meds equal to 100 ppm pfoa 100 ppm pfos and 90 ppm of the binary mixture fig 8 a c e the inclusion of only 0 02 w v mont carnitine and mont choline with pfoa show significant protection of hydra 93 4 71 and 100 versus 89 with parent montmorillonite p 0 01 fig 8b additionally mont carnitine and mont choline reduced 60 8 16 and 63 4 71 pfos toxicity p 0 01 compared to 60 8 16 from the parent clay fig 8d furthermore to test sorption efficacy for pfoa and pfos mixtures individual sorbents and a mixture of 50 mont carnitine and 50 mont choline were administered at 0 02 results in fig 8e show that the mixture showed significant protection at 71 17 3 against the pfoa and pfos mixture p 0 05 this protection percentage was higher than individual mont 43 30 mont carnitine 62 15 3 and mont choline 29 8 2 indicating a mixture of optimal sorbents can effectively reduce the toxicity of pfas mixtures it is possible that higher doses of sorbents will contribute to even better protection against toxicity based on previous dosimetry studies hearon et al 2021 maki et al 2017 phillips et al 2008 wang et al 2019c based on previous correlations between isothermal capacity dosimetry and human intervention studies an estimation of 0 25 sorbent inclusion in drinking water and the diet could be effective in mitigating pfas exposures mitigation strategies for pfas have focused mainly on the purification of contaminated wastewater not drinking water and food current recommendations to reduce consumption of pfas trough drinking water and food include 1 minimizing exposure to food packaging 2 testing local tap water for contamination and 3 using bottled water consumer reports 2019 department of health 2020 based on the results from the current study the dietary inclusion of edible amended clays with high affinity capacity enthalpy and tightness for pfas and the ability to reduce exposures and related toxicity from contaminated food and water would be an alternative strategy since pfas have unique physicochemical properties that vary with chain length functional group and degree of fluorination ongoing studies are necessary for the development of a combination of broad acting sorbents to reduce exposures to mixtures of pfas 4 conclusions in this study we characterized pfas binding ability of montmorillonite clays that were amended with the natural nutrients carnitine and choline by isothermal analysis md simulations and the hydra assay using simulated conditions found in the stomach and intestine amended montmorillonite clays showed high binding efficacy for pfoa pfos and a mixture of the two based on high binding percentage capacity affinity correlation coefficient enthalpy and tightness hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions were responsible for sequestering long chain pfas into clay interlayers while hydrogen bonding interactions also contributed to the binding of pfas h vulgaris confirmed the safety of these sorbents and the ability of the interaction to decrease the toxicity of pfas mixtures our results show that these edible sorbents have a notable potential for the detoxification of important long chain pfas and their mixtures from drinking water

17443,humans and animals are frequently exposed to pfas per and polyfluoroalkyl substances through drinking water and food however no therapeutic sorbent strategies have been developed to mitigate this problem montmorillonites amended with the common nutrients carnitine and choline were characterized for their ability to bind 4 representative pfas pfoa pfos genx and pfbs adsorption desorption isothermal analysis showed that pfoa pfos and a mixture of the two fit the langmuir model with high binding capacity affinity and enthalpy at conditions simulating the stomach a low percentage of desorption occurred at conditions simulating the intestine the results suggested that hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding were responsible for sequestering pfas into clay interlayers molecular dynamics md simulations suggested the key mode of interaction of pfas was through fluorinated carbon chains and confirmed that pfoa and pfos had enhanced binding to amended clays compared to genx and pfbs the safety and efficacy of amended montmorillonite clays were confirmed in hydra vulgaris where a mixture of amended sorbents delivered the highest protection against a pfas mixture these important results suggest that the inclusion of edible nutrient amended clays with optimal affinity capacity and enthalpy can be used to decrease the bioavailability of pfas from contaminated drinking water and diets graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas adsorption desorption isotherms hydra montmorillonite clay nutrient amended clay molecular dynamics simulations 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas have been extensively used in numerous consumer and industrial products such as firefighting foams stain preventives electronics clothing cookware and lubricants due to their high thermal stability and water dust and oil repellency us environmental protection agency epa 2017a however the high persistency bioaccumulation and widespread use of pfas have resulted in their ubiquitous distribution in the environment epa 2017a the cdc s national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes reported that detectable pfas concentrations were found at a frequency of 97 in 1682 blood samples from non institutionalized american civilian residents lewis et al 2015 among pfas pfoa perfluorooctanoic acid and pfos perfluorooctanesulfonic acid have been widely found in sediment sludge municipal wastewater coastal water and even tap water epa 2016 2017a because of their low pka values pfos and pfoa predominantly exist as anions in environmentally relevant scenarios itrc 2017 furthermore pfoa and pfos have been shown to co occur in a variety of drinking water sources epa 2016 2017a to decrease the use of the highly persistent and cumulative pfoa and pfos short chain pfas congeners including genx hexafluoropropylene oxide and pfbs perfluorobutane sulfonic acid were introduced as alternatives itrc 2017 however the hydrophobic chain and hydrophilic functional groups allow pfas residues to be easily transported in an aquatic environment and adsorbed onto the surfaces of environmental solid matrices shih and wang 2013 this problem can be exacerbated during disasters such as floods chemical spills and fires where chemicals such as pfas can be mobilized and redistributed in the environment further threatening the safety of drinking water and food supplies wang and phillips 2019 many studies have reported that the adsorption and purification of wastewater containing pfas can be economically feasible and effective zhang et al 2019 among conventional sorbents powdered activated carbon ac has been shown to have the highest adsorption ability and as early as 2005 the 3m company reported 99 removal of pfos using ac fujii et al 2007 however a major route for human and animal exposure to pfas is through the ingestion of pfas contaminated drinking water fish food packaged or processed with pfas containing materials and crops grown in contaminated soil or water atsdr 2019 crone et al 2019 epa 2017a b once pfas especially long chain pfas is consumed by animals and humans it is absorbed accumulated and can be biomagnified through the food chain causing adverse health effects such as cancer immune system dysfunction and liver damage atsdr 2018 however there are no reported strategies that can reduce unintended exposures through consumption of pfas and pfas mixtures in contaminated drinking water and foods it was reported that minerals played important roles in the pfas sorption process in groundwater systems the fate and transport of pfas have a strong dependence on interactions with surrounding mineral surfaces higgins and luthy 2006 montmorillonite is a common form of hydrated aluminum oxide that usually exists as fine grained constituents in soils and sediments importantly calcium montmorillonite has been shown to be safe for the consumption of humans and animals based on multiple clinical trials and animal intervention studies phillips et al 2019 to further enhance the lipophilicity of the clay surfaces montmorillonite clay was amended with l carnitine mont carnitine or choline mont choline which are natural nutrients that are commonly included in dietary supplements mont carnitine and mont choline have been previously shown to adsorb lipophilic chemicals such as aflatoxin benzo a pyrene plasticizers and pesticides cruz guzman et al 2004 orr et al 2020 wang et al 2017 2019 thus they were tested in this study for the adsorption of important pfas chemicals and common mixtures the mechanism of this strategy involves the ingestion of sorbent and the adsorption of pfas by the sorbent in the stomach and intestines resulting in reduced pfas bioavailability the overall objective of this study was to investigate the binding of 4 common pfas to the active surfaces of carnitine and choline amended montmorillonite clays versus the parent clay we have characterized and optimized pfas sorbent interactions and binding parameters including in vitro in vivo and in silico methods to 1 determine equilibrium adsorption and desorption of pfas from clay surfaces using isothermal analysis at conditions that simulate the gastrointestinal tract 2 identify active binding sites using heat collapsed sorbents 3 use molecular dynamics md simulations to validate binding percentages and binding modes 4 use thermodynamic studies to determine the heat of sorption enthalpy and 5 predict the safety and efficacy of sorbent interactions for individual pfas

amended montmorillonite clays were produced by intercalating l carnitine or choline at 100 cation exchange capacity between interlayer surfaces under acidic conditions as previously described wang et al 2017 md simulations have shown that carnitine and choline are stably bound with limited dissociation to interlayer surfaces of montmorillonite clays orr et al 2020 mont carnitine and mont choline have been previously characterized for d001 interlayer spacing composition of matter and functional groups using x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared ftir jaynes and zartman 2011

tescan orsay holding a s brno czech republic at 20 kv with a secondary electron detector at 5 kv accelerating voltage ultrapure deionized water 18 2 mω was generated using an elga automated filtration system woodridge il usa 2 2 determination of phpzc the ph of point of zero charge phpzc was measured in this study since it has been previously reported to closely affect the binding affinity of pfoa and pfos zhi and liu 2016 as previously described by park et al 2020 100 mg of sorbents were added into 20 ml 0 1 m nacl solutions with different initial ph values ranging from 2 to 11 adjusted with 0 5 n hcl or naoh solutions before making the solution distilled and deionized water was boiled to remove dissolved co2 sealed vials were shaken for 48 hr at 200 rpm at room temperature subsequently the final ph of the supernatant of the solution was measured when sorbents were completely settled if the ph of the nacl solution did not change after contact with sorbent that ph was selected as phpzc of the sorbent 2 3 chemical analysis pfas was analyzed using a waters acquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer lc ms ms equipped with triple quadrupole liang and chang 2019 roberts et al 2017 an acquity beh c18 column 2 1 50 mm 1 7 μm was used for separation and kept at 40 c in the column oven a gradient elution using 20 mm ammonium acetate eluent a and acetonitrile eluent b was carried out at a flow rate of 0 6 ml min the gradient program for elution was 10 eluent b initial 10 55 0 to 0 1 min 55 99 0 1 to 4 5 min 99 4 5 to 5 min and 99 10 5 to 6 5 min the injection volume was 10 μl for each analysis the mass spectrometer was used with an electrospray ionization interface esi and operated in a negative ion mode the spray voltage was maintained at 4 5 kv the source temperature was kept at 450 c the monitored precursor and product ions m z for pfoa pfos genx and pfbs were 413 to 369 499 to 80 285 to 168 9 and 298 9 to 80 respectively the cone voltage kv for pfoa pfos genx and pfbs was 25 40 20 and 35 respectively the mass spectrometer was operated under multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode nitrogen gas was used as the collision and curtain gas and argon gas was used as the nebulizer and heater gas empower analyst software was used to control the lc ms ms system and acquire the data 2 4 adsorption isotherms pfas solutions including pfoa pfos genx and pfbs at a concentration of 5 ppm µg ml were individually prepared from pure crystals in ph 2 distilled water which is the average stomach ph the concentrations were set based on previous literature zhi and liu 2016 screening results and the optimal ratio of sorbent pfas to achieve equilibrium saturation on isotherm plots each sorbent at 0 0005 was then added to a concentration gradient from 5 to 100 of 5 ml of pfas solution controls included 5 ml of blank solution ph 2 water pfas solution and sorbent suspension all samples were vibrated at 1000 rpm and 37 c or 24 c using an ika electric shaker vibrax vxr basic werke germany for 2 hr as 2 hr is the average digestion time in a human stomach the sorbent pfas complex was then separated from solution by centrifugation at 2000 g for 20 min and the supernatant was analyzed by lc ms ms 2 5 desorption isotherms the desorption of pfas from the surface of sorbents was tested in a simulated intestine model at the end of adsorption experiments pfas loaded sorbents were separated from the aqueous solutions and rinsed once with ph 7 water to washout unbound pfas and traces of acid the tubes were then filled with 5 ml of ph 7 water solution and shaken at 200 rpm and 37 c for 48 hr on a rocking platform vmr pa usa the 48 hr equilibration time was chosen based on the maximum duration of digestion in human intestines then the suspensions were centrifuged at 2000 g for 20 min and an aliquot of supernatant was extracted for analysis desorbed pfas concentrations were detected at the end of the desorption experiment and the amount of pfas that remained bound on sorbents was determined as the difference between the initial adsorbed and the desorbed amount for both adsorption and desorption the dry weight of sorbents before and after the experiments were determined for selected concentrations and no significant change was observed the potential variability in the amount of pfas adsorbed and desorbed to clay surfaces based on isothermal data calculations was less than 4 relative standard deviation 2 6 data calculations and curve fitting pfas detected by lc ms ms was calculated to determine the free pfas concentrations in solution in the adsorption study the quantity of bound pfas was calculated by the concentration difference between control and test groups and expressed as mol kg on the isotherm plots the amount of pfas that remained bound in the desorption study was derived from the difference between the initial amount bound in the adsorption and the dissociation in the solution table curve 2d was used to plot these data and derive values for the variable parameters the adsorption and desorption isotherms were plotted by well established langmuir or freundlich models based on the equation that fit the data with highest correlation coefficients and randomness of the residuals from triplicate analyses grant and phillips 1998 the langmuir isotherm describes monolayer adsorption onto a surface with a finite number of identical sites and uniform energies of adsorption the langmuir equation was entered as user defined functions 1 langmuir model q q max k d c w 1 k d

investigated through quintet 50 ns md simulations and subsequent structural analysis using in house fortran programs analogous to our previous studies wang et al 2019a the deprotonated states of pfos and pfbs were investigated since their pka values can be as low as 3 which is significantly below the ph in the md simulations ph 2 while the deprotonated pfoa pfoa nh is the main form in the environment it is important to investigate both the deprotonated pfoa nh and protonated pfoa h congeners of pfoa since previous studies reported a wide range of possible pka values 0 5 3 8 burns et al 2008 steinle darling et al 2008 vierke et al 2013 additionally due to the pka values of genx 2 8 3 8 both protonated genx h and deprotonated genx nh forms were investigated the ratio of different protonation states between pfoa h and pfoa nh or genx h and genx nh was not considered which was beyond the scope of our investigation thus a total of 12 simulation systems were computationally investigated corresponding to each of the 6 pfas forms in the presence of the parent clay and mont carnitine independently in the structural analysis the propensity of pfas binding to clays was evaluated through 1 binding percentage calculations and 2 prominent binding modes determined based on which chemical groups of pfas as shown in figure s1 interact with the clays the md simulations and subsequent structural analysis are described in detail in the supporting information 2 8 hydra assay hydra vulgaris were obtained from environment canada montreal qc and maintained at 18 c using a hydra classification method the morphology of hydra was rated over time as an indicator of solution toxicity the morphological scoring of hydra was objective and repeatable dash et al 2012 hearon et al 2020 the hydra response was scored after exposure to pfas with and without sorbent inclusion the assay included closely monitoring mature and non budding hydra at 0 4 20 28 44 68 and 92 hr without changing solutions during testing hydra medium was included as a control pfas dose response groups consisted of pfoa pfos and a mixture of pfoa and pfos at a gradient of concentrations to determine the minimum effective doses that resulted in 100 mortality of hydra in 92 hr individual sorbents and a sorbent mixture of equal amounts of amended clays were added to the pfas solutions at 0 02 inclusion rate all solutions were mixed at 1000 rpm for 2 hr and centrifuged at 2000 g for 20 min prior to exposure of hydra in pyrex dishes three hydra colonies in each group were exposed to 4 ml of test medium at 18 c the average score for each group was used to determine the toxicity rating at each time point a two way t test was used to determine statistical significance each experiment was independently conducted in triplicate to derive means and standard deviations for the toxicity scores from the hydra assay these were then used to calculate the t value using a tukey test and p value results were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion clays have been used as ancient medicine for diarrhea cholera bacterial infections and mitigation of poisonings for centuries eating clay has been a global practice that exists among humans as well as numerous animal species in previous intervention studies and clinical trials in the us and africa calcium montmorillonite clay was shown to be safe for human and animal consumption however the clay had a preference for binding aflatoxins and certain hydrophilic chemicals phillips et al 2019 wang et al 2019 to enhance its ability to bind diverse environmental chemicals we amended the interlayer with l carnitine and choline to increase interlayer spacing figure s2 and hydrophobicity of the clay surfaces a 7 point standard curve for each pfas was constructed using concentrations ranging from the limit of detection lod to 10 ppm lod was determined to be 10 ppb with a signal to noise ratio equal to 3 the calibration solutions were prepared daily and verified before running test samples the linearity r2 in all cases was 1 r2 0 99 3 1 adsorption analyses adsorption isotherms were conducted using a simulated stomach model at ph 2 and 37 c for 2 hr to simulate the average duration of the digestion process in the stomach isothermal data reflecting the sorption of pfoa and pfos onto clay surfaces were plotted as a langmuir model based on their r2 values as shown in fig 1 a and 1b the adsorption plots of pfoa and pfos binding onto parent montmorillonites exhibited good fit to a langmuir model based on correlation coefficients and a curved shape suggesting the presence of monolayer binding and saturable active sites the binding of pfoa and pfos onto parent montmorillonite clay showed high capacities equal to 0 31 and 0 58 mol kg and high affinities equal to 5 37e5 and 1 81e5 respectively within md simulations the binding percentages of deprotonated pfoa nh and pfos onto parent clay were 20 3 and 18 2 respectively fig 2 this agrees with the higher affinity of pfoa versus pfos observed in the isothermal studies the higher binding propensity of pfoa h could be facilitated by hydrogen bonding to the clay interlayer fig s3 furthermore our isothermal results indicated that amendments of montmorillonite clay with carnitine and choline enhanced the binding capacity for pfoa to 0 43 and 0 34 mol kg compared to parent clay similarly pfos binding capacity was increased for mont carnitine qmax 0 73 mol kg and mont choline qmax 0 75 mol kg compared to parent montmorillonite fig 1a and 1b the improved binding of mont carnitine for pfoa both pfoa nh and pfoa h and pfos was also observed within md simulations where mont carnitine showed significantly higher binding percentages than the parent clay fig 2 this improvement of mont carnitine was more pronounced for protonated pfoa h than deprotonated pfoa nh presumably due to the neutral charge on pfoa h both pfoa and pfos were shown to bind to carnitine directly or bind to clay interlayer and carnitine simultaneously fig 2 this enhancement in pfoa and pfos binding from the addition of l carnitine and choline at acidic ph may involve the exchange of inorganic cations and an increase of the hydrophobicity at interlayer surfaces resulting in a reduction of polar charge and more hydrophobic surfaces that facilitate the binding of pfas to further investigate the hydrophobic interaction short chain pfas including genx and pfbs were tested by isothermal analysis contrary to the isothermal plots of pfoa and pfos the binding of genx and pfbs was best described by a freundlich partitioning model as suggested by the r2 and the plots in fig 1c and 1d this indicated heterogeneous binding sites the lack of a saturable specific site on the clay surfaces and a partitioning interaction according to the md simulations genx both genx h and genx nh and pfbs bind both in the interlayer and at basal surface sites on the clay supporting the heterogenous binding shown in the freundlich isotherms while the protonated genx genx h binds to the parent clay with a similar propensity as pfoa and pfos the deprotonated genx genx nh and pfbs bind with less propensity fig s4 although mont carnitine slightly enhanced the binding of genx and pfbs pfoa and pfos showed higher binding to both parent and carnitine amended clays compared to genx and pfbs fig 2 this trend complies with experimental results showing that pfoa and pfos bind to the clay through homogenous adsorption with saturable capacity while genx and pfbs bind to the clay through heterogeneous surface adsorption and partitioning activity the decrease of homogenous binding sites and the lack of a qmax for genx and pfbs could be due to less hydrophobicity compared to long chain pfas the prominent binding modes of genx and pfbs to parent and mont carnitine clays are presented in fig s4 and s5 respectively the extensive use and widespread distribution of pfas are long standing especially for the legacy pfoa and pfos that are highly persistent the scientific literature has shown the co occurrence of pfoa and pfos in drinking water at the same time and location epa 2016 2017a therefore isothermal analysis was conducted with co exposure to equal concentrations of pfoa and pfos results in fig 3 showed that adsorption of the mixture onto amended montmorillonites maintained a good fit to the langmuir model with slightly lower qmax values compared to exposure to individual pfas despite the slight decrease binding onto mont carnitine and mont choline remained high with qmax equal to 0 42 and 0 31 mol kg for pfoa and 0 71 and 0 69 mol kg for pfos respectively similar to isotherms with individual toxicants in fig 1 adsorption of pfos showed higher binding capacity than pfoa which is consistent with the literature yu and hu 2011 zhao et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 this was possibly attributed to the higher water solubility of pfoa and its higher attraction to water molecules versus pfos cooney 1998 as part of this study it was important to gain insight into the thermodynamics of toxicant surface interactions the enthalpy heat of sorption δh can be calculated from kd values of isotherms run at different temperatures i e 37 c and 24 c fig 4 it is directly relevant to the tightness of toxicant clay interactions and can help with the derivation of mechanistic information in particular the sorption of compounds to a surface can be categorized as either physisorption or chemisorption based on δh calculated enthalpies δh for pfoa onto montmorillonite mont carnitine and mont choline were equal to 57 96 6 and 77 7 kj mol respectively enthalpies for pfos were 43 1 50 6 and 41 3 kj mol for montmorillonite mont carnitine and mont choline respectively these high enthalpy absolute values 20 kj mol indicated that pfoa and pfos were tightly bound to clay surfaces which is consistent with the langmuir model for the isothermal interaction adsorption parameters for pfas clay interactions are shown in table 1 all of the correlation coefficient values for the langmuir and freundlich models were greater than 0 8 also the standard deviations were lower than 4 and all points had small deviations from the plots supporting the validity of these models for describing the pfas adsorption process blank controls for each pfas without sorbent were performed and confirmed that pfas precipitation did not occur and was not associated with pfas sorption 3 2 major binding sites and modes clays were heat treated to determine the importance of interlayer surfaces in the binding of pfoa and pfos heating clays at 200 c and 800 c have been shown to significantly collapse the interlayer surfaces thus reducing the amount of total binding sites available the isothermal plot in fig 5 shows that the adsorption regressed to a freundlich trend for heat collapsed clays without a qmax value r2 0 92 the values of distribution constants were significantly decreased from 105 in intact clays to less than 102 p 0 01 this result indicates that the interlayer was a major binding site that contributed to saturable and homogenous binding possibly explaining higher binding of pfoa and pfos onto amended clays due to their higher interlayer spacing fig s2 jaynes and zartman 2011 the binding on the remaining basal surfaces and edge sites was minor and showed a partitioning activity also previous xrd analysis indicated the adsorption of pfos in the interlayer of a sodium montmorillonite clay with increased d001 spacing zhou et al 2010 within the md simulations structural analysis of the binding instances of the deprotonated pfoa nh and pfos showed that both molecules are predominantly bound to the parent clay interlayer through hydrophobic interactions with the fluorinated carbon chains specifically in 79 of the binding instances pfoa nh interacted with the clay through the terminal end of its fluorinated carbon chains fig 6 a encircled in green while 19 of pfoa nh interacted through the entire fluorinated carbon chain fig 6a encircled in blue similar to pfoa nh in 52 of the binding instances pfos interacted with the clay through the terminal end of its fluorinated carbon chains fig 6b encircled in green while 20 of pfos interacted at basal sites of clay through the entire fluorinated carbon chains fig 6b encircled in blue it is worth noting that the number of basal binding instances of pfos may be overestimated by the modeled system this result shows that pfoa nh and pfos mainly bind to the clay surfaces through hydrophobic tails suggesting that hydrophobic interaction is the major binding mechanism for montmorillonite clay which agrees with the earlier conclusion the higher binding of toxicants at the terminal end of the fluorinated carbon chain could be related to electrostatic interaction between partially negative fluorines and positive clay surfaces at ph 2 besides hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonding could also contribute to the higher binding onto amended clays according to md simulations in 42 of assisted binding instances protonated and deprotonated pfoa bind to mont carnitine by hydrogen bonds between its carboxyl group and the carboxyl or hydroxyl group on carnitine in this binding mode pfoa was shown to simultaneously bind to clay interlayers through the terminal end of its fluorinated carbon chain fig 6c and s3c pfoa also participated in assisted binding to mont carnitine through either the terminal end of its fluorinated carbon chain fig 6c and s3d 29 of assisted binding instances or the mid portion of its fluorinated carbon chain fig 6c and s3e 27 of assisted binding instances similarly pfos predominantly participated in assisted binding to mont carnitine by forming hydrogen bonds between its sulfonate group 45 of assisted binding instances fluorinated carbon chain or the terminal end of its fluorinated carbon chain 22 of assisted binding instances and the hydroxyl group of amending carnitine fig 6d 3 3 desorption analysis besides the high capacity and high affinity for binding in stomach conditions stability and tightness of the adsorption complex are important in the evaluation of the potential for pfas dissociation in conditions simulating the intestine therefore desorption studies were run using pfas loaded sorbents following the adsorption study and these were suspended in ph 7 water and incubated at 37 c for 48 hr to simulate the intestine the amount of pfas remaining bound after dissociation qmax was calculated from the difference between the maximum adsorption value qmax and the dissociated concentration in the solution the qmax values were lower compared to qmax values of their adsorption isotherms the point of zero charge pzc of mont carnitine and mont choline were determined to be ph 9 3 and 10 respectively therefore the overall positive charge on the surfaces of these amended clays may result from the solution at a ph lower than phpzc and oversaturation during cation exchange the protonated surfaces on amended clays attracted pfas that is negatively charged therefore the increase of solution ph from 2 to 7 can decrease the positive sites on the clay surfaces resulting in the desorption of pfoa and pfos with reduced qmax and kd from the results in fig 7 adsorption isotherms after desorption of pfoa and pfos from amended clays maintained a langmuir shape as suggested by r2 0 9 table 2 indicating the persistence of saturable binding sites during the dissociation the desorption percentages are less than 12 for both pfoa and pfos all these suggest that only a small amount of bound pfas was dissociated from the binding complex in the intestine model these results further indicate that pfoa and pfos binding to amended clays involve tight interactions and the complex is expected to be stable and not easily desorbed in the intestine the consistently higher binding affinity in mont choline compared to mont carnitine in all adsorption isotherms possibly resulted from the slightly higher phpzc of mont choline 10 since phpzc was reported to closely correlate to pfas binding affinity zhi and liu 2016 3 4 hydra assay hydra vulgaris is very sensitive to environmental toxins and has been widely used as an indicator of toxicity it has accurately predicted the safety and efficacy of toxin binding sorbents from diverse in vivo studies afriyie gyawu et al 2005 marroquin cardona et al 2009 wang et al 2019b wang and phillips 2020 it has also been utilized along with an in vitro gastrointestinal model lemke et al 2001 wang et al 2020 and in silico md simulations orr et al 2020 for obtaining fundamental insight and for screening and validation purposes the toxicities of individual pfoa and pfos and a mixture of pfoa and pfos were determined by the hydra vulgaris assay using minimum effective doses meds equal to 100 ppm pfoa 100 ppm pfos and 90 ppm of the binary mixture fig 8 a c e the inclusion of only 0 02 w v mont carnitine and mont choline with pfoa show significant protection of hydra 93 4 71 and 100 versus 89 with parent montmorillonite p 0 01 fig 8b additionally mont carnitine and mont choline reduced 60 8 16 and 63 4 71 pfos toxicity p 0 01 compared to 60 8 16 from the parent clay fig 8d furthermore to test sorption efficacy for pfoa and pfos mixtures individual sorbents and a mixture of 50 mont carnitine and 50 mont choline were administered at 0 02 results in fig 8e show that the mixture showed significant protection at 71 17 3 against the pfoa and pfos mixture p 0 05 this protection percentage was higher than individual mont 43 30 mont carnitine 62 15 3 and mont choline 29 8 2 indicating a mixture of optimal sorbents can effectively reduce the toxicity of pfas mixtures it is possible that higher doses of sorbents will contribute to even better protection against toxicity based on previous dosimetry studies hearon et al 2021 maki et al 2017 phillips et al 2008 wang et al 2019c based on previous correlations between isothermal capacity dosimetry and human intervention studies an estimation of 0 25 sorbent inclusion in drinking water and the diet could be effective in mitigating pfas exposures mitigation strategies for pfas have focused mainly on the purification of contaminated wastewater not drinking water and food current recommendations to reduce consumption of pfas trough drinking water and food include 1 minimizing exposure to food packaging 2 testing local tap water for contamination and 3 using bottled water consumer reports 2019 department of health 2020 based on the results from the current study the dietary inclusion of edible amended clays with high affinity capacity enthalpy and tightness for pfas and the ability to reduce exposures and related toxicity from contaminated food and water would be an alternative strategy since pfas have unique physicochemical properties that vary with chain length functional group and degree of fluorination ongoing studies are necessary for the development of a combination of broad acting sorbents to reduce exposures to mixtures of pfas 4 conclusions in this study we characterized pfas binding ability of montmorillonite clays that were amended with the natural nutrients carnitine and choline by isothermal analysis md simulations and the hydra assay using simulated conditions found in the stomach and intestine amended montmorillonite clays showed high binding efficacy for pfoa pfos and a mixture of the two based on high binding percentage capacity affinity correlation coefficient enthalpy and tightness hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions were responsible for sequestering long chain pfas into clay interlayers while hydrogen bonding interactions also contributed to the binding of pfas h vulgaris confirmed the safety of these sorbents and the ability of the interaction to decrease the toxicity of pfas mixtures our results show that these edible sorbents have a notable potential for the detoxification of important long chain pfas and their mixtures from drinking water

17444,the ubiquitous use and manufacturing of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass have led to the contamination of water resources worldwide high pressure membranes including nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro are increasingly being deployed for water treatment and may be an effective barrier to pfass however the impact of membrane operating conditions background water matrix and solute adsorption on rejection of diverse pfass by nf and ro remains unclear rejection of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas present in aqueous film forming foam afff diluted into a laboratory electrolyte matrix by nf and ro spiral wound elements was 98 and 99 respectively rejection of the same pfaas present in an afff impacted groundwater matrix by nf was lower between 92 98 and was attributed to background water matrix constituents operating conditions did not have a significant impact on rejection of pfass with the exception of shorter chain perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas in the afff impacted groundwater matrix where rejection increased with increasing flux structure activity analysis of 42 pfass including 10 pfaas and 32 pfass identified in afff through high resolution mass spectrometry suspect screening methods showed some correlation between rejection and compound molecular weight adsorptive losses of pfaas most notably longer chain hydrophobic pfaas to the spiral wound membrane elements and the membrane system were observed adsorption of pfaas to the permeate spacer was especially pronounced and may have implications of artificially high rejection values still rejection of pfass by nf remained consistently 98 over 13 days of continuous operation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanofiltration reverse osmosis pilot scale adsorption groundwater high resolution mass spectrometry 1 introduction due to their unique chemical properties per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass have been extensively used in the manufacturing of many industrial and consumer products leading to the detection of pfass in water resources worldwide including rivers lakes wastewaters groundwaters and surface waters houtz et al 2016 hu et al 2016 kim and kannan 2007 kwok et al 2013 quiñones and snyder 2009 a major source of groundwater contamination has been the widespread use of fire suppressing aqueous film forming foam afff at military and domestic fire training areas barzen hanson et al 2017 to protect human health and reduce the adverse health effects associated with some pfass the u s environmental protection agency usepa issued lifetime drinking water health advisory levels in 2016 for perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos at 70 ng l combined usepa 2016a b individual states have also set more stringent drinking water guidelines for pfoa pfos and other pfass resulting in greater challenges to entities seeking to provide safe drinking water simon et al 2019 pfass are difficult chemicals to degrade or remove from water and conventional drinking water and wastewater treatment processes are largely ineffective in their treatment appleman et al 2014 dauchy et al 2017 as a result significant research has been initiated to develop more effective pfas treatment technologies currently the most promising technologies involve physical separation of pfass from water by granular activated carbon gac anion exchange resins ix and high pressure membranes e g nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro franke et al 2019 liu et al 2019 rodowa et al 2020 although gac and ix are more cost effective than high pressure membranes for treatment of longer chain pfass such as pfos and pfoa high pressure membranes may be a better option where treatment of shorter chain pfass is desired given these compounds are poorly removed by adsorbents appleman et al 2014 franke et al 2019 additionally evaluating treatment of pfass by nf and ro membranes is important due to 1 the likely occurrence of pfass in feed waters of existing nf and ro installations e g wastewater reclamation facilities drinking water softening facilities appleman et al 2014 quiñones and snyder 2009 and 2 the inclusion of nf and ro in hybrid treatment systems being developed to pre concentrate pfass before applying other treatment processes to destroy e g electrochemical oxidation soriano et al 2017 or to improve separation of pfass e g gac ix superloading franke et al 2019 although several studies have reported on treatment of pfass by nf and ro membranes appleman et al 2013 franke et al 2019 hang et al 2015 soriano et al 2017 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 tang et al 2007 tang et al 2006 further research is needed to broaden adoption of high pressure membranes critical issues that need to be addressed include the rejection of diverse pfas compounds the influence of membrane operating conditions e g permeate flux recovery adsorption and water matrix on rejection of pfass and the potential for adsorption of pfass to various components in the membrane system to date most membrane studies have focused on treatment of a small number of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas most notably pfoa and pfos hang et al 2015 soriano et al 2017 tang et al 2007 tang et al 2006 with few studies reporting on rejection of a broader suite of pfass identified in afff impacted source waters recent advances in pfas compound discovery using high resolution mass spectrometry has revealed a much greater diversity of pfass including hundreds of potential polyfluorinated structures associated with afff releases backe et al 2013 barzen hanson et al 2017 oecd 2018 membrane treatment of these compounds remains largely unknown broadening the scope of treatment to include polyfluorinated structures is important not only because of their increased detection in the environment backe et al 2013 de silva et al 2011 and the potential adverse human health effects of these compounds but because polyfluorinated pfass have been shown to transform into pfaas harding marjanovic et al 2015 that have been linked to adverse human health effects usepa 2016a b to ensure experimental results are representative of full scale membrane applications membrane system configuration needs to be considered in study design because bench scale flat sheet membrane systems are convenient to operate they have been largely used in past pfas treatment studies appleman et al 2013 hang et al 2015 soriano et al 2017 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 tang et al 2007 tang et al 2006 however these systems may not provide results that are representative of the spiral wound membrane systems used in practice due to changing conditions along the length of a spiral wound element i e pressure concentration flux fujioka et al 2014 hancock et al 2011 regardless of possible differences between membrane configurations spiral wound elements are used in virtually all full scale high pressure membrane applications suggesting that experimentation with spiral wound elements is needed to best represent real world performance operating conditions such as water flux and recovery are likely to affect rejection of pfass wijmans and baker 1995 and a comprehensive assessment evaluating the impact of flux and recovery on rejection of diverse pfass has not been performed likewise solute adsorption interactions with membrane system components can affect the rejection values observed during experiments bellona et al 2004 xu et al 2006 while adsorption of pfass to membranes has been previously documented steinle darling and reinhard 2008 tang et al 2007 reports of the impacts on rejection have been limited to pfos tang et al 2007 furthermore little is known about the potential for pfas adsorption to components other than

table s1 feed solutions 14 l were adjusted to a ph of 7 0 4 with naoh or hcl prior to and during experimentation 2 3 membrane rejection experiments a series of membrane rejection experiments were conducted to evaluate rejection of pfass in afff spiked and afff gw by nf and ro rejection equation s1 of pfass was assessed over a wide range of operating conditions summarized in table s2 including system flux equation s2 ranging from 7 50 lmh single pass system recovery equation s3 ranging from 12 55 and feed flow rate ranging from 5 7 13 2 lpm operating conditions selected were based on membrane manufacturer guidelines and system limitations for clarification system flux and single pass system recovery calculations were based on the combined permeate flowrates from the three membrane elements in series through a single pass rejection is calculated based on the pfas concentration in the feed and combined permeate stream each operating condition was equilibrated for 30 minutes prior to sample collection for pfas analysis operating conditions for nf and ro membranes were slightly different due to differences in membrane permeability all experiments were conducted in duplicate and uncertainties are reported as min max values 2 4 pfas adsorption adsorption of pfass to the nf membrane and the subsequent impact on rejection was investigated in long term rejection experiments by recirculating afff spiked in duplicate at 20 lmh system flux 34 single pass system recovery and 7 6 lpm feed flow rate over 13 days two additional experiments to better understand adsorption of pfass were also performed first the membranes were removed from the pressure vessels and afff spiked solution was recirculated at 7 6 lpm feed flow rate for 13 days to assess adsorption of pfass to membrane

spiked solution experiments were first conducted to evaluate and compare rejection of pfass in afff spiked solution by nf and ro membranes to prevent interference from background water matrix constituents known to affect membrane performance e g dom ca 2 membrane rejection tests were conducted over a range of operating conditions summarized in table s2 fig 1 shows the measured rejection of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas panels a and c and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas panels b and d detected in the afff spiked solution over a subset of operating conditions 10 30 lmh 17 52 single pass system recovery and 7 6 lpm feed flow rate at the same feed flow rate flux and recovery are linearly related rejection of the full suite of pfaas was consistently 98 by nf and 99 by ro indicating operating conditions did not have a significant impact on rejection of pfaas by nf and ro in the afff spiked solution for ro rejection values were calculated using the loqs for individual pfas 1 4 ng l because measured permeate concentrations were below the reported loq according to common membrane diffusion models solute rejection increases with increasing water flux across a semi permeable membrane i e dilution effect where water flux is a function of pressure and membrane permeability and solute flux is a function of a solute s diffusion coefficient and concentration gradient wijmans and baker 1995 even at infinite flux however 100 rejection will likely not be reached due to imperfections in membrane materials spiegler and kedem 1966 and concentration polarization due to increased recovery song and elimelech 1995 rejection of pfaas in these experiments did not increase significantly as water flux increased likely because rejection was already high 98 by nf and 99 by ro at the lowest fluxes evaluated in addition for this system increasing flux causes an increase in recovery which is expected to result in higher permeate pfas concentrations from concentration polarization this phenomenon was not observed likely due to the dilution effect keeping permeate pfas concentrations relatively constant over the system operating conditions flux and recovery evaluated high rejection of pfaas by nf and ro is attributed to a combination of electrostatic repulsion and size exclusion appleman et al 2013 franke et al 2019 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 tang et al 2006 electrostatic repulsion occurs between pfaas which are anionic at ph 7 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 and the membrane polymer which is also expected to be negatively charged at ph 7 table 1 electrostatic repulsion has been shown to be an important rejection mechanism for pfass steinle darling and reinhard 2008 the high rejection of pfaas is also consistent with the mwco values of the nf 180 g mol and ro 100 g mol membranes being lower than the molecular weights of the pfaas examined this study 250 500 g mol the lower mwco of the ro membrane compared to that of the nf membrane is consistent with the higher rejection values observed with ro 99 than nf 98 similarly the differences in mwco between the two membranes is consistent with the fact that rejection by ro did not change significantly as compound molecular weight changed whereas there is a small effect 0 5 of increasing molecular weight and therefore decreasing solute diffusion coefficient on rejection of pfaas by nf presumably due to increased size exclusion for higher molecular weight compounds in general rejection values of pfass by nf 98 were comparable to those reported in previous studies using the same nf membrane 93 99 lower reported rejection values were due to high loq concentrations appleman et al 2013 franke et al 2019 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 3 1 1 rejection of suspect pfass in afff spiked solution in addition to the 10 pfaas detected by targeted lc qtof ms analysis 32 suspect pfass 24 unique molecular weights and 8 isomers were identified in the afff spiked solution table s4 no suspect pfass were detected in the afff gw proposed structures consistent with the molecular formulas are shown in table s5 backe et al 2013 barzen hanson et al 2017 d agostino and mabury 2014 de silva et al 2011 liu et al 2015 moe et al 2012 murray et al 2018 place and field 2012 rotander et al 2015 all suspect compounds were classified with level 4 confidence which is defined as unequivocal molecular formula but uncertain structure schymanski et al 2014 average rejection values for individual suspect pfass by nf over the full range of operating conditions table s2 are provided in table s5 and plotted in fig 2 like the pfaas none of the suspect pfass were detected in the ro permeate consistent with the membrane s lower mwco estimated rejection values with nf were high exceeding 98 for all suspect pfass with one notable exception pentahydrido fluoroheptane sulfate fig 2 shows that rejection of targeted pfaas and suspect pfass in afff spiked feed solution increases with increasing molecular weight in contrast varying polar functional groups e g carboxylate sulfonate amine and ionic charges e g negative positive zwitterionic of the structures did not have a discernable effect on rejection of suspect pfass one notable outlier to the observed trend in nf rejection pentahydrido fluoroheptane sulfate 375 g mol exhibited lower rejection than other pfass 96 6 1 4 the lower rejection of this compound may be an artifact of the large uncertainty associated with the measurements alternatively the lower rejection may be due to the presence of an ether functional group in the structure which promotes increased solute membrane affinity through hydrogen bonding interactions xu et al 2006 overall measurements indicate that nf and ro membranes are effective barriers for removal of the full diversity of afff derived pfass evaluated in this study subsequent experiments and analyses focused on treatment of pfass with nf because both nf and ro membranes yielded high and similar levels of pfaa rejection and equivalent permeate fluxes can be achieved for nf with much lower operating pressures e g 60 lower than that of ro making nf a more economical treatment option for pfass 3 2 rejection of pfass by nf in afff gw fig 3 shows rejection of pfaas in afff gw by nf measured at operating system fluxes and single pass system recoveries corresponding to those presented in fig 1 for pfcas and longer chain pfsas operating conditions did not have a significant impact on rejection similar to effects already noted for the afff spiked matrix in contrast operating conditions did have an impact on the rejection of shorter chain pfsas pfpes pfbs pfprs where rejection increased with increasing system flux as predicted by common membrane diffusion models wijmans and baker 1995 however it is unclear why the same trends were not observed for shorter chain pfcas and results unfortunately could not be compared against other studies that have evaluated rejection of pfass in groundwater due to reported permeate concentrations below the loq franke et al 2019 one possible explanation would be differences in sulfonate and carboxylate head group interactions with groundwater constituents e g dom ca2 that affect solute membrane interactions and promote greater transport through the nf membrane differing treatment of pfcas and pfsas have also been reported for other pfas treatment technologies such as gac and ix adsorbents franke et al 2019 liu et al 2019 rodowa et al 2020 fig 4 compares nf rejection values for pfcas fig 4a and pfsas fig 4b observed in afff gw versus afff spiked water matrices compared to the afff spiked water matrix rejection of all pfaas 98 lower rejection was observed in afff gw 92 98 with the largest differences being observed for the shorter chain pfsas the poor rejection of shorter chain pfsas indicates that natural groundwater constituents such as dom and ca2 table s1 inhibits rejection of the smallest pfsa compounds these and other groundwater constituents have been previously shown to decrease negative membrane surface charge i e less negative bellona et al 2010 tang et al 2007 xu et al 2006 which may result in reduced electrostatic repulsion of the anionic pfaas from the membrane polymer dom has also been shown to decrease rejection of pfass due to fouling enhanced concentration polarization where the concentration of solutes at the membrane surface are significantly higher than in the bulk solution song and elimelech 1995 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 likewise ca2 which is elevated in afff gw has been shown to cause much greater membrane fouling by dom due to the formation of dom ca 2 complexes lee et al 2005 3 3 adsorption of pfass and the impact of adsorption on rejection of pfass by nf the masses of selected pfaas in the afff spiked feed solution were observed to progressively decrease during extended 13 day recirculation tests with the nf membrane system these observations were attributed to adsorptive losses within the system since pfaas are non volatile and notoriously recalcitrant to degradation appleman et al 2014 kwok et al 2013 tenorio et al 2020 the 13 day recirculation experiment was repeated without the nf membrane elements installed to assess whether adsorption was occurring to the membrane elements or to other pilot system components e g pipes valves although mass losses to the membrane free system were observed for all pfaas greater losses were found when the membrane elements were installed fig 5 a demonstrating that both the membrane elements and other membrane system components can serve as adsorptive sinks for pfaas adsorption to both the membrane system and membrane elements as a percentage of the initial mass was greatest for pfos and pfhps fig 5b the two most hydrophobic pfaas suggesting an operative mechanism for the losses still with the exception of pfos adsorption of other pfaas was 20 after 13 days of recirculation additionally adsorption of pfaas to the membrane system and the membrane elements was similar and differed by 10 at most suggesting both the membrane system and the membrane elements have strong adsorptive affinities for the pfaas evaluated despite the observed adsorption of pfaas rejection calculated from measured feed and permeate concentrations remained consistently 98 over 13 days fig 6 demonstrating minimal effect on pfaa rejection no fouling or significant changes in average feed pressure were observed over the 13 days of operation as shown in fig s2 solute adsorption to membranes has been previously shown to decrease rejection of different solutes due to adsorption enhanced concentration polarization bellona and drewes 2005 bellona et al 2004 chang et al 2002 kimura et al 2003 however consistent rejection despite adsorption may imply adsorbed masses were either not high enough to cause adsorption enhanced concentration polarization or that pfass may be adsorbing to components other than the membrane itself in the membrane elements spiral wound membrane elements consist of three major components membrane feed spacer and permeate spacer while solute losses during membrane operation are generally attributed to adsorption to the membrane itself permeate and feed spacers may also act as adsorption sites thus to better understand where pfass may be adsorbing in a spiral wound membrane element separate batch adsorption experiments were conducted by equilibrating the afff spiked solution with coupons of nf membrane feed spacer and permeate spacer dissected from a virgin nf spiral wound membrane element in comparison to the control solution afff spiked solution with no membrane components the extent of adsorption was greatest for the highest molecular weight pfcas fig 7 a and pfsas fig 7b to the permeate spacer material while some adsorption to the membrane material was also observed adsorption to the permeate spacer was much more pronounced again the extent of adsorption to the permeate spacer and the membrane was greatest for the longer chain pfaas that exhibit the greatest hydrophobicity suggesting an operative mechanism it should be noted that adsorption of hydrophobic pfaas to the permeate spacer may result in artificially high rejection values if permeate concentrations are further suppressed by adsorption to the permeate spacer material after passing through the membrane overall the adsorption of pfaas to the permeate spacer suggests that rejection of pfaas and by extension other hydrophobic solutes may be a function of both the ability of the membrane to act as a separation barrier and the propensity of the solute to adsorb to membrane components further study is suggested to characterize solute adsorption to the permeate spacer and to assess whether this leads to higher rejection over sustained operation 4 conclusion this work evaluated the impacts of membrane operating conditions background water matrix and solute adsorption on rejection of diverse pfass in both an afff amended laboratory matrix and an afff impacted groundwater by spiral wound nf and ro membranes measurements confirm very high rejection 97 of most pfass at all operating conditions and water matrices evaluated while earlier studies had reported on membrane rejection of pfass this was the first work to examine rejection of pfass in afff derived water sources by nf and ro spiral wound membrane systems that better reflect engineered systems used in practice rejection of most pfass including 32 suspect pfass identified through high resolution mass spectrometry screening methods was unaffected by the range of operating conditions evaluated lower rejection 92 95 was observed for some shorter chain pfsas in afff impacted groundwater attributed to groundwater constituents e g dom ca2 that may interact with the sulfonate headgroup and inhibit rejection however similar inhibition was not observed for shorter chain pfcas structure activity analysis of the full suite of 42 pfass identified in the afff spiked water matrix showed some correlation between rejection and solute molecular weight adsorptive losses of hydrophobic pfaas especially pfos and pfhps to spiral wound membrane elements and the membrane system was observed adsorption to the permeate spacer was especially pronounced and further study is recommended to assess effects of adsorption on the long term treatment of solutes by nf and ro membranes still rejection of pfass by nf remained consistently 98 over 13

17444,the ubiquitous use and manufacturing of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass have led to the contamination of water resources worldwide high pressure membranes including nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro are increasingly being deployed for water treatment and may be an effective barrier to pfass however the impact of membrane operating conditions background water matrix and solute adsorption on rejection of diverse pfass by nf and ro remains unclear rejection of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas present in aqueous film forming foam afff diluted into a laboratory electrolyte matrix by nf and ro spiral wound elements was 98 and 99 respectively rejection of the same pfaas present in an afff impacted groundwater matrix by nf was lower between 92 98 and was attributed to background water matrix constituents operating conditions did not have a significant impact on rejection of pfass with the exception of shorter chain perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas in the afff

groundwater high resolution mass spectrometry 1 introduction due to their unique chemical properties per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass have been extensively used in the manufacturing of many industrial and consumer products leading to the detection of pfass in water resources worldwide including rivers lakes wastewaters groundwaters and surface waters houtz et al 2016 hu et al 2016 kim and kannan 2007 kwok et al 2013 quiñones and snyder 2009 a major source of groundwater contamination has been the widespread use of fire suppressing aqueous film forming foam afff at military and domestic fire training areas barzen hanson et al 2017 to protect human health and reduce the adverse health effects associated with some pfass the u s environmental protection agency usepa issued lifetime drinking water health advisory levels in 2016 for perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonate pfos at 70 ng l combined usepa 2016a b individual states have also set more stringent drinking water guidelines for pfoa pfos and other pfass resulting in greater challenges to entities seeking to provide safe drinking water simon et al 2019 pfass are difficult chemicals to degrade or remove from water and conventional drinking water and wastewater treatment processes are largely ineffective in their treatment appleman et al 2014 dauchy et al 2017 as a result significant research has been initiated to develop more effective pfas treatment technologies currently the most promising technologies involve physical separation of pfass from water by granular activated carbon gac anion exchange resins ix and high pressure membranes e g nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro franke et al 2019 liu et al 2019 rodowa et al 2020 although gac and ix are more cost effective than high pressure membranes for treatment of longer chain pfass such as pfos and pfoa high pressure membranes may be a better option where treatment of shorter chain pfass is desired given these compounds are poorly removed by adsorbents appleman et al 2014 franke et al 2019 additionally evaluating treatment of pfass by nf and ro membranes is important due to 1 the likely occurrence of pfass

al 2017 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 tang et al 2007 tang et al 2006 further research is needed to broaden adoption of high pressure membranes critical issues that need to be addressed include the rejection of diverse pfas compounds the influence of membrane operating conditions e g permeate flux recovery adsorption and water matrix on rejection of pfass and the potential for adsorption of pfass to various components in the membrane system to date most membrane studies have focused on treatment of a small number of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas most notably pfoa and pfos hang et al 2015 soriano et al 2017 tang et al 2007 tang et al 2006 with few studies reporting on rejection of a broader suite of pfass identified in afff impacted source waters recent advances in pfas compound discovery using high resolution mass spectrometry has revealed a much greater diversity of pfass including hundreds of potential polyfluorinated structures associated with afff releases backe et al 2013 barzen hanson et al 2017 oecd 2018 membrane treatment of these compounds remains largely unknown broadening the scope of treatment to include polyfluorinated structures is important not only because of their increased detection in the environment backe et al 2013 de silva et al 2011 and the potential adverse human health effects of these compounds but because polyfluorinated pfass have been shown to transform into pfaas harding marjanovic et al 2015 that have been linked to adverse human health effects usepa 2016a b to ensure experimental results are representative of full scale membrane applications membrane system configuration needs to be considered in study design because bench scale flat sheet membrane systems are convenient to operate they have been largely used in past pfas treatment studies appleman et al 2013 hang et al 2015 soriano et al 2017 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 tang et al 2007 tang et al 2006 however these systems may not provide results that are representative of the spiral wound membrane systems used in practice due to changing conditions along the length of a spiral wound element i e pressure concentration flux fujioka et al 2014 hancock et al 2011 regardless of possible differences between membrane configurations spiral wound elements are used in virtually all full scale high pressure membrane applications suggesting that experimentation with spiral wound elements is needed to best represent real world performance operating conditions such as water flux and recovery are likely to affect rejection of pfass wijmans and baker 1995 and a comprehensive assessment evaluating the impact of flux and recovery on rejection of diverse pfass has not been performed likewise solute adsorption interactions with membrane system components can affect the rejection values observed during experiments bellona et al 2004 xu et al 2006 while adsorption of pfass to membranes has been previously documented steinle darling and reinhard 2008 tang et al 2007 reports of the impacts on rejection have been limited to pfos tang et al 2007 furthermore little is known about the potential for pfas adsorption to components other than the membrane such as plastics llorca et al 2018 wang et al 2015 in the membrane system and in spiral wound membrane elements such as the feed and permeate spacers further work is also needed to assess

permeable membrane i e dilution effect where water flux is a function of pressure and membrane permeability and solute flux is a function of a solute s diffusion coefficient and concentration gradient wijmans and baker 1995 even at infinite flux however 100 rejection will likely not be reached due to imperfections in membrane materials spiegler and kedem 1966 and concentration polarization due to increased recovery song and elimelech 1995 rejection of pfaas in these experiments did not increase significantly as water flux increased likely because rejection was already high 98 by nf and 99 by ro at the lowest fluxes evaluated in addition for this system increasing flux causes an increase in recovery which is expected to result in higher permeate pfas concentrations from concentration polarization this phenomenon was not observed likely due to the dilution effect keeping permeate pfas concentrations relatively constant over the system operating conditions flux and recovery evaluated high rejection of pfaas by nf and ro is attributed to a combination of electrostatic repulsion and size exclusion appleman et al 2013 franke et al 2019 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 tang et al 2006 electrostatic repulsion occurs between pfaas which are anionic at ph 7 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 and the membrane polymer which is also expected to be negatively charged at ph 7 table 1 electrostatic repulsion has been shown to be an important rejection mechanism for pfass steinle darling and reinhard 2008 the high rejection of pfaas is also consistent with the mwco values of the nf 180 g mol and ro 100 g mol membranes being lower than the molecular weights of the pfaas examined this study 250 500 g mol the lower mwco of the ro membrane compared to that of the nf membrane is consistent with the higher rejection values observed with ro 99 than nf 98 similarly the differences in mwco between the two membranes is consistent with the fact that rejection by ro did not change significantly as compound molecular weight changed whereas there is a small effect 0 5 of increasing molecular weight and therefore decreasing solute diffusion coefficient on rejection of pfaas by nf presumably due to increased size exclusion for higher molecular weight compounds in general rejection values of pfass by nf 98 were comparable to those reported in previous studies using the same nf membrane 93 99 lower reported rejection values were due to high loq concentrations appleman et al 2013 franke et al 2019 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 3 1 1 rejection of suspect pfass in afff spiked solution in addition to the 10 pfaas detected by targeted lc qtof ms analysis 32 suspect pfass 24 unique molecular weights and 8 isomers were identified in the afff spiked solution table s4 no suspect pfass were detected in the afff gw proposed structures consistent with the molecular formulas are shown in table s5 backe et al 2013 barzen hanson et al 2017 d agostino and mabury 2014 de silva et al 2011 liu et al 2015 moe et al 2012 murray et al 2018 place and field 2012 rotander et al 2015 all suspect compounds were classified with level 4 confidence which is defined as unequivocal molecular formula but uncertain structure schymanski et al 2014 average rejection values for individual suspect pfass by nf over the full range of operating conditions table s2 are provided in table s5 and plotted in fig 2 like the pfaas none of the suspect pfass were detected in the ro permeate consistent with the membrane s lower mwco estimated rejection values with nf were high exceeding 98 for all suspect pfass with one notable exception pentahydrido fluoroheptane sulfate fig 2 shows that rejection of targeted pfaas and suspect pfass in afff spiked feed solution increases with increasing molecular weight in contrast varying polar functional groups e g carboxylate sulfonate amine and ionic charges e g negative positive zwitterionic of the structures did not have a discernable effect on rejection of suspect pfass one notable outlier to the observed trend in nf rejection pentahydrido fluoroheptane sulfate 375 g mol exhibited lower rejection than other pfass 96 6 1 4 the lower rejection of this compound may be an artifact of the large uncertainty associated with the measurements alternatively the lower rejection may be due to the presence of an ether functional group in the structure which promotes increased solute membrane affinity through hydrogen bonding interactions xu et al 2006 overall measurements indicate that nf and ro membranes are effective barriers for removal of the full diversity of afff derived pfass evaluated in this study subsequent experiments and analyses focused on treatment of pfass with nf because both nf and ro membranes yielded high and similar levels of pfaa rejection and equivalent permeate fluxes can be achieved for nf with much lower operating pressures e g 60 lower than that of ro making nf a more economical treatment option for pfass 3 2 rejection of pfass by nf in afff gw fig 3 shows rejection of pfaas in afff gw by nf measured at operating system fluxes and single pass system recoveries corresponding to those presented in fig 1 for pfcas and longer chain pfsas operating conditions did not have a significant impact on rejection similar to effects already noted for the afff spiked matrix in contrast operating conditions did have an impact on the rejection of shorter chain pfsas pfpes pfbs pfprs where rejection increased with increasing system flux as predicted by common membrane diffusion models wijmans and baker 1995 however it is unclear why the same trends were not observed for shorter chain pfcas and results unfortunately could not be compared against other studies that have evaluated rejection of pfass in groundwater due to reported permeate concentrations below the loq franke et al 2019 one possible explanation would be differences in sulfonate and carboxylate head group interactions with groundwater constituents e g dom ca2 that affect solute membrane interactions and promote greater transport through the nf membrane differing treatment of pfcas and pfsas have also been reported for other pfas treatment technologies such as gac and ix adsorbents franke et al 2019 liu et al 2019 rodowa et al 2020 fig 4 compares nf rejection values for pfcas fig 4a and pfsas fig 4b observed in afff gw versus afff spiked water matrices compared to the afff spiked water matrix rejection of all pfaas 98 lower rejection was observed in afff gw 92 98 with the largest differences being observed for the shorter chain pfsas the poor rejection of shorter chain pfsas indicates that natural groundwater constituents such as dom and ca2 table s1 inhibits rejection of the smallest pfsa compounds these and other groundwater constituents have been previously shown to decrease negative membrane surface charge i e less negative bellona et al 2010 tang et al 2007 xu et al 2006 which may result in reduced electrostatic repulsion of the anionic pfaas from the membrane polymer dom has also been shown to decrease rejection of pfass due to fouling enhanced concentration polarization where the concentration of solutes at the membrane surface are significantly higher than in the bulk solution song and elimelech 1995 steinle darling and reinhard 2008 likewise ca2 which is elevated in afff gw has been shown to cause much greater membrane fouling by dom due to the formation of dom ca 2 complexes lee et al 2005 3 3 adsorption of pfass and the impact of adsorption on rejection of pfass by nf the masses of selected pfaas in the afff spiked feed solution were observed to progressively decrease during extended 13 day recirculation tests with the nf membrane system these observations were attributed to adsorptive losses within the system since pfaas are non volatile and notoriously recalcitrant to degradation appleman et al 2014 kwok et al 2013 tenorio et al 2020 the 13 day recirculation experiment was repeated without the nf membrane elements installed to assess whether adsorption was occurring to the membrane elements or to other pilot system components e g pipes valves although mass losses to the membrane free system were observed for all pfaas greater losses were found when the membrane elements were installed fig 5 a demonstrating that both the membrane elements and other membrane system components can serve as adsorptive sinks for pfaas adsorption to both the membrane system and membrane elements as a percentage of the initial mass was greatest for pfos and pfhps fig 5b the two most hydrophobic pfaas suggesting an operative mechanism for the losses still with the exception of pfos adsorption of other pfaas was 20 after 13 days of recirculation additionally adsorption of pfaas to the membrane system and the membrane elements was similar and differed by 10 at most suggesting both the membrane system and the membrane elements have strong adsorptive affinities for the pfaas evaluated despite the observed adsorption of pfaas rejection calculated from measured feed and permeate concentrations remained consistently 98 over 13 days fig 6 demonstrating minimal effect on pfaa rejection no fouling or significant changes in average feed pressure were observed over the 13 days of operation as shown in fig s2 solute adsorption to membranes has been previously shown to decrease rejection of different solutes due to adsorption enhanced concentration polarization bellona and drewes 2005 bellona et al 2004 chang et al 2002 kimura et al 2003 however consistent rejection despite adsorption may imply adsorbed masses were either not high enough to cause adsorption enhanced concentration polarization or that pfass may be adsorbing to components other than the membrane itself in the membrane elements spiral wound membrane elements consist of three major components membrane feed spacer and permeate spacer while solute losses during membrane operation are generally attributed to adsorption to the membrane itself permeate and feed spacers may also act as adsorption sites thus to better understand where pfass may be adsorbing in a spiral wound membrane element separate batch adsorption experiments were conducted by equilibrating the afff spiked solution with coupons of nf membrane feed spacer and permeate spacer dissected from a virgin nf spiral wound membrane element in comparison to the control solution afff spiked solution with no membrane components the extent of adsorption was greatest for the highest molecular weight pfcas fig 7 a and pfsas fig 7b to the permeate spacer material while some adsorption to the membrane material was also observed adsorption to the permeate spacer was much more pronounced again the extent of adsorption to the permeate spacer and the membrane was greatest for the longer chain pfaas that exhibit the greatest hydrophobicity suggesting an operative mechanism it should be noted that adsorption of hydrophobic pfaas to the permeate spacer may result in artificially high rejection values if permeate concentrations are further suppressed by adsorption to the permeate spacer material after passing through the membrane overall the adsorption of pfaas to the permeate spacer suggests that rejection of pfaas and by extension other hydrophobic solutes may be a function of both the ability of the membrane to act as a separation barrier and the propensity of the solute to adsorb to membrane components further study is suggested to characterize solute adsorption to the permeate spacer and to assess whether this leads to higher rejection over sustained operation 4 conclusion this work evaluated the impacts of membrane operating conditions background water matrix and solute adsorption on rejection of diverse pfass in both an afff amended laboratory matrix and an afff impacted groundwater by spiral wound nf and ro membranes measurements confirm very high rejection 97 of most pfass at all operating conditions and water matrices evaluated while earlier studies had reported on membrane rejection of pfass this was the first work to examine rejection of pfass in afff derived water sources by nf and ro spiral wound membrane systems that better reflect engineered systems used in practice rejection of most pfass including 32 suspect pfass identified through high resolution mass spectrometry screening methods was unaffected by the range of operating conditions evaluated lower rejection 92 95 was observed for some shorter chain pfsas in afff impacted groundwater attributed to groundwater constituents e g dom ca2 that may interact with the sulfonate headgroup and inhibit rejection however similar inhibition was not observed for shorter chain pfcas structure activity analysis of the full suite of 42 pfass identified in the afff spiked water matrix showed some correlation between rejection and solute molecular weight adsorptive losses of hydrophobic pfaas especially pfos and pfhps to spiral wound membrane elements and the membrane system was observed adsorption to the permeate spacer was especially pronounced and further study is recommended to assess effects of adsorption on the long term treatment of solutes by nf and ro membranes still rejection of pfass by nf remained consistently 98 over 13
