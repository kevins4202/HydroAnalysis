8240,study region the pungwe river basin which is predominantly rural is a transboundary river shared between zimbabwe and mozambique the riparian communities along the river largely depend on the availability of streamflow for their livelihoods which are now being threatened by the effects of a changing climate study focus the study assessed the effects of climate change on water resources availability in 10 selected headwater sub catchments of the pungwe river basin using the pitman hydrological model the model was driven by 10 statistically downscaled climate models forced with rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 for the near 2020 2060 and far 2061 2099 futures new hydrological insights for the region the results of water resources availability varied depending on whether the short or long term scenarios were modelled 70 of the sub catchments predicted an increase in stream flow for the near and far future under the rcp 4 5 emission scenario under the rcp 8 5 scenario a decrease in streamflow was simulated for all sub catchments with the decrease ranging from 4 17 to 71 69 the reduction in water resources would be significant in the drier parts of the basin than in the wetter parts which are projected to maintain approximately 90 of current streamflow levels given the uncertainty in future climate simulations it is prudent that both scenarios be regarded as probabilities thus effective adaptive basin management should consider both keywords headwater catchments climate change delta change pitman model pungwe river basin rural livelihoods spatsim uncertainty 1 introduction survival and development of riparian communities depends on the presence of freshwater resources of good quality and adequate quantity rural communities in southern africa rely on natural rainfall for crop production with rain fed agriculture being dominant in the region beyer et al 2015 during the dry season riparian agro based communities rely on streamflow for their activities and the surrounding biodiversity okello et al 2015 peak flows occur during the rainy season while low flows occur during the dry period which is the most pronounced period in southern africa water abstractions are high during the dry period to sustain agricultural activities of the riparian communities and the riparian ecosystems as such adequate low flows are essential during the dry period to sustain communities and the environment climate change is however affecting the occurrence of streamflow within the region studies e g fao 2011 misra 2014 niang et al 2014 show that climate change will intensify the global climate cycle resulting in frequent more severe weather events that will affect the availability of water resources a changing climate has significant implications on riparian communities who already face many socio economic constraints moss et al 2008 floods damage infrastructure droughts reduce water resources availability increasing crop failure and the spread of diseases howard et al 2016 the vulnerability of southern africa arises from an interlinkage of problems arising from low adaptive capacity to changes in climate and high dependency on natural resources nyahunda and tirivangasi 2019 the effects of climate change will not be evenly distributed across the region different areas will be affected differently based on prevailing socio economic political and environmental factors there is therefore a need for localised research in assessing the impact of climate change on water resources this study assessed 10 selected headwater sub catchments of the upper pungwe river basin a transboundary river basin between zimbabwe and mozambique statistically downscaled climate data rainfall and evaporation from the climate systems analysis group csag forced with representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 were used to drive the pitman pitman 1973 hydrological monthly model the spatsim spatial and time series information model version of the pitman model hughes et al 2006 hughes and forsyth 2006 was used for this study the combination of the hydrological model and the projections from the chosen global circulation models gcms was used to evaluate the impact of climate change on water resources in the selected headwater sub catchments the headwater catchments provide essential ecosystems goods and services to downstream areas the information generated from this study will provide important baseline information for the pungwe river basin as the study area is limited in terms of availability of quantitative water demand studies sida 2004 2 description of study area pungwe river fig 1 originates from mount nyangani in the eastern highlands of zimbabwe and flows in an easterly direction passing through mozambique to the indian ocean the estimated length of the river is 400 km covering a total catchment area of 31 151 km2 sida 2008 about 5 of the basin area drains in zimbabwe with the remainder in mozambique the sub catchments studied are dominated by red soils derived from iron rich geological formations the soils are deep upwards of 2 m in some areas promoting agricultural activities but shallow on the slopes of hilly areas thompson 1966 the north western part of the pungwe river basin prb is generally a wet region with a mean annual precipitation map ranging from 1200 mm yr to above 2020 mm yr the mean potential annual evaporation mae is between 1380 1590 mm yr depending on temperature and relative humidity sida 2008 the eastern highlands are generally steep and a transition to gentle sloped lowlands as the river flows to the coast in mozambique there is rich plant and animal diversity within the study area which is supported by streamflow availability which provides a medium for biochemical reactions spawning of fish species and transportation of end products of ecosystems interactions high rainfall rich soils and perennial rivers make agricultural activities prominent water is used for commercial farming in estates and small holder irrigation schemes established along the river the presence of continuous streamflow and rugged terrain promotes the establishment of small scale hydropower stations for local use the most significant abstraction from the river is for public use for the city of mutare in zimbabwe about 22 million cubic meters mcm is abstracted annually from f14 sub catchment sida 2004 at a maximum rate of 1 m3 s therefore it is imperative to understand how climate change is likely to impact on the future water resources availability in the basin 3 materials and methods 3 1 the pitman model the pitman model pitman 1973 hughes et al 2006 is a semi distributed conceptual model driven by total monthly precipitation time series and mean annual potential evaporation tumbo and hughes 2015 the model has been extensively used for streamflow studies in southern africa in both gauged and ungauged river basins kapangaziwiri et al 2012 when available historical streamflow time series are used to calibrate the model for use in chosen sub catchments bharati and gamage 2011 the pitman spatsim hughes and forsyth 2006 hughes et al 2006 with groundwater routines and 41 parameters was preferred fig 2 for its ability to incorporate some sources of uncertainty and simulating future stream flow scenarios using up to 10 projected climate datasets the parameters of the model represent general and expected hydrological processes as described in table 1 most parameters can be estimated from the physical basin characteristics and only 11 parameters are calibrated according to the rules established in hughes et al 2006 kapangaziwiri and hughes 2008 and kapangaziwiri et al 2012 the spatsim framework facilitates the management of different types of data used in environmental modelling and provides direct links to various models and has procedures for data analysis hughes et al 2006 hughes and forsyth 2006 offline gis software was used to generate shape files that were used to produce the study area its drainage and the location of gauging stations the initial run of the model used parameter values obtained from the sida 2004 study hydrological and meteorological data were collected from a network of monitoring stations in and around prb the zimbabwe national water authority zinwa is responsible for collection and management of streamflow data whereas the meteorological services department msd manages rainfall and evapotranspiration data the administração regional de águas ara centro is responsible for the collection and achieving of streamflow data while the instituto nacional de metereologia inam is responsible for rainfall and evapotranspiration on the mozambique side 3 2 datasets 3 2 1 global circulation models the estimations of future water resources utilised meteorological datasets obtained from ten 10 statistically downscaled gcms forced with rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 emission scenarios table 2 these datasets had a baseline period from 1960 to 2000 and were projected to the end of 2099 the selection of the gcms was based on their ability to predict historical observed meteorological variables particularly rainfall of the area 3 2 2 rainfall available historical observed rainfall datasets extended over 40 years table 3 which made them ideal for hydrological modelling and climate studies wmo 2017 however given the differences between the periods of available stream flow and rainfall datasets in some sub catchments the study had to use the climate research unit cru gridded time series dataset at 0 5 resolution harris et al 2014 covering the period 1901 2016 tirivarombo 2013 used the cru datasets in the zambezi river study where observations were limited and concluded that the cru data were of acceptable accuracy for use as surrogate data sources in the region 3 2 3 potential evapotranspiration the pitman model accepts monthly evapotranspiration data as time series inputs or as percentage of the mean annual total and the later were used table 4 the evaporation data were collected using class a pans from several stations within each of the sub catchments and then areal averages were calculated for every sub catchment 3 2 4 streamflow available streamflow data in mcm at monthly intervals table 5 were used to calibrate and validate the hydrological model setups however there were some possible uncertainties in the streamflow data that were a result of the different flow gauging instruments and accuracy of rating curves used by the two riparian countries zimbabwe has concrete gauging structures while mozambique generally uses natural stream sections that are usually prone to give false readings especially during peak flows sida 2004 zimbabwe data were more reliable compared to those from mozambique sida 2004 3 3 hydrological model calibration validation and climate projections 3 3 1 model calibration the calibration of the hydrological model sought to a achieve goodness of fit between the simulated and the observed hydrographs visual analysis was used to spot the differences between the observed and simulated hydrographs when a parameter value was changed b assess the simulations using statistical objective functions in spatsim scatter plots using statistical objective functions such as nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 a percentage difference of means for both the normal and natural logarithm transformed values annual flow duration curves fdcs and monthly distribution curves mdcs were used to validate the visual observations made and c to give confidence in model s simulation capacity the calibration started with manual trial and error approach and followed by automatic calibration after a best fit was obtained between the simulated and observed graphs the optimal parameter sets were collected these parameter sets were then used to guide automatic calibration the sensitivity analysis of model parameters was guided by kapangaziwiri and hughes 2008 who explained the process of parameterization of the model and how parameters behaved in different environmental conditions the r2 nse and percentage differences between the observed and simulated values were calculated for all the calibrated sub catchments given the uncertainty related to the quality of historical observed streamflow data this study regarded a percentage difference of 10 to be an acceptable variance when using the r2 and nse objective functions the study adopted the acceptance criteria as being values above 0 5 the assessment of the medium to low flows was based on natural logarithm transformed values 3 3 2 validation proxy basin and split sample approaches were used for validation purposes the proxy basin validation was carried out for sub catchments where the length of the streamflow time series was limited split sample validation was carried out on f1 and f14 sub catchments as they had sufficiently longer data periods 3 4 uncertainty in future water predictions the uncertainty related to future water resources prediction or bias correction was addressed using the delta change approach downscaled datasets from gcms are affected by biases between the observed time series and simulated data such data should therefore be corrected before use in a climate change study to improve confidence in the generated results andersson et al 2011 the delta change approach was applied to the rainfall datasets from the climate models the approach compares statistical properties of simulated rainfall to those of the observed time series mora et al 2014 corrections are then applied to the simulated rainfall datasets to correct the biases hughes 2015 details the procedure that was adopted for this study in preserving the statistical properties of the data application of the delta change process in spatsim uses a series of models and procedures as explained by hughes 2015 and kapangaziwiri et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation the r2 and nse evaluates the model s ability to simulate the future through comparing simulated and observed hydrographs croke 2009 they are however limited in giving a hydrological explanation on flow distribution hydrological meaning of the simulation results was given using annual flow duration curves fdcs and monthly distribution curves mdcs the 10th percentile q10 of the fdc shows high flows of the stream flow system while the low flows would generally be shown by the 90th percentile q90 with the tail end indicating whether the stream is perennial all the studied sub catchments had the same characteristic shape and gradient of streams that occur in tropical regions which receive their rainfall for a shorter period of the year with the remainder being a dry period the continuity of the stream flow is then maintained by base flows the response of the simulated hydrograph to a parameter value change determined its sensitivity and indicated its importance to the calibration process in the sub catchment parameters of importance for the studied sub catchments are given in table 6 and their importance was confirmed by previous studies in the region hughes et al 2006 kapangaziwiri and hughes 2008 the calibration results for sub catchments are presented in table 7 and the visual analysis of the hydrographs presented in fig 3 the results show that both r2 and nse statistics showed good performance ratios for most sub catchments except for f22 e70 and e72 which performed poorly the modelling period for f22 was short 8 years to bring about meaningful conclusions about the performance of the model kapangaziwiri 2011 such a short period cannot fully address the hydrological characteristics of the sub catchment however parameterization of the sub catchment was important for the modelling of downstream basins e64 kapangaziwiri 2011 e70 and e72 are in an isolated area north west of the pungwe basin the data from these sub catchments is not meaningful due to issues with the rating curves used sida 2004 they were however considered in the study to represent all the major sources that contribute to the water resources of the pungwe river nse is more robust than r2 but using both methods of analysis gives more information while the nse is sensitive to systematic errors general over or under estimation r2 is not similarly affected though a value close to 1 does not necessarily imply a good hydrological simulation croke 2009 where both the nse and r2 are used as assessment criteria large differences between them indicate systematic errors as in the case of f22 e70 and e72 for instance the r2 values for f1 were 0 80 and 0 73 and for f14 they were 0 65 and 0 69 for peak and low flows respectively for the former sub catchment the nse values were 0 67 for peak flows and 0 62 for low flows as well as 0 517 for peak flows and 0 59 for low flow for the latter such values fell within the acceptable range of model efficiency and demonstrated the effectiveness of the model parameters chosen to predict water availability scenarios f1 and f14 were validated by the split sample method the graphical presentation of the validation results is presented in fig 4 the graphs show a high goodness of fit between the simulated and observed graphs f1 had better simulation results than f14 but both were within the range of acceptance fig 5 shows the resulting mdc for station e73 the graph shows an over simulation of the peak flows but the low flows were simulated better the sub catchment is agro based with livelihoods dependent on a continuous all year flow making a significant component of the water resources the mdc shows peak flows in february followed by a decline after april which marks commencement of the dry period and is typical of all sub catchments the fdc and mdc results for all the sub catchments are described in tables 8 and 9 respectively 4 2 current water resources based on historical observations the current water resources ranged between 6 mm3 simulated for f1 to 757 mm3 for e64 table 10 with strong low flows f1 has the least drainage area 6 km2 and had the lowest mar when compared to all the other headwater sub catchments the average current water resources of the study area is 814 mm3 for the sub catchments in zimbabwe and 101 mm3 for those in mozambique at f14 which is located just after the abstraction point for the city of mutare the perennial nature of the river is shown with flows persistent even during the dry periods the predominant perennial nature of rivers in the studied sub catchments could be explained by the presence of a series of interlinked storages which can recharge store and discharge water resources at any time controlled by the physiographic characteristics of the region scanlon et al 2002 such processes as infiltration hydraulic characteristics evapotranspiration rates the climate of the area recharge and distribution of vegetation have a direct influence on aquifer storativity and discharge in this part of the basin feng et al 2013 this leads to the maintenance of high and persistent base flows that supply the stream in dry seasons feng et al 2013 4 3 impact of climate change on water resources fdcs were used to illustrate the variations of future water resources for the near and far future periods for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios fig 6 the results for both emission scenarios showed significant variability when compared with the observed period the near future period under rcp 4 5 predicted an increase in available water resources across all stations except for e72 and e483 the far future period predicted slight reduction from the near future under the same rcp scenario a decrease in water resources was predicted for both the near and far futures under the rcp 8 5 emission scenario the predicted reduction was more significant for e72 e483 and e73 which were 43 68 and 71 respectively however the results for e72 and e73 may need to be considered as hugely uncertainty because of the less than acceptable performance during the calibration validation processes the observed records are not very good based on the unreliable rating curves sida 2004 a previous study on the impacts of climate change on water resources in the prb andersson et al 2011 had similar results andersson et al 2011 concluded that streamflow at the end of 2099 in the drier parts of the basin would decrease to about 55 75 of the mar compared to the baseline period these three sub catchments reported above which showed significant change in water resource i e e72 e483 and e73 are in the drier parts of the basin the rest of the sub catchments were predicted to experience significantly less adverse impact of a changing climate on water resources availability as a result the decrease related to these sub catchments ranged from 4 17 for f1 to 13 35 for e64 andersson et al 2011 also concluded that sub catchments in the wetter part of the basin had future water resources would only be reduced by approximately 10 from the baseline period which is in the same range as the results of this study climate change is expected to increase water stress in regions that are relatively dry around the world studies by dakhlaoui et al 2020 schilling et al 2020 show that the drier regions of the world are likely to get drier while wet regions might get wetter the results of this study show the same trend of change as in other regions dry regions becoming drier while wet regions get wetter the pitman model relies on limited available data to project future water with some degree of certainty the model works well for small catchments with hilly terrain which makes the study of headwater catchments easier headwater catchments are generally data scarce areas because accessibility is a challenge in these geographical locations the pitman model can however work with limited data to generate data and information that can be used in decision making in the study of climate change impacts it is imperative to carryout similar studies after a certain time interval to verify initial results obtained this is because technological developments are making hydrological models more robust projections by climate models are getting better and emission scenarios are improved frequently laudien et al 2010 decision making would thus need to be informed by the latest data to decide on whether to follow initial plans drawn or to create entirely new courses of action based on the new information the study assumed a change within a range of 10 difference could be regarded as not so significant rcp 4 5 emission scenario generally predicted a future which is close to the current period whilst rcp 8 5 projected a decline in water resources this is in line with the conclusions of coulibaly et al 2018 for impacts of climate change on water resources in sassandra west africa bodian et al 2015 also had similar trend of their results this current study serves as a baseline study for climate change studies within the prb area the changes realised for future water resources under both emission scenarios show a future that is not clearly threatened by climate change except for the sub catchments e70 e72 and e483 this study only addressed one element impacting water resources availability and is a significant baseline study which should be improved as when more data become available it could be enhanced through incorporating land use changes and population dynamics to fully account for probable future changes in water demand decrease in streamflow availability in the future will significantly affect the issuing of water use permits in the area environmental flows that promote riparian ecosystems dry period farming activities and important ecological headwater functions and services such as spawning of fish species sediment and pollution control and transportation of nutrients downstream meyer et al 2007 the upper pungwe river is important for eco tourism agriculture and hydropower energy generation these activities would be adversely affected by significant a decrease in water resources in the future results of this research should encourage climate change scientists to focus more on localised studies as opposed to regional studies a large spatial extent averages the results over a region though useful in determining the general trends some areas in the region might have significantly different characteristics to the averages this is the case for the headwater parts of the prb for sustainable development localised studies would inform the changes to be expected and resources could then be used to mitigate such changes area specific research projects should be adopted in different regions around the globe for sustainable development and solutions that are driven by local information 5 conclusion the water resources availability of 10 selected headwater sub catchments in the pungwe river basin were quantified to ascertain its current state and how it could potentially be affected by climate change in the future future water resources availability was simulated using statistically downscaled climate data forced with rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 to the year 2100 as input to drive the pitman spatsim hydrological model the hydrological model was calibrated validated and coupled with the projected climate data estimated the future water for the near 2020 2060 and far 2061 2099 future under the selected emission scenarios the parameters derived for the calibration and validation periods were used without variation in an uncertainty framework kapangaziwiri et al 2012 hughes 2015 kapangaziwiri et al 2018 to address probable changes to these results for both the near and far future scenarios showed variations in future water availability with significant decrease in water realised under rcp 8 5 the magnitudes of change using rcp 4 5 were not significant to cause a change on water availability in the future the research acknowledges uncertainties in the results because of the quality of the available observed datasets the level of confidence in the model generated results is adequate for a baseline study and can be used to inform management strategies for the headwater sub catchments the results also collaborated the findings of previous research carried out in the area the study concluded that rcp 4 5 projects a future with almost 90 of the current water resources while the rcp 8 5 projects a decrease in water resources by as much as 71 water resources could be significantly reduced in the drier sub catchments than in the wet sub catchments there is a need for continuous assessment of water resources as new information becomes available however implementation of sustainable developmental plans would require research that encompasses more factors that affect water resources availability in river systems this could be achieved by incorporating an ensemble of models hydrologic and climate that can assess other elements of the environment such as land use changes temperature changes and biodiversity etc author s statement the paper being

calibration the calibration of the hydrological model sought to a achieve goodness of fit between the simulated and the observed hydrographs visual analysis was used to spot the differences between the observed and simulated hydrographs when a parameter value was changed b assess the simulations using statistical objective functions in spatsim scatter plots using statistical objective functions such as nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 a percentage difference of means for both the normal and natural logarithm transformed values annual flow duration curves fdcs and monthly distribution curves mdcs were used to validate the visual observations made and c to give confidence in model s simulation capacity the calibration started with manual trial and error approach and followed by automatic calibration after a best fit was obtained between the simulated and observed graphs the optimal parameter sets were collected these parameter sets were then used to guide automatic calibration the sensitivity analysis of model parameters was guided by kapangaziwiri and hughes 2008 who explained the process of parameterization of the model and how parameters behaved in different environmental conditions the r2 nse and percentage differences between the observed and simulated values were calculated for all the calibrated sub catchments given the uncertainty related to the quality of historical observed streamflow data this study regarded a percentage difference of 10 to be an acceptable variance when using the r2 and nse objective functions the study adopted the acceptance criteria as being values above 0 5 the assessment of the medium to low flows was based on natural logarithm transformed values 3 3 2 validation proxy basin and split sample approaches were used for validation purposes the proxy basin validation was carried out for sub catchments where the length of the streamflow time series was limited split sample validation was carried out on f1 and f14 sub catchments as they had sufficiently longer data periods 3 4 uncertainty in future water predictions the uncertainty related to future water resources prediction or bias correction was addressed using the delta change approach downscaled datasets from gcms are affected by biases between the observed time series and simulated data such data should therefore be corrected before use in a climate change study to improve confidence in the generated results andersson et al 2011 the delta change approach was applied to the rainfall datasets from the climate models the approach compares statistical properties of simulated rainfall to those of the observed time series mora et al 2014 corrections are then applied to the simulated rainfall datasets to correct the biases hughes 2015 details the procedure that was adopted for this study in preserving the statistical properties of the data application of the delta change process in spatsim uses a series of models and procedures as explained by hughes 2015 and kapangaziwiri et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation the r2 and nse evaluates the model s ability to simulate the future through comparing simulated and observed hydrographs croke 2009 they are however limited in giving a hydrological explanation on flow distribution hydrological meaning of the simulation results was given using annual flow duration curves fdcs and monthly distribution curves mdcs the 10th percentile q10 of the fdc shows high flows of the stream flow system while the low flows would generally be shown by the 90th percentile q90 with the tail end indicating whether the stream is perennial all the studied sub catchments had the same characteristic shape and gradient of streams that occur in tropical regions which receive their rainfall for a shorter period of the year with the remainder being a dry period the continuity of the stream flow is then maintained by base flows the response of the simulated hydrograph to a parameter value change determined its sensitivity and indicated its importance to the calibration process in the sub catchment parameters of importance for the studied sub catchments are given in table 6 and their importance was confirmed by previous studies in the region hughes et al 2006 kapangaziwiri and hughes 2008 the calibration results for sub catchments are presented in table 7 and the visual analysis of the hydrographs presented in fig 3 the results show that both r2 and nse statistics showed good performance ratios for most sub catchments except for f22 e70 and e72 which performed poorly the modelling period for f22 was short 8 years to bring about meaningful conclusions about the performance of the model kapangaziwiri 2011 such a short period cannot fully address the hydrological characteristics of the sub catchment however parameterization of the sub catchment was important for the modelling of downstream basins e64 kapangaziwiri 2011 e70 and e72 are in an isolated area north west of the pungwe basin the data from these sub catchments is not meaningful due to issues with the rating curves used sida 2004 they were however considered in the study to represent all the major sources that contribute to the water resources of the pungwe river nse is more robust than r2 but using both methods of analysis gives more information while the nse is sensitive to systematic errors general over or under estimation r2 is not similarly affected though a value close to 1 does not necessarily imply a good hydrological simulation croke 2009 where both the nse and r2 are used as assessment criteria large differences between them indicate systematic errors as in the case of f22 e70 and e72 for instance the r2 values for f1 were 0 80 and 0 73 and for f14 they were 0 65 and 0 69 for peak and low flows respectively for the former sub catchment the nse values were 0 67 for peak flows and 0 62 for low flows as well as 0 517 for peak flows and 0 59 for low flow for the latter such values fell within the acceptable range of model efficiency and demonstrated the effectiveness of the model parameters chosen to predict water availability scenarios f1 and f14 were validated by the split sample method the graphical presentation of the validation results is presented in fig 4 the graphs show a high goodness of fit between the simulated and observed graphs f1 had better simulation results than f14 but both were within the range of acceptance fig 5 shows the resulting mdc for station e73 the graph shows an over simulation of the peak flows but the low flows were simulated better the sub catchment is agro based with livelihoods dependent on a continuous all year flow making a significant component of the water resources the mdc shows peak flows in february followed by a decline after april which marks commencement of the dry period and is typical of all sub catchments the fdc and mdc results for all the sub catchments are described in tables 8 and 9 respectively 4 2 current water resources based on historical observations the current water resources ranged between 6 mm3 simulated for f1 to 757 mm3 for e64 table 10 with strong low flows f1 has the least drainage area 6 km2 and had the lowest mar when compared to all the other headwater sub catchments the average current water resources of the study area is 814 mm3 for the sub catchments in zimbabwe and 101 mm3 for those in mozambique at f14 which is located just after the abstraction point for the city of mutare the perennial nature of the river is shown with flows persistent even during the dry periods the predominant perennial nature of rivers in the studied sub catchments could be explained by the presence of a series of interlinked storages which can recharge store and discharge water resources at any time controlled by the physiographic characteristics of the region scanlon et al 2002 such processes as infiltration hydraulic characteristics evapotranspiration rates the climate of the area recharge and distribution of vegetation have a direct influence on aquifer storativity and discharge in this part of the basin feng et al 2013 this leads to the maintenance of high and persistent base flows that supply the stream in dry seasons feng et al 2013 4 3 impact of climate change on water resources fdcs were used to illustrate the variations of future water resources for the near and far future periods for the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios fig 6 the results for both emission scenarios showed significant variability when compared with the observed period the near future period under rcp 4 5 predicted an increase in available water resources across all stations except for e72 and e483 the far future period predicted slight reduction from the near future under the same rcp scenario a decrease in water resources was predicted for both the near and far futures under the rcp 8 5 emission scenario the predicted reduction was more significant for e72 e483 and e73 which were 43 68 and 71 respectively however the results for e72 and e73 may need to be considered as hugely uncertainty because of the less than acceptable performance during the calibration validation processes the observed records are not very good based on the unreliable rating curves sida 2004 a previous study on the impacts of climate change on water resources in the prb andersson et al 2011 had similar results andersson et al 2011 concluded that streamflow at the end of 2099 in the drier parts of the basin would decrease to about 55 75 of the mar compared to the baseline period these three sub catchments reported above which showed significant change in water resource i e e72 e483 and e73 are in the drier parts of the basin the rest of the sub catchments were predicted to experience significantly less adverse impact of a changing climate on water resources availability as a result the decrease related to these sub catchments ranged from 4 17 for f1 to 13 35 for e64 andersson et al 2011 also concluded that sub catchments in the wetter part of the basin had future water resources would only be reduced by approximately 10 from the baseline period which is in the same range as the results of this study climate change is expected to increase water stress in regions that are relatively dry around the world studies by dakhlaoui et al 2020 schilling et al 2020 show that the drier regions of the world are likely to get drier while wet regions might get wetter the results of this study show the same trend of change as in other regions dry regions becoming drier while wet regions get wetter the pitman model relies on limited available data to project future water with some degree of certainty the model works well for small catchments with hilly terrain which makes the study of headwater catchments easier headwater catchments are generally data scarce areas because accessibility is a challenge in these geographical locations the pitman model can however work with limited data to generate data and information that can be used in decision making in the study of climate change impacts it is imperative to carryout similar studies after a certain time interval to verify initial results obtained this is because technological developments are making hydrological models more robust projections by climate models are getting better and emission scenarios are improved frequently laudien et al 2010 decision making would thus need to be informed by the latest data to decide on whether to follow initial plans drawn or to create entirely new courses of action based on the new information the study assumed a change within a range of 10 difference could be regarded as not so significant rcp 4 5 emission scenario generally predicted a future which is close to the current period whilst rcp 8 5 projected a decline in water resources this is in line with the conclusions of coulibaly et al 2018 for impacts of climate change on water resources in sassandra west africa bodian et al 2015 also had similar trend of their results this current study serves as a baseline study for climate change studies within the prb area the changes realised for future water resources under both emission scenarios show a future that is not clearly threatened by climate change except for the sub catchments e70 e72 and e483 this study only addressed one element impacting water resources availability and is a significant baseline study which should be improved as when more data become available it could be enhanced through incorporating land use changes and population dynamics to fully account for probable future changes in water demand decrease in streamflow availability in the future will significantly affect the issuing of water use permits in the area environmental flows that promote riparian ecosystems dry period farming activities and important ecological headwater functions and services such as spawning of fish species sediment and pollution control and transportation of nutrients downstream meyer et al 2007 the upper pungwe river is important for eco tourism agriculture and hydropower energy generation these activities would be adversely affected by significant a decrease in water resources in the future results of this research should encourage climate change scientists to focus more on localised studies as opposed to regional studies a large spatial extent averages the results over a region though useful in determining the general trends some areas in the region might have significantly different characteristics to the averages this is the case for the headwater parts of the prb for sustainable development localised studies would inform the changes to be expected and resources could then be used to mitigate such changes area specific research projects should be adopted in different regions around the globe for sustainable development and solutions that are driven by local information 5 conclusion the water resources availability of 10 selected headwater sub catchments in the pungwe river basin were quantified to ascertain its current state and how it could potentially be affected by climate change in the future future water resources availability was simulated using statistically downscaled climate data forced with rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 to the year 2100 as input to drive the pitman spatsim hydrological model the hydrological model was calibrated validated and coupled with the projected climate data estimated the future water for the near 2020 2060 and far 2061 2099 future under the selected emission scenarios the parameters derived for the calibration and validation periods were used without variation in an uncertainty framework kapangaziwiri et al 2012 hughes 2015 kapangaziwiri et al 2018 to address probable changes to these results for both the near and far future scenarios showed variations in future water availability with significant decrease in water realised under rcp 8 5 the magnitudes of change using rcp 4 5 were not significant to cause a change on water availability in the future the research acknowledges uncertainties in the results because of the quality of the available observed datasets the level of confidence in the model generated results is adequate for a baseline study and can be used to inform management strategies for the headwater sub catchments the results also collaborated the findings of previous research carried out in the area the study concluded that rcp 4 5 projects a future with almost 90 of the current water resources while the rcp 8 5 projects a decrease in water resources by as much as 71 water resources could be significantly reduced in the drier sub catchments than in the wet sub catchments there is a need for continuous assessment of water resources as new information becomes available however implementation of sustainable developmental plans would require research that encompasses more factors that affect water resources availability in river systems this could be achieved by incorporating an ensemble of models hydrologic and climate that can assess other elements of the environment such as land use changes temperature changes and biodiversity etc author s statement the paper being

8241,study region sixteen different sites from two provinces lorestan and illam in the western part of iran were considered for the field data measurement of cumulative infiltration infiltration rate and other effective variables that affect infiltration process study focus soil infiltration is recognized as a fundamental process of the hydrologic cycle affecting surface runoff soil erosion and groundwater recharge hence accurate prediction of the infiltration process is one of the most important tasks in hydrological science as direct measurement is difficult and costly and empirical models are inaccurate the current study proposed a standalone and optimized deep learning algorithm of a convolutional neural network cnn using gray wolf optimization gwo a genetic algorithm ga and an independent component analysis ica for cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate prediction first 154 raw datasets were collected including the time of measuring sand clay and silt percent bulk density soil moisture percent infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration using field survey next 70 of the dataset were used for model building and the remaining 30 was used for model validation then based on the correlation coefficient between input variables and outputs different input combinations were constructed finally the prediction power of each developed algorithm was evaluated using different visually based scatter plot box plot and taylor diagram and quantitatively based root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percentage of bias pbias metrics new hydrological insights for the region finding revealed that the time of measurement is more important for cumulative infiltration while soil characteristics i e silt content are more significant in infiltration rate prediction this shows that in the study area silt parameter which is the dominant constituent parameter can control infiltration process more effectively effectiveness of the variables in the present study in the order of importance are time silt clay moisture content sand and bulk density this can be related to the fact that most of study area is rangeland and thus overgrazing leads to compaction of the silt soil that can lead to a slow infiltration process soil moisture content and bulk density are not highly effective in our study because these two factors do not significantly change across the study area findings demonstrated that the optimum input variable combination is the one in which all input variables are considered the results illustrated that cnn algorithms have a very high performance while a metaheuristic algorithm enhanced the performance of a standalone cnn algorithm from 7 to 28 the results also showed that a cnn gwo algorithm outperformed the other algorithms followed by cnn ica cnn ga and cnn for both cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate prediction all developed algorithms underestimated cumulative infiltration while overestimating infiltration rates keywords cumulative infiltration infiltration rate deep learning cnn metaheuristic iran 1 introduction the soil water infiltration process plays a fundamental role in hydrology pedology hydrogeology irrigation and drainage systems kale and sahoo 2011 mahapatra et al 2020 ghumman et al 2018a from a computational point of view the infiltration can be defined as the ability of water to move into the soil strata angelaki et al 2013 total amount of water that soil strata are able to absorb from rainfall or irrigation in a given time is considered as a cumulative infiltration f t the velocity of the water entering into the soil in a given period of time is defined as the infiltration rate f t and the velocity of water entering into the soil in a specific amount of time is defined as an instantaneous infiltration rate hooshyar and wang 2016 mahmood and latif 2003 the rate of water infiltration into soil is controlled by several factors such as the initial moisture conditions of the ground s surface rainfall intensity soil and water temperature biological activities in the soil column soil texture porosity and compactness and surface cover conditions angelaki et al 2013 ma et al 2015 hooshyar and wang 2016 infiltration contributes to groundwater recharge the movement of soil solutes through the ground the water budget of vegetation runoff flood generation and soil erosion in addition the movement of chemical contaminants through soil and into groundwater is mainly controlled by the water infiltration process and overall watershed management plans angelaki et al 2004 mahapatra et al 2020 in addition the success of surface irrigation methods is mainly governed by soil infiltration characteristics ghumman et al 2018b fan et al 2018 and the efficiency of irrigation depends largely on the spatial and temporal variations in the infiltration characteristics khatri and smith 2006 therefore quantifying the infiltration process is important in watershed management over the years several authors worldwide have highlighted the difficulties encountered in direct soil water infiltration measurement which is a labor intensive and time consuming task huang et al 2016 jejurkar and rajurkar 2015 stephen et al 2010 puri et al 2011 therefore various physical and empirical equations have been developed for infiltration prediction based on the knowledge of water movement in the soil according to soil hydraulic properties lassabatere et al 2009 some example of these equations are green and ampt 1911 philip 1957a b richards 1931 the united states department of agriculture usda soil conservation service scs 1972 horton 1941 and kostiakov 1932 some drawbacks of these algorithms except simplicity which make them incapable to predict f t are homogeneity of soil and constant soil moisture content singh et al 2019a additionally these models involve only one or a few of the input variables while some effective variables such as soil texture and degree of compactness are neglected although numerical and physically based models i e topmodel and hydrus 3d can predict the infiltration process accurately the acquisition of data with high spatial resolutions i e heterogeneous soil data which is required for running these models is a difficult task especially for large catchments moreover recently infiltration processes have changed to a certain extent due to soil macro pores demand et al 2019 and soil biological activities cheik et al 2018 zaller et al 2014 fan et al 2020a b recently there have been increased efforts to propose alternative methods for accurately estimating the amount of soil water infiltration using different kinds of models based on data driven machine learning models angelaki et al 2018 rahmati 2017 sihag et al 2018a a sihag et al 2020b b sepahvand et al 2018 some benefits of these types of algorithms can be summarized as strong prediction performance easy and fast to develop robustness to missing data and the ability to handle large amounts of data at different scales ahmad and simonovic 2005 ahmad et al 2010 choubin et al 2014 kisi et al 2012 yaseen et al 2015 ateeq ur rauf et al 2018 thakur et al 2020 rahmati 2017 compared the group method of data handling gmdh multilayer perceptron artificial neural network mlpnn and multiple linear regression mlr models in predicting cumulative infiltrations f t using soils readily available characteristics racs i soil primary particles clay silt and sand ii saturated hydraulic conductivity ks iii soil densities bulk and particle iv organic carbon v wet aggregate stability vi electrical conductivity and vii soil antecedent θi and field saturated θ fs the study was conducted in iran and the obtained results showing that i among the racs characteristics the ks has the most influence on the model s accuracy and ii the best accuracy was obtained using the gmdh models singh et al 2017 compared random forest regression rf mlpnn and m5tree models in predicting soil s infiltration rate and showed that the rf model was more accurate the authors compared the genetic programming gp support vector machine svm multiple linear regression mlr models with kostiakov and philip s models in predicting the cumulative infiltration of sandy soil according to the obtained results the gp model was superior followed by the svm model the mlr model and the kostiakov model angelaki et al 2018 applied several machine learning models namely an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis svm and mlpnn models in predicting cumulative infiltration the best accuracy was obtained using the anfis model with a triangular membership function followed by the mlpnn and the svm models sihag et al 2018a b sihag et al 2019b and sepahvand et al 2018 compared ann gene expression programming gep anfis svm and rf algorithms for cumulative infiltration prediction and stated that the anfis model had the highest performance followed by the svm rf ann and gep algorithms sihag et al 2020a compared the ann svm rf gp machines learning models with kostiakov s and philip s models in predicting infiltration rate using various input variables they reported that the best accuracy was obtained using the gp with polynomial function while the lowest accuracy was obtained using the philip s model sihag et al 2020b used the svm with a radial basis function neural network svm rbf svm with a polynomial svm po kernel function grnn m5tree and mlr models in predicting cumulative infiltration the best accuracy was achieved using svm rbf while the lowest accuracy was achieved using the grnn model pahlavan rad et al 2020 applied mlr and rf for spatial prediction of soil water infiltration in south eastern iran they concluded that although both algorithms have a reasonable prediction power rf algorithm outperforms mlr resulting from a through literature review a summary of the developed algorithms for infiltration process prediction is presented in table 1 according to the literature review there is not a global algorithm that is perfect in all cases thus new robust algorithms are highly recommended the ann algorithm is one of the oldest developed algorithms but this algorithm has various drawbacks such as slow convergence speed kisi et al 2012 melesse et al 2011 svm can be time consuming to train since it is very sensitive to hyper parameter selection ahmad et al 2018 rf as a robust algorithm suffers from its complexity as well as being time consuming to build gmdh svm ann svm and other similar algorithms suffer from accurate determination of the models parameters especially weights in membership functions while their integration with metaheuristic algorithms has improved their prediction power significantly bui et al 2018 another limitation of these algorithms is that they only have one hidden layer in their structure lately deep learning algorithms i e convolution neural networks cnn which benefit from various hidden layers have been developed for solving more complex process with a higher degree of accuracy cnn algorithms are one of the well known types of dl which were developed for non time series datasets spatial distribution this kind of dl algorithm has been successfully applied for natural hazard susceptibility mapping including flash floods bui et al 2020a and landslides bui et al 2020b wang et al 2020 while they have not been used for hydrologic forecasting problems yet additionally these robust strong and high level algorithms have many parameters in their structures that need to be optimized similar to ann anfis and so on in the present research the prediction capability of a standalone cnn model and a cnn optimized algorithm using a genetic algorithm cnn ga grey wolf optimization cnn gwo and an imperialist competitive algorithm cnn ica were investigated for cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate prediction using in situ observations of sand clay silt density g cm3 and moisture content as input variables the main idea was to evaluate the robustness of the new hybrid models using different input variables to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first time that a deep learning algorithm was optimized using metaheuristic algorithms in the field of geoscience even a standalone cnn algorithm has not been used for hydrologic prediction forecasting so far 2 study area sixteen different sites from two provinces lorestan and illam in the western part of iran were considered for the field data measurement of cumulative infiltration infiltration rate and other effective variables nine sites from the davood rashid region three sites from the honam areas and four sites from the kelat region in the illam provinces were selected fig 1 and table 2 the maximum and minimum elevation of the study area is about 3300 and 2100 m respectively behrahi et al 2018 the study areas have a humid climate with mean annual rainfall of 550 mm rangeland covers most of the study areas while forest land dry farming and irrigation land are considerable more information about study areas is provided in sihag et al 2019c and sepahvand et al 2018 3 methodology 3 1 field measurement and data collection one hundred and fifty four raw datasets including cumulative infiltration f t infiltration rate f t of sand s a of silt s i of clay c soil bulk density d and moisture content m c were measured and compiled from 16 sites by sepahvand et al 2018 the field measurements were carried out using a double ring infiltrometer with a depth of 30 cm and inner and outer diameters of 30 cm and 60 cm respectively at first both rings were driven about 10 cm with a sledgehammer next both inner and out rings were filled by water at a given depth measurements were carried out in the inner ring while the outer ring water was used to prevent leaching from the inner ring which is one of the sources of error measurements were taken at time intervals of 2 5 5 15 20 30 35 40 50 and 70 min and continued until the infiltration rate became steady the compiled dataset was divided into two subsets randomly 70 107 raw data points of the data were used for model constructing while the remaining 30 47 raw data points were employed for model evaluation there is no universal guideline for data splitting but a 70 30 ratio is the most widely used method in both time series and spatial prediction samadianfard et al 2018 2019 pham et al 2017 descriptive statistics of the training and testing datasets are tabulated in table 3 3 2 input combination construction each variable has a different impact on the infiltration process hence the correct selection of input variables has an influential effect on the predictive capability of the developed algorithms while irrelevant data reduce models performance correlation coefficient r criteria between input variables and outputs fig 2 was utilized as a foundation metric to construct different input combinations table 4 at the first stage the variable with the highest correlation coefficient t for f t and si for f t was considered as a single input variable to the model the assumption here is to determine whether the variable with highest impact has the ability to predict the infiltration process individually next the second combination was constructed by adding variables with the second highest r to the first combination and this approach was continued until variables with the lowest r were added to the combinations to build the last input combination each developed algorithm was performed with all input combinations and finally based on the root mean square error rmse the best input combination for each model was determined and used for further analysis 3 3 determination of optimal values for each operator as there is no an optimum global value for model operators that works perfectly for all the cases model parameter optimization is one of the most important as well as the last step among the modeling process in the present study different meta heuristic algorithms were applied to find the optimum values especially weights in the membership function of the deep cnn algorithm ga gwo and ica can be applied to train a cnn with the main intention of achieving the exact required accuracy and minimizing the network complexity indicators as well as the approximation error accuracy in order to fulfill this purpose computing the standard error on the training set and the fitness function of the vector solution can be done in this study the fitness function f is determined as 1 f 0 5 i 1 n o y 2 r where o represents the desired output y stands for the actual output and r shows the number of training data this process can be stopped when the fixed predefined iteration is done and the calculating fitness function is less than a specified constant in this condition the approximate error accuracy is minimum and the network complexity indicators have their optimum amount 3 4 models background theory scientists have designed numerous deep learning dl algorithms goodfellow et al 2016 for performing optimization in various domains such as object detection and object recognition wu et al 2019 dl builds complex concepts by combining simpler concepts goodfellow et al 2016 all algorithms were implemented using matlab programming software 3 4 1 convolutional neural network cnn a convolutional neural network cnn is a type of multi layer and feed forward neural network di persio and honchar 2016 gunduz et al 2017 the concept of cnn was introduced by fukushima 1988 without wide application fukushima 1988 and lecun and bengio 1995 presented a cnn in 1995 with successful results in the classification of digital handwriting this technique is a multi layer algorithm and consists of three main types of layers including a convolutional layer pooling layer and fully connected layer the first layer is used to measure changes by a pre defined filter f f on the input layer n n matrix to put it another way eq 2 calculates input of layer l in order to obtain the value of v i j l in the next layer in fig 3 hoseinzade and haratizadeh 2019 2 v i j l δ k 0 f 1 m 0 f 1 w k m v i k j m l 1 the pooling layer has the main responsibility to reduce the spatial size therefore this layer can control the risk of the over fitting problem in cnns finally the fully connected layer converts the extracted features between two layers of the cnn the previous layer to the final output layer by the following equation 3 v i j δ k v k j 1 w k i j 1 detailed information about cnns can be found in ding 2020 indolia et al 2018 kujawa et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 3 4 2 genetic algorithm ga the original genetic algorithm ga was investigated by john holland in 1975 kofinas et al 2018 this algorithm is designed as optimization tool to provide an optimal solution for variety applications in science and engineering kakandikar and nandedkar 2016 ga is a class of population based algorithms with two fundamental operators crossover and mutation in fig 4 rozinajová et al 2018 in this method the incipient generation selects randomly afterward both operators generate new member of the population for the next generation maiti and maiti 2008 sivanandam and deepa 2008 a crossover operator is used to combine the genetic information two chromosomes to create new member new chromosomes rozinajová et al 2018 the aim of the mutation operator is to impede from being captured in the local optimal solution yang et al 2014 this operator protects the genetic diversity of a new generation of chromosomes to the next montazeri gh et al 2006 the numerous mutation genes of the new population are called n g which is the multiplication mutation rate m r and the length of genes l g as follows iyer et al 2019 4 n g l g m r 3 4 3 grey wolf optimizer gwo grey wolf optimizer gwo is one of the popular algorithms based on the diverse natural occurrences of the hunting behavior grey wolves mirjalili et al 2014 gwo belongs to the class of meta heuristic algorithms introduced by mirjalili in 2014 the structure of the grey wolf is similar to a pyramid of four levels as it consists of alpha α beta β delta δ and omega ω wolves from top to bottom as shown fig 5 hu et al 2020 as the pyramid clearly shows alpha wolves are the top and the optimal solutions that are the leaders of the wolves for making decisions dehghani et al 2019 this pyramid illustrates that the second level and third level are called beta and delta respectively and are subservient wolves in decision making or other pack processes luo and zhao 2019 as well as suboptimal solutions li et al 2020 finally omegas play the role of the scapegoat wolves dehghani et al 2019 and the rest of the solutions li et al 2020 the process of hunting of gwo consists of four steps firstly as shown in fig 6 the wolves encircle prey during a hunt karasu and saraç 2020 afterwards grey wolves get closer to the prey and harass it gwo achieves the best solution to update the positions of other wolves according to the positions of α β and δ wolves the hunting process finishes and the wolves attack towards the prey it depends on the values of a and c which are determined by the following formula 5 c 2 a r 1 6 a 2 a r 2 a where r 1 and r 2 are random numbers between 0 and 1 used to calculate the coefficient vectors of a and c and a is a vector that decreases linearly from 2 to 0 saxena et al 2020 theses coefficients vectors can be two states during the process of gwo the first state is a 1 and c 1 which means that the wolves tend to attack the prey yang et al 2017 in contrast the second state occurs by the range of a 1 or a 1 and c 1 which means that the wolves will leave the current position prey and find another potential prey yang et al 2017 this step is called searching for prey or the exploration step rashid et al 2019 3 4 4 imperialist competitive algorithm ica one of the evolutionary algorithms is achieved by the human socio political process that is called imperialistic competition algorithm ica reisi et al 2019 by using the mathematical model and computer simulation barkhoda and sheikhi 2020 ica is proposed by atashpaz and lucas to solve various optimization problems by high and speed convergence rate atashpaz gargari and lucas 2007 according to the flowchart in fig 1 roshanaei et al 2009 fig 7 ica is such as other evolutionary algorithms by random initial population that every one of them is named a country barkhoda and sheikhi 2020 the third steps of ica are presented according to countries as follows dehghani et al 2021 1 initialization empires the parameter of countries is p d i each of them is determined based on the problem that it means i th country in the d th dimension in eq 7 the number of primary countries is shown by n c in eq 8 7 c o u n t r y i p 1 i p d i p n v a r i 8 c i f c o u n t r y i f p 1 i p d i p n v a r i i 1 n c the power of a country indicates whether it is an imperial or a colony details of the colonies associated with each empire can be found here roshanaei et al 2009 2 assimilation colonies and revolution each imperialist conquers a number of colonies and forms a powerful empire and then the imperialist rivalry between empires begins if an empire fails to rise or loss its power it will disappear during imperialist competition so the secret of the survival of an empire depends on its ability and effort to conquer the colonies from enemy empires barkhoda and sheikhi 2020 then they move toward the imperialist by x units dehghani et al 2021 the new location of colony is in eq 9 9 x u 0 β d β 1 u β and d in eq c are a random number between 0 and 1 a number larger than one and distance between colony and its imperialist location respectively the colony and its imperialist move in different location when colony finds the best location after that situation of colony and its imperialist are changed until only one powerful empire exists dehghani et al 2021 3 5 model validation four different quantitative and visual metrics are applied for model performance validation and comparison visual comparison including a line graph scatter plot box plot and taylor diagram except for fast desirable and interesting methods benefit from detailed information about maximum and minimum accurate prediction line graph and box plot as well as mean first and third quartile accurate prediction box plot which are quantitative metrics weak to report a taylor diagram benefits from involving three matrices of rmse r and standard deviation instantaneously sigaroodi et al 2014 as performance classification and ranking ordering of the developed algorithms cannot be determined using visual criteria hence four different quantitative criteria including rmse mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percentage of bias pbias were calculated as follows moriasi et al 2007 krause et al 2005 10 r m s e 1 n i 1 n m p 0 rmse 11 m a e 1 n i 1 n m p 0 mae 12 n s e 1 i 1 n m p 2 i 1 n m m 2 nse 1 13 p b i a s i 1 n m p i 1 n m 100 pbias 14 r 2 i 1 n m m p p i 1 n m m 2 i 1 n p p 2 2 where m and p are the measured and predicted values respectively and m and p arethe mean measured and predicted values rmse and mae have the same error unit as the target value and this makes it easier to interpret results nse is a dimensionless criterion and makes it possible for a comprehensive comparison pbias determines how well the applied model predicts the average magnitudes of the target variable performance classification of different criteria is as follows 1 the lower the rmse and mae the higher the prediction performance 2 based on the nse classification performances are 0 75 nse 1 00 very good 0 65 nse 0 75 good 0 50 nse 0 65 satisfactory 0 40 nse 0 50 acceptable and nse 0 4 unsatisfactory ayele et al 2017 3 based on the pbias classification performances are pbias 10 very good 10 pbias 15 good 15 pbias 25 satisfactory pbias 25 unsatisfactory legates and mccabe 1999 pbias can be used to determine the over prediction or under prediction of the developed algorithms moriasi et al 2007 4 as suggested by moriasi et al 2007 r2 values of 0 7 r2 1 0 6 r2 0 7 0 5 r2 0 6 and r2 0 5 were considered as very good good satisfactory and unsatisfactory respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 input variables importance as mentioned in section 3 1 different input variables of time of measurement sand silt and clay content soil bulk density and moisture content were considered based on the data availability and theory of infiltration in order to predict the cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate results demonstrated that the time of measuring and silt content are the most effective variables on f t and f t respectively fig 2 while soil density has the lowest effect on both f t and f t this reveals that soil texture and its content have a greater effect on the infiltration process than soil density and its compactness one reason that shows soil moisture content and bulk density has the lowest effect in our study area is that these two factors do not change significantly across the study areas these results are in accordance with singh et al 2017 and 2020 which stated that time is the most important input variable on cumulative infiltration zolfaghari et al 2012 stated that soil texture properties have a great effect on cumulative infiltration variables effectiveness on f t and f t are not always constant and depend on many factors like catchment characteristics landuse cover physical and chemical soil characteristics and so on sy 2006 singh et al 2017 simulated the effect of water quality on infiltration rate and showed that among the input variables of cumulative time type of impurities concentration of impurities and moisture content cumulative time is the most effective variable on the infiltration rate of the soil results illustrated that time is one of the most efficient variables on both f t r 0 60 and f t r 0 42 according to the r time has a direct relationship with cumulative infiltration and shows that the more the time the larger the cumulative infiltration on the other hand infiltration rate has an inverse relationship with time showing infiltration rate decreases with time additionally with the passing of time the f t trend is descending until it reaches a constant rate which is called the constant or equilibrium infiltration rate or constant final infiltration capacity 4 2 best input combination the six input variables mentioned earlier were used to construct different input combinations based on rmse for f t and f t prediction respectively the input combination with the lowest rmse values were considered be the most effective input combination in improving the prediction capability of f t and f t table 2 and fig 8 for the f t prediction the model with the input combination no 6 which included all variables i e t si c sa mc and d had the best performance in the training rmse 2 39 cm and testing rmse 2 45 cm phases for f t prediction the model with the input combination no 6 which again included all input variables i e t si c sa mc and d had the highest performance in the training rmse 0 120 cm and testing rmse 0 128 cm steps according to fig 8 by increasing the input variables for both f t and f t the model s prediction power increases singh et al 2019a found that the variable combination including time sand clay silt density and moisture content was the most effective combination for f t and f t modeling using svm and rf models this is due to this fact that infiltration has a complex process and using fewer variables reduces the accuracy of its prediction therefore using more relevant and effective variables containing relevant information important to the infiltration process enhanced the model s performance 4 3 model evaluation as a training dataset is used for the identification of optimal input variable combinations for f t and f t prediction and then model development the training data cannot be used in the model validation step results of this phase only indicate how well the built model fits with the used training dataset therefore the cnn model and its ensembles were validated by the testing datasets results of validation through testing data show how good and efficient the built model is for infiltration process prediction fig 9 provides line graphs and also a scatter plot between the measured vs predicted values of f t and f t using cnn cnn ica cnn ga and cnn gwo during the testing dataset it is obvious that all predicted values of the models were well fitted with the measured values although a cnn is a powerful algorithm and has very good prediction power r2 0 97 and 0 73 for f t and f t it could not predict the maximum values accurately in general the accuracy of any predictive model depends on several factors e g the algorithm structure the optimization of the model s parameters the proper selection of inputs the nature of the data the data quality and the size of the dataset asim et al 2018 the lower prediction accuracy of cnn algorithms may be due to two main reasons the first one is cnns like other neuron based models need their parameters to be optimized the second one is length of the data as deep learning algorithms have a higher performance using large datasets to enhance the prediction power of a cnn algorithm three metaheuristic algorithms of ica ga and gwo can be coupled with a cnn to determine the model s parameter values automatically it is obvious that optimized cnn algorithm will have a higher performance than a standalone cnn for the prediction of both f t and f t and could predict maximum values perfectly however f t predicted using the cnn gwo model was the fittest to the measured values it was less scattered and demonstrated a good fit f t p r e d 0 969 f t m e a s 0 046 r 2 0 995 compared to the other models it is followed by the cnn ica f t p r e d 0 893 f t m e a s 0 378 r 2 0 985 cnn ga f t p r e d 0 889 f t m e a s 0 354 r 2 0 993 and cnn f t p r e d 0 742 f t m e a s 1 097 r 2 0 969 in the case of f t prediction the line graphs and the r2 values indicated that the cnn gwo was the best fit model f t p r e d 0 941 f t m e a s 0 016 r 2 0 986 followed by the cnn ica f t p r e d 0 871 f t m e a s 0 041 r 2 0 960 cnn ga f t p r e d 0 865 f t m e a s 0 041 r 2 0 959 and cnn f t p r e d 0 577 f t m e a s 0 111 r 2 0 731 based on the classification of goodness of fit for r2 statistics all three hybrid models cnn gwo cnn ici and cnn ga and the standalone algorithms had very good fits for f t and f t prediction van liew et al 2003 the box plots of the measured and predicted f t and f t using the different models were also used to assess the models performance visually fig 10 in the case of f t although the predicted minimum first quartile q25 medians q50 and third quartile q75 of the cnn cnn ga cnn ica and cnn gwo models were closest to the measured f t some of the models like cnn ga and cnn ica did not accurately predict the maximum value and the cnn model could not satisfactorily predict the maximum f t value in the case of f t the results of the box plots showed that the all of the models were closest to the measure in predicting the minimum q50 and q75 of the f t values while none of them could predict the q50 and maximum values accurately in the case of maximum value the cnn gwo model predicted much better than the other models all of the models underestimated the f t and f t maximum values the highest value is important in the prediction process because the high f t and f t values are representative of the potential contribution of infiltration to less runoff generation less flood occurrences and are important for groundwater recharge soil and water conservation and irrigation regimes in agricultural lands and for accurate watershed management plans therefore if the model predicted the maximum values inaccurately the management plan would fail therefore the best model is the one that except for generally high accuracy predicts the maximum value properly overall the results indicated that cnn gwo was the fittest for the testing dataset and it could predict maximum value well taylor diagrams were plotted in order to further evaluate the models prediction power fig 11 for both f t and f t the taylor plot indicated that the cnn gwo model had the highest performance because the predicted standard deviation values were closely matched to those of the measured data and the correlation coefficients were very high 0 997 and 0 985 respectively the visual comparison of the models performance has the weakness that those with high performance are easily recognizable but it is difficult to identify the models performance classification and rank them thus it is necessary to apply some quantitative measures that provide better evidence of the models performance therefore in this study evaluation metrics were considered to compare the performance of the developed models fig 12 a d provides the rmse mae nse and pbias values for f t predictions by different models the nse values revealed that all of the considered models had very good performance moriasi et al 2007 the results showed that the cnn gwo with rmse 0 409 cm mae 0 316 cm nse 0 994 and pbias 2 43 was the most accurate one among the optimized deep learning infiltration models followed by the cnn ici cnn ga and cnn models based on the pbias values all of the models underestimated the f t values shown by positive pbias values moreover the cnn gwo cnn ici and cnn ga model predictions were classified into very good performance pbias 10 and the cnn model had good performance 10 pbias 15 in the case of f t prediction as shown in fig 13 the cnn gwo model with rmse 0 028 cm h mae 0 019 cm h nse 0 984 and pbias 0 004 outperformed the other models it was followed by cnn ica cnn ga and cnn models based on rmse mae and nse measures however based on pbias criteria cnn ga with a pbias equal to 1 18 outperformed the cnn ica 1 85 and cnn 1 85 models according to nse optimized cnn models have a very good performance while a standalone cnn has good prediction power moreover all models overestimated f t values and their performance was classified into very good performance shown by negative pbias values and pbias 10 overall based on the model performance metrics all developed models had reasonable performance in predicting both f t and f t the present study confirmed that deep learning algorithms here cnn are able to model complex non linear input output relationships using different readily available input variables the results of the current study showed that although a cnn algorithm is a powerful model the hybrid models through metaheuristic algorithms enhanced the predictive power of the standalone cnn algorithm the hybrid methods are considered more reasonable for environmental modeling due to more model flexibility the determination of models parameter values accurately as well as the fact that they enhanced the combined effects of two standalone models thai pham et al 2019 bui et al 2018 stated that the hybrid models are strong and robust and improve the power prediction of standalone models while reducing noise and over fitting problems tien bui et al 2018 results of the enhanced percentage cnn algorithm by different metaheuristic algorithms are shown in fig 14 the results illustrated that the gwo algorithm could enhance performance of the cnn algorithm about 9 56 and 28 18 for f t and f t prediction respectively these percentages for f t and f t are 7 51 and 25 81 for ica algorithms and 7 12 and 25 65 for ga algorithms respectively the main advantage of cnn algorithms compared to traditional ai algorithms are a computationally efficient b have many different hidden layers which enhance prediction power c automatically detect the important features without any human supervision d use special convolution and pooling operations and perform parameter sharing and e use hierarchical patterns in data and assemble more complex patterns using smaller and simpler patterns the cnn gwo model was known as the best performing model in the predicting of f t and f t values the gwo was more efficient in reduction of both variance and bias compared to the ga and ica algorithms the advantages of the gwo algorithm are easy to implement less storage and fewer computational requirements can be summarized as faster convergence resulting from continuous reduction of search space and fewer decision variables ability in avoiding local minima having only two control parameters to tune the algorithm performance and hence better stability and robustness hameed et al 2016 given this is the first study not only evaluating the prediction performance of optimized deep learning algorithms for f t and f t prediction but also in geoscience no direct comparisons exist however the improved performance of the hybrid models conforms to previous tests of data mining algorithms in the infiltration modeling arshad et al 2013 sihag et al 2019b c there are many papers that have applied ann algorithms to predict infiltration processes in the laboratory or with field data and these have stated that ann is an efficient model anari et al 2011 esmaeelnejad et al 2015 sedaghat et al 2016 sihag et al 2018a b recently some field measurements showed the superiority of the rf model over other algorithms in infiltration rate or soil hydraulic conductivity in india kumar and sihag 2019 sihag et al 2019c singh et al 2017 some studies showed that svm or gp are the models with the highest performance in infiltration characteristic prediction das et al 2012 elbisy 2015 sihag et al 2018a 2017 sihag et al 2018b it is obvious from table 1 that there is not any global agreement about which model has the highest performance and therefore in a new study various models should be examined to find the best one thus the performance investigation of newly developed algorithms is strongly required like deep learning in the present study additionally some empirical traditional ai and data mining algorithms with the same data of the current study were applied by sepahvand et al 2018 and sihag et al 2018a sihag et al 2019d whose results are tabulated in table 5 according to table 4 the svm algorithm has the same performance compared to optimized cnn gwo algorithms while it outperforms other algorithms for f t prediction in the case of f t prediction optimized cnn algorithms outperform not only svm but other developed algorithms to better understand the modeling prediction power of optimized deep learning algorithms the authors also performed svm rbf fig 15 a and anfis trimf fig 15 b similar to what singh et al 2019 did but got different prediction accuracy which may be due to different structures of training and testing datasets according to the new finding the current results show that optimized cnn algorithms are more robust flexible and efficient algorithms with very high prediction capability results demonstrate that cnn algorithms have a 11 35 and 9 27 higher performance than svm and anfis models for f t prediction respectively while cnn gwo was the most accurate algorithm having has 13 65 and 11 64 higher performance respectively as the infiltration process not only changes spatially but also temporally it is recommended to collect various time series data and investigate the prediction power of ai models to predict the infiltration process cerdà 1997 reported that seasonal changes play important roles in soil hydrology whereas the infiltration rate was the highest during the summer each year fang et al 1958 5 conclusion the present study evaluated the effectiveness of the stand alone and optimized deep learning of convolutional neural network cnn algorithms using three metaheuristic algorithms for cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate prediction in iran the main results of the current study are summarized as follows 1 all developed algorithms have very good performance for both cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate prediction 2 a cnn model optimized with a gwo algorithm outperformed the other algorithms followed by cnn ica cnn ga and a stand alone cnn algorithm 3 metaheuristic algorithms enhanced the prediction capability of a stand alone cnn algorithm significantly about 9 56 7 51 and 7 21 for cumulative infiltration and about 28 15 25 81 and 25 65 for infiltration rate prediction for gwo ica and ga algorithms respectively 4 different input variables lead to different prediction performance 5 time of experiment measurement has the highest effect on the cumulative infiltration followed by of silt of clay of sand moisture content soil density and infiltration rate respectively 6 percentage of silt is the most important parameter on infiltration rate prediction followed by time of clay moisture content of sand and soil density 7 all developed algorithms underestimated cumulative infiltration while overestimating infiltration rates 8 not only optimized cnn algorithms but also a stand alone cnn algorithm outperformed over all traditional machine learning gp rf gep ann svr svm and anfis and empirical models kostiakov and philips the present results show that stand alone and optimized cnn algorithms are cost effective tools which are not only proposed to be used in infiltration process in other parts of the world but also in all aspects of hydrological science

8241,study region sixteen different sites from two provinces lorestan and illam in the western part of iran were considered for the field data measurement of cumulative infiltration infiltration rate and other effective variables that affect infiltration process study focus soil infiltration is recognized as a fundamental process of the hydrologic cycle affecting surface runoff soil erosion and groundwater recharge hence accurate prediction of the infiltration process is one of the most important tasks in hydrological science as direct measurement is difficult and costly and empirical models are inaccurate the current study proposed a standalone and optimized deep learning algorithm of a convolutional neural network cnn using gray wolf optimization gwo a genetic algorithm ga and an independent component analysis ica for cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate prediction first 154 raw datasets were collected including the time of measuring sand clay and silt percent bulk density soil moisture percent infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration using field survey next 70 of the dataset were used for model building and the remaining 30 was used for model validation then based on the correlation coefficient between input variables and outputs different input combinations were constructed finally the prediction power of each developed algorithm was evaluated using different visually based scatter plot box plot and taylor diagram and quantitatively based root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percentage of bias pbias metrics new hydrological insights for the region finding revealed that the time of measurement is more important for cumulative infiltration while soil characteristics i e silt content are more significant in infiltration rate prediction this shows that in the study area silt parameter which is the dominant constituent parameter can control infiltration process more effectively effectiveness of the variables in the present study in the order of importance are time silt clay moisture content sand and bulk density this can be related to the fact that most of study area is rangeland and thus overgrazing leads to compaction of the silt soil that can lead to a slow infiltration process soil moisture content and bulk density are not highly effective in our study because these two factors do not significantly change across the study area findings demonstrated that the optimum input variable combination is the one in which all input variables are considered the results illustrated that cnn algorithms have a very high performance while a metaheuristic algorithm enhanced the performance of a standalone cnn algorithm from 7 to 28 the results also showed that a cnn gwo algorithm outperformed the other algorithms followed by cnn ica cnn ga and cnn for both cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate prediction all developed algorithms underestimated cumulative infiltration while overestimating infiltration rates keywords cumulative infiltration infiltration rate deep learning cnn metaheuristic iran 1 introduction the soil water infiltration process plays a fundamental role in hydrology pedology hydrogeology irrigation and drainage systems kale and sahoo 2011 mahapatra et al 2020 ghumman et al 2018a from a computational point of view the infiltration can be defined as the ability of water to move into the soil strata angelaki et al 2013 total amount of water that soil strata are able to absorb from rainfall or irrigation in a given time is considered as a cumulative infiltration f t the velocity of the water entering into the soil in a given period of time is defined as the infiltration rate f t and the velocity of water entering into the soil in a specific amount of time is defined as an instantaneous infiltration rate hooshyar and wang 2016 mahmood and latif 2003 the rate of water infiltration into soil is controlled by several factors such as the initial moisture conditions of the ground s surface rainfall intensity soil and water temperature biological activities in the soil column soil texture porosity and compactness and surface cover conditions angelaki et al 2013 ma et al 2015 hooshyar and wang 2016 infiltration contributes to groundwater recharge the movement of soil solutes through the ground the water budget of vegetation runoff flood generation and soil erosion in addition the movement of chemical contaminants through soil and into groundwater is mainly controlled by the water infiltration process and overall watershed management plans angelaki et al 2004 mahapatra et al 2020 in addition the success of surface irrigation methods is mainly governed by soil infiltration characteristics ghumman et al 2018b fan et al 2018 and the efficiency of irrigation depends largely on the spatial and temporal variations in the infiltration characteristics khatri and smith 2006 therefore quantifying the infiltration process is important in watershed management over the years several authors worldwide have highlighted the difficulties encountered in direct soil water infiltration measurement which is a labor intensive and time consuming task huang et al 2016 jejurkar and rajurkar 2015 stephen et al 2010 puri et al 2011 therefore various physical and empirical equations have been developed for infiltration prediction based on the knowledge of water movement in the soil according to soil hydraulic properties lassabatere et al 2009 some example of these equations are green and ampt 1911 philip 1957a b richards 1931 the united states department of agriculture usda soil conservation service scs 1972 horton 1941 and kostiakov 1932 some drawbacks of these algorithms except simplicity which make them incapable to predict f t are homogeneity of soil and constant soil moisture content singh et al 2019a additionally these models involve only one or a few of the input variables while some effective variables such as soil texture and degree of compactness are neglected although numerical and physically based models i e topmodel and hydrus 3d can predict the infiltration process accurately the acquisition of data with high spatial resolutions i e heterogeneous soil data which is required for running these models is a difficult task especially for large catchments moreover recently infiltration processes have changed to a certain extent due to soil macro pores demand et al 2019 and soil biological activities cheik et al 2018 zaller et al 2014 fan et al 2020a b recently there have been increased efforts to propose alternative methods for accurately estimating the amount of soil water infiltration using different kinds of models based on data driven machine learning models angelaki et al 2018 rahmati 2017 sihag et al 2018a a sihag et al 2020b b sepahvand et al 2018 some benefits of these types of algorithms can be summarized as strong prediction performance easy and fast to develop robustness to missing data and the ability to handle large amounts of data at different scales ahmad and simonovic 2005 ahmad et al 2010 choubin et al 2014 kisi et al 2012 yaseen et al 2015 ateeq ur rauf et al 2018 thakur et al 2020 rahmati 2017 compared the group method of data handling gmdh multilayer perceptron artificial neural network mlpnn and multiple linear regression mlr models in predicting cumulative infiltrations f t using soils readily available characteristics racs i soil primary particles clay silt and sand ii saturated hydraulic conductivity ks iii soil densities bulk and particle iv organic carbon v wet aggregate stability vi electrical conductivity and vii soil antecedent θi and field saturated θ fs the study was conducted in iran and the obtained results showing that i among the racs characteristics the ks has the most influence on the model s accuracy and ii the best accuracy was obtained using the gmdh models singh et al 2017 compared random forest regression rf mlpnn and m5tree models in predicting soil s infiltration rate and showed that the rf model was more accurate the authors compared the genetic programming gp support vector machine svm multiple linear regression mlr models with kostiakov and philip s models in predicting the cumulative infiltration of sandy soil according to the obtained results the gp model was superior followed by the svm model the mlr model and the kostiakov model angelaki et al 2018 applied several machine learning models namely an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis svm and mlpnn models in predicting cumulative infiltration the best accuracy was obtained using the anfis model with a triangular membership function followed by the mlpnn and the svm models sihag et al 2018a b sihag et al 2019b and sepahvand et al 2018 compared ann gene expression programming gep anfis svm and rf algorithms for cumulative infiltration prediction and stated that the anfis model had the highest performance followed by the svm rf ann and gep algorithms sihag et al 2020a compared the ann svm rf gp machines learning models with kostiakov s and philip s models in predicting infiltration rate using various input variables they reported that the best accuracy was obtained using the gp with polynomial function while the lowest accuracy was obtained using the philip s model sihag et al 2020b used the svm with a radial basis function neural network svm rbf svm with a polynomial svm po kernel function grnn m5tree and mlr models in predicting cumulative infiltration the best accuracy was achieved using svm rbf while the lowest accuracy was achieved using the grnn model pahlavan rad et al 2020 applied mlr and rf for spatial prediction of soil water infiltration in south eastern iran they concluded that although both algorithms have a reasonable prediction power rf algorithm outperforms mlr resulting from a through literature review a summary of the developed algorithms for infiltration process prediction is presented in table 1 according to the literature review there is not a global algorithm that is perfect in all cases thus new robust algorithms are highly recommended the ann algorithm is one of the oldest developed algorithms but this algorithm has various drawbacks such as slow convergence speed kisi et al 2012 melesse et al 2011 svm can be time consuming to train since it is very sensitive to hyper parameter selection ahmad et al 2018 rf as a robust algorithm suffers from its complexity as well as being time consuming to build gmdh svm ann svm and other similar algorithms suffer from accurate determination of the models parameters especially weights in membership functions while their integration with metaheuristic algorithms has improved their prediction power significantly bui et al 2018 another limitation of these algorithms is that they only have one hidden layer in their structure lately deep learning algorithms i e convolution neural networks cnn which benefit from various hidden layers have been developed for solving more complex process with a higher degree of accuracy cnn algorithms are one of the well known types of dl which were developed for non time series datasets spatial distribution this kind of dl algorithm has been successfully applied for natural hazard susceptibility mapping including flash floods bui et al 2020a and landslides bui et al 2020b wang et al 2020 while they have not been used for hydrologic forecasting problems yet additionally these robust strong and high level algorithms have many parameters in their structures that need to be optimized similar to ann anfis and so on in the present research the prediction capability of a standalone cnn model and a cnn optimized algorithm using a genetic algorithm cnn ga grey wolf optimization cnn gwo and an imperialist competitive algorithm cnn ica were investigated for cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate prediction using in situ observations of sand clay silt density g cm3 and moisture content as input variables the main idea was to evaluate the robustness of the new hybrid models using different input variables to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first time that a deep learning algorithm was optimized using metaheuristic algorithms in the field of geoscience even a standalone cnn algorithm has not been used for hydrologic prediction forecasting so far 2 study area sixteen different sites from two provinces lorestan and illam in the western part of iran were considered for the field data measurement of cumulative infiltration infiltration rate and other effective variables nine sites from the davood rashid region three sites from the honam areas and four sites from the kelat region in the illam provinces were selected fig 1 and table 2 the maximum and minimum elevation of the study area is about 3300 and 2100 m respectively behrahi et al 2018 the study areas have a humid climate with mean annual rainfall of 550 mm rangeland covers most of the study areas while forest land dry farming and irrigation land are considerable more information about study areas is provided in sihag et al 2019c and sepahvand et al 2018 3 methodology 3 1 field measurement and data collection one hundred and fifty four raw datasets including cumulative infiltration f t infiltration rate f t of sand s a of silt s i of clay c soil bulk density d and moisture content m c were measured and compiled from 16 sites by sepahvand et al 2018 the field measurements were carried out using a double ring infiltrometer with a depth of 30 cm and inner and outer diameters of 30 cm and 60 cm respectively at first both rings were driven about 10 cm with a sledgehammer next both inner and out rings were filled by water at a given depth measurements were carried out in the inner ring while the outer ring water was used to prevent leaching from the inner ring which is one of the sources of error measurements were taken at time intervals of 2 5 5 15 20 30 35 40 50 and 70 min and continued until the infiltration rate became steady the compiled dataset was divided into two subsets randomly 70 107 raw data points of the data were used for model constructing while the remaining 30 47 raw data points were employed for model evaluation there is no universal guideline for data splitting but a 70 30 ratio is the most widely used method in both time series and spatial prediction samadianfard et al 2018 2019 pham et al 2017 descriptive statistics of the training and testing datasets are tabulated in table 3 3 2 input combination construction each variable has a different impact on the infiltration process hence the correct selection of input variables has an influential effect on the predictive capability of the developed algorithms while irrelevant data reduce models performance correlation coefficient r criteria between input variables and outputs fig 2 was utilized as a foundation metric to construct different input combinations table 4 at the first stage the variable with the highest correlation coefficient t for f t and si for f t was considered as a single input variable to the model the assumption here is to determine whether the variable with highest impact has the ability to predict the infiltration process individually next the second combination was constructed by adding variables with the second highest r to the first combination and this approach was continued until variables with the lowest r were added to the combinations to build the last input combination each developed algorithm was performed with all input combinations and finally based on the root mean square error rmse the best input combination for each model was determined and used for further analysis 3 3 determination of optimal values for each operator as there is no an optimum global value for model operators that works perfectly for all the cases model parameter optimization is one of the most important as well as the last step among the modeling process in the present study different meta heuristic algorithms were applied to find the optimum values especially weights in the membership function of the deep cnn algorithm ga gwo and ica can be applied to train a cnn with the main intention of achieving the exact required accuracy and minimizing the network complexity indicators as well as the approximation error accuracy in order to fulfill this purpose computing the standard error on the training set and the fitness function of the vector solution can be done in this study the fitness function f is determined as 1 f 0 5 i 1 n o y 2 r where o represents the desired output y stands for the actual output and r shows the number of training data this process can be stopped when the fixed predefined iteration is done and the calculating fitness function is less than a specified constant in this condition the approximate error accuracy is minimum and the network complexity indicators have their optimum amount 3 4 models background theory scientists have designed numerous deep learning dl algorithms goodfellow et al 2016 for performing optimization in various domains such as object detection and object recognition wu et al 2019 dl builds complex concepts by combining simpler concepts goodfellow et al 2016 all algorithms were implemented using matlab programming software 3 4 1 convolutional neural network cnn a convolutional neural network cnn is a type of multi layer and feed forward neural network di persio and honchar 2016 gunduz et al 2017 the concept of cnn was introduced by fukushima 1988 without wide application fukushima 1988 and lecun and bengio 1995 presented a cnn in 1995 with successful results in the classification of digital handwriting this technique is a multi layer algorithm and consists of three main types of layers including a convolutional layer pooling layer and fully connected layer the first layer is used to measure changes by a pre defined filter f f on the input layer n n matrix to put it another way eq 2 calculates input of layer l in order to obtain the value of v i j l in the next layer in fig 3 hoseinzade and haratizadeh 2019 2 v i j l δ k 0 f 1 m 0 f 1 w k m v i k j m l 1 the pooling layer has the main responsibility to reduce the spatial size therefore this layer can control the risk of the over fitting problem in cnns finally the fully connected layer converts the extracted features between two layers of the cnn the previous layer to the final output layer by the following equation 3 v i j δ k v k j 1 w k i j 1 detailed information about cnns can be found in ding 2020 indolia et al 2018 kujawa et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 3 4 2 genetic algorithm ga the original genetic algorithm ga was investigated by john holland in 1975 kofinas et al 2018 this algorithm is designed as optimization tool to provide an optimal solution for variety applications in science and engineering kakandikar and nandedkar 2016 ga is a class of population based algorithms with two fundamental operators crossover and mutation in fig 4 rozinajová et al 2018 in this method the incipient generation selects randomly afterward both operators generate new member of the population for the next generation maiti and maiti 2008 sivanandam and deepa 2008 a crossover operator is used to combine the genetic information two chromosomes to create new member new chromosomes rozinajová et al 2018 the aim of the mutation operator is to impede from being captured in the local optimal solution yang et al 2014 this operator protects the genetic diversity of a new generation of chromosomes to the next montazeri gh et al 2006 the numerous mutation genes of the new population are called n g which is the multiplication mutation rate m r and the length of genes l g as follows iyer et al 2019 4 n g l g m r 3 4 3 grey wolf optimizer gwo grey wolf optimizer gwo is one of the popular algorithms based on the diverse natural occurrences of the hunting behavior grey wolves mirjalili et al 2014 gwo belongs to the class of meta heuristic algorithms introduced by mirjalili in 2014 the structure of the grey wolf is similar to a pyramid of four levels as it consists of alpha α beta β delta δ and omega ω wolves from top to bottom as shown fig 5 hu et al 2020 as the pyramid clearly shows alpha wolves are the top and the optimal solutions that are the leaders of the wolves for making decisions dehghani et al 2019 this pyramid illustrates that the second level and third level are called beta and delta respectively and are subservient wolves in decision making or other pack processes luo and zhao 2019 as well as suboptimal solutions li et al 2020 finally omegas play the role of the scapegoat wolves dehghani et al 2019 and the rest of the solutions li et al 2020 the process of hunting of gwo consists of four steps firstly as shown in fig 6 the wolves encircle prey during a hunt karasu and saraç 2020 afterwards grey wolves get closer to the prey and harass it gwo achieves the best solution to update the positions of other wolves according to the positions of α β and δ wolves the hunting process finishes and the wolves attack towards the prey it depends on the values of a and c which are determined by the following formula 5 c 2 a r 1 6 a 2 a r 2 a where r 1 and r 2 are random numbers between 0 and 1 used to calculate the coefficient vectors of a and c and a is a vector that decreases linearly from 2 to 0 saxena et al 2020 theses coefficients vectors can be two states during the process of gwo the first state is a 1 and c 1 which means that the wolves tend to attack the prey yang et al 2017 in contrast the second state occurs by the range of a 1 or a 1 and c 1 which means that the wolves will leave the current position prey and find another potential prey yang et al 2017 this step is called searching for prey or the exploration step rashid et al 2019 3 4 4 imperialist competitive algorithm ica one of the evolutionary algorithms is achieved by the human socio political process that is called imperialistic competition algorithm ica reisi et al 2019 by using the mathematical model and computer simulation barkhoda and sheikhi 2020 ica is proposed by atashpaz and lucas to solve various optimization problems by high and speed convergence rate atashpaz gargari and lucas 2007 according to the flowchart in fig 1 roshanaei et al 2009 fig 7 ica is such as other evolutionary algorithms by random initial population that every one of them is named a country barkhoda and sheikhi 2020 the third steps of ica are presented according to countries as follows dehghani et al 2021 1 initialization empires the parameter of countries is p d i each of them is determined based on the problem that it means i th country in the d th dimension in eq 7 the number of primary countries is shown by n c in eq 8 7 c o u n t r y i p 1 i p d i p n v a r i 8 c i f c o u n t r y i f p 1 i p d i p n v a r i i 1 n c the power of a country indicates whether it is an imperial or a colony details of the colonies associated with each empire can be found here roshanaei et al 2009 2 assimilation colonies and revolution each imperialist conquers a number of colonies and forms a powerful empire and then the imperialist rivalry between empires begins if an empire fails to rise or loss its power it will disappear during imperialist competition so the secret of the survival of an empire depends on its ability and effort to conquer the colonies from enemy empires barkhoda and sheikhi 2020 then they move toward the imperialist by x units dehghani et al 2021 the new location of colony is in eq 9 9 x u 0 β d β 1 u β and d in eq c are a random number between 0 and 1 a number larger than one and distance between colony and its imperialist location respectively the colony and its imperialist move in different location when colony finds the best location after that situation of colony and its imperialist are changed until only one powerful empire exists dehghani et al 2021 3 5 model validation four different quantitative and visual metrics are applied for model performance validation and comparison visual comparison including a line graph scatter plot box plot and taylor diagram except for fast desirable and interesting methods benefit from detailed information about maximum and minimum accurate prediction line graph and box plot as well as mean first and third quartile accurate prediction box plot which are quantitative metrics weak to report a taylor diagram benefits from involving three matrices of rmse r and standard deviation instantaneously sigaroodi et al 2014 as performance classification and ranking ordering of the developed algorithms cannot be determined using visual criteria hence four different quantitative criteria including rmse mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percentage of bias pbias were calculated as follows moriasi et al 2007 krause et al 2005 10 r m s e 1 n i 1 n m p 0 rmse 11 m a e 1 n i 1 n m p 0 mae 12 n s e 1 i 1 n m p 2 i 1 n m m 2 nse 1 13 p b i a s i 1 n m p i 1 n m 100 pbias 14 r 2 i 1 n m m p p i 1 n m m 2 i 1 n p p 2 2 where m and p are the measured and predicted values respectively and m and p arethe mean measured and predicted values rmse and mae have the same error unit as the target value and this makes it easier to interpret results nse is a dimensionless criterion and makes it possible for a comprehensive comparison pbias determines how well the applied model predicts the average magnitudes of the target variable performance classification of different criteria is as follows 1 the lower the rmse and mae the higher the prediction performance 2 based on the nse classification performances are 0 75 nse 1 00 very good 0 65 nse 0 75 good 0 50 nse 0 65 satisfactory 0 40 nse 0 50 acceptable and nse 0 4 unsatisfactory ayele et al 2017 3 based on the pbias classification performances are pbias 10 very good 10 pbias 15 good 15 pbias 25 satisfactory pbias 25 unsatisfactory legates and mccabe 1999 pbias can be used to determine the over prediction or under prediction of the developed algorithms moriasi et al 2007 4 as suggested by moriasi et al 2007 r2 values of 0 7 r2 1 0 6 r2 0 7 0 5 r2 0 6 and r2 0 5 were considered as very good good satisfactory and unsatisfactory respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 input variables importance as mentioned in section 3 1 different input variables of time of measurement sand silt and clay content soil bulk density and moisture content were considered based on the data availability and theory of infiltration in order to predict the cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate results demonstrated that the time of measuring and silt content are the most effective variables on f t and f t respectively fig 2 while soil density has the lowest effect on both f t and f t this reveals that soil texture and its content have a greater effect on the infiltration process than soil density and its compactness one reason that shows soil moisture content and bulk density has the lowest effect in our study area is that these two factors do not change significantly across the study areas these results are in accordance with singh et al 2017 and 2020 which stated that time is the most important input variable on cumulative infiltration zolfaghari et al 2012 stated that soil texture properties have a great effect on cumulative infiltration variables effectiveness on f t and f t are not always constant and depend on many factors like catchment characteristics landuse cover physical and chemical soil characteristics and so on sy 2006 singh et al 2017 simulated the effect of water quality on infiltration rate and showed that among the input variables of cumulative time type of impurities concentration of impurities and moisture content cumulative time is the most effective variable on the infiltration rate of the soil results illustrated that time is one of the most efficient variables on both f t r 0 60 and f t r 0 42 according to the r time has a direct relationship with cumulative infiltration and shows that the more the time the larger the cumulative infiltration on the other hand infiltration rate has an inverse relationship with time showing infiltration rate decreases with time additionally with the passing of time the f t trend is descending until it reaches a constant rate which is called the constant or equilibrium infiltration rate or constant final infiltration capacity 4 2 best input combination the six input variables mentioned earlier were used to construct different input combinations based on rmse for f t and f t prediction respectively the input combination with the lowest rmse values were considered be the most effective input combination in improving the prediction capability of f t and f t table 2 and fig 8 for the f t prediction the model with the input combination no 6 which included all variables i e t si c sa mc and d had the best performance in the training rmse 2 39 cm and testing rmse 2 45 cm phases for f t prediction the model with the input combination no 6 which again included all input variables i e t si c sa mc and d had the highest performance in the training rmse 0 120 cm and testing rmse 0 128 cm steps according to fig 8 by increasing the input variables for both f t and f t the model s prediction power increases singh et al 2019a found that the variable combination including time sand clay silt density and moisture content was the most effective combination for f t and f t modeling using svm and rf models this is due to this fact that infiltration has a complex process and using fewer variables reduces the accuracy of its prediction therefore using more relevant and effective variables containing relevant information important to the infiltration process enhanced the model s performance 4 3 model evaluation as a training dataset is used for the identification of optimal input variable combinations for f t and f t prediction and then model development the training data cannot be used in the model validation step results of this phase only indicate how well the built model fits with the used training dataset therefore the cnn model and its ensembles were validated by the testing datasets results of validation through testing data show how good and efficient the built model is for infiltration process prediction fig 9 provides line graphs and also a scatter plot between the measured vs predicted values of f t and f t using cnn cnn ica cnn ga and cnn gwo during the testing dataset it is obvious that all predicted values of the models were well fitted with the measured values although a cnn is a powerful algorithm and has very good prediction power r2 0 97 and 0 73 for f t and f t it could not predict the maximum values accurately in general the accuracy of any predictive model depends on several factors e g the algorithm structure the optimization of the model s parameters the proper selection of inputs the nature of the data the data quality and the size of the dataset asim et al 2018 the lower prediction accuracy of cnn algorithms may be due to two main reasons the first one is cnns like other neuron based models need their parameters to be optimized the second one is length of the data as deep learning algorithms have a higher performance using large datasets to enhance the prediction power of a cnn algorithm three metaheuristic algorithms of ica ga and gwo can be coupled with a cnn to determine the model s parameter values automatically it is obvious that optimized cnn algorithm will have a higher performance than a standalone cnn for the prediction of both f t and f t and could predict maximum values perfectly however f t predicted using the cnn gwo model was the fittest to the measured values it was less scattered and demonstrated a good fit f t p r e d 0 969 f t m e a s 0 046 r 2 0 995 compared to the other models it is followed by the cnn ica f t p r e d 0 893 f t m e a s 0 378 r 2 0 985 cnn ga f t p r e d 0 889 f t m e a s 0 354 r 2 0 993 and cnn f t p r e d 0 742 f t m e a s 1 097 r 2 0 969 in the case of f t prediction the line graphs and the r2 values indicated that the cnn gwo was the best fit model f t p r e d 0 941 f t m e a s 0 016 r 2 0 986 followed by the cnn ica f t p r e d 0 871 f t m e a s 0 041 r 2 0 960 cnn ga f t p r e d 0 865 f t m e a s 0 041 r 2 0 959 and cnn f t p r e d 0 577 f t m e a s 0 111 r 2 0 731 based on the classification of goodness of fit for r2 statistics all three hybrid models cnn gwo cnn ici and cnn ga and the standalone algorithms had very good fits for f t and f t prediction van liew et al 2003 the box plots of the measured and predicted f t and f t using the different models were also used to assess the models performance visually fig 10 in the case of f t although the predicted minimum first quartile q25 medians q50 and third quartile q75 of the cnn cnn ga cnn ica and cnn gwo models were closest to the measured f t some of the models like cnn ga and cnn ica did not accurately predict the maximum value and the cnn model could not satisfactorily predict the maximum f t value in the case of f t the results of the box plots showed that the all of the models were closest to the measure in predicting the minimum q50 and q75 of the f t values while none of them could predict the q50 and maximum values accurately in the case of maximum value the cnn gwo model predicted much better than the other models all of the models underestimated the f t and f t maximum values the highest value is important in the prediction process because the high f t and f t values are representative of the potential contribution of infiltration to less runoff generation less flood occurrences and are important for groundwater recharge soil and water conservation and irrigation regimes in agricultural lands and for accurate watershed management plans therefore if the model predicted the maximum values inaccurately the management plan would fail therefore the best model is the one that except for generally high accuracy predicts the maximum value properly overall the results indicated that cnn gwo was the fittest for the testing dataset and it could predict maximum value well taylor diagrams were plotted in order to further evaluate the models prediction power fig 11 for both f t and f t the taylor plot indicated that the cnn gwo model had the highest performance because the predicted standard deviation values were closely matched to those of the measured data and the correlation coefficients were very high 0 997 and 0 985 respectively the visual comparison of the models performance has the weakness that those with high performance are easily recognizable but it is difficult to identify the models performance classification and rank them thus it is necessary to apply some quantitative measures that provide better evidence of the models performance therefore in this study evaluation metrics were considered to compare the performance of the developed models fig 12 a d provides the rmse mae nse and pbias values for f t predictions by different models the nse values revealed that all of the considered models had very good performance moriasi et al 2007 the results showed that the cnn gwo with rmse 0 409 cm mae 0 316 cm nse 0 994 and pbias 2 43 was the most accurate one among the optimized deep learning infiltration models followed by the cnn ici cnn ga and cnn models based on the pbias values all of the models underestimated the f t values shown by positive pbias values moreover the cnn gwo cnn ici and cnn ga model predictions were classified into very good performance pbias 10 and the cnn model had good performance 10 pbias 15 in the case of f t prediction as shown in fig 13 the cnn gwo model with rmse 0 028 cm h mae 0 019 cm h nse 0 984 and pbias 0 004 outperformed the other models it was followed by cnn ica cnn ga and cnn models based on rmse mae and nse measures however based on pbias criteria cnn ga with a pbias equal to 1 18 outperformed the cnn ica 1 85 and cnn 1 85 models according to nse optimized cnn models have a very good performance while a standalone cnn has good prediction power moreover all models overestimated f t values and their performance was classified into very good performance shown by negative pbias values and pbias 10 overall based on the model performance metrics all developed models had reasonable performance in predicting both f t and f t the present study confirmed that deep learning algorithms here cnn are able to model complex non linear input output relationships using different readily available input variables the results of the current study showed that although a cnn algorithm is a powerful model the hybrid models through metaheuristic algorithms enhanced the predictive power of the standalone cnn algorithm the hybrid methods are considered more reasonable for environmental modeling due to more model flexibility the determination of models parameter values accurately as well as the fact that they enhanced the combined effects of two standalone models thai pham et al 2019 bui et al 2018 stated that the hybrid models are strong and robust and improve the power prediction of standalone models while reducing noise and over fitting problems tien bui et al 2018 results of the enhanced percentage cnn algorithm by different metaheuristic algorithms are shown in fig 14 the results illustrated that the gwo algorithm could enhance performance of the cnn algorithm about 9 56 and 28 18 for f t and f t prediction respectively these percentages for f t and f t are 7 51 and 25 81 for ica algorithms and 7 12 and 25 65 for ga algorithms respectively the main advantage of cnn algorithms compared to traditional ai algorithms are a computationally efficient b have many different hidden layers which enhance prediction power c automatically detect the important features without any human supervision d use special convolution and pooling operations and perform parameter sharing and e use hierarchical patterns in data and assemble more complex patterns using smaller and simpler patterns the cnn gwo model was known as the best performing model in the predicting of f t and f t values the gwo was more efficient in reduction of both variance and bias compared to the ga and ica algorithms the advantages of the gwo algorithm are easy to implement less storage and fewer computational requirements can be summarized as faster convergence resulting from continuous reduction of search space and fewer decision variables ability in avoiding local minima having only two control parameters to tune the algorithm performance and hence better stability and robustness hameed et al 2016 given this is the first study not only evaluating the prediction performance of optimized deep learning algorithms for f t and f t prediction but also in geoscience no direct comparisons exist however the improved performance of the hybrid models conforms to previous tests of data mining algorithms in the infiltration modeling arshad et al 2013 sihag et al 2019b c there are many papers that have applied ann algorithms to predict infiltration processes in the laboratory or with field data and these have stated that ann is an efficient model anari et al 2011 esmaeelnejad et al 2015 sedaghat et al 2016 sihag et al 2018a b recently some field measurements showed the superiority of the rf model over other algorithms in infiltration rate or soil hydraulic conductivity in india kumar and sihag 2019 sihag et al 2019c singh et al 2017 some studies showed that svm or gp are the models with the highest performance in infiltration characteristic prediction das et al 2012 elbisy 2015 sihag et al 2018a 2017 sihag et al 2018b it is obvious from table 1 that there is not any global agreement about which model has the highest performance and therefore in a new study various models should be examined to find the best one thus the performance investigation of newly developed algorithms is strongly required like deep learning in the present study additionally some empirical traditional ai and data mining algorithms with the same data of the current study were applied by sepahvand et al 2018 and sihag et al 2018a sihag et al 2019d whose results are tabulated in table 5 according to table 4 the svm algorithm has the same performance compared to optimized cnn gwo algorithms while it outperforms other algorithms for f t prediction in the case of f t prediction optimized cnn algorithms outperform not only svm but other developed algorithms to better understand the modeling prediction power of optimized deep learning algorithms the authors also performed svm rbf fig 15 a and anfis trimf fig 15 b similar to what singh et al 2019 did but got different prediction accuracy which may be due to different structures of training and testing datasets according to the new finding the current results show that optimized cnn algorithms are more robust flexible and efficient algorithms with very high prediction capability results demonstrate that cnn algorithms have a 11 35 and 9 27 higher performance than svm and anfis models for f t prediction respectively while cnn gwo was the most accurate algorithm having has 13 65 and 11 64 higher performance respectively as the infiltration process not only changes spatially but also temporally it is recommended to collect various time series data and investigate the prediction power of ai models to predict the infiltration process cerdà 1997 reported that seasonal changes play important roles in soil hydrology whereas the infiltration rate was the highest during the summer each year fang et al 1958 5 conclusion the present study evaluated the effectiveness of the stand alone and optimized deep learning of convolutional neural network cnn algorithms using three metaheuristic algorithms for cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate prediction in iran the main results of the current study are summarized as follows 1 all developed algorithms have very good performance for both cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate prediction 2 a cnn model optimized with a gwo algorithm outperformed the other algorithms followed by cnn ica cnn ga and a stand alone cnn algorithm 3 metaheuristic algorithms enhanced the prediction capability of a stand alone cnn algorithm significantly about 9 56 7 51 and 7 21 for cumulative infiltration and about 28 15 25 81 and 25 65 for infiltration rate prediction for gwo ica and ga algorithms respectively 4 different input variables lead to different prediction performance 5 time of experiment measurement has the highest effect on the cumulative infiltration followed by of silt of clay of sand moisture content soil density and infiltration rate respectively 6 percentage of silt is the most important parameter on infiltration rate prediction followed by time of clay moisture content of sand and soil density 7 all developed algorithms underestimated cumulative infiltration while overestimating infiltration rates 8 not only optimized cnn algorithms but also a stand alone cnn algorithm outperformed over all traditional machine learning gp rf gep ann svr svm and anfis and empirical models kostiakov and philips the present results show that stand alone and optimized cnn algorithms are cost effective tools which are not only proposed to be used in infiltration process in other parts of the world but also in all aspects of hydrological science

8242,study region rib catchment in the lake tana sub basin upper blue nile river ethiopia study focus this paper aimed to assess the impacts of future increase in abstraction and recharge reduction on the groundwater groundwater availability and groundwater surface waters interaction based on a three dimensional groundwater flow modeling calibration was made under the steady state condition scenario analysis performed for 1 increase in abstraction 2 decrease in recharge 3 the worst case scenario that combined the aforementioned two scenarios and with additional extraction for irrigation and 4 for the optimal case scenario which considers 5 recharge increase for the worst case scenario model new hydrological insights for the region it is found that the groundwater flows from uplands toward the tana lake the total inflow to and outflow from the system in the calibrated model are 1733480 m3 d and 1840451 m3 d respectively groundwater level drop reduction in base flows to surface waters and in evapotranspiration flux compared to the calibrated values encountered for all scenarios which are significant mean 38 4 m 28 5 100 and 97 8 respectively for the worst case scenario on the other hand an increase in groundwater level mean 9 8 m base flows 0 14 4 and evapotranspiration flux 29 5 observed for the optimal scenario when compared to the worst case scenario results results suggest that groundwater management measures should be implemented to mitigate the impacts keywords groundwater recharge groundwater flow groundwater surface waters interaction modeling rib catchment ethiopia 1 introduction africa is expected to experience water stress before 2025 which is mainly due to increased water demand accompanying an increase in populations climate change is expected to exacerbate this condition bates et al 2008 climate change in the past several decades caused precipitation variability a shift in pattern and frequent extreme events droughts and floods and a rise in near surface atmospheric temperature bates et al 2008 global climate models gcm for east africa showed an increase in the annual mean precipitation 3 to 25 median 7 and temperature 1 8 4 3 c median 3 2 c for the periods 2080 2099 when compared to the years 1980 1999 christensen et al 2007 conway and schipper 2011 made the climate temperature and rainfall projection for ethiopia the result showed average annual warming of 1 2 c range 0 7 2 3 c by 2020s and 2 2 c range 1 4 2 9 c by 2050s the regional differences in warming are relatively modest and warming is observed in all four seasons the climate models showed different projections of the annual rainfall with the multi model average rainfall increase for the 2020s and 2050s of 0 4 and 1 respectively in ethiopia rainfall variability a pattern shift and extreme events of drought and flood frequently occur in the different parts of the country these are used to associate with el niño and la niña events which are due to warming over and cooling below the average temperature respectively of the indian and atlantic oceans the shift in rainfall patterns and frequency of extreme events increased in recent years that can be attributed to climate change ethiopian meteorological agency unpublished the atmospheric temperature showed an average increase of 1 3 c in the country between 1967 and 2017 ethiopian meteorological agency unpublished which nearly agrees with the conway and schipper 2011 projection gcm projection for the tana sub basin where the rib catchment is found fig 1 and sec 2 2 for 2021 2050 and 2071 2100 showed that the precipitation will increase in the winter months while precipitation increase by a small amount in summer or show a significant decrease in some months like june this shows that there will be a seasonal shift in precipitation due to climatic change enyew et al 2014 this may shift the groundwater recharge season from summer to winter according to these models the minimum and maximum temperature increase is 1 7 and 8 9 c respectively potential evapotranspiration is projected to increase in all months of the year at the end of the 21st century climate change has possible direct impacts such as a decrease in groundwater recharge increase in evapotranspiration and water quality deterioration bates et al 2008 indirect impacts include an increase in water demand from groundwater use taylor et al 2013 recharge is not only influenced by the magnitude of precipitation but also by its intensity frequency and land use increased precipitation decreases the recharge in humid regions as precipitation intensity or heavy precipitation events exceed the infiltration capacity in semiarid and arid areas an increase in precipitation may increase the groundwater recharge bates et al 2008 however the concurrent increase in evapotranspiration can potentially reduce the recharge even with precipitation increase global circulation model projection in the ogallala aquifer region usa showed that the natural groundwater recharge decreased by more than 20 for an increase in temperature of 2 5 c rosenberg et al 1999 according to stoll et al 2011 attribution of observed changes in groundwater level storage or discharge to climatic changes is difficult because of additional influences of land use changes and groundwater abstraction both detections of changes in the groundwater systems and attribution of those changes to climatic changes are rare owing to a lack of appropriate observation wells and a small number of studies jiménez cisneros et al 2014 in the tana sub basin there is water use competition among hydropower tourism or navigation water supply irrigation and environmental needs such as sustaining wetlands and base flow to streams and the tana lake groundwater is the sole source of water supply for urban and rural communities and industries according to chebud and melesse 2009 groundwater is the source of potable water for an approximate total population of two million in the tana sub basin moreover in addition to surface waters rivers reservoirs and tana lake household irrigation using groundwater is being increased an increase in the number of people better livelihood higher per capita demand urbanization industrial and irrigation expansions in the area will escalate the water demand and conflict in water use in the future on the other hand groundwater level decline and drying of productive boreholes and springs were reported after a prolonged drought and pumping for a long time in the tana sub basin besides poor quality groundwaters were pumped in some deep boreholes amhara design and supervision works enterprise adswe 2009 application of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace in tana sub basin revealed an overall declining trend in groundwater storage groundwater storage depletion of 18 4 cm was observed for the period between 2003 and 2013 which is due to overexploitation abiy and melesse 2017 moreover according to the information from the local dwellers personal communication with the local people and the authors long time observations unpublished the size of the permanent wetland and dry season stream flows are decreasing from previous years besides navigation on tana lake was also seen paused during the dry season in some drought years the authors assume that the decline in the water table size of the wetland and flow in streams are because of the combined effect of an increase in abstraction and decrease in recharge due to climate change and deforestation tana sub basin consists of 11 catchments of which gilgel abay rib gumera and megech catchments account for 75 6 of the total drainage area mamo 2015 the study area rib catchment is the 2nd biggest catchments in the lake tana sub basin which consists of more urban centers a big irrigable plain area 198 5 km2 and groundwater fed wetland and the tana lake all concerns described above apply to the rib catchment even will be more severe here in the future as groundwater development will be intense in the area most of the people in the rib catchment live in the rural parts of the area and have a sedentary way of life that exercise mixed farming and raising livestock the land use has changed and the forest cover is diminishing due to deforestation by the dwellers for farmland and energy source and the people use open grazing for livestock personal communication with the local people which lead to recharge reduction according to adswe 2019 the land use land cover of the rib catchment consists of cultivated land 76 1 shrub bushland 9 4 forest woodland 6 5 grassland 6 4 wetland 1 3 built up area 0 4 and bare land 0 01 in general the study area is facing on the one hand escalating water demand and water use conflict and decreasing groundwater recharge trend sec 2 3 5 and on the other hand declining groundwater resource and base flows to surface waters previous studies in the area bceom 1998 mamo 2015 mamo et al 2016 nigate et al 2017 smec 2007 are mainly regional which are for the whole tana sub basin and are based on hydrogeological studies and integrated hydrological and hydrogeological system analysis these studies dealt with characterizing the aquifer and groundwater flow systems groundwater and surface water interaction and recharge evaluation getenet 2017 did hydrogeological investigation including recharge evaluation in the rib catchment however there is no modeling work done for the area to better understand the current groundwater and water use condition and groundwater fluxes and to predict the future impacts associated with an increase in abstraction and recharge reduction which can be used as an input for groundwater management undertakings groundwater flow models have been and continue to be used to investigate the important features of the groundwater systems and to predict their behavior under varied conditions and also form an integral part of decision support systems for management sinha 2005 a numerical model is a deterministic mathematical model which simulates groundwater flow indirectly using a governing differential equation together with boundary conditions the initial condition is also required for transient simulation anderson and woessner 1992 kresic 1997 the purpose of groundwater flow modeling can be a prediction system description or a generic modeling exercise anderson and woessner 1992 the type of model to be constructed whether steady or transient one two full three dimensional or quasi three dimensional depends on the availability of input data type of aquifer current understanding of the hydrogeological system and on site specific use of the model results groundwater flow models developed in different parts of ethiopia which have the purposes of system analysis and understanding the response of aquifer systems to the different increase in abstractions and decrease recharge scenarios amare 2007 asrie and sebhat 2016 ayenew et al 2008 azeref and bushira 2020 belay 2006 birhanu 2012 bushira 2007 kinfu 2010 oljira 2006 modeling works in ethiopia are often made in steady state conditions because of the scarcity of groundwater level monitoring data chebud and melesse 2009 did groundwater flow modeling in gumera catchment of the tana sub basin to estimate the base flow to tana lake khadim et al 2020 also did transient groundwater flow modeling in gilgel abay catchment of the tana sub basin to determine the groundwater availability in this study a three dimensional two layers steady state numerical modeling made which better represents the aquifer system being exploited the simulation was made using modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 that is a modular finite difference groundwater model there is no time series data to do transient modeling the objectives of the study are to 1 discern the current the base line condition of the groundwater groundwater surface waters interaction and groundwater fluxes 2 assess the impacts of the projected increase in groundwater abstraction and recharge reduction on the groundwater groundwater availability and groundwater surface waters interaction and 3 to identify the possible groundwater management options to mitigate the impacts the result of the study will serve as a foundation for future modeling efforts including transient modeling the study will give valuable clues and insight for decision and policy makers and researchers to devise evaluate and implement proper groundwater management strategies besides the methodology can be a useful approach to similar studies on other catchments and sub basin s 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and data acquisition meteorological and hydrological data were acquired from the western amhara meteorology office and ministry of water irrigation and energy respectively boreholes data such as pumping test logs depth and groundwater level were collected from amhara water irrigation and energy development bureau water well drilling enterprise tis isat water works plc and zonal and district water offices topographic data generated from shuttle radar topographic mission srtm data which is from 90 m by 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem landsat tm and google earth imageries were also used to delineate different boundaries in the study area figures were prepared by using microsoft excel and arcgis 10 softwares 2 2 site description the rib catchment was first delineated based on dem data using arcgis spatial analyst tools hydrology and checked with hill shed and landsat tm image to correct some error in delineation and further verified in the field it is found in the lake tana sub basin where the blue nile river originates from the tana lake northwest ethiopian plateau in the amhara regional state fig 1 the area is located within utm zone 37 wgs 1984 between 342831and 414511 m east and 1294048 and 1351659 m north the total area is 2099 km2 plateau top rugged elevated and steep mountainous volcanic terrain rugged low relief volcanic terrain and gentle to nearly flat plain in unconsolidated sediments constitute the physiography of the area the topographic slope decreases from all sides toward tana lake the rugged elevated and steep mountain has a slope of 15 1 49 7 the rugged and low relief terrain and the gentle to flat plain have slopes of 3 1 to 15 and less than 3 respectively the maximum and minimum elevations are 4108 and 1776 m which are at the southeast extremity of guna mountain and the lake margin in the west respectively fig 1 the study area is drained by the rib river and its tributaries which flow to tana lake the rib river is perennial while most of the tributaries are seasonal or with little dry season flow a perennial wetland with an area of 17 2 km2 10 october 2019 google earth image exists close to the lake the rib reservoir has a design storage capacity of 234 106 m3 and its area as per the 24 october 2019 google earth image is 11 1 km2 the reservoir is intended to irrigate 20 800 ha of land in the plain area but irrigation did not commence until this time according to the thornthwaite 1948 climate classification method the area has a moist sub humid c2 climate while the climate is moist based on the modified thornthwaite feddema 2005 method the rainfall pattern is unimodal with wet and dry seasons from june to september and october to may respectively the mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet of the area are 1278 and 1247 mm year respectively it is difficult to get the actual population data residing in the catchment because administrative boundaries are not the same as the hydrologic boundary population number in rib catchment deduced based on the population number of ethiopia in 2018 world bank group 2019 and the population dwelling by 2019 in the area projected to be about 213 007 using the growth rate of 2 6 ethiopian statistical agency unpublished 2 3 developing the conceptual model the conceptual model represents the aquifer and groundwater flow systems of the area to be modeled in the form of a diagram and cross section it includes defining boundaries of the model hydrostratigraphic units and the groundwater flow system and preparing a water budget anderson and woessner 1992 2 3 1 model boundaries physical natural and hydraulic artificial features can be used as internal and external boundaries of the model domain anderson and woessner 1992 kresic 1997 the topographic divide of the rib catchment which is coincident with the regional groundwater divide as there is no groundwater inflow and outflow across it and the tana lake in the west are external boundaries delimiting the model area perennial rivers rib reservoir and the wetland fig 1 are considered as internal boundaries which are represented by different boundary conditions on the numerical model 2 3 2 defining aquifer system geological mapping revealed that the upper basalt guna volcanics guna tuff guna basalt and guna phonolite and quaternary fluivio lacustrine sediments are exposed in the study area figs 2 and 3 the upper basalt is correlated to the oligocene trap series of alaji formation while the guna volcanics to miocene pliocene shield volcanos of tarmaber guassa formation guna basalt dated to have age of 10 4 ma kieffer et al 2004 the upper basalt contains interlayers of trachyte flows tuff and ignimbrite and has a thickness of about 804 m in the area it is underlain elsewhere in tana sub basin by the middle basalt mamo 2015 and overlain by guna tuff and guna basalt within the study area it is highly weathered with thin eluvium on the top part and moderate slopes and moderately fractured and with columnar joints fractures are open and interconnected boreholes drilled in this aquifer have 43 156 m depth with a mean of 91 8 m borehole yield is 0 6 10 l s with a mean of 3 5 l s and transmissivity ranges between 3 2 and 67 3 m2 d and the mean is 19 8 m2 d springs often have little discharge less than 2 l s guna tuff is loose to weakly compact with welded tuff interbeds the thickness of this unit is 209 m springs in this aquifer have low discharge less than 0 5 l s two boreholes drilled in this aquifer have depth and yield of 42 m and 3 1 l s and 180 m and 7 l s transmissivity is about 13 7 m2 d for the first borehole guna basalt is weathered and highly fractured with columnar joints at places there are no groundwater points in this aquifer it is situated on a steep slope which acts as a recharge area with low storage guna basalt has a thickness of about 393 m guna phonolite occupies the top summit of the guna volcano and has a steep slope that can transmit but with low storage this rock is fresh with columnar joints and has a thickness of 590 m the fluvio lacustrine sediments consist of unconsolidated sediments of clay at the top and sand beds at different depths a borehole drilled near woreta town in this aquifer with 88 m depth has sand sediments up to 84 m with less than 6 m clay at the top and middle and fractured and weathered basalt underneath the yield of this borehole is 40 l s the thickness of the deposits at the center of the plain is not known but expected to reach 100 m according to mamo 2015 the middle basalt and lower basalt underlie the upper basalt and are described as follows the middle basalt correlated to oligocene aiba basalt is weathered and moderately fractured with thin about 0 5 m clayey silt paleosol at the contact with the overlying upper basalt its thickness is about 300 m transmissivity in this rock varies between 1 1 to 157 m2 d with a mean of 26 5 m2 d borehole yield varies between 0 7 and 17 l s and the mean is 2 6 l s the lower basalt eocene ashangi formation was encountered at deep boreholes in the northern tana sub basin underlying the middle basalt and is expected to have a thickness of 200 1200 m in regional flow systems aquifer and confining units are defined based on the concept of hydrostratigraphy anderson and woessner 1992 weight 2008 several geologic or stratigraphic formations may be combined into a single hydrostratigraphic unit according to their similar hydrogeologic properties or a single stratigraphic formation may be divided into aquifer and confining units based on the integrated hydrogeological hydrogeochemical and isotope hydrology approaches mamo 2015 revealed that the different volcanic rocks and unconsolidated sediments in the tana sub basin form three aquifer systems which are the upper aquifer system uas middle aquifer system mas and lower aquifer system las the uas consists of an unconfined aquifer in the upper and semi confined aquifer s in the lower parts the two aquifers are interacting this aquifer system is being exploited and has a thickness of 300 400 m at different places borehole yield and transmissivity increase were seen with depth when the two aquifers intersected mamo 2015 the mas and las underlie the uas and are under confined conditions and have unfit quality for drinking and irrigation purposes mamo 2015 in this study the uas was considered for the modeling hydrogeologic units exposed at the surface figs 2 and 3 form the regional unconfined aquifer part of the uas at the current understanding the extent and thickness of the confining unit between the unconfined and semi confined aquifers are not well defined due to the limitation of boreholes data however groundwater struck at different depths and groundwater level drop and rise encountered in boreholes when the semi confined aquifer s was penetrated 2 3 3 groundwater flow systems most of the boreholes were drilled in the unconfined aquifer the unconfined aquifer has a shallow circulation and flushed system and often feeds and sustains dry season flows of streams and springs in volcanic terrain the rib river feeds groundwater in the downstream part of the plain this groundwater also feeds the tana lake and sustains the wetland groundwater flows from the uplands and converges toward tana lake see fig 8 and sec 3 1 3 there are only a few boreholes penetrating the semi confined aquifer s in these boreholes screens installed in both aquifers and the groundwater levels measured represent the composite heads groundwater in the semi confined aquifer s has regional flow beneath the unconfined aquifer in the tana sub basin and underflows to the south and west adjacent low lying sub basins mamo 2015 2 3 4 water budget the water budget is prepared from the field data to summarize the magnitude of the inflows and outflows and the change in storage and it is used to compare with the water budget computed by the model during calibration anderson and woessner 1992 the inflow is mainly diffuse recharge from the rainfall and minor induced recharge in the plain from rib river and seasonal ponds which form accompanying the inundation of the near shore areas during the wet season by the tana lake however the recharge from these ponds is low due to hard and plastic clay cover the recharge from ponds and the rib river is not accounted for the model mean recharge of 284 7 mm year was estimated for the tana sub basin based on chloride mass balance and soil water balance methods mamo 2015 which gives 1 64 106 m3 d for rib catchment getenet 2017 estimated mean recharge of 236 mm year 1 36 106 m3 d for rib catchment using soil water balance chloride mass balance and water level fluctuation methods the outflows include abstraction base flows to streams rib reservoir and tana lake evapotranspiration from the wetland and underflow beneath the lake bed sediments through the semi confined aquifer s of the uas evapotranspiration et was only considered from the wetland as this area has subdued topography and the groundwater level here is near to or at the surface compared to other parts of the study area et rate was taken equal to the mean pet of adis zemen station 1337 mm year which gives 6 3 104 m3 d the pet was estimated by penman monteith method using 2010 2019 meteorological data the hydrological station on the rib river is not functioning since 2007 and the base flow data was not used as a model calibration value the current total water demand for domestic use is about 17 041 m3 d which is estimated based on the population number in 2019 sec 2 2 and assuming 80 l d capita water demand african development bank group 2019 this value is nearly similar to the total abstraction rate used during model calibration 2 3 5 recharge trend analysis fig 4 shows the trends of precipitation and temperature five years moving average for debre tabore station the precipitation shows fluctuations with extremely high values between 1975 and 1978 and 2017 and 2019 in general the graph indicates a decreasing trend especially for the data between 1979 and 2016 the temperature has an increasing trend from 15 2 c in 1975 to 16 4 c in 2019 which is in agreement with the conway and schipper 2011 projection sec 1 potential evapotranspiration is expected to increase accompanying the temperature rise the base flow component of the rib river flow 1989 2007 was separated based on eckhardt 2005 recursive digital filter method using automated base flow separation for canadian datasets abscan software maximum base flow index of 0 25 for volcanic rocks and perennial streams eckhardt 2005 and recession constant of 0 998 which is estimated from the rib river recession period flow data were applied as a two parameter filter then a correlation was made between precipitation and the base flow data after screening by 95 confidence interval and recharge deduced from precipitation data based on the trend line equation plotting these recharge values against time years excluding the 1975 1978 and 2017 2019 extreme high values revealed a decreasing trend although the coefficient of determination is low due to cycles of ups and downs fig 5 a recharge reduction of about 13 3 was deduced for the coming 15 years based on the trend line equation this is in agreement with khadim et al 2020 simulated recharge and net stream leakage base flow minus stream leakage to the aquifer for gilgel abay river which show fluctuation with years but generally with a slightly decreasing trend from 1988 to 2016 although gcm projections showed slight increase and variability in precipitation for the 2020s in ethiopia and tana sub basin sec 1 the concurrent increase in pet and deforestation is expected to reduce the recharge during this period 2 4 model design and construction a three dimensional groundwater flow model constructed using the finite difference processing modflow 2005 the model domain was discretized into grids or cells with two model layers an equal number of 124 rows and 154 columns created in both layers the blocks have a uniform size of 500 m by 500 m taking into consideration of the data availability figs 6 and 7 the top unconfined and the underlying semi confined aquifers in the uas form the two model layers the thickness lateral extent and hydraulic conductivity of the semi confining unit between the two aquifers is not known at present sec 2 3 2 thus the first model layer was designated as an unconfined aquifer layer type one while the second layer was considered as a convertible layer from semi confined to unconfined with variable transmissivity layer type three based on geophysical data sogreah 2012 and borehole lithological logs the thickness of model layer one is taken to vary from 100 m in the fluvio lacustrine sediments to 150 m in the upland volcanic rocks a uniform thickness of 250 m considered for layer two geophysical data and borehole logs showed that the bottom of layer two is an impermeable boundary the top elevations for layer one were derived with model grid size from shuttle radar topographic mission srtm data i e from 90 m by 90 m resolution digital elevation model layer top for layer two was assigned by subtracting the layer one thickness from the top elevations layers one and two thicknesses subtracted from their top elevations to assign the bottom elevations the regional groundwater divide coincides with the topographic divide of the rib catchment no flow boundary conditions were assigned along this divide in the two layers the model boundary with the tana lake in the west was considered as a specified constant head boundary condition for layer one as it is a huge lake with negligible water level fluctuation model boundary groundwater outflow beneath the lake bed sediments in layer two was considered as a head dependent flux boundary condition and simulated by general head boundary ghb package perennial rivers figs 1 and 6 and the rib reservoir designated as head dependent flux boundary conditions and simulated with river and reservoir packages respectively data for rivers width river bed elevation water level and river bed sediments were collected during the field investigation limited horizontal hydraulic conductivity data are available for volcanic rocks in both layers therefore the preliminary mean values were assigned for each geologic unit in the two layers which are deduced from pumping test data and literature review figs a 1 and a 2 supplementary material horizontal hydraulic conductivity values subsequently modified during the calibration process the horizontal anisotropy took as one while the vertical hydraulic conductivity for layer one is one tenth of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity spatially variable recharge input was assigned based on topography precipitation and soil cover variation in the area which is in agreement with the mean recharge rate estimated by mamo 2015 and getenet 2017 recharge was simulated by the recharge package evapotranspiration from the wetland in layer one sec 2 3 4 was simulated by the evapotranspiration package and the extinction depth is 3 m groundwater abstraction in the catchment simulated with a well package location fig 6 and daily production from the boreholes were acquired from different zonal and district water offices and these boreholes were visited during the field work extraction rates used during model calibration from these boreholes showed in table a 1 supplementary material initial and prescribed hydraulic heads are values of hydraulic heads for each active and constant head cell in the model these heads must be higher than the bottom elevation of cells the initial heads are necessary to start iterative model calculations and for a steady state condition only hydraulic heads in the constant head cells must be realistic values kresic 1997 in this model the initial hydraulic heads were assigned by subtracting 10 m from the top elevations of layer one 1786 m assigned for the constant head cells which is the average water level of tana lake 2 5 model calibration calibration is a process of finding a set of boundary conditions stresses and hydrogeologic parameters which produce results that match the field measured hydraulic heads and fluxes within a pre established range of error anderson and woessner 1992 kresic 1997 calibration methods include forward and inverse techniques forward or trial and error calibration technique applied here the initial hydraulic conductivity recharge river conductance and ghb conductance values were assigned and adjusted in sequential model runs within a reasonable limit and the results were checked to the calibration targets adjustments to all or selected parameters and recharge at a time and model execution made sequentially until the simulated heads and flux match with the observed ones with a reasonable error or within the calibration targets values with more certainty modified slightly besides adjustment to model layers thicknesses was made during calibration during the process of calibration a new hydraulic conductivity zone was created in the basalt beneath the fluvio lacustrine sediments to achieve the best calibration fit this agrees with the geophysical magneto telluric and vertical electrical sounding data of sogreah 2012 which show a relatively more resistive layer 250 m volcanic rock than the overlying sediments and more permeable or lower resistivity than the adjacent basalt trial and error calibration may produce non unique solutions when using only heads as calibration criteria because correlated values e g increase in horizontal hydraulic conductivity and decrease in recharge will give similar heads therefore the steady state calibration was made using static water level data of 34 observation boreholes and flux of evapotranspiration from the wetland as calibration values the effectiveness of calibration was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively comparison between contour maps and analysis of the scatter plots of measured and simulated heads made the average of the differences in measured and simulated heads mean error me absolute mean error ame and root mean squared error rmse which are used to quantify the average error in the calibration determined using the following equations eqs 1 3 these different statistical parameters me ame rmse scaled root mean squared error etc were used to evaluate the model performance percent change of simulated evapotranspiration and recharge fluxes from estimated values and water budget discrepancy were also used as calibration targets 1 me 1 n ʃ ho hs 2 ame 1 n ʃ ho hs 3 rmse 1 n ʃ ho hs 2 0 5 where ho and hs are measured and simulated heads respectively and n refers to the number of observation boreholes 2 6 calibration sensitivity analysis trial and error calibration does not quantify the statistical uncertainty or reliability of the results and should be followed by detailed sensitivity analysis anderson and woessner 1992 the sensitivity of the calibrated model was analyzed by changing the calibrated horizontal hydraulic conductivity recharge and the ghb and river bed conductance values by 25 50 and 75 one parameter value adjusted at a time in the whole model domain while other parameters kept to the calibrated values the sensitivity of the model to that particular parameter or stress value was evaluated by the corresponding percent change in rmse and evapotranspiration flux from the calibrated ones 2 7 scenario analysis the calibrated model was used to predict the impacts of the projected changes in groundwater abstraction and recharge on the groundwater groundwater availability and groundwater and surface waters interaction under steady state conditions scenario analyses made for 1 increase in abstraction for domestic use 2 decrease in recharge 3 the worst case scenario and 4 for optimal case scenario the population in the area was projected for 15 years 2034 and the water demand was estimated based on the water demand per capita of 80 l s the result showed that the total domestic water demand will increase by at least 190 of the present 2019 abstraction rate and this value is used for increase abstraction scenario analysis this water demand may be less than the actual value as migration and expansion of industries and service sectors will escalate the demand and the water demand per capita will increase from the present value besides the population density in amhara regional state is relatively higher in the country and this was not accounted for in the population number estimation sec 2 2 livestock watering in the rural parts of the area is mainly from surface waters however in the plain near the tana lake some people use groundwater for their livestock watering personal communication with the local people and this water demand was not accounted for in the water demand projection the increase in abstraction distributed equally to all pumping wells which were used during model calibration climate and land use changes are expected to cause recharge reduction sec 1 recharge trend analysis revealed a 13 3 recharge decline in the area in the coming 15 years sec 2 3 5 hence the calibrated model was tested in scenario two by a 13 3 decrease in groundwater recharge from the calibrated value the worst case scenario is a combination of the increase in abstraction and the decrease in recharge scenarios in this scenario abstraction used during calibration increased by 190 120 new synthetic pumping wells each withdrawing 1912 5 m3 d added in the plain near the tana lake to irrigate 3000 ha of land as an augmentation to the rib reservoir and the recharge was decreased by 13 3 irrigation is practiced in two seasons from december to may onion potato carrot rice and cabbage used to grow in the area and an average crop water requirement of 350 mm ha per season considered to estimate pumping rate and the number of boreholes this scenario represents the most likely situations that the area will experience in the coming 15 years the optimal scenario is a hypothetical case analysis made to test the effectiveness of source management strategies under normal conditions the present recharge tends to decrease in the future due to climate and land use changes to mitigate impacts associated with these threats climate change adaptation measures have to be exercised in the catchment the recharge is assumed to increase if better land use practices and groundwater management works are to be undertaken e g managed aquifer recharge afforestation terracing and minimizing over grazing the worst case scenario model was used for this simulation with a 5 69 044 m3 d increase on the recharge system responses were evaluated as a percentage change of fluxes and heads difference groundwater level drawdown or rise from the calibrated and the worst case scenario results 2 8 prediction sensitivity analysis prediction sensitivity analysis was made for the worst case scenario to assess the uncertainty in the simulation results due to uncertainties in the magnitude of the stresses and uncertainties in the calibrated model recharge withdrawal horizontal hydraulic conductivity and ghb and river bed conductance values of the worst case scenario varied by 0 25 and 0 5 and the head rmse and evapotranspiration flux variation from the worst case ones assessed to rank which parameter or stress is the most influencing 3 results 3 1 calibration results 3 1 1 calibration goodness of fit comparison between contour maps of simulated and observed heads shows that the pattern and groundwater flow direction are similar the general groundwater flow configuration agrees in the two contour maps fig 8 the scatter plot of simulated versus observed heads indicates an excellent correlation with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 992 all observation boreholes lie within the 95 confidence interval fig 9 residual estimated minus simulated evapotranspiration flux is 19 4 of the estimated flux moreover the change in simulated recharge from estimated recharges by mamo 2015 and getenet 2017 is 2 7 and 17 1 respectively besides the simulated water budget shows a discrepancy of 5 99 between inflows and outflows which is within a reasonable limit the me ame and rmse for the calibrated model are 17 4 32 9 and 36 7 m respectively the average errors are not big considering the high total head loss 1007 m in the model domain the maximum acceptable value of the calibration criterion depends on the magnitude of the change in heads over the problem domain if the ratio of rmse to the total head loss in the system is small the error is only a small part of the overall model response anderson and woessner 1992 the scaled root mean squared error srmse which is the rmse divided by the range of measured heads less than 5 or 10 is considered a reasonable target barnett et al 2012 the following criteria were also used in addition to the above ones to evaluate the effectiveness of the calibration table 1 the spatial distribution of errors residuals depicted in fig 10 the errors are randomly distributed in the area the model was considered calibrated when there was no further improvement in the rmse and all other criteria met 3 1 2 calibrated parameters and recharge the calibrated general head boundary conductance is 17 175 m2 d the river conductance is 0 07 and 0 09 m2 d in volcanic rocks and fluvio lacustrine sediments respectively the calibrated horizontal hydraulic conductivity values for layer one and layer two and the recharge are shown in figures a 3 a 4 and a 5 supplementary material respectively 3 1 3 hydraulic heads and water budget base line conditions the calibrated model was used to assess the base line conditions the simulated groundwater head in layer one decreases from 2790 m in the southeast guna mountain to 1784 m in the plain near tana lake similarly the hydraulic head in layer two varies from 2774 m in the guna mountain to 1681 m in the plain area the groundwater flow direction is similar in layer one and layer two groundwater flows from the north due southwest and from south due northwest toward the rib river and from the southeast to the northwest and finally converges toward the tana lake the hydraulic gradient is relatively lower in the plain than in the upland volcanic areas see fig 8 simulated total inflow to and outflow from the system are 1 733 480 m3 d and 1 840 451 m3 d respectively table 2 the simulated total diffuse groundwater recharge from precipitation is 1 59 106 m3 d 276 5 mm year which is the major component 91 9 of the total inflow the recharge rates vary from the maximum value of 2 95 10 3 m d 1077 mm year in a rugged and fractured volcanic area to 3 0 10 6 m d 1 1 mm year in the plain fluvio lacustrine area which is covered by plastic and hard clay suggesting lower infiltration rate here see fig a 5 supplementary material the precipitation also tends to decrease from uplands toward the plain the simulated water budget revealed that there is inflow from the tana lake constant head cells to the adjacent groundwater which is mainly at the margin south of the rib river this induced recharge equals 8 1 of the total inflow to the system besides a very small quantity of leakage from the rib river to the groundwater occurs in the plain area close to the lake the groundwater discharge mechanisms are an abstraction evapotranspiration and base flows to streams rib reservoir and tana lake abstraction et flux and base flows to streams tana lake and rib reservoir account for 0 7 2 8 and 0 2 0 6 and 2 3 of the total outflow respectively groundwater in layer two underflows beneath the lake bed sediments and is the major component 93 4 of the total aquifer system outflow the current total abstraction is 0 8 of the recharge the groundwater fluxes are shown in table 2 vertically layer one receives 6 4 106 m3 d leakage from layer two while leakage from layer one to layer two is 1 6 106 m3 d 99 2 of the leakage from layer two to layer one takes place through volcanic uplands only 0 8 of the leakage occurs through the fluvio lacustrine sediments in upstream areas which is close to the volcanic uplands 54 and 46 of the total leakage from layer one to layer two occur through the fluvio lacustrine sediments and volcanic rocks respectively 3 2 results of calibration sensitivity analysis the model is more sensitive to recharge and hydraulic conductivity and less sensitive to ghb conductance and least sensitive to river bed conductance the effect of recharge and hydraulic conductivity on heads i e rmse is the highest under increasing and decreasing values from the calibrated ones respectively fig 11 recharge and hydraulic conductivity have similar effects but in a reverse way based on evapotranspiration flux fig 12 therefore effort should be made in the future to collect new hydraulic conductivity data with the help of drilling in the catchment 3 3 results of scenario and predictive sensitivity analyses results of the scenario analyses are shown in tables 3 and 4 tables a 2 and a 3 supplementary material show the sensitivity of the worst case scenario predictions to the different input stresses and parameters change 4 discussion the results of scenario analyses were evaluated to examine the severity of impacts of the projected increase in abstraction and decreased recharge on the groundwater groundwater availability and groundwater and surface waters interaction the increase in abstraction resulted in a mean drawdown of 1 5 m with a range of 0 1 9 9 m the decrease in base flows to surface waters and evapotranspiration flux from calibrated values for this scenario are 0 9 12 3 and 5 1 respectively the mean drawdown for recharge reduction is 30 2 m with a minimum and maximum value of 2 1 and 135 5 m respectively the decrease in base flows to surface waters and evapotranspiration flux are 24 9 100 and 80 6 respectively the drawdown ranges from 4 8 to 152 1 m with a mean of 38 4 m for the worst case scenario and the base flows and evapotranspiration flux reductions are 28 5 100 and 97 8 respectively leakages from the tana lake and streams increased by 3 6 and zero percent for an increase in abstraction 70 8 and 700 for recharge reduction and by 190 6 and 900 for the worst case scenarios respectively groundwater underflow decreased by 0 3 5 8 and 10 2 for increase abstraction recharge reduction and the worst case scenarios respectively see tables 3 and 4 compared to the calibrated values leakage from layer one to layer two decreases 0 5 18 while leakage from layer two to layer one increases 0 9 34 7 for all scenarios with the maximum values for the worst case scenario table a 4 supplementary material in general the decline in groundwater level base flow and et fluxes were observed for all scenarios groundwater flow reversal was not observed except cone of depressions for the recharge reduction and worst case scenarios in the southeastern mountain and near tana lake around the wetland the drawdown for the worst scenario is depicted in fig 13 drawdown decreases from the maximum in the southeast upland toward the tana lake where it is a minimum and is often greater than 10 m despite that the total extraction is 18 6 of the recharge the decrease in the groundwater level is significant for the worst case scenario limited 13 groundwater level monitoring data getenet 2017 showed that the mean seasonal groundwater level fluctuation due to natural recharge in the study area is 4 9 m the groundwater level decline drawdown for the worst case scenario is much greater than this seasonal water table change therefore significant static storage reserve depletion or overdraft to the unconfined aquifer layer one will occur in almost the whole study area this will entail adverse effects on the groundwater availability and base flows to surface waters and on the existence of the wetland base flow and et fluxes of the worst case scenario found significantly declined from that of the base line conditions which agrees with the above conclusion the water table decline will lead to drying of shallow boreholes hand dug wells and small springs and the pump setting depths may need to be deepened for deep boreholes which increase the cost of extraction the base flow reduction especially that of the worst case scenario will cause the dry season streams flows and size of the tana lake to diminish and the result showed that the wetland is nearly drying this will in turn adversely affect the groundwater dependent habitats furthermore this suggests a serious water use conflict in the future and more stress to the groundwater on the other hand the optimal case scenario showed a mean groundwater level decline of 28 5 m from the calibrated value the outflow fluxes as base flows to streams tana lake and the rib reservoir et flux and groundwater underflow decreased when compared to the calibrated values leakages from streams and the tana lake to the aquifer system increased from the calibrated values however groundwater level rose by a mean of 9 8 m range 0 7 44 2 m and the base flows to all surface waters increased 11 4 14 4 excepting the tana lake 0 while leakages decreased 8 9 40 and et flux increased by 29 5 when compared to those of the worst case scenario the groundwater underflow value showed an increase by 2 1 from that of the worst case scenario see tables 3 and 4 this suggests that the 5 increase in recharge in the optimal scenario from that of the worst case scenario was effective and resulted in a considerable recovery of the groundwater storage and base flows to surface waters and et flux even under extreme groundwater withdrawal conditions results of groundwater level and groundwater fluxes of the worst case and optimal scenarios indicate the need and effectiveness of the groundwater management climate adaptation measures in the area sensitivity analysis for the worst case scenario showed that the predicted values are more sensitive to horizontal hydraulic conductivity followed by recharge withdrawals ghb conductance and river bed conductance based on heads i e rmse see table a 2 based on et flux the recharge and horizontal hydraulic conductivity have a high influence on the prediction simulations followed by withdrawals ghb conductance and least for river bed conductance table a 3 5 limitations and recommendations the model is of the first kind for the area the following limitations should be considered when utilizing the model outputs limited hydraulic conductivity data are available at present more pumping test data should be collected for each layer by drilling test wells these boreholes data together with additional geophysical survey results will also help to refine the thicknesses and to better define the hydrostratigraphic layers and their extent evapotranspiration and recharge fluxes are reasonable estimates although may not be determined with 100 accuracy the recharge may be refined in the future by considering the ever changing land use and climate data the observation boreholes data are of different times which are static water level data during drilling however the mean seasonal groundwater level fluctuation due to natural recharge in the area is 4 9 m getenet 2017 see sec 4 moreover the groundwater level decline between 2003 and 2013 was 18 4 cm abiy and melesse 2017 sec 1 these water level changes are far less than the calibration rmse value which suggest that the error introduced into the result due to heads measured at different times is lower than the error introduced due to uncertainty in the other input parameters and recharge model verification was not made due to limited available observation boreholes data despite these limitations the model outputs are adequate and reliable to give valuable clues and insights on the base line conditions and impacts of the increase in abstraction and recharge reduction on the groundwater groundwater availability and groundwater surface waters interaction the study identified the need and the options for groundwater management which will enable decision and policy makers and researchers to devise evaluate and implement management strategies however the model may not be directly used for detailed groundwater management practices management strategies should be evaluated based on detailed transient modeling for this groundwater level monitoring rehabilitation of gauge station on the rib river and the above recommendations should be realized in the area 6 conclusions a three dimensional groundwater flow model was constructed and utilized to assess the base line conditions and the impacts of the projected 2034 increase in abstraction and recharge reduction on the groundwater groundwater availability and groundwater surface waters interaction the model has two layers representing the aquifer system being exploited in the area and calibrated for steady state condition the simulated heads showed that the groundwater flow converges from all sides of the uplands toward the west or the tana lake groundwater from layer one feeds streams rib reservoir and partly the tana lake and sustains the wetland the rib river feeds this aquifer in the western part of the plain near the lake and the tana lake also feeds the aquifer at its margin mainly south of the rib river junction groundwater from layer two underflows beneath the lake bed sediments the two aquifers are hydraulically linked and interact the total inflow to the system is 1 733 480 m3 d while the total outflow is 1 840 451 m3 d diffuse recharge and groundwater underflow from layer two are the major components of the inflow and outflow respectively the increase in abstraction recharge reduction and the worst case scenarios resulted in groundwater level drop reduction in base flows to the tana lake streams and the rib reservoir and evapotranspiration flux from the wetland significant drawdown mean 38 4 m and range 4 8 152 1 m which created overdraft to layer one in almost the whole study area and base flow and et fluxes reduction 28 5 100 97 8 respectively observed for the worst case scenario groundwater underflow value decreased under all scenarios with the highest for the worst case scenario results suggest that the water table decline will entail drying of shallow boreholes hand dug wells and springs and increase the cost of pumping from deep boreholes reduction in base flow will diminish the dry season streams flow and size of the tana lake and the wetland which will have an adverse effect on the groundwater dependent habitats on the other hand an increase in leakage from the lake and streams to layer one observed under all scenarios except for the increase in abstraction where increasing in streams leakage is zero and this will enhance the likelihood of groundwater pollution the optimal scenario although showed a decline in the groundwater level base flows and evapotranspiration flux when compared to the calibrated values results indicated a substantial rise in the groundwater level mean 9 8 m and range 0 7 44 2 m and an increase in base flows to surface waters 0 14 4 and evapotranspiration flux 29 5 when viewed against the worst case scenario the aforementioned clues suggest the need for implementation of groundwater management measures groundwater management options such as integrated water resources management managed aquifer recharge conjunctive use and harvesting rain water during the wet season in the uplands and other climate change adaptation strategies like the adaptation of water efficient technologies and practices and water demand and land management will be effective and should be devised and implemented to mitigate impacts of reduction in natural recharge and increase in withdrawal on the aquifer system groundwater management strategies should be evaluated based on detail transient numerical modeling author statement the authors here by submit the revised version of the manuscript we have made revisions as per the comments and suggestions

8242,study region rib catchment in the lake tana sub basin upper blue nile river ethiopia study focus this paper aimed to assess the impacts of future increase in abstraction and recharge reduction on the groundwater groundwater availability and groundwater surface waters interaction based on a three dimensional groundwater flow modeling calibration was made under the steady state condition scenario analysis performed for 1 increase in abstraction 2 decrease in recharge 3 the worst case scenario that combined the aforementioned two scenarios and with additional extraction for irrigation and 4 for the optimal case scenario which considers 5 recharge increase for the worst case scenario model new hydrological insights for the region it is found that the groundwater flows from uplands toward the tana lake the total inflow to and outflow from the system in the calibrated model are 1733480 m3 d and 1840451 m3 d respectively groundwater level drop reduction in base flows to surface waters and in evapotranspiration flux compared to the calibrated values encountered for all scenarios which are significant mean 38 4 m 28 5 100 and 97 8 respectively for the worst case scenario on the other hand an increase in groundwater level mean 9 8 m base flows 0 14 4 and evapotranspiration flux 29 5 observed for the optimal scenario when compared to the worst case scenario results results suggest that groundwater management measures should be implemented to mitigate the impacts keywords groundwater recharge groundwater flow groundwater surface waters interaction modeling rib catchment ethiopia 1 introduction africa is expected to experience water stress before 2025 which is mainly due to increased water demand accompanying an increase in populations climate change is expected to exacerbate this condition bates et al 2008 climate change in the past several decades caused precipitation variability a shift in pattern and frequent extreme events droughts and floods and a rise in near surface atmospheric temperature bates et al 2008 global climate models gcm for east africa showed an increase in the annual mean precipitation 3 to 25 median 7 and temperature 1 8 4 3 c median 3 2 c for the periods 2080 2099 when compared to the years 1980 1999 christensen et al 2007 conway and schipper 2011 made the climate temperature and rainfall projection for ethiopia the result showed average annual warming of 1 2 c range 0 7 2 3 c by 2020s and 2 2 c range 1 4 2 9 c by 2050s the regional differences in warming are relatively modest and warming is observed in all four seasons the climate models showed different projections of the annual rainfall with the multi model average rainfall increase for the 2020s and 2050s of 0 4 and 1 respectively in ethiopia rainfall variability a pattern shift and extreme events of drought and flood frequently occur in the different parts of the country these are used to associate with el niño and la niña events which are due to warming over and cooling below the average temperature respectively of the indian and atlantic oceans the shift in rainfall patterns and frequency of extreme events increased in recent years that can be attributed to climate change ethiopian meteorological agency unpublished the atmospheric temperature showed an average increase of 1 3 c in the country between 1967 and 2017 ethiopian meteorological agency unpublished which nearly agrees with the conway and schipper 2011 projection gcm projection for the tana sub basin where the rib catchment is found fig 1 and sec 2 2 for 2021 2050 and 2071 2100 showed that the precipitation will increase in the winter months while precipitation increase by a small amount in summer or show a significant decrease in some months like june this shows that there will be a seasonal shift in precipitation due to climatic change enyew et al 2014 this may shift the groundwater recharge season from summer to winter according to these models the minimum and maximum temperature increase is 1 7 and 8 9 c respectively potential evapotranspiration is projected to increase in all months of the year at the end of the 21st century climate change has possible direct impacts such as a decrease in groundwater recharge increase in evapotranspiration and water quality deterioration bates et al 2008 indirect impacts include an increase in water demand from groundwater use taylor et al 2013 recharge is not only influenced by the magnitude of precipitation but also by its intensity frequency and land use increased precipitation decreases the recharge in humid regions as precipitation intensity or heavy precipitation events exceed the infiltration capacity in semiarid and arid areas an increase in precipitation may increase the groundwater recharge bates et al 2008 however the concurrent increase in evapotranspiration can potentially reduce the recharge even with precipitation increase global circulation model projection in the ogallala aquifer region usa showed that the natural groundwater recharge decreased by more than 20 for an increase in temperature of 2 5 c rosenberg et al 1999 according to stoll et al 2011 attribution of observed changes in groundwater level storage or discharge to climatic changes is difficult because of additional influences of land use changes and groundwater abstraction both detections of changes in the groundwater systems and attribution of those changes to climatic changes are rare owing to a lack of appropriate observation wells and a small number of studies jiménez cisneros et al 2014 in the tana sub basin there is water use competition among hydropower tourism or navigation water supply irrigation and environmental needs such as sustaining wetlands and base flow to streams and the tana lake groundwater is the sole source of water supply for urban and rural communities and industries according to chebud and melesse 2009 groundwater is the source of potable water for an approximate total population of two million in the tana sub basin moreover in addition to surface waters rivers reservoirs and tana lake household irrigation using groundwater is being increased an increase in the number of people better livelihood higher per capita demand urbanization industrial and irrigation expansions in the area will escalate the water demand and conflict in water use in the future on the other hand groundwater level decline and drying of productive boreholes and springs were reported after a prolonged drought and pumping for a long time in the tana sub basin besides poor quality groundwaters were pumped in some deep boreholes amhara design and supervision works enterprise adswe 2009 application of gravity recovery and climate experiment grace in tana sub basin revealed an overall declining trend in groundwater storage groundwater storage depletion of 18 4 cm was observed for the period between 2003 and 2013 which is due to overexploitation abiy and melesse 2017 moreover according to the information from the local dwellers personal communication with the local people and the authors long time observations unpublished the size of the permanent wetland and dry season stream flows are decreasing from previous years besides navigation on tana lake was also seen paused during the dry season in some drought years the authors assume that the decline in the water table size of the wetland and flow in streams are because of the combined effect of an increase in abstraction and decrease in recharge due to climate change and deforestation tana sub basin consists of 11 catchments of which gilgel abay rib gumera and megech catchments account for 75 6 of the total drainage area mamo 2015 the study area rib catchment is the 2nd biggest catchments in the lake tana sub basin which consists of more urban centers a big irrigable plain area 198 5 km2 and groundwater fed wetland and the tana lake all concerns described above apply to the rib catchment even will be more severe here in the future as groundwater development will be intense in the area most of the people in the rib catchment live in the rural parts of the area and have a sedentary way of life that exercise mixed farming and raising livestock the land use has changed and the forest cover is diminishing due to deforestation by the dwellers for farmland and energy source and the people use open grazing for livestock personal communication with the local people which lead to recharge reduction according to adswe 2019 the land use land cover of the rib catchment consists of cultivated land 76 1 shrub bushland 9 4 forest woodland 6 5 grassland 6 4 wetland 1 3 built up area 0 4 and bare land 0 01 in general the study area is facing on the one hand escalating water demand and water use conflict and decreasing groundwater recharge trend sec 2 3 5 and on the other hand declining groundwater resource and base flows to surface waters previous studies in the area bceom 1998 mamo 2015 mamo et al 2016 nigate et al 2017 smec 2007 are mainly regional which are for the whole tana sub basin and are based on hydrogeological studies and integrated hydrological and hydrogeological system analysis these studies dealt with characterizing the aquifer and groundwater flow systems groundwater and surface water interaction and recharge evaluation getenet 2017 did hydrogeological investigation including recharge evaluation in the rib catchment however there is no modeling work done for the area to better understand the current groundwater and water use condition and groundwater fluxes and to predict the future impacts associated with an increase in abstraction and recharge reduction which can be used as an input for groundwater management undertakings groundwater flow models have been and continue to be used to investigate the important features of the groundwater systems and to predict their behavior under varied conditions and also form an integral part of decision support systems for management sinha 2005 a numerical model is a deterministic mathematical model which simulates groundwater flow indirectly using a governing differential equation together with boundary conditions the initial condition is also required for transient simulation anderson and woessner 1992 kresic 1997 the purpose of groundwater flow modeling can be a prediction system description or a generic modeling exercise anderson and woessner 1992 the type of model to be constructed whether steady or transient one two full three dimensional or quasi three dimensional depends on the availability of input data type of aquifer current understanding of the hydrogeological system and on site specific use of the model results groundwater flow models developed in different parts of ethiopia which have the purposes of system analysis and understanding the response of aquifer systems to the different increase in abstractions and decrease recharge scenarios amare 2007 asrie and sebhat 2016 ayenew et al 2008 azeref and bushira 2020 belay 2006 birhanu 2012 bushira 2007 kinfu 2010 oljira 2006 modeling works in ethiopia are often made in steady state conditions because of the scarcity of groundwater level monitoring data chebud and melesse 2009 did groundwater flow modeling in gumera catchment of the tana sub basin to estimate the base flow to tana lake khadim et al 2020 also did transient groundwater flow modeling in gilgel abay catchment of the tana sub basin to determine the groundwater availability in this study a three dimensional two layers steady state numerical modeling made which better represents the aquifer system being exploited the simulation was made using modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 that is a modular finite difference groundwater model there is no time series data to do transient modeling the objectives of the study are to 1 discern the current the base line condition of the groundwater groundwater surface waters interaction and groundwater fluxes 2 assess the impacts of the projected increase in groundwater abstraction and recharge reduction on the groundwater groundwater availability and groundwater surface waters interaction and 3 to identify the possible groundwater management options to mitigate the impacts the result of the study will serve as a foundation for future modeling efforts including transient modeling the study will give valuable clues and insight for decision and policy makers and researchers to devise evaluate and implement proper groundwater management strategies besides the methodology can be a useful approach to similar studies on other catchments and sub basin s 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and data acquisition meteorological and hydrological data were acquired from the western amhara meteorology office and ministry of water irrigation and energy respectively boreholes data such as pumping test logs depth and groundwater level were collected from amhara water irrigation and energy development bureau water well drilling enterprise tis isat water works plc and zonal and district water offices topographic data generated from shuttle radar topographic mission srtm data which is from 90 m by 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem landsat tm and google earth imageries were also used to delineate different boundaries in the study area figures were prepared by using microsoft excel and arcgis 10 softwares 2 2 site description the rib catchment was first delineated based on dem data using arcgis spatial analyst tools hydrology and checked with hill shed and landsat tm image to correct some error in delineation and further verified in the field it is found in the lake tana sub basin where the blue nile river originates from the tana lake northwest ethiopian plateau in the amhara regional state fig 1 the area is located within utm zone 37 wgs 1984 between 342831and 414511 m east and 1294048 and 1351659 m north the total area is 2099 km2 plateau top rugged elevated and steep mountainous volcanic terrain rugged low relief volcanic terrain and gentle to nearly flat plain in unconsolidated sediments constitute the physiography of the area the topographic slope decreases from all sides toward tana lake the rugged elevated and steep mountain has a slope of 15 1 49 7 the rugged and low relief terrain and the gentle to flat plain have slopes of 3 1 to 15 and less than 3 respectively the maximum and minimum elevations are 4108 and 1776 m which are at the southeast extremity of guna mountain and the lake margin in the west respectively fig 1 the study area is drained by the rib river and its tributaries which flow to tana lake the rib river is perennial while most of the tributaries are seasonal or with little dry season flow a perennial wetland with an area of 17 2 km2 10 october 2019 google earth image exists close to the lake the rib reservoir has a design storage capacity of 234 106 m3 and its area as per the 24 october 2019 google earth image is 11 1 km2 the reservoir is intended to irrigate 20 800 ha of land in the plain area but irrigation did not commence until this time according to the thornthwaite 1948 climate classification method the area has a moist sub humid c2 climate while the climate is moist based on the modified thornthwaite feddema 2005 method the rainfall pattern is unimodal with wet and dry seasons from june to september and october to may respectively the mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet of the area are 1278 and 1247 mm year respectively it is difficult to get the actual population data residing in the catchment because administrative boundaries are not the same as the hydrologic boundary population number in rib catchment deduced based on the population number of ethiopia in 2018 world bank group 2019 and the population dwelling by 2019 in the area projected to be about 213 007 using the growth rate of 2 6 ethiopian statistical agency unpublished 2 3 developing the conceptual model the conceptual model represents the aquifer and groundwater flow systems of the area to be modeled in the form of a diagram and cross section it includes defining boundaries of the model hydrostratigraphic units and the groundwater flow system and preparing a water budget anderson and woessner 1992 2 3 1 model boundaries physical natural and hydraulic artificial features can be used as internal and external boundaries of the model domain anderson and woessner 1992 kresic 1997 the topographic divide of the rib catchment which is coincident with the regional groundwater divide as there is no groundwater inflow and outflow across it and the tana lake in the west are external boundaries delimiting the model area perennial rivers rib reservoir and the wetland fig 1 are considered as internal boundaries which are represented by different boundary conditions on the numerical model 2 3 2 defining aquifer system geological mapping revealed that the upper basalt guna volcanics guna tuff guna basalt and guna phonolite and quaternary fluivio lacustrine sediments are exposed in the study area figs 2 and 3 the upper basalt is correlated to the oligocene trap series of alaji formation while the guna volcanics to miocene pliocene shield volcanos of tarmaber guassa formation guna basalt dated to have age of 10 4 ma kieffer et al 2004 the upper basalt contains interlayers of trachyte flows tuff and ignimbrite and has a thickness of about 804 m in the area it is underlain elsewhere in tana sub basin by the middle basalt mamo 2015 and overlain by guna tuff and guna basalt within the study area it is highly weathered with thin eluvium on the top part and moderate slopes and moderately fractured and with columnar joints fractures are open and interconnected boreholes drilled in this aquifer have 43 156 m depth with a mean of 91 8 m borehole yield is 0 6 10 l s with a mean of 3 5 l s and transmissivity ranges between 3 2 and 67 3 m2 d and the mean is 19 8 m2 d springs often have little discharge less than 2 l s guna tuff is loose to weakly compact with welded tuff interbeds the thickness of this unit is 209 m springs in this aquifer have low discharge less than 0 5 l s two boreholes drilled in this aquifer have depth and yield of 42 m and 3 1 l s and 180 m and 7 l s transmissivity is about 13 7 m2 d for the first borehole guna basalt is weathered and highly fractured with columnar joints at places there are no groundwater points in this aquifer it is situated on a steep slope which acts as a recharge area with low storage guna basalt has a thickness of about 393 m guna phonolite occupies the top summit of the guna volcano and has a steep slope that can transmit but with low storage this rock is fresh with columnar joints and has a thickness of 590 m the fluvio lacustrine sediments consist of unconsolidated sediments of clay at the top and sand beds at different depths a borehole drilled near woreta town in this aquifer with 88 m depth has sand sediments up to 84 m with less than 6 m clay at the top and middle and fractured and weathered basalt underneath the yield of this borehole is 40 l s the thickness of the deposits at the center of the plain is not known but expected to reach 100 m according to mamo 2015 the middle basalt and lower basalt underlie the upper basalt and are described as follows the middle basalt correlated to oligocene aiba basalt is weathered and moderately fractured with thin about 0 5 m clayey silt paleosol at the contact with the overlying upper basalt its thickness is about 300 m transmissivity in this rock varies between 1 1 to 157 m2 d with a mean of 26 5 m2 d borehole yield varies between 0 7 and 17 l s and the mean is 2 6 l s the lower basalt eocene ashangi formation was encountered at deep boreholes in the northern tana sub basin underlying the middle basalt and is expected to have a thickness of 200 1200 m in regional flow systems aquifer and confining units are defined based on the concept of hydrostratigraphy anderson and woessner 1992 weight 2008 several geologic or stratigraphic formations may be combined into a single hydrostratigraphic unit according to their similar hydrogeologic properties or a single stratigraphic formation may be divided into aquifer and confining units based on the integrated hydrogeological hydrogeochemical and isotope hydrology approaches mamo 2015 revealed that the different volcanic rocks and unconsolidated sediments in the tana sub basin form three aquifer systems which are the upper aquifer system uas middle aquifer system mas and lower aquifer system las the uas consists of an unconfined aquifer in the upper and semi confined aquifer s in the lower parts the two aquifers are interacting this aquifer system is being exploited and has a thickness of 300 400 m at different places borehole yield and transmissivity increase were seen with depth when the two aquifers intersected mamo 2015 the mas and las underlie the uas and are under confined conditions and have unfit quality for drinking and irrigation purposes mamo 2015 in this study the uas was considered for the modeling hydrogeologic units exposed at the surface figs 2 and 3 form the regional unconfined aquifer part of the uas at the current understanding the extent and thickness of the confining unit between the unconfined and semi confined aquifers are not well defined due to the limitation of boreholes data however groundwater struck at different depths and groundwater level drop and rise encountered in boreholes when the semi confined aquifer s was penetrated 2 3 3 groundwater flow systems most of the boreholes were drilled in the unconfined aquifer the unconfined aquifer has a shallow circulation and flushed system and often feeds and sustains dry season flows of streams and springs in volcanic terrain the rib river feeds groundwater in the downstream part of the plain this groundwater also feeds the tana lake and sustains the wetland groundwater flows from the uplands and converges toward tana lake see fig 8 and sec 3 1 3 there are only a few boreholes penetrating the semi confined aquifer s in these boreholes screens installed in both aquifers and the groundwater levels measured represent the composite heads groundwater in the semi confined aquifer s has regional flow beneath the unconfined aquifer in the tana sub basin and underflows to the south and west adjacent low lying sub basins mamo 2015 2 3 4 water budget the water budget is prepared from the field data to summarize the magnitude of the inflows and outflows and the change in storage and it is used to compare with the water budget computed by the model during calibration anderson and woessner 1992 the inflow is mainly diffuse recharge from the rainfall and minor induced recharge in the plain from rib river and seasonal ponds which form accompanying the inundation of the near shore areas during the wet season by the tana lake however the recharge from these ponds is low due to hard and plastic clay cover the recharge from ponds and the rib river is not accounted for the model mean recharge of 284 7 mm year was estimated for the tana sub basin based on chloride mass balance and soil water balance methods mamo 2015 which gives 1 64 106 m3 d for rib catchment getenet 2017 estimated mean recharge of 236 mm year 1 36 106 m3 d for rib catchment using soil water balance chloride mass balance and water level fluctuation methods the outflows include abstraction base flows to streams rib reservoir and tana lake evapotranspiration from the wetland and underflow beneath the lake bed sediments through the semi confined aquifer s of the uas evapotranspiration et was only considered from the wetland as this area has subdued topography and the groundwater level here is near to or at the surface compared to other parts of the study area et rate was taken equal to the mean pet of adis zemen station 1337 mm year which gives 6 3 104 m3 d the pet was estimated by penman monteith method using 2010 2019 meteorological data the hydrological station on the rib river is not functioning since 2007 and the base flow data was not used as a model calibration value the current total water demand for domestic use is about 17 041 m3 d which is estimated based on the population number in 2019 sec 2 2 and assuming 80 l d capita water demand african development bank group 2019 this value is nearly similar to the total abstraction rate used during model calibration 2 3 5 recharge trend analysis fig 4 shows the trends of precipitation and temperature five years moving average for debre tabore station the precipitation shows fluctuations with extremely high values between 1975 and 1978 and 2017 and 2019 in general the graph indicates a decreasing trend especially for the data between 1979 and 2016 the temperature has an increasing trend from 15 2 c in 1975 to 16 4 c in 2019 which is in agreement with the conway and schipper 2011 projection sec 1 potential evapotranspiration is expected to increase accompanying the temperature rise the base flow component of the rib river flow 1989 2007 was separated based on eckhardt 2005 recursive digital filter method using automated base flow separation for canadian datasets abscan software maximum base flow index of 0 25 for volcanic rocks and perennial streams eckhardt 2005 and recession constant of 0 998 which is estimated from the rib river recession period flow data were applied as a two parameter filter then a correlation was made between precipitation and the base flow data after screening by 95 confidence interval and recharge deduced from precipitation data based on the trend line equation plotting these recharge values against time years excluding the 1975 1978 and 2017 2019 extreme high values revealed a decreasing trend although the coefficient of determination is low due to cycles of ups and downs fig 5 a recharge reduction of about 13 3 was deduced for the coming 15 years based on the trend line equation this is in agreement with khadim et al 2020 simulated recharge and net stream leakage base flow minus stream leakage to the aquifer for gilgel abay river which show fluctuation with years but generally with a slightly decreasing trend from 1988 to 2016 although gcm projections showed slight increase and variability in precipitation for the 2020s in ethiopia and tana sub basin sec 1 the concurrent increase in pet and deforestation is expected to reduce the recharge during this period 2 4 model design and construction a three dimensional groundwater flow model constructed using the finite difference processing modflow 2005 the model domain was discretized into grids or cells with two model layers an equal number of 124 rows and 154 columns created in both layers the blocks have a uniform size of 500 m by 500 m taking into consideration of the data availability figs 6 and 7 the top unconfined and the underlying semi confined aquifers in the uas form the two model layers the thickness lateral extent and hydraulic conductivity of the semi confining unit between the two aquifers is not known at present sec 2 3 2 thus the first model layer was designated as an unconfined aquifer layer type one while the second layer was considered as a convertible layer from semi confined to unconfined with variable transmissivity layer type three based on geophysical data sogreah 2012 and borehole lithological logs the thickness of model layer one is taken to vary from 100 m in the fluvio lacustrine sediments to 150 m in the upland volcanic rocks a uniform thickness of 250 m considered for layer two geophysical data and borehole logs showed that the bottom of layer two is an impermeable boundary the top elevations for layer one were derived with model grid size from shuttle radar topographic mission srtm data i e from 90 m by 90 m resolution digital elevation model layer top for layer two was assigned by subtracting the layer one thickness from the top elevations layers one and two thicknesses subtracted from their top elevations to assign the bottom elevations the regional groundwater divide coincides with the topographic divide of the rib catchment no flow boundary conditions were assigned along this divide in the two layers the model boundary with the tana lake in the west was considered as a specified constant head boundary condition for layer one as it is a huge lake with negligible water level fluctuation model boundary groundwater outflow beneath the lake bed sediments in layer two was considered as a head dependent flux boundary condition and simulated by general head boundary ghb package perennial rivers figs 1 and 6 and the rib reservoir designated as head dependent flux boundary conditions and simulated with river and reservoir packages respectively data for rivers width river bed elevation water level and river bed sediments were collected during the field investigation limited horizontal hydraulic conductivity data are available for volcanic rocks in both layers therefore the preliminary mean values were assigned for each geologic unit in the two layers which are deduced from pumping test data and literature review figs a 1 and a 2 supplementary material horizontal hydraulic conductivity values subsequently modified during the calibration process the horizontal anisotropy took as one while the vertical hydraulic conductivity for layer one is one tenth of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity spatially variable recharge input was assigned based on topography precipitation and soil cover variation in the area which is in agreement with the mean recharge rate estimated by mamo 2015 and getenet 2017 recharge was simulated by the recharge package evapotranspiration from the wetland in layer one sec 2 3 4 was simulated by the evapotranspiration package and the extinction depth is 3 m groundwater abstraction in the catchment simulated with a well package location fig 6 and daily production from the boreholes were acquired from different zonal and district water offices and these boreholes were visited during the field work extraction rates used during model calibration from these boreholes showed in table a 1 supplementary material initial and prescribed hydraulic heads are values of hydraulic heads for each active and constant head cell in the model these heads must be higher than the bottom elevation of cells the initial heads are necessary to start iterative model calculations and for a steady state condition only hydraulic heads in the constant head cells must be realistic values kresic 1997 in this model the initial hydraulic heads were assigned by subtracting 10 m from the top elevations of layer one 1786 m assigned for the constant head cells which is the average water level of tana lake 2 5 model calibration calibration is a process of finding a set of boundary conditions stresses and hydrogeologic parameters which produce results that match the field measured hydraulic heads and fluxes within a pre established range of error anderson and woessner 1992 kresic 1997 calibration methods include forward and inverse techniques forward or trial and error calibration technique applied here the initial hydraulic conductivity recharge river conductance and ghb conductance values were assigned and adjusted in sequential model runs within a reasonable limit and the results were checked to the calibration targets adjustments to all or selected parameters and recharge at a time and model execution made sequentially until the simulated heads and flux match with the observed ones with a reasonable error or within the calibration targets values with more certainty modified slightly besides adjustment to model layers thicknesses was made during calibration during the process of calibration a new hydraulic conductivity zone was created in the basalt beneath the fluvio lacustrine sediments to achieve the best calibration fit this agrees with the geophysical magneto telluric and vertical electrical sounding data of sogreah 2012 which show a relatively more resistive layer 250 m volcanic rock than the overlying sediments and more permeable or lower resistivity than the adjacent basalt trial and error calibration may produce non unique solutions when using only heads as calibration criteria because correlated values e g increase in horizontal hydraulic conductivity and decrease in recharge will give similar heads therefore the steady state calibration was made using static water level data of 34 observation boreholes and flux of evapotranspiration from the wetland as calibration values the effectiveness of calibration was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively comparison between contour maps and analysis of the scatter plots of measured and simulated heads made the average of the differences in measured and simulated heads mean error me absolute mean error ame and root mean squared error rmse which are used to quantify the average error in the calibration determined using the following equations eqs 1 3 these different statistical parameters me ame rmse scaled root mean squared error etc were used to evaluate the model performance percent change of simulated evapotranspiration and recharge fluxes from estimated values and water budget discrepancy were also used as calibration targets 1 me 1 n ʃ ho hs 2 ame 1 n ʃ ho hs 3 rmse 1 n ʃ ho hs 2 0 5 where ho and hs are measured and simulated heads respectively and n refers to the number of observation boreholes 2 6 calibration sensitivity analysis trial and error calibration does not quantify the statistical uncertainty or reliability of the results and should be followed by detailed sensitivity analysis anderson and woessner 1992 the sensitivity of the calibrated model was analyzed by changing the calibrated horizontal hydraulic conductivity recharge and the ghb and river bed conductance values by 25 50 and 75 one parameter value adjusted at a time in the whole model domain while other parameters kept to the calibrated values the sensitivity of the model to that particular parameter or stress value was evaluated by the corresponding percent change in rmse and evapotranspiration flux from the calibrated ones 2 7 scenario analysis the calibrated model was used to predict the impacts of the projected changes in groundwater abstraction and recharge on the groundwater groundwater availability and groundwater and surface waters interaction under steady state conditions scenario analyses made for 1 increase in abstraction for domestic use 2 decrease in recharge 3 the worst case scenario and 4 for optimal case scenario the population in the area was projected for 15 years 2034 and the water demand was estimated based on the water demand per capita of 80 l s the result showed that the total domestic water demand will increase by at least 190 of the present 2019 abstraction rate and this value is used for increase abstraction scenario analysis this water demand may be less than the actual value as migration and expansion of industries and service sectors will escalate the demand and the water demand per capita will increase from the present value besides the population density in amhara regional state is relatively higher in the country and this was not accounted for in the population number estimation sec 2 2 livestock watering in the rural parts of the area is mainly from surface waters however in the plain near the tana lake some people use groundwater for their livestock watering personal communication with the local people and this water demand was not accounted for in the water demand projection the increase in abstraction distributed equally to all pumping wells which were used during model calibration climate and land use changes are expected to cause recharge reduction sec 1 recharge trend analysis revealed a 13 3 recharge decline in the area in the coming 15 years sec 2 3 5 hence the calibrated model was tested in scenario two by a 13 3 decrease in groundwater recharge from the calibrated value the worst case scenario is a combination of the increase in abstraction and the decrease in recharge scenarios in this scenario abstraction used during calibration increased by 190 120 new synthetic pumping wells each withdrawing 1912 5 m3 d added in the plain near the tana lake to irrigate 3000 ha of land as an augmentation to the rib reservoir and the recharge was decreased by 13 3 irrigation is practiced in two seasons from december to may onion potato carrot rice and cabbage used to grow in the area and an average crop water requirement of 350 mm ha per season considered to estimate pumping rate and the number of boreholes this scenario represents the most likely situations that the area will experience in the coming 15 years the optimal scenario is a hypothetical case analysis made to test the effectiveness of source management strategies under normal conditions the present recharge tends to decrease in the future due to climate and land use changes to mitigate impacts associated with these threats climate change adaptation measures have to be exercised in the catchment the recharge is assumed to increase if better land use practices and groundwater management works are to be undertaken e g managed aquifer recharge afforestation terracing and minimizing over grazing the worst case scenario model was used for this simulation with a 5 69 044 m3 d increase on the recharge system responses were evaluated as a percentage change of fluxes and heads difference groundwater level drawdown or rise from the calibrated and the worst case scenario results 2 8 prediction sensitivity analysis prediction sensitivity analysis was made for the worst case scenario to assess the uncertainty in the simulation results due to uncertainties in the magnitude of the stresses and uncertainties in the calibrated model recharge withdrawal horizontal hydraulic conductivity and ghb and river bed conductance values of the worst case scenario varied by 0 25 and 0 5 and the head rmse and evapotranspiration flux variation from the worst case ones assessed to rank which parameter or stress is the most influencing 3 results 3 1 calibration results 3 1 1 calibration goodness of fit comparison between contour maps of simulated and observed heads shows that the pattern and groundwater flow direction are similar the general groundwater flow configuration agrees in the two contour maps fig 8 the scatter plot of simulated versus observed heads indicates an excellent correlation with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 992 all observation boreholes lie within the 95 confidence interval fig 9 residual estimated minus simulated evapotranspiration flux is 19 4 of the estimated flux moreover the change in simulated recharge from estimated recharges by mamo 2015 and getenet 2017 is 2 7 and 17 1 respectively besides the simulated water budget shows a discrepancy of 5 99 between inflows and outflows which is within a reasonable limit the me ame and rmse for the calibrated model are 17 4 32 9 and 36 7 m respectively the average errors are not big considering the high total head loss 1007 m in the model domain the maximum acceptable value of the calibration criterion depends on the magnitude of the change in heads over the problem domain if the ratio of rmse to the total head loss in the system is small the error is only a small part of the overall model response anderson and woessner 1992 the scaled root mean squared error srmse which is the rmse divided by the range of measured heads less than 5 or 10 is considered a reasonable target barnett et al 2012 the following criteria were also used in addition to the above ones to evaluate the effectiveness of the calibration table 1 the spatial distribution of errors residuals depicted in fig 10 the errors are randomly distributed in the area the model was considered calibrated when there was no further improvement in the rmse and all other criteria met 3 1 2 calibrated parameters and recharge the calibrated general head boundary conductance is 17 175 m2 d the river conductance is 0 07 and 0 09 m2 d in volcanic rocks and fluvio lacustrine sediments respectively the calibrated horizontal hydraulic conductivity values for layer one and layer two and the recharge are shown in figures a 3 a 4 and a 5 supplementary material respectively 3 1 3 hydraulic heads and water budget base line conditions the calibrated model was used to assess the base line conditions the simulated groundwater head in layer one decreases from 2790 m in the southeast guna mountain to 1784 m in the plain near tana lake similarly the hydraulic head in layer two varies from 2774 m in the guna mountain to 1681 m in the plain area the groundwater flow direction is similar in layer one and layer two groundwater flows from the north due southwest and from south due northwest toward the rib river and from the southeast to the northwest and finally converges toward the tana lake the hydraulic gradient is relatively lower in the plain than in the upland volcanic areas see fig 8 simulated total inflow to and outflow from the system are 1 733 480 m3 d and 1 840 451 m3 d respectively table 2 the simulated total diffuse groundwater recharge from precipitation is 1 59 106 m3 d 276 5 mm year which is the major component 91 9 of the total inflow the recharge rates vary from the maximum value of 2 95 10 3 m d 1077 mm year in a rugged and fractured volcanic area to 3 0 10 6 m d 1 1 mm year in the plain fluvio lacustrine area which is covered by plastic and hard clay suggesting lower infiltration rate here see fig a 5 supplementary material the precipitation also tends to decrease from uplands toward the plain the simulated water budget revealed that there is inflow from the tana lake constant head cells to the adjacent groundwater which is mainly at the margin south of the rib river this induced recharge equals 8 1 of the total inflow to the system besides a very small quantity of leakage from the rib river to the groundwater occurs in the plain area close to the lake the groundwater discharge mechanisms are an abstraction evapotranspiration and base flows to streams rib reservoir and tana lake abstraction et flux and base flows to streams tana lake and rib reservoir account for 0 7 2 8 and 0 2 0 6 and 2 3 of the total outflow respectively groundwater in layer two underflows beneath the lake bed sediments and is the major component 93 4 of the total aquifer system outflow the current total abstraction is 0 8 of the recharge the groundwater fluxes are shown in table 2 vertically layer one receives 6 4 106 m3 d leakage from layer two while leakage from layer one to layer two is 1 6 106 m3 d 99 2 of the leakage from layer two to layer one takes place through volcanic uplands only 0 8 of the leakage occurs through the fluvio lacustrine sediments in upstream areas which is close to the volcanic uplands 54 and 46 of the total leakage from layer one to layer two occur through the fluvio lacustrine sediments and volcanic rocks respectively 3 2 results of calibration sensitivity analysis the model is more sensitive to recharge and hydraulic conductivity and less sensitive to ghb conductance and least sensitive to river bed conductance the effect of recharge and hydraulic conductivity on heads i e rmse is the highest under increasing and decreasing values from the calibrated ones respectively fig 11 recharge and hydraulic conductivity have similar effects but in a reverse way based on evapotranspiration flux fig 12 therefore effort should be made in the future to collect new hydraulic conductivity data with the help of drilling in the catchment 3 3 results of scenario and predictive sensitivity analyses results of the scenario analyses are shown in tables 3 and 4 tables a 2 and a 3 supplementary material show the sensitivity of the worst case scenario predictions to the different input stresses and parameters change 4 discussion the results of scenario analyses were evaluated to examine the severity of impacts of the projected increase in abstraction and decreased recharge on the groundwater groundwater availability and groundwater and surface waters interaction the increase in abstraction resulted in a mean drawdown of 1 5 m with a range of 0 1 9 9 m the decrease in base flows to surface waters and evapotranspiration flux from calibrated values for this scenario are 0 9 12 3 and 5 1 respectively the mean drawdown for recharge reduction is 30 2 m with a minimum and maximum value of 2 1 and 135 5 m respectively the decrease in base flows to surface waters and evapotranspiration flux are 24 9 100 and 80 6 respectively the drawdown ranges from 4 8 to 152 1 m with a mean of 38 4 m for the worst case scenario and the base flows and evapotranspiration flux reductions are 28 5 100 and 97 8 respectively leakages from the tana lake and streams increased by 3 6 and zero percent for an increase in abstraction 70 8 and 700 for recharge reduction and by 190 6 and 900 for the worst case scenarios respectively groundwater underflow decreased by 0 3 5 8 and 10 2 for increase abstraction recharge reduction and the worst case scenarios respectively see tables 3 and 4 compared to the calibrated values leakage from layer one to layer two decreases 0 5 18 while leakage from layer two to layer one increases 0 9 34 7 for all scenarios with the maximum values for the worst case scenario table a 4 supplementary material in general the decline in groundwater level base flow and et fluxes were observed for all scenarios groundwater flow reversal was not observed except cone of depressions for the recharge reduction and worst case scenarios in the southeastern mountain and near tana lake around the wetland the drawdown for the worst scenario is depicted in fig 13 drawdown decreases from the maximum in the southeast upland toward the tana lake where it is a minimum and is often greater than 10 m despite that the total extraction is 18 6 of the recharge the decrease in the groundwater level is significant for the worst case scenario limited 13 groundwater level monitoring data getenet 2017 showed that the mean seasonal groundwater level fluctuation due to natural recharge in the study area is 4 9 m the groundwater level decline drawdown for the worst case scenario is much greater than this seasonal water table change therefore significant static storage reserve depletion or overdraft to the unconfined aquifer layer one will occur in almost the whole study area this will entail adverse effects on the groundwater availability and base flows to surface waters and on the existence of the wetland base flow and et fluxes of the worst case scenario found significantly declined from that of the base line conditions which agrees with the above conclusion the water table decline will lead to drying of shallow boreholes hand dug wells and small springs and the pump setting depths may need to be deepened for deep boreholes which increase the cost of extraction the base flow reduction especially that of the worst case scenario will cause the dry season streams flows and size of the tana lake to diminish and the result showed that the wetland is nearly drying this will in turn adversely affect the groundwater dependent habitats furthermore this suggests a serious water use conflict in the future and more stress to the groundwater on the other hand the optimal case scenario showed a mean groundwater level decline of 28 5 m from the calibrated value the outflow fluxes as base flows to streams tana lake and the rib reservoir et flux and groundwater underflow decreased when compared to the calibrated values leakages from streams and the tana lake to the aquifer system increased from the calibrated values however groundwater level rose by a mean of 9 8 m range 0 7 44 2 m and the base flows to all surface waters increased 11 4 14 4 excepting the tana lake 0 while leakages decreased 8 9 40 and et flux increased by 29 5 when compared to those of the worst case scenario the groundwater underflow value showed an increase by 2 1 from that of the worst case scenario see tables 3 and 4 this suggests that the 5 increase in recharge in the optimal scenario from that of the worst case scenario was effective and resulted in a considerable recovery of the groundwater storage and base flows to surface waters and et flux even under extreme groundwater withdrawal conditions results of groundwater level and groundwater fluxes of the worst case and optimal scenarios indicate the need and effectiveness of the groundwater management climate adaptation measures in the area sensitivity analysis for the worst case scenario showed that the predicted values are more sensitive to horizontal hydraulic conductivity followed by recharge withdrawals ghb conductance and river bed conductance based on heads i e rmse see table a 2 based on et flux the recharge and horizontal hydraulic conductivity have a high influence on the prediction simulations followed by withdrawals ghb conductance and least for river bed conductance table a 3 5 limitations and recommendations the model is of the first kind for the area the following limitations should be considered when utilizing the model outputs limited hydraulic conductivity data are available at present more pumping test data should be collected for each layer by drilling test wells these boreholes data together with additional geophysical survey results will also help to refine the thicknesses and to better define the hydrostratigraphic layers and their extent evapotranspiration and recharge fluxes are reasonable estimates although may not be determined with 100 accuracy the recharge may be refined in the future by considering the ever changing land use and climate data the observation boreholes data are of different times which are static water level data during drilling however the mean seasonal groundwater level fluctuation due to natural recharge in the area is 4 9 m getenet 2017 see sec 4 moreover the groundwater level decline between 2003 and 2013 was 18 4 cm abiy and melesse 2017 sec 1 these water level changes are far less than the calibration rmse value which suggest that the error introduced into the result due to heads measured at different times is lower than the error introduced due to uncertainty in the other input parameters and recharge model verification was not made due to limited available observation boreholes data despite these limitations the model outputs are adequate and reliable to give valuable clues and insights on the base line conditions and impacts of the increase in abstraction and recharge reduction on the groundwater groundwater availability and groundwater surface waters interaction the study identified the need and the options for groundwater management which will enable decision and policy makers and researchers to devise evaluate and implement management strategies however the model may not be directly used for detailed groundwater management practices management strategies should be evaluated based on detailed transient modeling for this groundwater level monitoring rehabilitation of gauge station on the rib river and the above recommendations should be realized in the area 6 conclusions a three dimensional groundwater flow model was constructed and utilized to assess the base line conditions and the impacts of the projected 2034 increase in abstraction and recharge reduction on the groundwater groundwater availability and groundwater surface waters interaction the model has two layers representing the aquifer system being exploited in the area and calibrated for steady state condition the simulated heads showed that the groundwater flow converges from all sides of the uplands toward the west or the tana lake groundwater from layer one feeds streams rib reservoir and partly the tana lake and sustains the wetland the rib river feeds this aquifer in the western part of the plain near the lake and the tana lake also feeds the aquifer at its margin mainly south of the rib river junction groundwater from layer two underflows beneath the lake bed sediments the two aquifers are hydraulically linked and interact the total inflow to the system is 1 733 480 m3 d while the total outflow is 1 840 451 m3 d diffuse recharge and groundwater underflow from layer two are the major components of the inflow and outflow respectively the increase in abstraction recharge reduction and the worst case scenarios resulted in groundwater level drop reduction in base flows to the tana lake streams and the rib reservoir and evapotranspiration flux from the wetland significant drawdown mean 38 4 m and range 4 8 152 1 m which created overdraft to layer one in almost the whole study area and base flow and et fluxes reduction 28 5 100 97 8 respectively observed for the worst case scenario groundwater underflow value decreased under all scenarios with the highest for the worst case scenario results suggest that the water table decline will entail drying of shallow boreholes hand dug wells and springs and increase the cost of pumping from deep boreholes reduction in base flow will diminish the dry season streams flow and size of the tana lake and the wetland which will have an adverse effect on the groundwater dependent habitats on the other hand an increase in leakage from the lake and streams to layer one observed under all scenarios except for the increase in abstraction where increasing in streams leakage is zero and this will enhance the likelihood of groundwater pollution the optimal scenario although showed a decline in the groundwater level base flows and evapotranspiration flux when compared to the calibrated values results indicated a substantial rise in the groundwater level mean 9 8 m and range 0 7 44 2 m and an increase in base flows to surface waters 0 14 4 and evapotranspiration flux 29 5 when viewed against the worst case scenario the aforementioned clues suggest the need for implementation of groundwater management measures groundwater management options such as integrated water resources management managed aquifer recharge conjunctive use and harvesting rain water during the wet season in the uplands and other climate change adaptation strategies like the adaptation of water efficient technologies and practices and water demand and land management will be effective and should be devised and implemented to mitigate impacts of reduction in natural recharge and increase in withdrawal on the aquifer system groundwater management strategies should be

8243,this study assessed the impacts of climate change on terrestrial hydrological components and crop water use cwu over the chesapeake bay watershed using a combination of global climate models gcms

project cmip phase 5 are statistically downscaled and bias corrected using multivariate adaptive constructed analogs maca scheme for use as model forcing precipitation indices from the twenty maca based gcms are used to identify six best performing models a mesoscale approach is developed where cwu is estimated by accounting for the impacts of changing climate conditions and rising co2 levels daily grid based crop coefficients are derived from evapotranspiration data the findings indicate a significant annual increase in precipitation 10 and temperature 4 5 k for the rcp 8 5 scenario towards the end of the 21st century a significant reduction 13 and 17 respectively in cwu is estimated for corn and soybeans resulting from increased total precipitation and rising co2 levels suppressing evapotranspiration our results indicate that even in a warmer regime crop water use decreased due to rising co2 concentrations due to climate change keywords noah mp crop water use maca global climate models climate change 1 introduction increases in global co2 emissions have led to significant changes in climatic conditions solomon et al 2009 these changes often manifested in the precipitation and temperature have and will continue to affect regional water availability solomon et al 2007 wagena et al 2016 and crop production brown et al 2015 climate change has direct impacts on crop growth due to changes in temperature water availability or co2 concentrations and indirect impacts due to the more rapid changes in weed insect and pathogen pressures associated with these climatic changes varanasi et al 2016 each of these pressures can affect crop water use increasing temperatures intensify the water cycle making more water available in the atmosphere for storms but contributing to increased evapotranspiration and increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations can suppress crop water use deryng et al 2016 urban et al 2017 in the u s climate change is expected to cause a northward shift in storm tracks resulting in increases in the north and east us baldini et al 2016 however these changes vary by season and depend on regional weather patterns such as el niño and la niña climate projections for the chesapeake bay watershed suggest an increase in annual precipitation with more significant precipitation in the winter and spring and less in the summer and fall

and temperature interact to affect crop growth in complex ways brown et al 2015 hayhoe et al 2007 pyke et al 2008 for instance changes in crop growth may be least impacted under scenarios of moderate warming without significant shifts in the timing or magnitude of precipitation but result in reduced growth if dry periods coincide with times when crops are most sensitive to water shortages elliott et al 2014 in addition to changing weather patterns atmospheric co2 concentrations play a crucial role in crop water use increased atmospheric co2 levels can increase agricultural productivity by enhancing photosynthesis rates while suppressing leaf level transpiration ultimately reducing plant water use kimball and idso 1983 vanuytrecht 2012 however the interactions between changes in precipitation temperature atmospheric co2 concentrations and plant vadose zone processes make inferring the impact of climate change on plant water use difficult crop water use cwu is the metric often used to quantify the amount of water used to achieve optimal crop growth for estimating gross plant requirements döll and siebert 2002 in many regions cwu is estimated using crop models elliott et al 2014 konzmann et al 2013 which represent the dynamics between the atmosphere crop and soil ultimately simulating crop growth and development water uptake and transpiration holzworth et al 2018 while crop models are powerful tools to predict crop phenology and water use they are limited by their representation of the landscape where crops are grown and in how they model water and nutrient

benefits on future local and regional water availability koehler 2020 in effect limiting our understanding of future food and environmental security we propose a simple mesoscale approach that incorporates parameterization from high resolution topography and soil datasets to quantify the impacts of changing climatic conditions on future water availability and crop water use by accounting for increasing co2 levels this study uses a soil water balance approach evapotranspiration soil moisture and atmospheric co2 concentrations to estimate crop water use using a combination of gcms and land surface model noah mp over rainfed and irrigated croplands in the chesapeake bay watershed six best performing gcm s are included based on the precipitation indices and two future scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 are considered the crop coefficients for different crops are estimated using available global evapotranspiration datasets which can be easily applied to a region without prior knowledge of its characteristics and at required spatiotemporal resolution the objectives of this study are to understand the changes in water availability using climate projections and quantify the alteration in crop water use under the impact of climate change 2 study area the chesapeake bay watershed occupies 165 760 km2 with more than 18 million people residing in the watershed five major rivers form

with the multi parameterization scheme is an improved version of the baseline noah land surface model ek et al 2003 niu et al 2011 noah mp has an interactive vegetation canopy layer to compute canopy and ground surface temperatures with an embedded dynamic vegetation model the choice of multi parameterization includes several vegetation models with an option of dynamic vegetation radiation transfer runoff and groundwater schemes the soil moisture content and its transition from wet to dry periods are largely affected by the runoff mechanism the runoff schemes in noah mp include the infiltration excess free drainage runoff schaake et al 1996 a saturation excess based topmodel runoff with an equilibrium water table niu et al 2005 simtop and a simple topmodel with groundwater model niu et al 2007 simgm in simtop subsurface runoff is represented as an exponential function of water table depth by using a single coefficient to calculate the maximum subsurface runoff volume the saturated hydraulic conductivity decreases with the soil depth and reduces uncertainty in the total runoff preventing the direct alteration of hydraulic conductivity which dramatically affects other terrestrial hydrological components like evapotranspiration and soil moisture niu et al 2005 simtop the parameterization options used in this study are shown in table s2 streamflow routing is performed using a stand alone routing model lohmann et al 1996 based on a unit hydrograph method that uses daily surface runoff and baseflow to estimate the streamflow at gauge locations to do this flow direction and flow accumulation are determined to develop the routing network and then a convolution based model based on the unit hydrograph representing the travel time distribution is used to route the streamflow at the usgs gaging stations the digital elevation model dem is hydrologically conditioned and available at 3 sec spatial resolution from the usgs hydrosheds database lehner et al 2008 3 2 model input data datasets needed to parameterize the model include surface albedo from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis the green fraction from modis landuse landcover from united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda 2008 leaf area index from modis maximum snow albedo soil type from state soil geographic statsgo and soil temperature from wrf preprocessing system wps data page managed by ucar ucar ncar 2020 these datasets are used to configure the noah mp hrldas high resolution land data assimilation system model and are assumed to be constant in time the meteorological variables that are used to force noah mp include precipitation mean temperature specific humidity at 2 m wind speed components at 10 m downward longwave and shortwave radiation and surface pressure the model is set up at a 4 km spatial resolution with the input data forced at a daily time step 3 3 weather data 3 3 1 historical reference training dataset the metdata gridmet dataset abatzoglou 2013 gridded meteorological daily dataset is available over the entire domain of conterminous united states conus and is a high resolution gridded meteorological dataset available at 1 24 degree spatial resolution from 1979 to 2010 abatzoglou 2013 developed metdata by combining the temporally rich data from the north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 mitchell 2004 xia et al 2012 and spatially rich data from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 one of the limitations of metdata is that the source datasets nldas and prism do not account for evaporative cooling effects from agriculture which implies that metdata derived potential evapotranspiration eto estimates have systematic bias inherited from its source abatzoglou 2013 huntington et al 2016 calibration parameters for noah mp particular to chesapeake bay watershed are estimated by comparing the output from noah mp forced by metdata from 1980 to 2010 with several observed and remotely sensed products described in section 3 5 3 3 2 bias correction and statistical downscaling to force noah mp and incorporate the impacts of climate change we use climate models from the macav2 metdata version now known as maca m abatzoglou and brown 2012 which is statistically downscaled and bias corrected with metdata as a training dataset for the entire conus using the constructed analogs ca method glotter et al 2014 concluded that current dynamical downscaling methods do not provide improved predictions over statistically bias corrected gcm projections and macav2 metdata contains all the inputs to noah mp including precipitation minimum and maximum temperature solar radiation specific humidity and wind speed components the ca method is developed to match the patterns between the synoptic scale field of global climate models gcm and the set of observation patterns hidalgo et al 2008 in simple terms weather patterns today or in the future correspond to or exactly replicates the weather pattern following the time of the exact analog in the historical record van den dool 2003 van den dool 1994 maca multivariate adaptive constructed analogs uses the same approach except that it uses a multivariate analog search to improve coherence across downscaled fields the gcm data are bias corrected using the quantile mapping approach by spatially interpolating the data to the downscaled grid maurer et al 2010 the epoch adjustment is used to avoid no analogs situations under future climate scenarios by removing the differences between the mean of future time slices and historical time slices on a 21 day moving window and adding or multiplying to the respective downscaled fields analogs were constructed from gcm s by identifying the 30 best predictor patterns as a single field or linear combinations that are matched with a library of observed patterns from metdata falling within 45 days of the target date finally epoch adjustment and bias correction are again performed to ensure statistical moments between historical observations and gcm s historical predictions are preserved the maca dataset consists of 20 different gcm s from the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 that includes data from historical 1950 2005 and two future representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 increase in radiation by 4 5 w m2 by 2100 and 8 5 increase in radiation by 8 5 w m2 by 2100 from 2006 to 2100 for this study two rcps 4 5 and 8 5 are selected representing an intermediate baseline and high emission baseline scenario respectively where each gcm includes historical data 1976 2005 and two future periods 2021 2050 near future and 2061 2090 distant future for each rcp scenario 3 4 selection of gcm s to select representative gcms a series of indices are calculated that compare historical gcm predictions against the metdata precipitation indices including the annual maximum precipitation amp mean annual precipitation map frequency of precipitation p freq and heavy to non heavy precipitation ratio h nh are calculated for both the statistically downscaled gcms and the metdata mishra et al 2014 amp for each year is the highest magnitude event for each year during the reference period of 1981 2005 p freq is estimated as the number of precipitation events above the 99th percentile during the reference period whereas h nh is estimated by calculating the ratio of total precipitation due to heavy events 99th percentile and total precipitation due to non heavy events 1 mm during the reference period the top six performing models are selected for use in this study the six best performing models are identified by ranking each model within each index from least to most biased followed by the sum of ranks the six models selected include canesm2 ccsm4 cnrm cm5 csiro mk3 6 0 hadgem2 es365 and ipsl cm5a lr however it should be noted that adequate model hindcast performance does not ensure reliable future predictions but it is considered to be the only way to assign model confidence reichler and kim 2008 three out of the six gcm s ccsm4 csiro mk3 6 0 ipsl cm5a lr chosen are similar to the work of maloney et al 2014 and sheffield et al 2013 that ranked and analyzed the gcms based on the bias with the observed precipitation and air temperature and which was later adapted by wagena and easton 2018 to study the impacts of climate change on agricultural conservation practices in susquehanna river basin in chesapeake bay watershed there is no significant difference observed between the spatial plots of precipitation indices like amp and map as the statistical moments of gcm s are preserved during the downscaling and bias correction extreme statistics related to precipitation indices like p freq and h nh are usually not preserved by bias correction hagemann et al 2011 and they show a significant difference in the spatial patterns among the different gcm s when compared to metdata the spatial plot indicating the relative bias for different precipitation indices with respect to metdata for six best performing gcms is shown in fig s1 the evaluation of temperature is excluded from the selection of gcms as they have a narrow range of uncertainty among the models with all of them showing a consistent increasing trend in future climate scenarios 3 5 calibration and evaluation of noah mp noah mp is calibrated for the water balance components including streamflow evapotranspiration and soil moisture monthly streamflow is calibrated for each of the nine stations table s1 in cbw with the usgs streamflow measurements from 1995 to 2001 and evaluated from 2002 to 2008 to ensure good model performance two evaluation metrics are used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the coefficient of determination r2 the nse at each gaging station depends on the input forcing data static model data and model parametrization the theil sen slope estimator is used to estimate the trend and slope in the future periods relative to the baseline scenario this non parametric technique determines the median slope among the lines generated through pairs of two dimensional sample points and computes trends insensitive to the outliers sen 1968 theil 1950 the model was calibrated and run on the computational information systems laboratory supercomputing facilities at ucar ncar noah mp forced by metdata is calibrated and evaluated using observed and derived products a manual sub basin calibration is performed using a combination of literature values and expert judgment for the nine sub basins as described in table s3 some parameters are distributed throughout the study domain and their calibration is performed on the basis of multiplier values rather than replacing the actual parameter values the topographic mean in the simtop runoff routine affects the partitioning of total excess moisture into surface runoff and baseflow and varies for each sub basin noah mp by default has a single value for topographic index throughout the domain but by manually configuring an additional layer of the topographic index into setup file and code the topographic index mean for each sub basin is used the topographic index mean is further calibrated for each sub basin based on the water balance components streamflow is calibrated by adjusting the runoff decay factor fff baseflow coefficient rsbmx topographic index timean saturated hydraulic conductivity dksat and maximum soil moisture level smcmax et is calibrated by adjusting the vegetation parameters including stomatal resistance rs and soil parameters including pore size distribution index bexp for et model predictions are compared to the remotely sensed usgs ssebop dataset from 2002 to 2008 senay et al 2013 ssebop method is based on the simplified surface energy balance model that estimates et using predefined boundary conditions between hot and cold reference values for each grid scan soil climate analysis network schaefer et al 2007 station data led by the united states department of agriculture usda national resources conservation service nrcs are used for calibrating the soil moisture of the top 10 cm layer five stations throughout the cbw are used to evaluate model performance from 2002 to 2008 using the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean squared error rmse soil moisture is calibrated using a combination of calibration parameters of et and streamflow that includes the maximum soil moisture smcmax and pore size distribution index bexp 3 6 crop types and growing seasons in this study the usda 2018 cropland data layer cdl with a 30 m spatial resolution is used the classes from cdl are reassigned to the modis noah international biosphere geosphere programme igbp scheme 21 classes strahler et al 1999 by grouping them as agricultural or non agricultural classes the cb watershed has two dominant crop types corn and soybeans which are predominantly located on the delmarva peninsula east coast of maryland delaware and virginia and in york and lancaster county in pennsylvania as per the statistics from usda the cb watershed contains 1 25 million hectares of corn and 0 78 million hectares of soybeans the cdl is resampled to the model s spatial resolution using a maximum likelihood method of 30 m pixels in each 4 km grid cell at 4 km model resolution the maximum agricultural area derived is approximately 55 for both corn and soybeans of the actual usda acreage the decrease in the crop acreage is because the 4 km grid cells in noah mp landcover are aggregated based on the neighboring algorithm cwu is strongly dependent on overall cropping pattern and climate conditions and hence it is not greatly affected by the decrease in crop acreage this decrease in crop acreage can be resolved by increasing the model resolution subject to the availability of the meteorological data at a higher spatial resolution based on the usda nass 2010 the typical planting and harvesting dates are obtained for both corn and soybeans table s4 from the estimated daily crop coefficients as described in section 3 7 and the planting and harvesting dates the initial crop growth stage the crop development stage the mid growth stage and the harvest period are defined for both crops the dates were in a similar range for all the states for both corn and soybeans which allowed us to develop a single crop coefficient curve for each crop over the entire cb watershed a fixed growth duration is considered for both the crops instead of the varying growth duration calculated using gdd growing degree days the varying growth duration is driven by both climatic changes as well as technological advancement in agronomics which necessitates the use of crop models to generate various scenarios based on historical records of management practices past studies have reported either a decrease in the crop growing length he et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 or little to no change in crop growing duration due to change in cultivars liu et al 2012 2009 sacks and kucharik 2011 considering either of the univariate scenarios in case of varying growth duration to derive the change in growing duration length might mislead the estimates of cwu 3 7 current and future crop water use cwu crop water use cwu mm day is determined using a soil water balance approach eq 1 national engineering handbook 1993 effective rainfall pe eq 2 is the difference between gross water inputs via precipitation p and irrigation ing and loss of rootzone available moisture via runoff and interflow tr pe represents the amount of moisture stored in the crop root zone that can be used for crop evapotranspiration since our interest is in in times of water deficit i e soil below saturation we limit this analysis to crop root zone and therefore only consider the effect of total runoff and not deep percolation in estimating effective rainfall 1 c w u p e e t c 2 w h e r e p e p i n g t r 3 e t c e t o k c b c c d where pe is the effective rainfall mm day etc is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm day computed using eq 3 eto is the potential evapotranspiration mm day kc is the 10 day mean daily crop coefficient bc is the monthly bias correction factor p is the total precipitation mm day tr is the total runoff including surface runoff and baseflow mm day cd is the carbon dioxide co2 correction factor pe is estimated using the water fluxes from the noah mp land surface model that includes inputs precipitation and irrigation and losses surface runoff interflow and baseflow eto for future periods is calculated from the energy fluxes of noah mp using the penman monteith formulation with inputs as mean air temperature wind speed relative humidity and net radiation from gcms daily crop coefficients kc are by definition defined as the ratio of actual et to potential et used in eq 3 thus we determined kc as the ratio of usgs ssebop actual et to noaa global reference potential evapotranspiration eto the historic eto estimations from noaa are based on global data assimilation system gdas drivers from senay et al 2008 who used asce s standard penman monteith formulation to derive eto estimates using modern era retrospective analysis for research and application merra2 reanalysis product the ratio is estimated from 2000 to 2017 and is averaged over the years 2000 2017 to get a daily crop coefficient to reduce the uncertainty due to precipitation variability a 10 day moving mean is used the use of historically validated datasets ensures that the calculation of crop coefficient accounts for soil water stress and crop growth under natural conditions we estimate monthly bias correction factors bc and a co2 correction factor used in eq 3 to account for bias from gcms and impacts of co2 emissions on crop evapotranspiration cd respectively monthly bias correction factors are calculated by taking the ratio of metdata derived eto estimates from noah mp and noaa reference evapotranspiration from 2000 to 2017 multiplied by projections from gcm s eto estimates huntington et al 2016 to account for the effects of rising co2 concentrations stomatal conductance functions developed by kruijt et al 2008 for c3 and c4 crops are used to estimate co2 correction factors for each crop cd these factors account for the impacts of rising co2 concentrations on stomatal aperture transpiration and crop growth and are calculated using eq 4 huntington et al 2016 4 c d 1 s g s s t δ c o 2 5 s g s d g s g s d c o 2 6 s t d t t d g s g s where cd is the co2 correction factor δ c o 2 is the change in co2 concentration ppm relative to a historical baseline sgs is the relative sensitivity of crop stomatal conductance gs to co2 ppm 1 computed using eq 5 and st is the relative sensitivity of transpiration t in kg m2 s 1 to a change in crop stomatal conductance dimensionless computed using eq 6 with sensitivities derived from jacobs and bruin 1997 1992 kruijt et al 2008 as suggested by huntington et al 2016 the co2 correction factors cd for the respective c3 soybeans and c4 corn crops are calculated at daily time steps for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance evaluation fig 2 shows the monthly calibration left 1995 2001 and evaluation right 2002 2008 of streamflow for the noah mp model all stations except choptank had nse values and r2 greater than 0 6 for both calibration and evaluation periods signifying good model performance over the entire cb watershed the choptank is dominated by groundwater flow due to the presence of shallow unconfined aquifers and short groundwater recharging paths sun et al 2017 the streamflow was highly sensitive to the partitioning of input precipitation and soil parameters such as saturated hydraulic conductivity the simtop runoff scheme used in this study is governed by the topographic index of the respective sub basin runoff decay factors and the baseflow coefficient which differ substantially between the majority of the basin and the coastal plain choptank the difference between the model predicted et and actual et from the usgs indicated an underestimation of 10 15 in the coastal plain region and overprediction of 40 in the urban areas which can be attributed to a simple urban scheme used in the study that does not provide reliable estimates of et fig s2 et is obtained as a sum of three components in noah mp that constitutes evaporation of canopy intercepted water ecan transpiration etran and soil surface evaporation edir ecan and etran are dominated by the forest regions whereas croplands had higher edir fig 3 shows the comparison between the modeled soil moisture top 10 cm layer and the observed scan soil moisture for five locations the left panels show a temporal series of soil moisture from 2002 to 2008 the middle panels display the seasonal climatological cycle from 2002 to 2008 and the right panel shows the sites georeferenced in the study area as indicated in fig 3 all model predictions show r2 0 6 and rmse 0 1 but the model tends to have a much more damped response than observed the top 10 cm soil moisture layer was highly sensitive to the seasonality of precipitation and its partitioning indeed cai et al 2014a showed similar soil moisture predictions in the northeast region a damped response to drying and wetting conditions however cai et al 2014b yang et al 2011 zhuo et al 2019 all showed much better model predictions of soil moisture when conditions were less variable the uncertainty in model output was also introduced due to underlying assumptions of the noah mp land surface parameterization schemes for example the use of simtop as a runoff scheme tends to retain more water in the soil column yang et al 2011 4 2 changes in terrestrial hydrology fig 4 a b shows the average monthly change and inter model variation in the precipitation and 2 m air temperature k respectively across the six selected gcms fig 4 a depicts the monthly precipitation change and inter model variation precipitation increased by 9 and 10 in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in the 2061 2090 period as compared to the historical period 1976 2005 interestingly a consistent increase of 7 5 in precipitation was observed across all models for rcp 4 5 in the 2021 2050 period whereas there was greater uncertainty of 20 mm month among the rcp 8 5 model scenarios with an overall mean change of 6 in the 2021 2050 period a larger mean difference was observed during the winter and spring seasons while greater variation was observed during the summer and fall seasons for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 likewise a lower inter model variation of 5 mm month was observed during the historical period for the winter and spring seasons as compared to the higher inter model variation during the future period for the summer and fall seasons a consistent increase was observed in the appalachian plateau and valley region across all gcm s and scenarios except in the rcp 8 5 scenario during the 2021 2050 period which was due to a decrease in precipitation in pennsylvania and the lower portion of the chesapeake bay watershed fig s3 as shown in fig 4 b an overall increase of 2 8 k and 4 5 k is observed in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively for the 2061 2090 period similar to precipitation higher inter model variation 2 k was seen during the summer and fall for the rcp 8 5 scenario for the 2061 2090 period the change in temperature was uniform throughout the chesapeake bay watershed for all the scenarios fig s3 fig 4 c d represents the annual change relative to the historical mean from 1976 to 2005 along with the sen s slope theil sen s estimator for each scenario across the six gcm s fig 4 c illustrates the increasing trends for all precipitation scenarios except for rcp 4 5 that indicates the decreasing trend towards the end period with a sen s slope value of 0 99 fig 4 d shows a consistent increase in temperature for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 with a similar sen s slope of 0 06 for the 2021 2050 and 2061 2090 however a plateau in precipitation was observed in the rcp 4 5 scenario towards the end period with a non significant sen s slope hawkins 2015 used cmip3 and cmip5 climate projections and concluded an overall increase of 1 9 5 4 in annual air temperature and an increase between 5 2 and 15 2 in annual total precipitation in 2080 2099 similar to the results from this study with increasing precipitation and rising temperatures crop production and water availability are likely to be uncertain as it is dependent on multiple factors including soil properties crop type the interaction between land surface processes water management strategies and atmospheric co2 levels however in regions with increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation soil water unavailability is often the limiting factor in crop production bhatt and hossain 2019 4 3 current and future crop water use cwu as described in section 3 7 daily crop coefficients kc were calculated using the ratio of eto from noaa and actual et from usgs ssebop the estimated ratios were averaged over the crop growth periods table s4 to derive the crop coefficients fig 5 fig 5 i j illustrates the daily crop coefficient curve for corn and soybeans with a 10 day moving mean the corn fig 5 i and soybeans fig 5 j have similar kc patterns but with different planting and harvesting dates these kc values were similar to the values determined by allen 1998 who found average kc mid values of 1 15 for corn and 1 20 for soybeans the values for cd approach 0 85 and 0 80 by 2100 for c3 and c4 crops respectively further details on the temporal evolution of cd for different rcp projections and crop species are described in huntington et al 2016 the cwu was calculated for both corn and soybeans by using the crop evapotranspiration and effective rainfall eq 1 and an overall decline was observed in cwu for both corn and soybeans a decrease of 4 and 13 in cwu is observed for corn under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenario respectively which is consistent with the decrease in the sen s slope of 4 and 19 for the 2061 2090 period fig 6 a b a similar trend is observed for soybeans indicating an overall decrease in cwu of 6 and 17 in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios for the 2061 2090 period respectively fig 6 c the cwu ranged from 50 mm month during the initial crop growth phase to 100 mm month during the peak crop growth phase fig 7 illustrates the different water balance components and the changes in crop evapotranspiration with and without the co2 correction factor as shown in fig 7 the cwu for both crops decreases due to an increase in the effective rainfall in both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios resulting from the effect of increased co2 concentrations and increased total precipitation decreases in cd values increase crop water use efficiency resulting in reduced water consumption for both corn and soy crops in the chesapeake bay watershed cwu was more sensitive to the change in effective rainfall in the early growing period apr may due to an increase in precipitation whereas in the mid growing period jun aug lower evaporative demand caused a decrease in cwu fig 7 b e the combined impact of increased precipitation and co2 emissions is responsible for a decrease in crop evapotranspiration and thereby the crop water use figs 6 7 the impact of co2 levels in future scenarios is accounted for by the co2 correction factors correcting transpiration in future periods the stomatal conductance is suppressed by elevated co2 levels thereby decreasing the water loss and the evaporative flux this study estimated the change and uncertainty in cwu using a combination of gcms and a land surface model by accounting for complex land surface processes and factors including soil properties crop type climate variables atmospheric co2 levels and crop coefficients that determine the crop water use the decrease in cwu assuming a fixed growing duration length and no change in cultivars results in decreased crop evapotranspiration in agricultural areas in the chesapeake bay watershed in summary with an increase of 6 10 in precipitation fig 4 towards the end of the 21st century a decrease of 13 17 is estimated in cwu fig 6 primarily due to lower evaporative demand from increased photosynthetic efficiency this is in contrast to many other regions where climate change results in largely adverse effects on irrigated agriculture due to many concomitant changes precipitation temperature et co2 acting on the system in complex and nonlinear ways nkomozepi and chung 2012 yang et al 2019 although this study used bias corrected and downscaled gcm simulations to estimate change in cwu there exist uncertainties in intra annual climate variability abatzoglou and brown 2012 and further resolving the timing of climate change impacts over the course of a growing season is critical mueller et al 2015 cmip phase 6 is in development and offers higher spatial resolution and better representation of processes eyring et al 2016 but does not entirely resolve the intra annual variability issue cook et al 2020 our results suggest that even a slight shift in the magnitude and timing of precipitation for example a 15 decrease in winter spring precipitation results in early growing season water stress and can ultimately propagate through the entire growing season impacting cumulative cwu 5 conclusions noah mp in combination with gcm s was used to assess the change in the terrestrial hydrological components across chesapeake bay agricultural lands due to climate change and variability cwu is important to understand for future water resource use management crop production potential and developing mitigation strategies using available evapotranspiration products daily crop coefficients for corn and soybeans are generated the impacts of co2 levels on crop coefficients in future scenarios are accounted for by using the co2 correction factor considering the soybeans as c3 and corn as c4 crops the soil water balance is then used to calculate the cwu for the pixels dominated by corn and soybeans the results suggest a significant increase in precipitation and temperature over the entire chesapeake bay watershed for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in future periods higher effective rainfall during the growing season resulting from increased total precipitation and increased co2 concentrations leads to a decrease of 13 and 17 in cwu for corn and soybeans respectively in the rcp 8 5 scenario for 2061 2090 as compared to 4 and 6 in the rcp 4 5 scenario with the increasing availability of global datasets remotely sensed land based station and modeled such as irrigation maps portmann et al 2010 siebert et al 2015 high resolution bias

8243,this study assessed the impacts of climate change on terrestrial hydrological components and crop water use cwu over the chesapeake bay watershed using a combination of global climate models gcms and a land surface model to better understand the impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle long term simulations of multiple earth system models from the coupled model intercomparison project cmip phase 5 are statistically downscaled and bias corrected using multivariate adaptive constructed analogs maca scheme for use as model forcing precipitation indices from the twenty maca based gcms are used to identify six best performing models a mesoscale approach is developed where cwu is estimated by accounting for the impacts of changing climate conditions and rising co2 levels daily grid based crop coefficients are derived from evapotranspiration data the findings indicate a significant annual increase in precipitation 10 and temperature 4 5 k for the rcp 8 5 scenario towards the end of the 21st century a significant reduction 13 and 17 respectively in cwu is estimated for corn and soybeans resulting from increased total precipitation and rising co2 levels suppressing evapotranspiration our results indicate that even in a warmer regime crop water use decreased due to rising co2 concentrations due to climate change keywords noah mp crop water use maca global climate models climate change 1 introduction increases in global co2 emissions have led to significant changes in climatic conditions solomon et al 2009 these changes often manifested in the precipitation and temperature have and will continue to affect regional water availability solomon et al 2007 wagena et al 2016 and crop production brown et al 2015 climate change has direct impacts on crop growth due to changes in temperature water availability or co2 concentrations and indirect impacts due to the more rapid changes in weed insect and pathogen pressures associated with these climatic changes varanasi et al 2016 each of these pressures can affect crop water use increasing temperatures intensify the water cycle making more water available in the atmosphere for storms but contributing to increased evapotranspiration and increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations can suppress crop water use deryng et al 2016 urban et al 2017 in the u s climate change is expected to cause a northward shift in storm tracks resulting in increases in the north and east us baldini et al 2016 however these changes vary by season and depend on regional weather patterns such as el niño and la niña climate projections for the chesapeake bay watershed suggest an increase in annual precipitation with more significant precipitation in the winter and spring and less in the summer and fall najjar et al 2010 pyke et al 2008 rosenzweig et al 2004 wagena et al 2018 and projected warming of 2 6 c throughout the 21 st century hayhoe et al 2007 najjar et al 2010 these changes in precipitation and temperature interact to affect crop growth in complex ways brown et al 2015 hayhoe et al 2007 pyke et al 2008 for instance changes in crop growth may be least impacted under scenarios of moderate warming without significant shifts in the timing or magnitude of precipitation but result in reduced growth if dry periods coincide with times when crops are most sensitive to water shortages elliott et al 2014 in addition to changing weather patterns atmospheric co2 concentrations play a crucial role in crop water use increased atmospheric co2 levels can increase agricultural productivity by enhancing photosynthesis rates while suppressing leaf level transpiration ultimately reducing plant water use kimball and idso 1983 vanuytrecht 2012 however the interactions between changes in precipitation temperature atmospheric co2 concentrations and plant vadose zone processes make inferring the impact of climate change on plant water use difficult crop water use cwu is the metric often used to quantify the amount of water used to achieve optimal crop growth for estimating gross plant requirements döll and siebert 2002 in many regions cwu is estimated using crop models elliott et al 2014 konzmann et al 2013 which represent the dynamics between the atmosphere crop and soil ultimately simulating crop growth and development water uptake and transpiration holzworth et al 2018 while crop models are powerful tools to predict crop phenology and water use they are limited by their representation of the landscape where crops are grown and in how they model water and nutrient transport stöckle and kemanian 2020 land surface models lsms due to their coupled water and energy balance approach can be used to simultaneously project future water availability hurkmans et al 2008 and estimate the cwu through simple crop management formulations döll and siebert 2002 fischer et al 2007 yang et al 2019 though the current limitations of included field scale geospatial data

benefits on future local and regional water availability koehler 2020 in effect limiting our understanding of future food and environmental security we propose a simple mesoscale approach that incorporates parameterization from high resolution topography and soil datasets to quantify the impacts of changing climatic conditions on future water availability and crop water use by accounting for increasing co2 levels this study uses a soil water balance approach evapotranspiration soil moisture and atmospheric co2 concentrations to estimate crop water use using a combination of gcms and land surface model noah mp over rainfed and irrigated croplands in the chesapeake bay watershed six best performing gcm s are included based on the precipitation indices and two future scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 are considered the crop coefficients for different crops are estimated using available global evapotranspiration datasets which can be easily applied to a region without prior knowledge of its characteristics and at required spatiotemporal resolution the objectives of this study are to understand the changes in water availability using climate projections and quantify the alteration in crop water use under the impact of climate change 2 study area the chesapeake bay watershed occupies 165 760 km2 with more than 18 million people residing in the watershed five major rivers form

phase 5 3 2 developed by cbp 23 of the land is used for agriculture 6 4 is the developed land and 69 8 forest water use is a major issue that must be evaluated with the increasing extent and intensity of the agricultural activities in the watershed and the ongoing effects of climate change fig 1 shows the chesapeake bay watershed and the usgs gage locations used for this study the chesapeake bay watershed is divided into nine sub basins corresponding to usgs gages located on the major tributaries table s1 3 data and methods 3 1 noah mp model and configuration the noah mp land surface model with the multi parameterization scheme is an improved version of the baseline noah land surface model ek et al 2003 niu et al 2011 noah mp has an interactive vegetation canopy layer to compute canopy and ground surface temperatures with an embedded dynamic vegetation model the choice of multi parameterization includes several vegetation models with an option of dynamic vegetation radiation transfer runoff and groundwater schemes the soil moisture content and its transition from wet to dry periods are largely affected by the runoff mechanism the runoff schemes in noah mp include the infiltration excess free drainage runoff schaake et al 1996 a saturation excess based topmodel runoff with an equilibrium water table niu et al 2005 simtop and a simple topmodel with groundwater model niu et al 2007 simgm in simtop subsurface runoff is represented as an exponential function of water table depth by using a single coefficient to calculate the maximum subsurface runoff volume the saturated hydraulic conductivity decreases with the soil depth and reduces uncertainty in the total runoff preventing the direct alteration of hydraulic conductivity which dramatically affects other terrestrial hydrological components like evapotranspiration and soil moisture niu et al 2005 simtop the parameterization options used in this study are shown in table s2 streamflow routing is performed using a stand alone routing model lohmann et al 1996 based on a unit hydrograph method that uses daily surface runoff and baseflow to estimate the streamflow at gauge locations to do this flow direction and flow accumulation are determined to develop the routing network and then a convolution based model based on the unit hydrograph representing the travel time distribution is used to route the streamflow at the usgs gaging stations the digital elevation model dem is hydrologically conditioned and available at 3 sec spatial resolution from the usgs hydrosheds database lehner et al 2008 3 2 model input data datasets needed to parameterize the model include surface albedo from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis the green fraction from modis landuse landcover from united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda 2008 leaf area index from modis maximum snow albedo soil type from state soil geographic statsgo and soil temperature from wrf preprocessing system wps data page managed by ucar ucar ncar 2020 these datasets are used to configure the noah mp hrldas high resolution land data assimilation system model and are assumed to be constant in time the meteorological variables that are used to force noah mp include precipitation mean temperature specific humidity at 2 m wind speed components at 10 m downward longwave and shortwave radiation and surface pressure the model is set up at a 4 km spatial resolution with the input data forced at a daily time step 3 3 weather data 3 3 1 historical reference training dataset the metdata gridmet dataset abatzoglou 2013 gridded meteorological daily dataset is available over the entire domain of conterminous united states conus and is a high resolution gridded meteorological dataset available at 1 24 degree spatial resolution from 1979 to 2010 abatzoglou 2013 developed metdata by combining the temporally rich data from the north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 mitchell 2004 xia et al 2012 and spatially rich data from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 one of the limitations of metdata is that the source datasets nldas and prism do not account for evaporative cooling effects from agriculture which implies that metdata derived potential evapotranspiration eto estimates have systematic bias inherited from its source abatzoglou 2013 huntington et al 2016 calibration parameters for noah mp particular to chesapeake bay watershed are estimated by comparing the output from noah mp forced by metdata from 1980 to 2010 with several observed and remotely sensed products described in section 3 5 3 3 2 bias correction and statistical downscaling to force noah mp and incorporate the impacts of climate change we use climate models from the macav2 metdata version now known as maca m abatzoglou and brown 2012 which is statistically downscaled and bias corrected with metdata as a training dataset for the entire conus using the constructed analogs ca method glotter et al 2014 concluded that current dynamical downscaling methods do not provide improved predictions over statistically bias corrected gcm projections and macav2 metdata contains all the inputs to noah mp including precipitation minimum and maximum temperature solar radiation specific humidity and wind speed components the ca method is developed to match the patterns between the synoptic scale field of global climate models gcm and the set of observation patterns hidalgo et al 2008 in simple terms weather patterns today or in the future correspond to or exactly replicates the weather pattern following the time of the exact analog in the historical record van den dool 2003 van den dool 1994 maca multivariate adaptive constructed analogs uses the same approach except that it uses a multivariate analog search to improve coherence across downscaled fields the gcm data are bias corrected using the quantile mapping approach by spatially interpolating the data to the downscaled grid maurer et al 2010 the epoch adjustment is used to avoid no analogs situations under future climate scenarios by removing the differences between the mean of future time slices and historical time slices on a 21 day moving window and adding or multiplying to the respective downscaled fields analogs were constructed from gcm s by identifying the 30 best predictor patterns as a single field or linear combinations that are matched with a library of observed patterns from metdata falling within 45 days of the target date finally epoch adjustment and bias correction are again performed to ensure statistical moments between historical observations and gcm s historical predictions are preserved the maca dataset consists of 20 different gcm s from the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2012 that includes data from historical 1950 2005 and two future representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 increase in radiation by 4 5 w m2 by 2100 and 8 5 increase in radiation by 8 5 w m2 by 2100 from 2006 to 2100 for this study two rcps 4 5 and 8 5 are selected representing an intermediate baseline and high emission baseline scenario respectively where each gcm includes historical data 1976 2005 and two future periods 2021 2050 near future and 2061 2090 distant future for each rcp scenario 3 4 selection of gcm s to select representative gcms a series of indices are calculated that compare historical gcm predictions against the metdata precipitation indices including the annual maximum precipitation amp mean annual precipitation map frequency of precipitation p freq and heavy to non heavy precipitation ratio h nh are calculated for both the statistically downscaled gcms and the metdata mishra et al 2014 amp for each year is the highest magnitude event for each year during the reference period of 1981 2005 p freq is estimated as the number of precipitation events above the 99th percentile during the reference period whereas h nh is estimated by calculating the ratio of total precipitation due to heavy events 99th percentile and total precipitation due to non heavy events 1 mm during the reference period the top six performing models are selected for use in this study the six best performing models are identified by ranking each model within each index from least to most biased followed by the sum of ranks the six models selected include canesm2 ccsm4 cnrm cm5 csiro mk3 6 0 hadgem2 es365 and ipsl cm5a lr however it should be noted that adequate model hindcast performance does not ensure reliable future predictions but it is considered to be the only way to assign model confidence reichler and kim 2008 three out of the six gcm s ccsm4 csiro mk3 6 0 ipsl cm5a lr chosen are similar to the work of maloney et al 2014 and sheffield et al 2013 that ranked and analyzed the gcms based on the bias with the observed precipitation and air temperature and which was later adapted by wagena and easton 2018 to study the impacts of climate change on agricultural conservation practices in susquehanna river basin in chesapeake bay watershed there is no significant difference observed between the spatial plots of precipitation indices like amp and map as the statistical moments of gcm s are preserved during the downscaling and bias correction extreme statistics related to precipitation indices like p freq and h nh are usually not preserved by bias correction hagemann et al 2011 and they show a significant difference in the spatial patterns among the different gcm s when compared to metdata the spatial plot indicating the relative bias for different precipitation indices with respect to metdata for six best performing gcms is shown in fig s1 the evaluation of temperature is excluded from the selection of gcms as they have a narrow range of uncertainty among the models with all of them showing a consistent increasing trend in future climate scenarios 3 5 calibration and evaluation of noah mp noah mp is calibrated for the water balance components including streamflow evapotranspiration and soil moisture monthly streamflow is calibrated for each of the nine stations table s1 in cbw with the usgs streamflow measurements from 1995 to 2001 and evaluated from 2002 to 2008 to ensure good model performance two evaluation metrics are used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the coefficient of determination r2 the nse at each gaging station depends on the input forcing data static model data and model parametrization the theil sen slope estimator is used to estimate the trend and slope in the future periods relative to the baseline scenario this non parametric technique determines the median slope among the lines generated through pairs of two dimensional sample points and computes trends insensitive to the outliers sen 1968 theil 1950 the model was calibrated and run on the computational information systems laboratory supercomputing facilities at ucar ncar noah mp forced by metdata is calibrated and evaluated using observed and derived products a manual sub basin calibration is performed using a combination of literature values and expert judgment for the nine sub basins as described in table s3 some parameters are distributed throughout the study domain and their calibration is performed on the basis of multiplier values rather than replacing the actual parameter values the topographic mean in the simtop runoff routine affects the partitioning of total excess moisture into surface runoff and baseflow and varies for each sub basin noah mp by default has a single value for topographic index throughout the domain but by manually configuring an additional layer of the topographic index into setup file and code the topographic index mean for each sub basin is used the topographic index mean is further calibrated for each sub basin based on the water balance components streamflow is calibrated by adjusting the runoff decay factor fff baseflow coefficient rsbmx topographic index timean saturated hydraulic conductivity dksat and maximum soil moisture level smcmax et is calibrated by adjusting the vegetation parameters including stomatal resistance rs and soil parameters including pore size distribution index bexp for et model predictions are compared to the remotely sensed usgs ssebop dataset from 2002 to 2008 senay et al 2013 ssebop method is based on the simplified surface energy balance model that estimates et using predefined boundary conditions between hot and cold reference values for each grid scan soil climate analysis network schaefer et al 2007 station data led by the united states department of agriculture usda national resources conservation service nrcs are used for calibrating the soil moisture of the top 10 cm layer five stations throughout the cbw are used to evaluate model performance from 2002 to 2008 using the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean squared error rmse soil moisture is calibrated using a combination of calibration parameters of et and streamflow that includes the maximum soil moisture smcmax and pore size distribution index bexp 3 6 crop types and growing seasons in this study the usda 2018 cropland data layer cdl with a 30 m spatial resolution is used the classes from cdl are reassigned to the modis noah international biosphere geosphere programme igbp scheme 21 classes strahler et al 1999 by grouping them as agricultural or non agricultural classes the cb watershed has two dominant crop types corn and soybeans which are predominantly located on the delmarva peninsula east coast of maryland delaware and virginia and in york and lancaster county in pennsylvania as per the statistics from usda the cb watershed contains 1 25 million hectares of corn and 0 78 million hectares of soybeans the cdl is resampled to the model s spatial resolution using a maximum likelihood method of 30 m pixels in each 4 km grid cell at 4 km model resolution the maximum agricultural area derived is approximately 55 for both corn and soybeans of the actual usda acreage the decrease in the crop acreage is because the 4 km grid cells in noah mp landcover are aggregated based on the neighboring algorithm cwu is strongly dependent on overall cropping pattern and climate conditions and hence it is not greatly affected by the decrease in crop acreage this decrease in crop acreage can be resolved by increasing the model resolution subject to the availability of the meteorological data at a higher spatial resolution based on the usda nass 2010 the typical planting and harvesting dates are obtained for both corn and soybeans table s4 from the estimated daily crop coefficients as described in section 3 7 and the planting and harvesting dates the initial crop growth stage the crop development stage the mid growth stage and the harvest period are defined for both crops the dates were in a similar range for all the states for both corn and soybeans which allowed us to develop a single crop coefficient curve for each crop over the entire cb watershed a fixed growth duration is considered for both the crops instead of the varying growth duration calculated using gdd growing degree days the varying growth duration is driven by both climatic changes as well as technological advancement in agronomics which necessitates the use of crop models to generate various scenarios based on historical records of management practices past studies have reported either a decrease in the crop growing length he et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 or little to no change in crop growing duration due to change in cultivars liu et al 2012 2009 sacks and kucharik 2011 considering either of the univariate scenarios in case of varying growth duration to derive the change in growing duration length might mislead the estimates of cwu 3 7 current and future crop water use cwu crop water use cwu mm day is determined using a soil water balance approach eq 1 national engineering handbook 1993 effective rainfall pe eq 2 is the difference between gross water inputs via precipitation p and irrigation ing and loss of rootzone available moisture via runoff and interflow tr pe represents the amount of moisture stored in the crop root zone that can be used for crop evapotranspiration since our interest is in in times of water deficit i e soil below saturation we limit this analysis to crop root zone and therefore only consider the effect of total runoff and not deep percolation in estimating effective rainfall 1 c w u p e e t c 2 w h e r e p e p i n g t r 3 e t c e t o k c b c c d where pe is the effective rainfall mm day etc is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm day computed using eq 3 eto is the potential evapotranspiration mm day kc is the 10 day mean daily crop coefficient bc is the monthly bias correction factor p is the total precipitation mm day tr is the total runoff including surface runoff and baseflow mm day cd is the carbon dioxide co2 correction factor pe is estimated using the water fluxes from the noah mp land surface model that includes inputs precipitation and irrigation and losses surface runoff interflow and baseflow eto for future periods is calculated from the energy fluxes of noah mp using the penman monteith formulation with inputs as mean air temperature wind speed relative humidity and net radiation from gcms daily crop coefficients kc are by definition defined as the ratio of actual et to potential et used in eq 3 thus we determined kc as the ratio of usgs ssebop actual et to noaa global reference potential evapotranspiration eto the historic eto estimations from noaa are based on global data assimilation system gdas drivers from senay et al 2008 who used asce s standard penman monteith formulation to derive eto estimates using modern era retrospective analysis for research and application merra2 reanalysis product the ratio is estimated from 2000 to 2017 and is averaged over the years 2000 2017 to get a daily crop coefficient to reduce the uncertainty due to precipitation variability a 10 day moving mean is used the use of historically validated datasets ensures that the calculation of crop coefficient accounts for soil water stress and crop growth under natural conditions we estimate monthly bias correction factors bc and a co2 correction factor used in eq 3 to account for bias from gcms and impacts of co2 emissions on crop evapotranspiration cd respectively monthly bias correction factors are calculated by taking the ratio of metdata derived eto estimates from noah mp and noaa reference evapotranspiration from 2000 to 2017 multiplied by projections from gcm s eto estimates huntington et al 2016 to account for the effects of rising co2 concentrations stomatal conductance functions developed by kruijt et al 2008 for c3 and c4 crops are used to estimate co2 correction factors for each crop cd these factors account for the impacts of rising co2 concentrations on stomatal aperture transpiration and crop growth and are calculated using eq 4 huntington et al 2016 4 c d 1 s g s s t δ c o 2 5 s g s d g s g s d c o 2 6 s t d t t d g s g s where cd is the co2 correction factor δ c o 2 is the change in co2 concentration ppm relative to a historical baseline sgs is the relative sensitivity of crop stomatal conductance gs to co2 ppm 1 computed using eq 5 and st is the relative sensitivity of transpiration t in kg m2 s 1 to a change in crop stomatal conductance dimensionless computed using eq 6 with sensitivities derived from jacobs and bruin 1997 1992 kruijt et al 2008 as suggested by huntington et al 2016 the co2 correction factors cd for the respective c3 soybeans and c4 corn crops are calculated at daily time steps for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance evaluation fig 2 shows the monthly calibration left 1995 2001 and evaluation right 2002 2008 of streamflow for the noah mp model all stations except choptank had nse values and r2 greater than 0 6 for both calibration and evaluation periods signifying good model performance over the entire cb watershed the choptank is dominated by groundwater flow due to the presence of shallow unconfined aquifers and short groundwater recharging paths sun et al 2017 the streamflow was highly sensitive to the partitioning of input precipitation and soil parameters such as saturated hydraulic conductivity the simtop runoff scheme used in this study is governed by the topographic index of the respective sub basin runoff decay factors and the baseflow coefficient which differ substantially between the majority of the basin and the coastal plain choptank the difference between the model predicted et and actual et from the usgs indicated an underestimation of 10 15 in the coastal plain region and overprediction of 40 in the urban areas which can be attributed to a simple urban scheme used in the study that does not provide reliable estimates of et fig s2 et is obtained as a sum of three components in noah mp that constitutes evaporation of canopy intercepted water ecan transpiration etran and soil surface evaporation edir ecan and etran are dominated by the forest regions whereas croplands had higher edir fig 3 shows the comparison between the modeled soil moisture top 10 cm layer and the observed scan soil moisture for five locations the left panels show a temporal series of soil moisture from 2002 to 2008 the middle panels display the seasonal climatological cycle from 2002 to 2008 and the right panel shows the sites georeferenced in the study area as indicated in fig 3 all model predictions show r2 0 6 and rmse 0 1 but the model tends to have a much more damped response than observed the top 10 cm soil moisture layer was highly sensitive to the seasonality of precipitation and its partitioning indeed cai et al 2014a showed similar soil moisture predictions in the northeast region a damped response to drying and wetting conditions however cai et al 2014b yang et al 2011 zhuo et al 2019 all showed much better model predictions of soil moisture when conditions were less variable the uncertainty in model output was also introduced due to underlying assumptions of the noah mp land surface parameterization schemes for example the use of simtop as a runoff scheme tends to retain more water in the soil column yang et al 2011 4 2 changes in terrestrial hydrology fig 4 a b shows the average monthly change and inter model variation in the precipitation and 2 m air temperature k respectively across the six selected gcms fig 4 a depicts the monthly precipitation change and inter model variation precipitation increased by 9 and 10 in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in the 2061 2090 period as compared to the historical period 1976 2005 interestingly a consistent increase of 7 5 in precipitation was observed across all models for rcp 4 5 in the 2021 2050 period whereas there was greater uncertainty of 20 mm month among the rcp 8 5 model scenarios with an overall mean change of 6 in the 2021 2050 period a larger mean difference was observed during the winter and spring seasons while greater variation was observed during the summer and fall seasons for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 likewise a lower inter model variation of 5 mm month was observed during the historical period for the winter and spring seasons as compared to the higher inter model variation during the future period for the summer and fall seasons a consistent increase was observed in the appalachian plateau and valley region across all gcm s and scenarios except in the rcp 8 5 scenario during the 2021 2050 period which was due to a decrease in precipitation in pennsylvania and the lower portion of the chesapeake bay watershed fig s3 as shown in fig 4 b an overall increase of 2 8 k and 4 5 k is observed in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios respectively for the 2061 2090 period similar to precipitation higher inter model variation 2 k was seen during the summer and fall for the rcp 8 5 scenario for the 2061 2090 period the change in temperature was uniform throughout the chesapeake bay watershed for all the scenarios fig s3 fig 4 c d represents the annual change relative to the historical mean from 1976 to 2005 along with the sen s slope theil sen s estimator for each scenario across the six gcm s fig 4 c illustrates the increasing trends for all precipitation scenarios except for rcp 4 5 that indicates the decreasing trend towards the end period with a sen s slope value of 0 99 fig 4 d shows a consistent increase in temperature for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 with a similar sen s slope of 0 06 for the 2021 2050 and 2061 2090 however a plateau in precipitation was observed in the rcp 4 5 scenario towards the end period with a non significant sen s slope hawkins 2015 used cmip3 and cmip5 climate projections and concluded an overall increase of 1 9 5 4 in annual air temperature and an increase between 5 2 and 15 2 in annual total precipitation in 2080 2099 similar to the results from this study with increasing precipitation and rising temperatures crop production and water availability are likely to be uncertain as it is dependent on multiple factors including soil properties crop type the interaction between land surface processes water management strategies and atmospheric co2 levels however in regions with increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation soil water unavailability is often the limiting factor in crop production bhatt and hossain 2019 4 3 current and future crop water use cwu as described in section 3 7 daily crop coefficients kc were calculated using the ratio of eto from noaa and actual et from usgs ssebop the estimated ratios were averaged over the crop growth periods table s4 to derive the crop coefficients fig 5 fig 5 i j illustrates the daily crop coefficient curve for corn and soybeans with a 10 day moving mean the corn fig 5 i and soybeans fig 5 j have similar kc patterns but with different planting and harvesting dates these kc values were similar to the values determined by allen 1998 who found average kc mid values of 1 15 for corn and 1 20 for soybeans the values for cd approach 0 85 and 0 80 by 2100 for c3 and c4 crops respectively further details on the temporal evolution of cd for different rcp projections and crop species are described in huntington et al 2016 the cwu was calculated for both corn and soybeans by using the crop evapotranspiration and effective rainfall eq 1 and an overall decline was observed in cwu for both corn and soybeans a decrease of 4 and 13 in cwu is observed for corn under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenario respectively which is consistent with the decrease in the sen s slope of 4 and 19 for the 2061 2090 period fig 6 a b a similar trend is observed for soybeans indicating an overall decrease in cwu of 6 and 17 in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios for the 2061 2090 period respectively fig 6 c the cwu ranged from 50 mm month during the initial crop growth phase to 100 mm month during the peak crop growth phase fig 7 illustrates the different water balance components and the changes in crop evapotranspiration with and without the co2 correction factor as shown in fig 7 the cwu for both crops decreases due to an increase in the effective rainfall in both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios resulting from the effect of increased co2 concentrations and increased total precipitation decreases in cd values increase crop water use efficiency resulting in reduced water consumption for both corn and soy crops in the chesapeake bay watershed cwu was more sensitive to the change in effective rainfall in the early growing period apr may due to an increase in precipitation whereas in the mid growing period jun aug lower evaporative demand caused a decrease in cwu fig 7 b e the combined impact of increased precipitation and co2 emissions is responsible for a decrease in crop evapotranspiration and thereby the crop water use figs 6 7 the impact of co2 levels in future scenarios is accounted for by the co2 correction factors correcting transpiration in future periods the stomatal conductance is suppressed by elevated co2 levels thereby decreasing the water loss and the evaporative flux this study estimated the change and uncertainty in cwu using a combination of gcms and a land surface model by accounting for complex land surface processes and factors including soil properties crop type climate variables atmospheric co2 levels and crop coefficients that determine the crop water use the decrease in cwu assuming a fixed growing duration length and no change in cultivars results in decreased crop evapotranspiration in agricultural areas in the chesapeake bay watershed in summary with an increase of 6 10 in precipitation fig 4 towards the end of the 21st century a decrease of 13 17 is estimated in cwu fig 6 primarily due to lower evaporative demand from increased photosynthetic efficiency this is in contrast to many other regions where climate change results in largely adverse effects on irrigated agriculture due to many concomitant changes precipitation temperature et co2 acting on the system in complex and nonlinear ways nkomozepi and chung 2012 yang et al 2019 although this study used bias corrected and downscaled gcm simulations to estimate change in cwu there exist uncertainties in intra annual climate variability abatzoglou and brown 2012 and further resolving the timing of climate change impacts over the course of a growing season is critical mueller et al 2015 cmip phase 6 is in development and offers higher spatial resolution and better representation of processes eyring et al 2016 but does not entirely resolve the intra annual variability issue cook et al 2020 our results suggest that even a slight shift in the magnitude and timing of precipitation for example a 15 decrease in winter spring precipitation results in early growing season water stress and can ultimately propagate through the entire growing season impacting cumulative cwu 5 conclusions noah mp in combination with gcm s was used to assess the change in the terrestrial hydrological components across chesapeake bay agricultural lands due to climate change and variability cwu is important to understand for future water resource use management crop production potential and developing mitigation strategies using available evapotranspiration products daily crop coefficients for corn and soybeans are generated the impacts of co2 levels on crop coefficients in future scenarios are accounted for by using the co2 correction factor considering the soybeans as c3 and corn as c4 crops the soil water balance is then used to calculate the cwu for the pixels dominated by corn and soybeans the results suggest a significant increase in precipitation and temperature over the entire chesapeake bay watershed for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in future periods higher effective rainfall during the growing season resulting from increased total precipitation and increased co2 concentrations leads to a decrease of 13 and 17 in cwu for corn and soybeans respectively in the rcp 8 5 scenario for 2061 2090 as compared to 4 and 6 in the rcp 4 5 scenario with the increasing availability of global datasets remotely sensed land based station and modeled such as irrigation maps portmann et al 2010 siebert et al 2015 high resolution bias

hydrological paradoxes shp budyko framework was employed to evaluate the impact of climate change environmental change and climate environment interaction on surface runoff change in seven nested watersheds 38 21 178 km2 over the period 1965 2018 new hydrological insights for the region based on time series stationarity statistical tests the study period was divided into one baseline period 1965 1977 and three impacted periods 1978 1994 1995 2006 and 2007 2018 compared to the baseline period the period 1978 1994 was characterized by a decrease in precipitation and an increase in runoff first shp during the period 1995 2018 the runoff coefficient which increased despite the observed re greening was interpreted as evidence of the second shp the impact study showed that environmental change was the main driver of the first shp contribution reached 175 then climate environment interaction became increasingly dominant during the second shp contribution reaching 68 the watersheds evolution in budyko framework showed that the fu budyko type model parameter appears to be a good indicator of soil water holding capacity spatio temporal variability our results highlight the consequences of climate and environmental changes on surface runoff in the sahelian context and might help in developing informed land management and restoration strategies to control runoff

on water resources can be summarized into upward and downward approaches the so called upward approach starts with a thorough understanding of physical processes to further set up a detailed hydrological model based on conservation equations blöschl et al 2013 this approach requires a long time series of climate and environmental data in addition the detailed models are multi parametric which might lead to an increase in uncertainties in the results hence an overall increased difficulty in analyzing the outputs in a given study context blöschl et al 2007 the so called downward approach seeks to explain the behavior of the hydrological system as a whole it consists of analyzing the evolution of hydrological response to come up with hypotheses which explain the mechanisms and conditions underlying the observed trends harman and troch 2014 the downward approach includes statistical empirical methods linear regression machine learning conceptual frameworks budyko tomer schilling and analytical methods arora 2002 budyko 1974 guo et al 2019 peng et al 2013 tomer and schilling 2009 zuo et al 2014 zhu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 in this set the budyko framework budyko 1974 is widely used for impact studies in hydrology through parametric models such models do not require environmental data however the signatures of environmental dynamics are captured through the evolution of actual evapotranspiration ae defined as a function of potential evapotranspiration pe and precipitation p budyko 1974 sposito 2017 climate elasticity and decomposition of the budyko curve are the two techniques used to quantify the impacts the climate elasticity based method quantifies the impact of cc on water resources and the remainder is attributed to non climatic factors arora 2002 the budyko curve decomposition is a conceptual method that partitions runoff change into impacts of cc and human interference wang and hejazi 2011 which assumes that runoff change is solely due to cc and human interference however the interaction between climate and environment is recognized at all spatio temporal scales dearing 2006 diello 2007 gao et al 2014 therefore it is essential to isolate the impact of cc ec and climate environment interaction on water resources in the budyko type model the impact of human interferences is quantified through a parameter largely controlled by environmental variables li et al 2013 several studies have shown that the value of the budyko parameter is a function of the proportion of the watershed covered by vegetation ning et al 2019 teuling et al 2019 zhang et al 2004 2001 1999 but the relationships established were not stable and varied across studies donohue et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 li et al 2013 liu et al 2019 ning et al 2019 wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2004 2019a among the several studies applying the budyko framework to assess the contributions of cc and ec to surface runoff change only li et al 2013 took into account the niger river watershed in west african sahel was most of the impact studies carried in the was have been limited to assessing the effects of cc grijsen et al 2013 karambiri et al 2011 a few studies gave an interest in the effects of ec but were limited to qualitative assessments nka et al 2015 or based on upward approaches through hydrological modeling gal et al 2017 yonaba et al 2021 however the scarcity and the low quality of data that characterize africa hasan et al 2018 mahé 2006 severely hamper the application of such upward approaches blöschl et al 2007 the was is known for the fragility of its hydrological system for which a wide range of questions remains unanswered since 1950 the climate in this zone has been characterized by i a continuous increase in potential evapotranspiration pe due to global warming ii a wet period 1950 1970 followed by a drought period 1970 1990 and recovery of precipitation since the 1990s de longueville et al 2016 lebel and ali 2009 mahé 2006 since the 1980s drought the hydrological behavior of some hydro systems has become paradoxical descroix et al 2018 mahé and paturel 2009 wendling et al 2019 the first sahelian hydrological paradox shp characterized by an exacerbated increase in runoff occurred during the drought the second shp characterized by an increase in the runoff coefficient despite the general re greening of the was has been observed since the precipitation recovery descroix et al 2018 these shps fostered flooding overflowing in hydraulic infrastructures erosion and land degradation the nakanbé river is an important tributary of the volta river in west africa it takes its source from the sahelian zone in burkina faso and it is one of the main freshwater resources of the country ibrahim 2012 a significant part of its drainage area nakanbé at wayen is located in the was and has also been experiencing changes in the hydrologic regimes diello 2007 mahé et al 2005 paturel et al 2017 the overflow of the large bagré dam downstream of wayen station in 1994 two years after its impoundment is such an example mahé et al 2005 paturel et al 2003 therefore the nakanbé watershed is an interesting case study to shed light on the evolution of the was watersheds hydrological behavior by assessing the isolated and combined impacts of cc and ec on surface runoff change the objectives of this study were i to quantify the contributions of cc ec and climate environment interaction to surface runoff change across seven nested watersheds ii to investigate the relationship between budyko model parameter and the vegetation coverage 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area fig 1 lies in the sahel characterized by a short wet season june october higher variability in precipitation high evapotranspiration rates and significant thermal amplitudes the average annual precipitation varies between 200 mm and 1200 mm and potential evapotranspiration ranges between 1500 and 3000 mm per year the nakanbé river is an important tributary of the trans boundary volta river shared by benin burkina faso ivory coast ghana mali and togo the nakanbé river watershed in burkina faso covers about 15 of the country with high population density and shelters more than 50 of its water reservoirs ibrahim 2012 the watershed relief is generally flat with altitudes varying between 259 and 526 m the crystalline basement which occupies the underground watershed is not favorable to a significant mobilization of groundwater resources upstream wayen gauging station several natural and artificial reservoirs can be found in the nakanbé watershed the most important of which are the bam lake 41 million m3 the dourou dam 100 million m3 and ziga dam 200 million m3 impounded in 1995 and 2000 respectively fig 1 the ziga dam is mainly used for water supply to ouagadougou the capital city of burkina faso and the dourou dam is mainly used for agricultural purposes in the nakanbé watershed lulc changes were significant over the period 1972 1992 but have become stable since 1992 diello 2007 2 2 hydro climatic data hydro climatic data used in this study included precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pe actual evapotranspiration ae and surface runoff r fig 2 shows the flowchart used for data processing in general the quality control of the observed data collected consisted of an exploratory analysis to detect outliers and gaps some additional checks specific to each type of data were also carried out at the end of data quality control the valid observations were used to identify the appropriate databases to fill in the gaps after bias correction if necessary hydrological data concerned the daily discharges over the period 1965 2018 at seven gauging stations in the nakanbé river watershed presented in fig 1 six of which were provided by the hydrological services direction générale des ressources en eau dgre in burkina faso the daily data from the tougou watershed gauging station was provided by 2ie institute for the period 2004 2018 as shown in fig 3 these data have several gaps in this study it has been assumed that a valid year is a year without missing data during the wet season june october furthermore when the river cross section at the gauging station underwent significant changes without updating its rating curve all data measured after the modification were declared missing thus three gauging stations wayen ramsa and rambo had valid data for more than 20 years fig 3 annual runoffs at wayen station after the construction of ziga and dourou dams from 1995 were reconstructed based on monitoring data obtained from dgre and water withdrawals monitoring from the water and sanitation services office national de l eau et de l assainissement onea in burkina faso the daily time series of p and pe came from the sierem database boyer et al 2006 and the national meteorological services agence nationale de la météorologie anam in burkina faso table 1 these included data from seventeen stations among which two are synoptic stations as shown in fig 1 the meteorological data collected covers the period 1965 2015 but most of them ended in 2000 fig 3 to fill the gaps the databases arc 2 chirpsv2 0 mswepv2 2 terraclimate and cru ts v 4 03 see table 1 for details were identified the two synoptic stations ouagaaero and ouahigouya with complete data from 1965 to 2015 were used to select the most suitable databases for the nakanbé watershed for the precipitation time series three databases arc v2 chirps v2 0 and mswep v2 2 were compared to observations at synoptic stations over the period 2000 2015 as it contained 90 of the gaps the kling gupta efficiency kge performance criterion gupta et al 2009 and the percent bias pbias moriasi et al 2007 were applied to assess database performance the arc v2 database was finally selected as it presented the best performance overall kge 0 8 and pbias 2 6 similarly dembélé et al 2020 and dembélé and zwart 2016 showed that arcv2 is among the most suitable database in picturing precipitation over the volta basin and also over burkina faso the quality of arc 2 data after correction by empirical quantile mapping eqm was not significantly improved finally arc 2 was directly used to fill the gaps in the rainfall data for the rain gauges the thiessen polygon method was used to spatialize the rainfall over the watershed the thiessen polygon method was selected because it is suitable for our study area olawoyin and acheampong 2017 given the insufficient number of rain gauges and their heterogeneous distribution over the watershed the comparative analysis of spatial pe databases cru ts v 4 03 and terraclimate with pe data from the two synoptic stations provided by anam through the mann whitney test at the 5 level showed that there is no significant difference between annual pe provided by anam and those from terraclimate p value 0 0890 annual pe of cru ts v 4 03 are significantly different from those provided by anam p value 0 0001 terraclimate database also provides ae data at the same resolution and for the same period as pe therefore the terraclimate database was considered as the source for pe and ae in this study 2 3 altitude vegetation and demographic data the digital elevation model dem alos world 3d aw3d from the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa was used in this study from this dem data the boundaries of the nested watersheds were extracted the demographic data from 1985 1996 and 2006 national censuses of the population were provided by insd table 1 the population density was evaluated for administrative and territorial units found within the nakanbé watershed the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data used in this study is from pinzon and tucker 2014 and is based on noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration and eumetsat european organization for the exploitation of meteorological satellites records provided at 8 km 8 km resolution over the period 1981 2015 3 methodology fig 4 outlines the methodological framework used in this study firstly pettitt test and segmentation procedure were applied to split the study period into pre change baseline period and change impact periods sensitivity analysis based on the partial derivative allowed selecting the most suitable budyko type model for west african sahel was secondly the suitable budyko type model chosen was used to quantify the impacts of cc ec on the water resource of the seven nested watersheds through elasticity and decomposition methods a specific elasticity method developed allowed quantifying the individual impacts of cc and ec and the impact of their interaction finally correlation and regression research techniques were applied to explore the spatial variability of the impacts and the relationship between the parameter of budyko and the vegetation coverage m 3 1 breakpoint detection methods the pettitt test pettitt 1979 and the segmentation procedure hubert et al 1989 for the detection of one or more breakpoints respectively were applied to annual hydro climatic and environmental time series data herein the results obtained from the segmentation procedure were considered only in the occurrence of numerous breaks and the results of the pettitt test were considered for single breaks we limited the use of the segmentation procedure due to the ambiguity around the significance level of its results hubert et al 1989 there is not a precise p value assigned to each result 3 2 quantification of impacts of climate and environmental changes on water resources based on budyko framework assuming negligible in the long term changes in subsurface water storage and net heat transfer between the land surface and the vadose zone root zone water and energy balances at the watershed scale become eq 1 sposito 2017 1 a e p r a e p e h l a e f p p e where p l t precipitation ae l t actual evapotranspiration r l t runoff pe l t potential evapotranspiration h m t3 sensible heat flux and l m l 1 t 2 latent heat of vaporization dividing the terms in eq 1 by the precipitation p gives eq 2 which expresses the conceptual framework of budyko budyko 1974 2 a e p f p e p a e p f φ where φ ratio between pe and p is the aridity index the aridity index indicates the climate type and is the most widely used similarity measure blöschl et al 2013 wetlands are characterized by low aridity index φ 0 76 while an aridity index greater than 1 35 indicates an arid zone mcvicar et al 2012 this framework is the basis of several models for estimating actual evapotranspiration dey and mishra 2017 budyko parametric models table 2 have been widely used to quantify the impacts of cc and human interferences on the hydrological response of watersheds dey and mishra 2017 li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 teuling et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a the budyko type parametric models table 2 show that in a given watershed the evaporative index a e p is a function of the aridity index φ and the parameter e therefore eq 2 can be rewritten as in eq 3 3 a e p f φ e where φ is the aridity index and e is the budyko type model parameter the methods for assessing impacts used in the budyko approach are climate elasticity and budyko curve decomposition 3 2 1 budyko curve decomposition for quantifying impacts of climate change and human interferences on water resources in the budyko framework based on global data it has been shown that under natural conditions without human interference the evolution of the state of a watershed follows the budyko curve budyko 1974 climate change cc leads to changes in aridity and evaporative indexes a to b in fig 5 of the watersheds wang and hejazi 2011 which translates as horizontal and vertical shifts while human interferences cause only vertical shifts these shifts could be explained by the fact that the aridity index φ pe p and the evaporative index ae p depend on the climate whereas human activities only affect ae tomer and schilling 2009 based on the above assumptions wang and hejazi 2011 have shown that the contributions of cc ccde and human interferences h on the runoff change in a watershed which has gone from state a to state b fig 6 can be quantified by eq 4 4 h δ r h δ r p 2 δ r a e 2 p 2 a e 2 p 2 c c d e δ r c δ r p 2 δ r 1 a e 2 p 2 r 1 δ r where r1 δr δrc and δrh are respectively average annual values of runoff over baseline period total runoff change runoff change due to cc and due to human interferences the following procedures were adopted to evaluate the isolated contributions of cc cde and human interferences h to runoff change in the nested watersheds of the nakanbé river the average annual aridity and evaporative indexes for baseline and impact periods were first calculated based on the yearly average of p pe and ae secondly the selected budyko type model was forced with the average of the aridity and evaporative indexes values over the baseline period to estimate the model parameter e thirdly the estimated parameter e over the baseline period was used to compute the evaporative index due to climate change only ae 2 in fig 5 finally the contribution of each factor climate and human interference to runoff change was quantified as shown in eq 4 3 2 2 elasticity based method to quantify impacts of climate change environmental change and climate environment interaction on water resources by deriving the runoff expression from eq 1 and 3 the elasticity coefficients of climate β and environment εe as well as the contributions of cc cc ec ce and interaction of climate environment cice were obtained eq 5 the details of the derivation procedure are provided in the appendix 5 δ r 1 β δ p p 1 β δ p e p e 1 r 1 ε e δ e e r 1 β φ 1 f φ e f φ a n d ε e e 1 f φ e f e c c 1 β δ p p 1 β δ p e p e 1 r 1 δ r c e ε e δ e e 1 r 1 δ r c i c e 1 c c c e where cc ce and cice are respectively the contributions of cc ec and interaction of climate environment to runoff change δr e1 r1 p1 and pe1 are respectively average values of the parameter runoff precipitation and potential evapotranspiration over the baseline period δe δp and δpe are respectively the variations in the parameter precipitation and potential evapotranspiration between baseline and impact periods the derivation of the budyko function does not consider the interactions between the variables p pe and e therefore the resulting elasticity coefficients are assumed to be the eigenvalues of the climate and environment elasticities these coefficients were used to quantify the isolated impact of cc cc and ec ce on surface runoff variation as such the difference between the total change in surface runoff and the isolated contributions of climate and environmental change can be attributed to the climate environment interaction cice 1 cc ce indeed it is already acknowledged that climate and environment are interrelated with each other dearing 2006 gao et al 2014 however it should be admitted that the contribution of the climate environment interaction cice deduced here might include model uncertainty further work is needed to estimate this uncertainty when the data requirement is met the elasticity coefficient of runoff to climate β is similar to that obtained by arora 2002 the elasticity coefficients β and εe which denote the level of sensitivity of runoff to climate p and pe and environmental changes respectively were used to analyze the sensitivity of the budyko type models table 1 to the aridity index in order to identify the most suitable ones for the study area 3 3 identification of budyko models adapted to the sahelian context the identification of budyko models adapted to the sahelian context was based on sensitivity analysis of budyko type models to aridity index as the west african sahel is characterized by a high aridity index it should be recalled that the elasticity coefficients β and εe are also sensitivity coefficients mccuen 1974 because they are based on the derivative of each budyko function among all the models based on the framework of budyko fu 1981 model has been the most widely used fathi et al 2019 furthermore a comparative study zhang et al 2004 has shown that the fu model is better than that of zhang et al 2001 the equation of porporato et al 2004 is useful when the saturation runoff formation mechanism is dominant over the hortonian runoff table 2 as the hydrological response of watersheds in was is characterized by the hortonian runoff generation casenave and valentin 1991 the models which can be used are those of choudhury 1999 fu 1981 and wang and tang 2014 the two parameter models du et al 2016 greve et al 2016 are an extension of the model of fu 1981 a sensitivity analysis based on elasticity coefficients of runoff to aridity index was carried out to identify the most suitable models for the study area among those of fu choudhury and wang and tang fig 6 a b and c shows the evolution of the elasticities of climate β and environment εe as a function of aridity index φ for each of the three models choudhury 1999 and fu 1981 models showed similar results β reaches its highest values from φ 2 while εe increases continuously with φ with wang and tang 2014 model β and εe are more sensitive when φ 2 therefore this model does not appear relevant for our case study and even for the was in general where the aridity index is likely to reach higher values φ 2 as shown in fig 6 d the models of fu and choudhury models seem to be the most suitable based on sensitivity analysis the fitness quality of the nakanbé watershed at wayen data to fu and choudhury models over the period 1965 2018 was assessed using the root mean square error function eq 6 6 r m s e 1 n i 1965 2018 a e p i a e ˆ p i 2 where n is the data series length a e p i a e p ˆ i represents the difference between simulated and observed evaporative indexes 6 the result showed that both models fu and choudhury fit well to the data fig 6 d with the same root mean square error rmse 0 04 the lag in the data over the period 2007 2018 is certainly due to the effect of environmental change because budyko functions adjustment by a fixed parameter implies neglecting the watershed environmental change the fu model was applied in this study because it is mathematically based and the most widely used table 2 3 4 exploring the relationship between fu model parameter w and vegetation coverage m the vegetation coverage m is one of the main characteristics of the land surface which largely controls the spatial variability of the parameter relating to the environmental conditions in budyko type models ning et al 2019 teuling et al 2019 zhang et al 2004 2001 1999 in this study remotely sensed vegetation information was used to estimate the vegetation coverage li et al 2013 through the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi as shown in eq 7 7 m n d v i n d v i m i n n d v i m a x n d v i m i n where m indicates the vegetation coverage ndvima x and ndvimin are ndvi values for dense forest 0 80 and bare soil 0 05 respectively the relationship between w and m was assessed through regression for this purpose the values of the parameter w were calculated by forcing the budyko type model of fu 1981 with long term average data of p pe and ae at watersheds 7 and grid 276 ndvi grids scale the regressions performance was assessed through the coefficient of determination r2 eq 8 8 r 2 i 1 283 m i m w i w i 1 283 m i m 2 i 1 283 w i w 2 2 where m and w are the averages over the 276 grids and 7 watersheds i e 283 of vegetation coverage m and the fu model parameter w respectively 8 4 results 4 1 hydro meteorological and environmental changes in the nakanbé watershed at wayen table 3 presents the results of breakpoints detection tests performed on the annual hydro meteorological time series in seven nested watersheds of the nakanbé river we investigated the change in runoff through the three gauges with at least 20 valid years of records wayen ramsa and rambo the pettitt test identified 1977 and 1982 as break years in the time series data of r and pe respectively whereas various breakpoints during 1990 2000 were identified in p time series in the nested watersheds of the nakanbé river additionally the segmentation procedure identified 1969 1981 2006 and 2014 as breakpoints in precipitation time series as the period 2015 2018 is relatively short 2014 was not considered as a breakpoint year the breakpoints years 1969 and 1981 showed a significant reduction in precipitation while the breakpoints over the period 1990 2000 and in 2006 indicated a significant increase as shown in fig 7 a for the whole watershed annual precipitation decreased from 1965 to 1981 reaching its lowest values during the 1981 1990 period since 1990 a recovery in precipitation has been observed which intensified from 2007 the runoff coefficient of the nakanbé watershed at wayen increased from 1965 to 2018 fig 8 b despite the drought of the 1980s and the impoundment of dourou 100 million m3 in 1995 and ziga 200 million m3 in 2000 dams in the absence of these two dams the average runoff coefficient over the period 2007 2014 would be 6 against 1 5 over the period 1965 1977 the increase in runoff despite the decrease in precipitation over the period 1965 1990 is reminiscent of the first sahelian hydrological paradox descroix et al 2018 wendling et al 2019 the environmental change and its spatial variability were assessed through the vegetation coverage m and ndvi significant spatial variability was observed in the vegetation cover of the nakanbé watershed at wayen fig 8 a the trend in ndvi from 1982 to 2015 fig 8 b showed a decrease from 1982 to 1984 an increase until 1993 and relative stability since 1993 the test of pettitt indicated 1993 as a breakpoint year in the average ndvi time series for all sub watersheds p value 0 05 the increase in runoff coefficient over the period 1994 2018 fig 7 b despite the re greening fig 8 b is reminiscent of the second sahelian hydrological paradox descroix et al 2018 it was also shown that population growth led to decreased vegetation in these locations diello 2007 table 4 indicates that from 1985 to 2006 the population density increased in all watersheds the average population density of the watershed ranged from 50 inhabitants per square kilometer hbts km2 in 1985 to 62 in 1996 and 79 in 2006 with an important spatial variability the sub watershed gauged by dombré station exhibits the highest densities 98 122 156 hbts km2 respectively in 1985 1996 2006 while the rambo sub watershed has the lowest densities 32 45 56 hbts km2 respectively in 1985 1996 2006 it is instructive to point out that the dombré sub watershed shelters ouahigouya city the fifth largest city in burkina faso in summary the evolution of hydro meteorological and environmental time series showed significant breaks before 1982 in pe p and r over the period 1990 2000 p ndvi with the impoundment of the two large dams and after 2006 p based on these breakpoints the study period was divided into one baseline period 1965 1977 and three impacted periods 1978 1994 1995 2006 and 2007 2018 in the nakanbé watershed at wayen the period 1978 1994 was the driest and characterized by the highest aridity indexes fig 9 and lowest ndvi values fig 8 b the periods 1995 2006 and 2007 2018 compared to 1978 1994 were characterized by a decrease in the aridity index fig 9 b to d overall from 1965 to 2018 runoff has increased in all nested watersheds however over the period 1978 1994 runoff derived from the water balance exhibited a decrease compared to the period 1965 1977 in the sub watersheds of rambo 28 59 mm vs 41 82 mm and ramsa 38 26 mm vs 43 29 mm 4 2 separated and combined effects of climate and environmental changes on water resources in the nested watersheds of nakanbé based on the identified sub periods subsection 4 1 the elasticity and decomposition methods eq 4 and 5 were applied to quantify the contributions of each factor climate and environmental changes to runoff change the decomposition method made it possible to quantify the impacts of climate change ccde and human interferences h and the elasticity method developed in this study allowed the quantification of the impacts of cc cc ec ce and climate environment interaction cice the analysis of the results showed that h includes ce and cice fig 10 showed that elasticity and decomposition based methods gave similar results r2 0 99 in the following only the results based on the elasticity method are presented table 5 the elasticity coefficients analysis showed that runoff is more than twice as sensitive to environmental change ec than climate change cc the negative value of impact indicates a contribution in the opposite direction to the runoff variation the analysis of the individual and combined contributions of cc and ec to runoff changes showed that over the period 1978 1994 ec was the leading cause of the increased runoff at wayen yilou tempelga dombré and tougou in the ramsa and rambo watersheds the drought increased aridity was dominant and decreased the surface runoff from 1995 to 2018 the precipitation recovery contributed positively to the increase in runoff in all watersheds cc 0 and δr 0 during the period 1995 2006 the contribution of ec was the highest in all watersheds except ramsa and yilou in the ramsa watershed cc was the predominant factor while the climate environment interaction was the most important in the yilou watershed over the period 2007 2018 climate environment interaction has been the main factor causing the increase in surface runoff in four watersheds wayen yilou rambo and tougou against two for cc ramsa and dombré and one for ec tempelga between 1978 and 2018 the impact of climate environment interaction increased the seven nested nakanbé watersheds at wayen with surface ranging from 38 to 21 178 km2 were considered to assess the spatial scale effect fig 11 shows that the absolute value of the elasticity coefficient is proportional to the size of the watersheds however the low regression coefficients 5 10 5 for climate and 4 10 5 for the environment explain the non detection of a significant relationship between the impacts and the size of the watersheds 4 3 evolution of the state of nakanbé nested watersheds under the budyko framework from 1965 to 2018 fig 12 shows the evolution of the states of the seven nakanbé nested watersheds under the budyko framework and helps in understanding the effects of cc and ec on water resources table 5 according to wang and hejazi 2011 fig 12 a shows the impacts of possible watershed state shifts in the budyko framework a decrease or increase in aridity index implies the respectively positive or negative contribution of cc to runoff increase over the period 1978 1994 the increase in aridity index all the watersheds shifted to the right in fig 12 b to h justifies the negative contribution of cc to the increase in runoff the precipitation recovery all watersheds moved to the left in fig 12 b to h caused the positive contribution of cc to the increase in runoff since 1995 also fig 12 b to h shows that the nested watersheds located in the northwest ramsa rambo dombré and tougou have the lowest parameter w the northern part of the watershed is globally characterized by a very low vegetation cover fig 8 a and high aridity indexes fig 9 therefore it could be concluded that low vegetation cover coupled with a high aridity index lead to low w values in the budyko framework unilateral decrease increase in evaporative index translates into a decrease increase in the model parameter w leading to positive negative contribution of human interferences to runoff change respectively the decrease in vegetation can be caused by direct anthropogenic actions deforestation or by cc thus a change in w can be attributed to direct anthropogenic activities or climate environment interactions therefore the parameter w is a potential global environmental indicator including direct and indirect changes in the environment of the watershed being studied in the nested watersheds of the nakanbé river the transition from the baseline period 1965 1977 to the impacted periods 1978 1994 1995 2006 and 2007 2018 was characterized by fig 12 a continuous degradation translated by a decrease in the parameter w value from 1965 to 2018 in the wayen and yilou watersheds an improvement of environmental conditions increase in w from 1965 to 1977 followed by degradation decrease in w from 1978 to 2018 in the rambo sub watershed a degradation reduction in w from 1965 to 1977 and an improvement from 1995 to 2018 in the ramsa and dombré sub watersheds in the ramsa sub watershed w was relatively stable between 2 30 and 2 41 due to the opposite environmental dynamics of rambo and dombré sub watersheds it controls a mixed trend in the evolution of w in the tougou and tempelga sub watersheds therefore the evolution of the global environmental parameter w explains the estimated ec and climate environment interactions contributions to the runoff change table 5 according to the elasticity coefficients found in the nested watersheds of nakanbé environmental degradation leads to an increase in runoff while the increase in w leads to runoff decrease from 1965 to 2018 ec globally contributed positively to the increase in runoff due to environmental degradation since 1995 cc has contributed positively to runoff increase due to the precipitation recovery over the period 2007 2018 climate environment interaction has contributed most to the increase in runoff in most watersheds 4 out of 7 as compared to 2 for cc and 1 for ec from these results it appears that the first sahelian hydrological paradox the runoff increase despite precipitation decrease over 1978 1994 was caused by environmental degradation in contrast during the second paradox increase in runoff coefficients after the precipitation recovery despite the general re greening climate environment interaction was dominant 4 4 relationship between the parameter w and vegetation coverage m in nakanbé watershed the seven nested watersheds and 276 grids 8 km 8 km were used to look for a link between w and m over the period 1978 1994 specific values of w for watersheds and grids were obtained by forcing the budyko model of fu with aridity and evaporative indexes fig 13 illustrates the spatial variability of the parameter w in the nakanbé watershed at wayen fig 14 shows that a linear regression model between w and m is optimal and significant r2 0 53 p value 2 2 10 16 and is given by eq 9 9 w 6 27 m 0 98 the parameter w is positively correlated and proportional to the long term averaged annual vegetation coverage m fig 14 as also found by li et al 2013 in the nakanbé watershed at wayen the value w 7 25 was found for dense forests and w 0 98 for completely bare soils whereas in comparison with li et al 2013 these values were w 3 52 for dense forests and w 1 16 for bare soils the regression slope between w and m in nakanbé watershed 6 27 is higher than that obtained by li et al 2013 2 36 which means that for the same change in m the w in nakanbé watershed will vary by a factor of about 3 from that estimated by the regression model of li et al 2013 5 discussions and conclusion 5 1 impact of climate environment interaction on water resources in this study the difference between the total change in runoff and the contribution of climate change cc and environmental change ec was assumed to be the impact of climate environment interactions eq 5 the impacts study showed that fig 10 and table 5 the impact of human interference h quantified using budyko curve decomposition is the sum of the impacts of ec and climate environment interaction budyko curve decomposition and elasticity methods lead to similar results and from 1978 to 2018 the impact of the climate environment interaction increased although the impact of climate environment interaction calculated here could include uncertainties in estimating cc and ec impacts the values obtained allow us to assume that these uncertainties could not change the observed trends at a watershed scale cc can induce ec dearing 2006 gao et al 2014 thus the impact of climate environment interaction could be as a result of indirect feedback from the climate climate influences the environment which in turn affects the runoff in the west african sahel was the heavy nature of rainfall intensity plays a significant role in forming soil overcrusting which hampers infiltration and promotes runoff ribstein 1990 valentin 1985 valentin et al 2004 the increase in soil overcrusting in was descroix 2018 likely attributable to the increase in the intensity of extreme rainfall panthou et al 2018 2014 would be one of the major causes of the rise in the impact of climate environment interaction on runoff in nakanbé watershed at wayen therefore the effect of the climate environment interaction should be given much attention as in the face of climate change rainfall intensity is expected to increase in the was diedhiou et al 2018 5 2 towards a better understanding of the hydrological behavior of the nakanbé watershed the results obtained in this study highlighted that environmental change ec was the main driver of runoff change in the nested nakanbé watersheds at wayen from 1978 to 1994 however since 1995 the climate environment interaction has become increasingly prominent this result is expected to be the same throughout the west africa sahel was due to the high sensitivity of runoff to ec in arid zones fig 6 a to c in arid zones φ 2 runoff change is at least twice as sensitive to ec as climate change cc these findings quantitatively explain the causes of the two sahelian hydrological paradoxes dardel et al 2014 descroix et al 2018 the impact of precipitation change mainly determines the impact of cc on surface runoff as the elasticity coefficient of runoff to pe εpe is lower than that of p εp 1 εpe the analysis of the spatial variability of the impacts did not reveal any spatial organization the non detection of a significant trend between cc and ec contributions and watershed size is undoubtedly due to the size of the watersheds considered although the relationship between surface runoff and scale is already acknowledged to be complicated in the study area mounirou 2012 mounirou et al 2020 indeed pouyaud 1986 proposed that 30 000 km2 should be considered as a significant break surface in the analysis of the effect of spatial scale of cc and ec on surface runoff in the volta river watershed in burkina faso while the size of the watersheds in this study ranged from 38 to 21 178 km2 below 30 000 km2 the influence of cc especially precipitation is shadowed by that of ec especially the development of bare soils and crusting which are predominant in smaller watersheds in budyko type models the environmental dynamic is analyzed through the model parameter w in the fu equation as shown by li et al 2013 there is a good relationship between the vegetation coverage m and w in the nakanbé watershed at wayen but the regression coefficient is higher fig 14 the nakanbé watershed studied is located in an arid context with high values of w for the same given m in a wet context li et al 2019 the high variation observed between the regression coefficient obtained by li et al 2013 and that indicated by this study might be related to the under representation of arid watersheds in the work of li et al 2013 less than 10 it is therefore necessary to establish the relationship between w and m for each climatic zone the relationship obtained in this study is indicative of the nakanbé watershed at wayen and it might be necessary to integrate other watersheds before concluding at the full was scale from 1965 to 2018 the value of parameter w decreased in most of the nakanbé nested watersheds this evolution of w is consistent with the downward trend in the soil water holding capacity whc suggested in the nakanbé river watershed diello 2007 mahé et al 2005 paturel et al 2017 furthermore the factors influencing w and whc are the same climate and watershed characteristics albergel 1987 dunne and willmott 1996 jiang et al 2015 li et al 2013 mahé et al 2005 zhang et al 2019b the parameter w can therefore be compared to the whc of the watershed in the dombré sub watershed the parameter w increased from 1978 to 2018 despite the increase in the population density 98 156 hbts km2 from 1985 to 2006 see table 4 this observation is at par with the fact that beyond a certain population density an inverse process of environmental dynamics can be observed as in the population theory of boserup populations are forced to limit the area of cultivated land and to adopt improved agricultural techniques and shift to intensive agriculture geared towards productivity indeed several studies in different african territories showed that the increase in population density can lead to a virtuous agricultural intensification leading therefore to the improvement of soil fertility and the reduction of soil erosion and an increase in whc of soils demont and jouve 2000 descroix 2018 luxereau and roussel 1997 planel 2008 tiffen et al 1994 it is worth mentioning the case of m yacouba sawadogo right livelihood award 2018 known as the man who stopped the desert thor west et al 2020 between 1980 and 2018 he created a forest of about 40 ha from barren and abandoned land in gourga located in ouahigouya municipality in yatenga province northern burkina faso in the dombré sub watershed area this result was achieved through the implementation of the soil and water conservation technique called zaï which contributes to reducing runoff to promote infiltration supplying crops and mitigating dry spells nyamekye et al 2018 zouré et al 2019 water harvesting techniques have therefore enabled to increase whc of the soils in the dombré sub watershed thus the parameter w of the fu model is a good indicator of the spatio temporal variability of soil whc in the sahelian part of the nakanbé river watershed water holding capacity whc is an essential parameter in most hydrological models the whc data available to date are those given in the fao soil map fao 1981 fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2012 the fao soil map for the was is based on soil surveys and information gathered in the 1960s nachtergaele et al 2010 and therefore might be outdated the use of time varying values of soil whc can improve the performance of hydrological model applications in the was watersheds diello 2007 mahé et al 2005 paturel et al 2017 in the light of this study results the parameter w can therefore be used to provide time varying soil whc to this end according to the elasticity coefficient of runoff to environmental change table 5 the relationship between vegetation coverage m and the parameter w in the watershed of nakanbé at wayen eq 9 an increase in vegetation coverage m would lead to an increase in w by order of 1 45 1 80 and a decrease of runoff by order of 2 43 to 3 36 therefore the adoption of an adequate environmental management policy to promote environmental restoration might help in mitigating the increase in runoff coefficient which is reported to be the cause of significant flooding events throughout the was coulibaly et al 2020 nka et al 2015 sighomnou et al 2013 tazen et al 2019 6 conclusion this study focused on seven nested watersheds located in the sahel part of nakanbé river in burkina faso it aimed to identify a suitable budyko type model for arid contexts such as in west africa sahel was and to analyze the impacts of climate change cc environmental change ec and climate environment interaction on water resources in nakanbé watershed at wayen the budyko type model of fu was found to be appropriate through a sensitivity analysis therefore the isolated and combined impacts of cc and ec on runoff change were quantified based on elasticity and budyko curve decomposition methods from these results the evolution of the hydrological behavior of nakanbé watershed at wayen was assessed through the analysis of the spatio temporal variability of the parameter w from the fu model and its relationship with the vegetation coverage m our results confirmed that the nakanbé watershed at wayen had undergone the two sahelian hydrological paradoxes from 1965 to 2018 the runoff coefficient increased the runoff coefficient over the period 2007 2014 became 4 times higher than that of the period 1965 1977 the environmental conditions of the watershed area are characterized by low vegetation coverage albeit presenting a substantial variability the impact studies showed that elasticity and budyko curve decomposition methods gave similar results r2 0 99 the impact of human interferences quantified by the decomposition method includes the impacts of ec and climate environment interactions from 1978 to 1994 ec had been the main driver of runoff change in the nakanbé nested watersheds contribution reached 175 but climate environment interaction became increasingly predominant contribution reached 68 over the period 2007 2018 the analysis of the variability of the impacts did not reveal a significant trend between cc ec contributions and watershed size however in the nakanbé watershed at wayen there is a good and consistent relationship between the vegetation coverage m and the parameter w from 1965 to 2018 w decreased in all watersheds except in that of dombré possibly due to the long term implementation of water harvesting techniques which is effective in the increase of the soil water holding capacity whc therefore w appears to be a good indicator of the spatio temporal variability of the soils whc which could be used to generate time varying values of whc to improve the performance of hydrological models author contributions y patrick gbohoui conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing jean emmanuel

8244,study region nakanbé river watershed in the west africa sahel was study focus this study aims to better understand the hydrological behavior of was watersheds which experienced sahelian hydrological paradoxes shp budyko framework was employed to evaluate the impact of climate change environmental change and climate environment interaction on surface runoff change in seven nested watersheds 38 21 178 km2 over the period 1965 2018 new hydrological insights for the region based on time series stationarity statistical tests the study period was divided into one baseline period 1965 1977 and three impacted periods 1978 1994 1995 2006 and 2007 2018 compared to the baseline period the period 1978 1994 was characterized by a decrease in precipitation and an increase in runoff first shp during the period 1995 2018 the runoff coefficient which increased despite the observed re greening was interpreted as evidence of the second shp the impact study showed that environmental change was the main driver of the first shp contribution reached 175 then climate environment interaction became increasingly dominant during the second shp contribution reaching 68 the watersheds evolution in budyko framework showed that the fu budyko type model parameter appears to be a good indicator of soil water holding capacity spatio temporal variability our results highlight the consequences of climate and environmental changes on surface runoff in the sahelian context and might help in developing informed land management and restoration strategies to control runoff

environmental change ec affect the hydrological behavior of most rivers watersheds in the world bai et al 2019 descroix et al 2018 grijsen et al 2013 kang et al 2020 karambiri et al 2011 mango et al 2011 piemontese et al 2019 svensson et al 2005 at the watershed scale ec includes changes in land use and land cover lulc and soil physical properties thus the hydrological cycle of the watersheds has undergone profound modifications floods have become increasingly devastating and water resources threatened descroix et al 2018 2009 kundzewicz et al 2005 mangini et al 2018 nka et al 2015 paturel et al 2003 robson 2002 svensson et al 2005 given such drastic changes a better understanding of watersheds hydrological behavior is critical to implement effective measures for surface runoff regulation or at least to strengthen resilience the studies examining the impacts of cc and ec on water resources have been often used to investigate the hydrological behavior of watersheds dooge 1992 kang et al 2020 mango et al 2011 pellarin et al 2013 piemontese et al 2019 taylor et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 according to blöschl et al 2007 and sivapalan et al 2003 the methods used to assess cc and ec impacts on water resources can be summarized into upward and downward approaches the so called upward approach starts with a thorough understanding of physical processes to further set up a detailed hydrological model based on conservation equations blöschl et al 2013 this approach requires a long time series of climate and environmental data in addition the detailed models are multi parametric which might lead to an increase in uncertainties in the results hence an overall increased difficulty in analyzing the outputs in a given study context blöschl et al 2007 the so called downward approach seeks to explain the behavior of the hydrological system as a whole it consists of analyzing the evolution of hydrological response to come up with hypotheses which explain the mechanisms and conditions underlying the observed trends harman and troch 2014 the downward approach includes statistical empirical methods linear regression machine learning conceptual frameworks budyko tomer schilling and analytical methods arora 2002 budyko 1974 guo et al 2019 peng et al 2013 tomer and schilling 2009 zuo et al 2014 zhu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 in this set the budyko framework budyko 1974 is widely used for impact studies in hydrology through parametric models such models do not require environmental data however the signatures of environmental dynamics are captured through the evolution of actual evapotranspiration ae defined as a function of potential evapotranspiration pe and precipitation p budyko 1974 sposito 2017 climate elasticity and decomposition of the budyko curve are the two techniques used to quantify the impacts the climate elasticity based method quantifies the impact of cc on water resources and the remainder is attributed to non climatic factors arora 2002 the budyko curve decomposition is a conceptual method that partitions runoff change into impacts of cc and human interference wang and hejazi 2011 which assumes that runoff change is solely due to cc and human interference however the interaction between climate and environment is recognized at all spatio temporal scales dearing 2006 diello 2007 gao et al 2014 therefore it is essential to isolate the impact of cc ec and climate environment interaction on water resources in the budyko type model the impact of human interferences is quantified through a parameter largely controlled by environmental variables li et al 2013 several studies have shown that the value of the budyko parameter is a function of the proportion of the watershed covered by vegetation ning et al 2019 teuling et al 2019 zhang et al 2004 2001 1999 but the relationships established were not stable and varied across studies donohue et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 li et al 2013 liu et al 2019 ning et al 2019 wang and tang 2014 zhang et al 2004 2019a among the several studies applying the budyko framework to assess the contributions of cc and ec to surface runoff change only li et al 2013 took into account the niger river watershed in west african sahel was most of the impact studies carried in the was have been limited to assessing the effects of cc grijsen et al 2013 karambiri et al 2011 a few studies gave an interest in the effects of ec but were limited to qualitative assessments nka et al 2015 or based on upward approaches through hydrological modeling gal et al 2017 yonaba et al 2021 however the scarcity and the low quality of data that characterize africa hasan et al 2018 mahé 2006 severely hamper the application of such upward approaches blöschl et al 2007 the was is known for the fragility of its hydrological system for which a wide range of questions remains unanswered since 1950 the climate in this zone has been characterized by i a continuous increase in potential evapotranspiration pe due to global warming ii a wet period 1950 1970 followed by a drought period 1970 1990 and recovery of precipitation since the 1990s de longueville et al 2016 lebel and ali 2009 mahé 2006 since the 1980s drought the hydrological behavior of some hydro systems has become paradoxical descroix et al 2018 mahé and paturel 2009 wendling et al 2019 the first sahelian hydrological paradox shp characterized by an exacerbated increase in runoff occurred during the drought the second shp characterized by an increase in the runoff coefficient despite the general re greening of the was has been observed since the precipitation recovery descroix et al 2018 these shps fostered flooding overflowing in hydraulic infrastructures erosion and land degradation the nakanbé river is an important tributary of the volta river in west africa it takes its source from the sahelian zone in burkina faso and it is one of the main freshwater resources of the country ibrahim 2012 a significant part of its drainage area nakanbé at wayen is located in the was and has also been experiencing changes in the hydrologic regimes diello 2007 mahé et al 2005 paturel et al 2017 the overflow of the large bagré dam downstream of wayen station in 1994 two years after its impoundment is such an example mahé et al 2005 paturel et al 2003 therefore the nakanbé watershed is an interesting case study to shed light on the evolution of the was watersheds hydrological behavior by assessing the isolated and combined impacts of cc and ec on surface runoff change the objectives of this study were i to quantify the contributions of cc ec and climate environment interaction to surface runoff change across seven nested watersheds ii to investigate the relationship between budyko model parameter and the vegetation coverage 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area fig 1 lies in the sahel characterized by a short wet season june october higher variability in precipitation high evapotranspiration rates and significant thermal amplitudes the average annual precipitation varies between 200 mm and 1200 mm and potential evapotranspiration ranges between 1500 and 3000 mm per year the nakanbé river is an important tributary of the trans boundary volta river shared by benin burkina faso ivory coast ghana mali and togo the nakanbé river watershed in burkina faso covers about 15 of the country with high population density and shelters more than 50 of its water reservoirs ibrahim 2012 the watershed relief is generally flat with altitudes varying between 259 and 526 m the crystalline basement which occupies the underground watershed is not favorable to a significant mobilization of groundwater resources upstream wayen gauging station several natural and artificial reservoirs can be found in the nakanbé watershed the most important of which are the bam lake 41 million m3 the dourou dam 100 million m3 and ziga dam 200 million m3 impounded in 1995 and 2000 respectively fig 1 the ziga dam is mainly used for water supply to ouagadougou the capital city of burkina faso and the dourou dam is mainly used for agricultural purposes in the nakanbé watershed lulc changes were significant over the period 1972 1992 but have become stable since 1992 diello 2007 2 2 hydro climatic data hydro climatic data used in this study included precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pe actual evapotranspiration ae and surface runoff r fig 2 shows the flowchart used for data processing in general the quality control of the observed data collected consisted of an exploratory analysis to detect outliers and gaps some additional checks specific to each type of data were also carried out at the end of data quality control the valid observations were used to identify the appropriate databases to fill in the gaps after bias correction if necessary hydrological data concerned the daily discharges over the period 1965 2018 at seven gauging stations in the nakanbé river watershed presented in fig 1 six of which were provided by the hydrological services direction générale des ressources en eau dgre in burkina faso the daily data from the tougou watershed gauging station was provided by 2ie institute for the period 2004 2018 as shown in fig 3 these data have several gaps in this study it has been assumed that a valid year is a year without missing data during the wet season june october furthermore when the river cross section at the gauging station underwent significant changes without updating its rating curve all data measured after the modification were declared missing thus three gauging stations wayen ramsa and rambo had valid data for more than 20 years fig 3 annual runoffs at wayen station after the construction of ziga and dourou dams from 1995 were reconstructed based on monitoring data obtained from dgre and water withdrawals monitoring from the water and sanitation services office national de l eau et de l assainissement onea in burkina faso the daily time series of p and pe came from the sierem database boyer et al 2006 and the national meteorological services agence nationale de la météorologie anam in burkina faso table 1 these included data from seventeen stations among which two are synoptic stations as shown in fig 1 the meteorological data collected covers the period 1965 2015 but most of them ended in 2000 fig 3 to fill the gaps the databases arc 2 chirpsv2 0 mswepv2 2 terraclimate and cru ts v 4 03 see table 1 for details were identified the two synoptic stations ouagaaero and ouahigouya with complete data from 1965 to 2015 were used to select the most suitable databases for the nakanbé watershed for the precipitation time series three databases arc v2 chirps v2 0 and mswep v2 2 were compared to observations at synoptic stations over the period 2000 2015 as it contained 90 of the gaps the kling gupta efficiency kge performance criterion gupta et al 2009 and the percent bias pbias moriasi et al 2007 were applied to assess database performance the arc v2 database was finally selected as it presented the best performance overall kge 0 8 and pbias 2 6 similarly dembélé et al 2020 and dembélé and zwart 2016 showed that arcv2 is among the most suitable database in picturing precipitation over the volta basin and also over burkina faso the quality of arc 2 data after correction by empirical quantile mapping eqm was not significantly improved finally arc 2 was directly used to fill the gaps in the rainfall data for the rain gauges the thiessen polygon method was used to spatialize the rainfall over the watershed the thiessen polygon method was selected because it is suitable for our study area olawoyin and acheampong 2017 given the insufficient number of rain gauges and their heterogeneous distribution over the watershed the comparative analysis of spatial pe databases cru ts v 4 03 and terraclimate with pe data from the two synoptic stations provided by anam through the mann whitney test at the 5 level showed that there is no significant difference between annual pe provided by anam and those from terraclimate p value 0 0890 annual pe of cru ts v 4 03 are significantly different from those provided by anam p value 0 0001 terraclimate database also provides ae data at the same resolution and for the same period as pe therefore the terraclimate database was considered as the source for pe and ae in this study 2 3 altitude vegetation and demographic data the digital elevation model dem alos world 3d aw3d from the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa was used in this study from this dem data the boundaries of the nested watersheds were extracted the demographic data from 1985 1996 and 2006 national censuses of the population were provided by insd table 1 the population density was evaluated for administrative and territorial units found within the nakanbé watershed the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data used in this study is from pinzon and tucker 2014 and is based on noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration and eumetsat european organization for the exploitation of meteorological satellites records provided at 8 km 8 km resolution over the period 1981 2015 3 methodology fig 4 outlines the methodological framework used in this study firstly pettitt test and segmentation procedure were applied to split the study period into pre change baseline period and change impact periods sensitivity analysis based on the partial derivative allowed selecting the most suitable budyko type model for west african sahel was secondly the suitable budyko type model chosen was used to quantify the impacts of cc ec on the water resource of the seven nested watersheds through elasticity and decomposition methods a specific elasticity method developed allowed quantifying the individual impacts of cc and ec and the impact of their interaction finally correlation and regression research techniques were applied to explore the spatial variability of the impacts and the relationship between the parameter of budyko and the vegetation coverage m 3 1 breakpoint detection methods the pettitt test pettitt 1979 and the segmentation procedure hubert et al 1989 for the detection of one or more breakpoints respectively were applied to annual hydro climatic and environmental time series data herein the results obtained from the segmentation procedure were considered only in the occurrence of numerous breaks and the results of the pettitt test were considered for single breaks we limited the use of the segmentation procedure due to the ambiguity around the significance level of its results hubert et al 1989 there is not a precise p value assigned to each result 3 2 quantification of impacts of climate and environmental changes on water resources based on budyko framework assuming negligible in the long term changes in subsurface water storage and net heat transfer between the land surface and the vadose zone root zone water and energy balances at the watershed scale become eq 1 sposito 2017 1 a e p r a e p e h l a e f p p e where p l t precipitation ae l t actual evapotranspiration r l t runoff pe l t potential evapotranspiration h m t3 sensible heat flux and l m l 1 t 2 latent heat of vaporization dividing the terms in eq 1 by the precipitation p gives eq 2 which expresses the conceptual framework of budyko budyko 1974 2 a e p f p e p a e p f φ where φ ratio between pe and p is the aridity index the aridity index indicates the climate type and is the most widely used similarity measure blöschl et al 2013 wetlands are characterized by low aridity index φ 0 76 while an aridity index greater than 1 35 indicates an arid zone mcvicar et al 2012 this framework is the basis of several models for estimating actual evapotranspiration dey and mishra 2017 budyko parametric models table 2 have been widely used to quantify the impacts of cc and human interferences on the hydrological response of watersheds dey and mishra 2017 li et al 2019 liu et al 2019 teuling et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a the budyko type parametric models table 2 show that in a given watershed the evaporative index a e p is a function of the aridity index φ and the parameter e therefore eq 2 can be rewritten as in eq 3 3 a e p f φ e where φ is the aridity index and e is the budyko type model parameter the methods for assessing impacts used in the budyko approach are climate elasticity and budyko curve decomposition 3 2 1 budyko curve decomposition for quantifying impacts of climate change and human interferences on water resources in the budyko framework based on global data it has been shown that under natural conditions without human interference the evolution of the state of a watershed follows the budyko curve budyko 1974 climate change cc leads to changes in aridity and evaporative indexes a to b in fig 5 of the watersheds wang and hejazi 2011 which translates as horizontal and vertical shifts while human interferences cause only vertical shifts these shifts could be explained by the fact that the aridity index φ pe p and the evaporative index ae p depend on the climate whereas human activities only affect ae tomer and schilling 2009 based on the above assumptions wang and hejazi 2011 have shown that the contributions of cc ccde and human interferences h on the runoff change in a watershed which has gone from state a to state b fig 6 can be quantified by eq 4 4 h δ r h δ r p 2 δ r a e 2 p 2 a e 2 p 2 c c d e δ r c δ r p 2 δ r 1 a e 2 p 2 r 1 δ r where r1 δr δrc and δrh are respectively average annual values of runoff over baseline period total runoff change runoff change due to cc and due to human interferences the following procedures were adopted to evaluate the isolated contributions of cc cde and human interferences h to runoff change in the nested watersheds of the nakanbé river the average annual aridity and evaporative indexes for baseline and impact periods were first calculated based on the yearly average of p pe and ae secondly the selected budyko type model was forced with the average of the aridity and evaporative indexes values over the baseline period to estimate the model parameter e thirdly the estimated parameter e over the baseline period was used to compute the evaporative index due to climate change only ae 2 in fig 5 finally the contribution of each factor climate and human interference to runoff change was quantified as shown in eq 4 3 2 2 elasticity based method to quantify impacts of climate change environmental change and climate environment interaction on water resources by deriving the runoff expression from eq 1 and 3 the elasticity coefficients of climate β and environment εe as well as the contributions of cc cc ec ce and interaction of climate environment cice were obtained eq 5 the details of the derivation procedure are provided in the appendix 5 δ r 1 β δ p p 1 β δ p e p e 1 r 1 ε e δ e e r 1 β φ 1 f φ e f φ a n d ε e e 1 f φ e f e c c 1 β δ p p 1 β δ p e p e 1 r 1 δ r c e ε e δ e e 1 r 1 δ r c i c e 1 c c c e where cc ce and cice are respectively the contributions of cc ec and interaction of climate environment to runoff change δr e1 r1 p1 and pe1 are respectively average values of the parameter runoff precipitation and potential evapotranspiration over the baseline period δe δp and δpe are respectively the variations in the parameter precipitation and potential evapotranspiration between baseline and impact periods the derivation of the budyko function does not consider the interactions between the variables p pe and e therefore the resulting elasticity coefficients are assumed to be the eigenvalues of the climate and environment elasticities these coefficients were used to quantify the isolated impact of cc cc and ec ce on surface runoff variation as such the difference between the total change in surface runoff and the isolated contributions of climate and environmental change can be attributed to the climate environment interaction cice 1 cc ce indeed it is already acknowledged that climate and environment are interrelated with each other dearing 2006 gao et al 2014 however it should be admitted that the contribution of the climate environment interaction cice deduced here might include model uncertainty further work is needed to estimate this uncertainty when the data requirement is met the elasticity coefficient of runoff to climate β is similar to that obtained by arora 2002 the elasticity coefficients β and εe which denote the level of sensitivity of runoff to climate p and pe and environmental changes respectively were used to analyze the sensitivity of the budyko type models table 1 to the aridity index in order to identify the most suitable ones for the study area 3 3 identification of budyko models adapted to the sahelian context the identification of budyko models adapted to the sahelian context was based on sensitivity analysis of budyko type models to aridity index as the west african sahel is characterized by a high aridity index it should be recalled that the elasticity coefficients β and εe are also sensitivity coefficients mccuen 1974 because they are based on the derivative of each budyko function among all the models based on the framework of budyko fu 1981 model has been the most widely used fathi et al 2019 furthermore a comparative study zhang et al 2004 has shown that the fu model is better than that of zhang et al 2001 the equation of porporato et al 2004 is useful when the saturation runoff formation mechanism is dominant over the hortonian runoff table 2 as the hydrological response of watersheds in was is characterized by the hortonian runoff generation casenave and valentin 1991 the models which can be used are those of choudhury 1999 fu 1981 and wang and tang 2014 the two parameter models du et al 2016 greve et al 2016 are an extension of the model of fu 1981 a sensitivity analysis based on elasticity coefficients of runoff to aridity index was carried out to identify the most suitable models for the study area among those of fu choudhury and wang and tang fig 6 a b and c shows the evolution of the elasticities of climate β and environment εe as a function of aridity index φ for each of the three models choudhury 1999 and fu 1981 models showed similar results β reaches its highest values from φ 2 while εe increases continuously with φ with wang and tang 2014 model β and εe are more sensitive when φ 2 therefore this model does not appear relevant for our case study and even for the was in general where the aridity index is likely to reach higher values φ 2 as shown in fig 6 d the models of fu and choudhury models seem to be the most suitable based on sensitivity analysis the fitness quality of the nakanbé watershed at wayen data to fu and choudhury models over the period 1965 2018 was assessed using the root mean square error function eq 6 6 r m s e 1 n i 1965 2018 a e p i a e ˆ p i 2 where n is the data series length a e p i a e p ˆ i represents the difference between simulated and observed evaporative indexes 6 the result showed that both models fu and choudhury fit well to the data fig 6 d with the same root mean square error rmse 0 04 the lag in the data over the period 2007 2018 is certainly due to the effect of environmental change because budyko functions adjustment by a fixed parameter implies neglecting the watershed environmental change the fu model was applied in this study because it is mathematically based and the most widely used table 2 3 4 exploring the relationship between fu model parameter w and vegetation coverage m the vegetation coverage m is one of the main characteristics of the land surface which largely controls the spatial variability of the parameter relating to the environmental conditions in budyko type models ning et al 2019 teuling et al 2019 zhang et al 2004 2001 1999 in this study remotely sensed vegetation information was used to estimate the vegetation coverage li et al 2013 through the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi as shown in eq 7 7 m n d v i n d v i m i n n d v i m a x n d v i m i n where m indicates the vegetation coverage ndvima x and ndvimin are ndvi values for dense forest 0 80 and bare soil 0 05 respectively the relationship between w and m was assessed through regression for this purpose the values of the parameter w were calculated by forcing the budyko type model of fu 1981 with long term average data of p pe and ae at watersheds 7 and grid 276 ndvi grids scale the regressions performance was assessed through the coefficient of determination r2 eq 8 8 r 2 i 1 283 m i m w i w i 1 283 m i m 2 i 1 283 w i w 2 2 where m and w are the averages over the 276 grids and 7 watersheds i e 283 of vegetation coverage m and the fu model parameter w respectively 8 4 results 4 1 hydro meteorological and environmental changes in the nakanbé watershed at wayen table 3 presents the results of breakpoints detection tests performed on the annual hydro meteorological time series in seven nested watersheds of the nakanbé river we investigated the change in runoff through the three gauges with at least 20 valid years of records wayen ramsa and rambo the pettitt test identified 1977 and 1982 as break years in the time series data of r and pe respectively whereas various breakpoints during 1990 2000 were identified in p time series in the nested watersheds of the nakanbé river additionally the segmentation procedure identified 1969 1981 2006 and 2014 as breakpoints in precipitation time series as the period 2015 2018 is relatively short 2014 was not considered as a breakpoint year the breakpoints years 1969 and 1981 showed a significant reduction in precipitation while the breakpoints over the period 1990 2000 and in 2006 indicated a significant increase as shown in fig 7 a for the whole watershed annual precipitation decreased from 1965 to 1981 reaching its lowest values during the 1981 1990 period since 1990 a recovery in precipitation has been observed which intensified from 2007 the runoff coefficient of the nakanbé watershed at wayen increased from 1965 to 2018 fig 8 b despite the drought of the 1980s and the impoundment of dourou 100 million m3 in 1995 and ziga 200 million m3 in 2000 dams in the absence of these two dams the average runoff coefficient over the period 2007 2014 would be 6 against 1 5 over the period 1965 1977 the increase in runoff despite the decrease in precipitation over the period 1965 1990 is reminiscent of the first sahelian hydrological paradox descroix et al 2018 wendling et al 2019 the environmental change and its spatial variability were assessed through the vegetation coverage m and ndvi significant spatial variability was observed in the vegetation cover of the nakanbé watershed at wayen fig 8 a the trend in ndvi from 1982 to 2015 fig 8 b showed a decrease from 1982 to 1984 an increase until 1993 and relative stability since 1993 the test of pettitt indicated 1993 as a breakpoint year in the average ndvi time series for all sub watersheds p value 0 05 the increase in runoff coefficient over the period 1994 2018 fig 7 b despite the re greening fig 8 b is reminiscent of the second sahelian hydrological paradox descroix et al 2018 it was also shown that population growth led to decreased vegetation in these locations diello 2007 table 4 indicates that from 1985 to 2006 the population density increased in all watersheds the average population density of the watershed ranged from 50 inhabitants per square kilometer hbts km2 in 1985 to 62 in 1996 and 79 in 2006 with an important spatial variability the sub watershed gauged by dombré station exhibits the highest densities 98 122 156 hbts km2 respectively in 1985 1996 2006 while the rambo sub watershed has the lowest densities 32 45 56 hbts km2 respectively in 1985 1996 2006 it is instructive to point out that the dombré sub watershed shelters ouahigouya city the fifth largest city in burkina faso in summary the evolution of hydro meteorological and environmental time series showed significant breaks before 1982 in pe p and r over the period 1990 2000 p ndvi with the impoundment of the two large dams and after 2006 p based on these breakpoints the study period was divided into one baseline period 1965 1977 and three impacted periods 1978 1994 1995 2006 and 2007 2018 in the nakanbé watershed at wayen the period 1978 1994 was the driest and characterized by the highest aridity indexes fig 9 and lowest ndvi values fig 8 b the periods 1995 2006 and 2007 2018 compared to 1978 1994 were characterized by a decrease in the aridity index fig 9 b to d overall from 1965 to 2018 runoff has increased in all nested watersheds however over the period 1978 1994 runoff derived from the water balance exhibited a decrease compared to the period 1965 1977 in the sub watersheds of rambo 28 59 mm vs 41 82 mm and ramsa 38 26 mm vs 43 29 mm 4 2 separated and combined effects of climate and environmental changes on water resources in the nested watersheds of nakanbé based on the identified sub periods subsection 4 1 the elasticity and decomposition methods eq 4 and 5 were applied to quantify the contributions of each factor climate and environmental changes to runoff change the decomposition method made it possible to quantify the impacts of climate change ccde and human interferences h and the elasticity method developed in this study allowed the quantification of the impacts of cc cc ec ce and climate environment interaction cice the analysis of the results showed that h includes ce and cice fig 10 showed that elasticity and decomposition based methods gave similar results r2 0 99 in the following only the results based on the elasticity method are presented table 5 the elasticity coefficients analysis showed that runoff is more than twice as sensitive to environmental change ec than climate change cc the negative value of impact indicates a contribution in the opposite direction to the runoff variation the analysis of the individual and combined contributions of cc and ec to runoff changes showed that over the period 1978 1994 ec was the leading cause of the increased runoff at wayen yilou tempelga dombré and tougou in the ramsa and rambo watersheds the drought increased aridity was dominant and decreased the surface runoff from 1995 to 2018 the precipitation recovery contributed positively to the increase in runoff in all watersheds cc 0 and δr 0 during the period 1995 2006 the contribution of ec was the highest in all watersheds except ramsa and yilou in the ramsa watershed cc was the predominant factor while the climate environment interaction was the most important in the yilou watershed over the period 2007 2018 climate environment interaction has been the main factor causing the increase in surface runoff in four watersheds wayen yilou rambo and tougou against two for cc ramsa and dombré and one for ec tempelga between 1978 and 2018 the impact of climate environment interaction increased the seven nested nakanbé watersheds at wayen with surface ranging from 38 to 21 178 km2 were considered to assess the spatial scale effect fig 11 shows that the absolute value of the elasticity coefficient is proportional to the size of the watersheds however the low regression coefficients 5 10 5 for climate and 4 10 5 for the environment explain the non detection of a significant relationship between the impacts and the size of the watersheds 4 3 evolution of the state of nakanbé nested watersheds under the budyko framework from 1965 to 2018 fig 12 shows the evolution of the states of the seven nakanbé nested watersheds under the budyko framework and helps in understanding the effects of cc and ec on water resources table 5 according to wang and hejazi 2011 fig 12 a shows the impacts of possible watershed state shifts in the budyko framework a decrease or increase in aridity index implies the respectively positive or negative contribution of cc to runoff increase over the period 1978 1994 the increase in aridity index all the watersheds shifted to the right in fig 12 b to h justifies the negative contribution of cc to the increase in runoff the precipitation recovery all watersheds moved to the left in fig 12 b to h caused the positive contribution of cc to the increase in runoff since 1995 also fig 12 b to h shows that the nested watersheds located in the northwest ramsa rambo dombré and tougou have the lowest parameter w the northern part of the watershed is globally characterized by a very low vegetation cover fig 8 a and high aridity indexes fig 9 therefore it could be concluded that low vegetation cover coupled with a high aridity index lead to low w values in the budyko framework unilateral decrease increase in evaporative index translates into a decrease increase in the model parameter w leading to positive negative contribution of human interferences to runoff change respectively the decrease in vegetation can be caused by direct anthropogenic actions deforestation or by cc thus a change in w can be attributed to direct anthropogenic activities or climate environment interactions therefore the parameter w is a potential global environmental indicator including direct and indirect changes in the environment of the watershed being studied in the nested watersheds of the nakanbé river the transition from the baseline period 1965 1977 to the impacted periods 1978 1994 1995 2006 and 2007 2018 was characterized by fig 12 a continuous degradation translated by a decrease in the parameter w value from 1965 to 2018 in the wayen and yilou watersheds an improvement of environmental conditions increase in w from 1965 to 1977 followed by degradation decrease in w from 1978 to 2018 in the rambo sub watershed a degradation reduction in w from 1965 to 1977 and an improvement from 1995 to 2018 in the ramsa and dombré sub watersheds in the ramsa sub watershed w was relatively stable between 2 30 and 2 41 due to the opposite environmental dynamics of rambo and dombré sub watersheds it controls a mixed trend in the evolution of w in the tougou and tempelga sub watersheds therefore the evolution of the global environmental parameter w explains the estimated ec and climate environment interactions contributions to the runoff change table 5 according to the elasticity coefficients found in the nested watersheds of nakanbé environmental degradation leads to an increase in runoff while the increase in w leads to runoff decrease from 1965 to 2018 ec globally contributed positively to the increase in runoff due to environmental degradation since 1995 cc has contributed positively to runoff increase due to the precipitation recovery over the period 2007 2018 climate environment interaction has contributed most to the increase in runoff in most watersheds 4 out of 7 as compared to 2 for cc and 1 for ec from these results it appears that the first sahelian hydrological paradox the runoff increase despite precipitation decrease over 1978 1994 was caused by environmental degradation in contrast during the second paradox increase in runoff coefficients after the precipitation recovery despite the general re greening climate environment interaction was dominant 4 4 relationship between the parameter w and vegetation coverage m in nakanbé watershed the seven nested watersheds and 276 grids 8 km 8 km were used to look for a link between w and m over the period 1978 1994 specific values of w for watersheds and grids were obtained by forcing the budyko model of fu with aridity and evaporative indexes fig 13 illustrates the spatial variability of the parameter w in the nakanbé watershed at wayen fig 14 shows that a linear regression model between w and m is optimal and significant r2 0 53 p value 2 2 10 16 and is given by eq 9 9 w 6 27 m 0 98 the parameter w is positively correlated and proportional to the long term averaged annual vegetation coverage m fig 14 as also found by li et al 2013 in the nakanbé watershed at wayen the value w 7 25 was found for dense forests and w 0 98 for completely bare soils whereas in comparison with li et al 2013 these values were w 3 52 for dense forests and w 1 16 for bare soils the regression slope between w and m in nakanbé watershed 6 27 is higher than that obtained by li et al 2013 2 36 which means that for the same change in m the w in nakanbé watershed will vary by a factor of about 3 from that estimated by the regression model of li et al 2013 5 discussions and conclusion 5 1 impact of climate environment interaction on water resources in this study the difference between the total change in runoff and the contribution of climate change cc and environmental change ec was assumed to be the impact of climate environment interactions eq 5 the impacts study showed that fig 10 and table 5 the impact of human interference h quantified using budyko curve decomposition is the sum of the impacts of ec and climate environment interaction budyko curve decomposition and elasticity methods lead to similar results and from 1978 to 2018 the impact of the climate environment interaction increased although the impact of climate environment interaction calculated here could include uncertainties in estimating cc and ec impacts the values obtained allow us to assume that these uncertainties could not change the observed trends at a watershed scale cc can induce ec dearing 2006 gao et al 2014 thus the impact of climate environment interaction could be as a result of indirect feedback from the climate climate influences the environment which in turn affects the runoff in the west african sahel was the heavy nature of rainfall intensity plays a significant role in forming soil overcrusting which hampers infiltration and promotes runoff ribstein 1990 valentin 1985 valentin et al 2004 the increase in soil overcrusting in was descroix 2018 likely attributable to the increase in the intensity of extreme rainfall panthou et al 2018 2014 would be one of the major causes of the rise in the impact of climate environment interaction on runoff in nakanbé watershed at wayen therefore the effect of the climate environment interaction should be given much attention as in the face of climate change rainfall intensity is expected to increase in the was diedhiou et al 2018 5 2 towards a better understanding of the hydrological behavior of the nakanbé watershed the results obtained in this study highlighted that environmental change ec was the main driver of runoff change in the nested nakanbé watersheds at wayen from 1978 to 1994 however since 1995 the climate environment interaction has become increasingly prominent this result is expected to be the same throughout the west africa sahel was due to the high sensitivity of runoff to ec in arid zones fig 6 a to c in arid zones φ 2 runoff change is at least twice as sensitive to ec as climate change cc these findings quantitatively explain the causes of the two sahelian hydrological paradoxes dardel et al 2014 descroix et al 2018 the impact of precipitation change mainly determines the impact of cc on surface runoff as the elasticity coefficient of runoff to pe εpe is lower than that of p εp 1 εpe the analysis of the spatial variability of the impacts did not reveal any spatial organization the non detection of a significant trend between cc and ec contributions and watershed size is undoubtedly due to the size of the watersheds considered although the relationship between surface runoff and scale is already acknowledged to be complicated in the study area mounirou 2012 mounirou et al 2020 indeed pouyaud 1986 proposed that 30 000 km2 should be considered as a significant break surface in the analysis of the effect of spatial scale of cc and ec on surface runoff in the volta river watershed in burkina faso while the size of the watersheds in this study ranged from 38 to 21 178 km2 below 30 000 km2 the influence of cc especially precipitation is shadowed by that of ec especially the development of bare soils and crusting which are predominant in smaller watersheds in budyko type models the environmental dynamic is analyzed through the model parameter w in the fu equation as shown by li et al 2013 there is a good relationship between the vegetation coverage m and w in the nakanbé watershed at wayen but the regression coefficient is higher fig 14 the nakanbé watershed studied is located in an arid context with high values of w for the same given m in a wet context li et al 2019 the high variation observed between the regression coefficient obtained by li et al 2013 and that indicated by this study might be related to the under representation of arid watersheds in the work of li et al 2013 less than 10 it is therefore necessary to establish the relationship between w and m for each climatic zone the relationship obtained in this study is indicative of the nakanbé watershed at wayen and it might be necessary to integrate other watersheds before concluding at the full was scale from 1965 to 2018 the value of parameter w decreased in most of the nakanbé nested watersheds this evolution of w is consistent with the downward trend in the soil water holding capacity whc suggested in the nakanbé river watershed diello 2007 mahé et al 2005 paturel et al 2017 furthermore the factors influencing w and whc are the same climate and watershed characteristics albergel 1987 dunne and willmott 1996 jiang et al 2015 li et al 2013 mahé et al 2005 zhang et al 2019b the parameter w can therefore be compared to the whc of the watershed in the dombré sub watershed the parameter w increased from 1978 to 2018 despite the increase in the population density 98 156 hbts km2 from 1985 to 2006 see table 4 this observation is at par with the fact that beyond a certain population density an inverse process of environmental dynamics can be observed as in the population theory of boserup populations are forced to limit the area of cultivated land and to adopt improved agricultural techniques and shift to intensive agriculture geared towards productivity indeed several studies in different african territories showed that the increase in population density can lead to a virtuous agricultural intensification leading therefore to the improvement of soil fertility and the reduction of soil erosion and an increase in whc of soils demont and jouve 2000 descroix 2018 luxereau and roussel 1997 planel 2008 tiffen et al 1994 it is worth mentioning the case of m yacouba sawadogo right livelihood award 2018 known as the man who stopped the desert thor west et al 2020 between 1980 and 2018 he created a forest of about 40 ha from barren and abandoned land in gourga located in ouahigouya municipality in yatenga province northern burkina faso in the dombré sub watershed area this result was achieved through the implementation of the soil and water conservation technique called zaï which contributes to reducing runoff to promote infiltration supplying crops and mitigating dry spells nyamekye et al 2018 zouré et al 2019 water harvesting techniques have therefore enabled to increase whc of the soils in the dombré sub watershed thus the parameter w of the fu model is a good indicator of the spatio temporal variability of soil whc in the sahelian part of the nakanbé river watershed water holding capacity whc is an essential parameter in most hydrological models the whc data available to date are those given in the fao soil map fao 1981 fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2012 the fao soil map for the was is based on soil surveys and information gathered in the 1960s nachtergaele et al 2010 and therefore might be outdated the use of time varying values of soil whc can improve the performance of hydrological model applications in the was watersheds diello 2007 mahé et al 2005 paturel et al 2017 in the light of this study results the parameter w can therefore be used to provide time varying soil whc to this end according to the elasticity coefficient of runoff to environmental change table 5 the relationship between vegetation coverage m and the parameter w in the watershed of nakanbé at wayen eq 9 an increase in vegetation coverage m would lead to an increase in w by order of 1 45 1 80 and a decrease of runoff by order of 2 43 to 3 36 therefore the adoption of an adequate environmental management policy to promote environmental restoration might help in mitigating the increase in runoff coefficient which is reported to be the cause of significant flooding events throughout the was coulibaly et al 2020 nka et al 2015 sighomnou et al 2013 tazen et al 2019 6 conclusion this study focused on seven nested watersheds located in the sahel part of nakanbé river in burkina faso it aimed to identify a suitable budyko type model for arid contexts such as in west africa sahel was and to analyze the impacts of climate change cc environmental change ec and climate environment interaction on water resources in nakanbé watershed at wayen the budyko type model of fu was found to be appropriate through a sensitivity analysis therefore the isolated and combined impacts of cc and ec on runoff change were quantified based on elasticity and budyko curve decomposition methods from these results the evolution of the hydrological behavior of nakanbé watershed at wayen was assessed through the analysis of the spatio temporal variability of the parameter w from the fu model and its relationship with the vegetation coverage m our results confirmed that the nakanbé watershed at wayen had undergone the two sahelian hydrological paradoxes from 1965 to 2018 the runoff coefficient increased the runoff coefficient over the period 2007 2014 became 4 times higher than that of the period 1965 1977 the environmental conditions of the watershed area are characterized by low vegetation coverage albeit presenting a substantial variability the impact studies showed that elasticity and budyko curve decomposition methods gave similar results r2 0 99 the impact of human interferences quantified by the decomposition method includes the impacts of ec and climate environment interactions from 1978 to 1994 ec had been the main driver of runoff change in the nakanbé nested watersheds contribution reached 175 but climate environment interaction became increasingly predominant contribution reached 68 over the period 2007 2018 the analysis of the variability of the impacts did not reveal a significant trend between cc ec contributions and watershed size however in the nakanbé watershed at wayen there is a good and consistent relationship between the vegetation coverage m and the parameter w from 1965 to 2018 w decreased in all watersheds except in that of dombré possibly due to the long term implementation of water harvesting techniques which is effective in the increase of the soil water holding capacity whc therefore w appears to be a good indicator of the spatio temporal variability of the soils whc which could be used to generate time varying values of whc to improve the performance of hydrological models author contributions y patrick gbohoui conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing jean emmanuel
