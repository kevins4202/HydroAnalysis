17330,in freshwater systems sediment can be an important source for the internal loading of po4 the limiting character of this element in such system leads to consider this phenomenon in terms of eutrophication risks and water quality stakes a four months follow up january march april and may 2019 was carried out in a strong phosphate po4 limited secondary channel from an artificial irrigation system of charente maritime france to link the mobilization of remineralization products in the upper 6 cm layer of sediment conventional core slicing centrifugation and det probes and the phytoplankton biomass dynamics in the water column results showed congruent patterns between the temporal succession of the organic matter mineralization processes in the sediment and the primary biomass dynamics in the water column in january and march considered in winter po4 proved to be retained by adsorption onto iron oxides in anoxic sediment since pore water nitrate inhibited for about a month the respiration of metal oxides in the first cm of sediment thus limiting po4 availability and the phytoplankton growth in april and may early spring after exhaustion of pore water nitrate the dissolutive reduction of iron oxides released po4 into pore water generated a significant diffusive outgoing flux from the sediment to the water column with a maximum in april 1 10e 04 2 81e 05 nmol cm 2 s 1 this release coincided with the nanophytoplankton bloom 5 50 µg chla l 1 and a potential increase of po4 concentration in the water column this work provides some insight on the importance of benthic pelagic coupling in anthropogenic systems this conceptual model has to be deployed on other sites of interest where internal loading of p takes precedence over external inputs and nitrate mitigation drives its benthic recycling and ultimately its bioavailability this is to be essential to characterize the aquatic environment quality in order to limit eutrophication risks graphical

chmura et al 2003 sousa et al 2010 or water purification led by primary producers smith 2003 phytoplankton structure and dynamics has been well studied in both marine environments legendre and rassoulzadegan 1995 hlaili et al 2014 and freshwater ecosystems tortajada et al 2011 masclaux et al 2014 david et al 2020a b its development can depend on bottom up factors such as water temperature light penetration or nutrient availability reid et al 1990 and or top down factors such as grazing or parasitism reid et al 1990 lynn 2003 or macrophyte competition barrow et al 2019 the variations of the physical chemical parameters in the water column and their consequences on phytoplankton dynamics are well documented in marine coastal zones justić et al 1995 dupuy et al 2011 and continental freshwater environments soballe and kimmel 1987 søndergaard et al 2017 temporarily two blooms are generally mentioned in saline environments in early spring and late summer morais et al 2003 toompuu et al 2003 however little is known about marsh ecosystems research focusing on the variation of water column settings on these dynamics shows a close relation to physical and chemical parameters of the environment both in freshwater or brackish environments while the phytoplankton dynamics seems to depend less on the season in brackish environments but more on the renewal of water tortajada et al 2011 significant temporal succession has been highlighted in freshwater marshes masclaux et al 2014 by their position in the watershed marshes receive huge amounts of nutrients coming from the continent by soil leaching such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p essential for primary producers growth redfield 1958 søndergaard et al 2017 among these elements p is widely recognized as the principal factor of phytoplankton growth especially in freshwater systems schindler 1974 søndergaard et al 2000 kraal et al 2015 human activities can alter the growth limiting nutrients especially through wastewater or various surfaces runoff withers and jarvie 2008 and can cause eutrophication schindler 1974 smith 2003 the reduction of external growth limiting nutrients as p from shift in management framework would lead to an increase in the importance of sediment as an internal source perkins and underwood 2001 in some lowland river systems p released from organic matter om remineralization in the sediment may even be the main source of p in the water column van dael et al 2020 and thus for the phytoplankton productivity this loading from sediment could also determinate the p limitation in freshwater ecosystems such as lakes wu et al 2017 many techniques exist for calculating diffusive fluxes at the sediment water interface swi such as the in situ use of benthic chambers or ex situ measures through the use of fick s law grenz et al 1991 viollier et al 2003 the latter allow an evaluation of redox processes in the sediment through the modeling of sediment profiles grüneberg et al 2015 more recent techniques such as the use of 2d gel probes provide results flux and profile modeling with better vertical and horizontal resolution jézéquel et al 2007 santner et al 2015 thibault de chanvalon et al 2017 they make it possible to document the intense gradients that can be expected during p remobilization benthic phosphorus dynamics is well documented in both marine and freshwater systems boström et al 1988 caraco et al 1990 anschutz et al 1998 ekholm and lehtoranta 2012 and depends on the evolution of the oxide stocks in the sediment the iron cycle is of particular interest in understanding the phosphate po4 remobilization having the capacity of forming relatively stable fe ooh p complexes preventing its dissolution herzsprung et al 2010 the dynamics of elements interacting with the iron cycle in sediment and influencing its mobilization such as oxygen nitrates manganese and sulfur is therefore a major issue in understanding the mechanisms governing the release of po4 into the water column borggaard et al 1990 caraco et al 1990 herzsprung et al 2010 xiao et al 2015 vertical oxidant successions in the first stages of biotic om mineralization in sediment called early diagenesis are well known in marine environments froelich et al 1979 aller 2004 however temporal succession of these processes is poorly documented thibault de chanvalon et al 2016 moreover retrospective reports on the response of pelagic nutrient and biota are quite frequent jeppesen et al 2005 welch and cooke 2005 but rarely combined with the in situ sediment analysis grüneberg et al 2015 liu et al 2016 the high productivity of the marans site already observed despite the strong p limitation masclaux et al 2014 testifies to the importance of internal p recycling in this system the objective of this study is to propose for the first time an interdisciplinary seasonal benthos pelagos in situ monitoring in a strong p limited coastal freshwater marsh it is of interest to target such p limited site as environmental policies focuses on limiting p release into natural aquatic systems which consequence is the increase of water bodies characterized by high n p ratios the main hypothesis of this work lies on the importance of temporal variation of benthic mineralization processes for the phytoplankton development through generated nutrient fluxes at the swi benthos pelagos coupling was assessed through a combined ecological and biogeochemical approach with temporal phytoplankton biomass measurements and nutrient and metal oxides profiling diffusive fluxes were obtained from porewater chemical gradients from core slicing 0 5 cm resolution and 2d det gel deployment submillimeter resolution 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the charente maritime marshes french atlantic west coast present a high diversity of freshwater marsh types differing by their locality their role and the way they are managed a eutrophic freshwater marsh based on tortajada classification 2011 used for anthropogenic activities e g field irrigation was chosen to carry out this work among the artificial hydrographic networks the study site took place in a secondary channel of the sèvre niortaise river marshes 46 282 0 969 located closed to the commune of marans fig s1 as supplementary material the station is surrounded by crops and cattle lands and the management i e replenishment drainage and dredging is provided by a trade union association 2 2 sampling strategy and parameters studied the sediment and the water column compartments were sampled simultaneously and monthly from winter to early spring 2019 the sampling campaigns were realized in january the 30th march the 5th april the 2nd and may the 1st 2 2 1 water column 2 2 1 1 abiotic parameters at each campaign in situ temperature salinity and oxygen concentration in the water column were measured with multiparametric sensors vwr in addition these three parameters were monitored continuously one measurement per 15 min between january the 30th and may the 1st with hobo u 26 sensor 2 2 1 2 phytoplankton compartment a volume of 15 l of surface water was collected for the phytoplankton sampling in the middle of the channel the chlorophyll a biomass chla was evaluated for three size classes of phytoplankton micro 20 µm nano 3 to 20 µm and picophytoplankton 3 µm filters made in triplicate 20 µm 3 µm and 0 7 µm were used to separate the 3 different size fractions by fractional filtration the biomass of chla of each size class was determined by fluorimetry according to the yentsch and menzel method 1963 2 2 2 sediment compartment 2 2 2 1 core sampling and processing four cylindrical cores were collected using pvc tubes 8 2 cm diameter 20 cm long with taking care to keep a water thickness of at least 5 cm above the sediment to preserve the sediment water interface and for bottom water chemistry three cores were sliced every 5 mm to a depth of 6 cm i e 12 layers under nitrogen atmosphere porewater was extracted from each sediment layer by centrifugation 20 min at 2 700 g and at in situ temperature then filtered through 0 2 µm filters overlying and pore waters were conserved at 20 c for nutrients analyses an aliquot was conserved at 5 c for silica analysis in both bottom and pore waters aliquots were immediately used for alkalinity measurement and hno3 acidification 0 01 mol l 1 suprapur merck for metal analysis nutrients i e nitrates no3 nitrites no2 soluble reactive phosphorus srp ammonium nh3 and silica si concentrations were determined by a colorimetric autoanalyser scalar seal whit a detection limit of 0 02 µmol l 1 the acidified aliquot was analyzed by icp aes thermo scientific icap 6300 radial to measure dissolved iron fed manganese mnd and sulfur sd alkalinity was determined according to the colorimetric sarazin et al 1999 method absorbance measurements were carried out with a spectrophotomer spectrostar nano bmg labtech the remaining sediment from centrifugation was then frozen at 20 c samples were freeze dried and manually grounded for solid phase analyses once the samples have been reweighed the porosity was determined for use in fluxes modeling see next section an aliquot 100 mg was used for the ascorbate extraction of reactive manganese mn3 and mn4 iron amorphous fe3 and p according to the method used in kostka and luther 1994 and anschutz et al 1998 2 2 2 2 high resolution methods microprofiling a core was placed in an aquarium thermoregulated at the in situ temperature and air was injected at the overlying water to maintain o2 saturation and keep a thin benthic boundary layer oxygen was analysed with clark type electrodes 50 µm tip diameter revsbech 1989 connected to a unisense multimeter and a motorized vertical micromanipulator a two point calibration was made from saturated overlying water and anoxic sediment 2d det probes in april two supplementary cores were collected for a 2d det probes deployment this method uses a diffusive equilibrium in thin films det probe davison et al 1991 coupled with a colorimetric technique to visualize in two dimensions the repartition of dissolved nitrite iron and p concentrations along the core jézéquel et al 2007 pagès et al 2011 metzger et al 2016 firstly a det gel probe which samples the dissolved chemical species from the pore water at high resolution fixed to a plexiglas plate was introduced into the sediment core this probe was made of a 185 mm 125 mm 0 8 mm polyacrylamide thin film krom et al 1994 laid on an acrylic support and a pvdf porous 0 2 µm membrane that maintained and protected the gel in order to minimize lateral heterogeneity for a single support 2 gels were placed back to back to make a double faced probe the first probe had a gel dedicated to nitrite and another to iron the second had a probe dedicated to p the other to iron after 5 hours equilibrium time gel probes were quickly processed to minimize lateral diffusion within the sampling gel and subsequent loss of 2d resolution it consisted in superimposing each gel into a specific reagent gel previously equilibrated with no2 po4 and fe colorimetric reagents griess molybdate ferrozine reagents see references cited above twenty minutes after contact a picture was taken with a standard scanner images were analyzed by densitometry of different rgb spectral bandwidths using imagej software the iron was treated in the blue channel this channel was chosen despite its lower sensibility compared to the green one in order to avoid saturation range between 0 and 500 µmol l 1 for the blue channel between 0 and 200 µmol l 1 for the green one phosphates and nitrites were analyzed in the red and green channel respectively 2 2 2 3 diffusive fluxes modeling no3 no2 ʃnh3 srp si fed and oxygen o2 diffusive fluxes at the swi were determined using the profile software berg et al 1998 based on a transport reaction model this software allowed to describe the sedimentary column as a succession of layers with a specific reaction rate for a dissolved chemical species and the fluxes above and below that sediment column modeling vertical domain this work focused on the vertical diffusion and the transport was assumed to be dominated by molecular diffusion without bioturbation as described in lewandowski et al 2002 since the sediment is impermeable silt clay the flux f was calculated at the swi thanks the fick law as 1 f ϕ d s d c d z with the sediment porosity ds the diffusion coefficient c the element concentration and z the depth of calculation in profile ds was calculated using rasmussen and jorgensen 1992 as below 2 d s d 1 3 1 ϕ diffusion coefficient d was determined with previous studies varying with temperature o2 fluxes modeling were made using data from microprofiling d was taken from the unisense gas table the no3 no2 ʃnh3 and srp coefficient diffusion were taken from li and gregory 1974 and the si one from rebreanu et al 2008 modeling was based on data from the core slicing and 2d det profiles in case of too few points with quantified concentrations a linear model was used to calculate the flux manually boudreau 1997 using the formula 1 and ds as 3 d s d 1 ln φ 2 in this work the negative flux values corresponded to fluxes leaving the sediment the positive values to fluxes entering the sediment o2 no3 ʃnh3 and si fluxes were calculated through profiles obtained with the core slicing method no2 srp and fe fluxes were calculated through both core slicing method profiles and 2d det probes the fluxes calculated from the 2d det probes represented the width integrated average fluxes of the gel at three interfaces positioning 0 swi swi 1 mm and swi 1 mm the flux was modeled from the mean concentrations per gel line the overlying water was not used for the calculation of the gradients at the interface because of the very strong chemical gradients near the diffusive boundary layer dbl and not reflecting its chemical properties 2 3 statistical tests all statistical tests were made with the software r studio 1 2 1335 analyses of variance anova and tuckey post hoc tests threshold α 0 05 were made to determinate significant differences between replicates to respect the validity of this statistical test data could be log transformed if residuals did not followed normality kruskal wallis and wilcoxon post hoc tests were made 3 results 3 1 physical chemical parameters of the water column temperature increased regularly between the end of january and may rising from 8 c to 15 c on average in the channel fig 1 discrete sampling points indicated measured with wtw sensor 7 5 10 14 and 14 c for january march april and may respectively conductivity was relatively stable around 850 µs cm 1 which represents a salinity around 0 5 dissolved oxygen increased between late january and late february approximately 5 to 17 mg l 1 from april to may it decreased on average from about 17 to 10 mg l 1 discrete sampling indicated subsequently 9 11 14 5 and 11 3 mg l 1 for january march april and may respectively nitrogen was mainly represented by no3 with the highest concentration 668 µmol l 1 observed in march tuckey test f 3 7 58 p 0 05 table 1 no2 concentration was the highest in april 20 43 µmol l 1 tuckey test f 3 14 06 p 0 05 ʃnh3 concentration was higher in april 79 µmol l 1 than those of january and march kruskal wallis test χ2 3 8 66 p 0 05 srp increased over time from 0 00 to 0 37 µmol l 1 in march and may respectively however no significant differences were noted despite the increase kruskal wallis test χ2 3 5 64 p 0 05 finally si concentration in april 154 µmol l 1 was higher than for march kruskal wallis test χ2 3 3 17 p 0 05 according to redfield ratio calculations fig s2 as supplementary material the study site was only phosphate limited for planktonic primary producers all along the survey 3 2 phytoplankton dynamics from january to march the phytoplankton biomass was between 1 and 3 4 µg chla l 1 depending on the size class and dominated by the microphytoplankton fig 2 however no significant difference was observed between the three size classes neither in january anova f 2 1 21 p 0 05 nor in march anova f 2 3 55 p 0 05 in april a significant nanophytoplankton development was observed with 5 5 µg chla l 1 tuckey post hoc test p 0 001 a similar pattern was observed in may with a dominant nanophytoplankton biomass four times higher than that of the other two size classes 4 and 1 µg chla l 1 respectively tuckey post hoc test p 0 001 within each size class the april nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton biomasses 5 and 3 µg chla l 1 respectively were higher than in january march and may tuckey post hoc test p 0 03 and p 0 001 respectively 3 3 sediment geochemistry in late january no3 mean concentration was around 200 µmol l 1 with high spatial variability between 0 and 2 cm depth and decreased sharply to reach about 5 µmol l 1 at 3 5 cm depth fig 3 same pattern was observed for no2 with a maximum mean concentration in the top layer 43 µmol l 1 which decreased rapidly to reach the detection limit at 3 5 cm depth early in march only the first sediment layer showed detectable nitrate and nitrite with 37 and 6 µmol l 1 respectively then no sample showed detectable concentrations mnasc showed a maximum concentration in late january in the first layer of sediment 3 2 mmol kg 1 and remained constant downwards at 1 5 mmol kg 1 for march april and may values ranged between 1 0 to 1 5 mmol kg 1 mnd presented a linear increase along the core in january april and may between 1 and 60 µmol kg 1 a peak was observed in march between 0 and 3 cm with a maximum of 35 µmol kg 1 feasc was higher in january and may around 25 mmol kg 1 and lower in march and april around 20 mmol kg 1 until 4 cm depth in late january fed was near the detection limit from 0 to 5 cm and in march a first peak was observed at 1 5 cm 47 µmol kg 1 at the same depth as the manganese one in april a strong mobilization was detected between the surface and 4 cm deep with a peak of 152 µmol kg 1 it then increased to 238 µmol kg 1 in the deepest layers in may at the same depth dissolved iron peaked at 70 µmol kg 1 to then reach 232 µmol kg 1 at 6 cm depth in april and may fed increased from 4 to 3 cm depth respectively to reach more than 200 µmol l 1 at the core bottom pasc ranged between 4 and 5 mmol kg 1 in january march and may without any real trend with depth it was higher in april to reach between 5 and 6 mmol kg 1 srp was under detection limit in january a first peak of 3 µmol l 1 appeared at 1 5 cm depth in march concomitant with manganese and the first iron peak to increase in april with a strong mobilization in the first 2 cm with a maximum of 32 µmol l 1 in may a weaker and deeper peak was observed 3 cm depth 22 µmol l 1 these two peaks seemed to coincide with the globally increase of dissolved iron mobilization in the first 4 cm of sediment especially in april sulfate profiles showed generally increasing concentrations with depth with the highest concentrations observed in january 2 to 8 mmol kg 1 at surface and depth respectively in march april and may concentrations ranged from about 0 5 mmol kg 1 at the surface to 3 mmol kg 1 at depth concentrations in april were the lowest and showed the smallest gradient between 0 5 and 1 5 mmol kg 1 along the sediment for both january and march ʃnh3 concentrations ranged from nearly 50 µmol l 1 to 130 µmol l 1 between top layer and 6 cm deep respectively with a slight increase in the last centimeter ʃnh3 concentrations in april and may were about 4 times higher than those obtained in winter in the surface layer 193 and 175 µmol l 1 respectively and presented a maximum peak in may at 3 cm depth to reach 439 µmol l 1 si had the same vertical trend for every month with a slightly increasing concentration along both the core column and time maxima observed were at around 5 cm depth with 411 496 583 and 682 µmol l 1 for january march april and may respectively the alkalinity increased over months and was positively correlated with ʃnh3 concentration in porewater p 0 001 r2 0 76 in january it ranged between 6 5 and 7 7 mmol kg 1 at the surface and core bottom layer respectively with a slight increase in the last centimeter it then increased from marsh between 7 0 and 8 9 mmol kg 1 to april between 10 5 and 13 5 mmol kg 1 the 2d representation of dissolved iron nitrite and srp in the sediment pore water was made in april fig 4 both iron gels probe 1 and 2 showed an increasing concentration with depth fig 4 with mobilization starting at nearly 0 5 cm below the swi and increased sharply from 15 to 170 µmol l 1 at 1 5 cm depth for probe 1 and from 30 to 170 µmol l 1 at 2 5 cm depth for probe 2 the concentrations then increased slightly to reach a maximum of 290 µmol l 1 and 240 µmol l 1 at 12 cm deep for probe 1 and probe 2 respectively on probe 1 nitrite was only present in a thin layer between the swi and 1 cm depth maximum concentrations of about 65 µmol l 1 the average srp probe 2 presented a strong mobilization between 1 and 6 cm with a maximum concentration about 90 µmol l 1 the lateral heterogeneity was more pronounced on probe 1 e g fed depleted and no2 rich zones between 5 9 cm and 0 2 cm depth respectively on a 2 cm width the feasc pasc ratio is an interesting indicator to understand the effects of the adsorption site saturation on the remobilization of p in the porewater anschutz et al 1998 thibault de chanvalon et al 2016 between 1 and 5 cm deep in january and may feasc pasc ratio was quite similar around 6 fig 5 in march and april this ratio was lower around 5 and 4 respectively 3 4 benthic fluxes and high spatial resolution consideration incoming oxygen fluxes were observed around 10 2 nmol cm 2 s 1 with maximum fluxes in may significantly higher than those of march kruskal wallis test χ2 3 12 19 p 0 03 the nitrogen nutrient fluxes were most heterogeneous recording ingoing and outgoing fluxes depending on the element studied ingoing no3 and no2 fluxes were observed for each date with a significantly higher flux in january 4 53e 03 nmol cm 2 s 1 tuckey test f 3 6 48 p 0 05 and 5 06e 04 nmol cm 2 s 1 tuckey test f 3 5 87 p 0 05 for no3 and no2 respectively lastly ʃnh3 fluxes tended to be outgoing for each date no significant differences were noted between dates kruskal wallis test χ2 3 4 59 p 0 20 a slight srp influx in january and efflux between march and may was observed the outgoing flux in april 1 10e 04 nmol cm 2 s 1 was significantly higher and 10 times greater compared to ones in march tuckey test f 3 12 51 p 0 005 the si fluxes showed an outgoing flux for each date no significant differences were noted tuckey test f 3 2 06 p 0 18 finally the iron flowed out regardless of the date the february flux 2 10e 06 nmol cm 2 s 1 was significantly lower than those of march april and may tuckey test f 3 10 38 p 0 05 the fluxes calculations via the modeling of 2d gel concentrations showed the impact of the core scale heterogeneity on the fluxes and the importance of interface positioning table 3 at the 0 interface no2 and srp presented an incoming flux of the order of 10 5 and 10 6 µmol cm 2 s 1 respectively a fed efflux was observed around 2e 04 nmol cm 2 s 1 the change in the interface positioning generated variability in flux directions for no2 a 1 mm positioning generated a mean outgoing 10 5 µmol cm 2 s 1 and incoming 10 4 µmol cm 2 s 1 flux respectively for srp these two positions produced an outgoing flux of the same magnitude order 10 5 µmol cm 2 s 1 only the averaged iron fluxes were always outgoing whatever the interface considered which showed a better homogeneity in the upper part of the gel 4 discussion 4 1 phytoplankton dynamics and nutrients availability the phytoplanktonic dynamics observed at marans can be qualified as relatively classic for a freshwater system tortajada et al 2011 a poor development in winter regardless of the size classes was explained by the unfavorable physical conditions low temperature and probably luminosity despite huge nitrates values in march table 1 probably coming from near agricultural soil leaching tortajada et al 2011 the nanophytoplankton bloom observed in april could be attributed to much more favorable physical conditions increase in temperature and probably luminosity but also in nutrient charging of the system and especially in dissolved phosphorus see below for link benthos pelagos coupling as strong limiting factor kraal et al 2015 horppila 2019 these very weak concentrations of srp not exceeding 0 4 µmol l 1 were of the same magnitude order as those measured in the work of david et al 2020a in a comparable environment such weak concentration could suggest a constant upstream to downstream flow of water preventing its accumulation or a rapid withdrawal by autotrophic organisms masclaux et al 2014 the p limitation at marans could induce competition between different phytoplanktonic communities the high surface area volume ratio and the active metabolism of nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton make them more efficient to uptake nutrients than larger cells microphytoplankton legendre et rasoulzadegan 1995 masclaux et al 2014 which could explain the dominance of nanophytoplankton at early spring in this study however these dynamics over time was not entirely consistent to those observed in comparable systems if a slight spring development of nano microphytoplankton was observed in david et al 2020a the real difference appeared to occur in march when a strong microphytoplankton development has been observed in other works in addition to the pico nanophytoplankton masclaux et al 2014 the absence of such a development in this work would suggest that a possible bloom took place between sampling dates in line with the potential fast phytoplankton response to environmental changes thyssen et al 2008 indeed the decrease of nitrate in the water column from march to may 668 to 371 µmol l 1 as well as the increase of the dissolved o2 concentration fig 1 could indicate a nutrient uptake by primary producers as observed in april that would have started before masclaux et al 2014 moreover p limitation in marans did not allow a strong development with regard to the redfield ratio justić et al 1995 but shift in such limitation could be possible attributed to the endogenous recycling of p wu et al 2017 through diagenetic processes 4 2 temporal succession of dominant diagenetic processes 4 2 1 initial condition winter situation the high no3 concentration in the water column and the high no3 no2 concentration in january between the interface and 3 cm depth suggested water column as the main nitrate source for the sediment rather than nitrification in the sediment of low nitrate environments middelburg et al 1996 the strong no3 no2 gradient in these sediment layers fig 3 led to consider denitrification as the main process for nitrogen removal since the only slight reduction to ammonia dnra occur in the sediment binnerup et al 1992 rysgaard et al 1993 here denitrification appeared to indirectly inhibit the srp remobilization by inhibiting the reduction of iron oxides wauer et al 2005 petzoldt and uhlmann 2006 schauser et al 2006 grüneberg et al 2015 whereas mn and fe cycles quickly dominated early diagenetic processes in coastal marine sediment pastor et al 2018 indeed the only trace state presence of srp congruent with the non detection of fed and the relatively large stock of iron oxide along the profile fig 3 suggested a low iron oxide reactivity the high no3 concentration in the surficial sediment in winter plus the probable thin oxic layer could promote iron oxidation and explain the maximum feasc values and the mnasc peak at the sediment surface fig 3 hansen et al 2003 burgin et al 2011 these high oxides concentrations allow a great amount of adsorption sites for po4 which would be immediately uptaken during om mineralization the deeper feasc values could be explained by a ferrous fraction fe2 associated with iron monosulphide kostka and luther 1994 anschutz et al 1999 the constant increasing gradient of mnd could be generated by dissolutive manganese reduction during om mineralization following the appearance of favourable redox conditions another possible source of dissolved manganese could be the reduction of manganese oxides by reduced iron diffusion from a deeper source moreover the concomitant low pasc fig 3 and low srp values in january could suggest that mineralization was still low at this time of the year moreover in considering ʃnh3 and alkalinity in porewater as a tracer of anaerobic mineralization processes their slight increase in the last cm seemed to indicate the occurrence of such processes under the sampling area fig 3 4 2 2 spring time evolution in march the slight presence of nitrate and nitrite in sediment surface indicated that the denitrification became shallower overlying waters were more concentrated table 1 probably due to inputs from watershed suggesting that denitrification was relatively fast limiting diffusion of nitrate and nitrite downwards moreover the non accumulation of ʃnh3 between january and march fig 3 would be consistent with annamox reaction for the nitrogen removal possible as long as no3 was not totally depleted canfield et al 1993 however weak gradients of ʃnh3 in the surficial sediment made this hypothesis unlikely the peak of mnd also suggested a consumption of manganese oxides for mineralization of om in the first 3 cm fig 3 as evidenced by the decrease in mnasc at the surface between january and march which could lead to the first remobilization of phosphorus explained by the slight peak of srp at 1 5 cm depth the presence of a first fe dissolved peak concurrent to the dissolved mn one also suggested the beginning of the consumption of fe3 hydroxides as a terminal electron acceptor for the degradation of om this seemed to be consistent with the decrease of feasc in the sediment at that time this decrease could also be attributed to the non efficient fe2 reoxidation due to the absence of no3 and the thin oxic layer the quantities of oxides were certainly still too high to permit a significant diffusive p flux into water column table 2 as shown by the high ratio feasc pasc fig 5 and the rather weak mineralization the total depletion of nitrate and nitrite in the sediment from april fig 3 and the increase in temperature fig 1 were favourable factors for triggering the chemical and microbial reduction of iron hydroxides jensen et al 1995 as om mineralization pathway the sharp increase in fed in the porewaters within the first 4 cm in april and the second peak in the first 3 cm in may was an evidence of the iron oxides consumption fig 3 as a result the phosphate sorbed onto iron hydroxides was released into interstitial waters and seemed to be the main route for srp mobilization rather than the dissimilatory sulfate reduction observed in estuarine systems pan et al 2020 the phosphate mobilization attributed to the 4 first cm in spring was the highest and most superficial in april according to pasc diminution in the first cm fig 3 a significant srp efflux was observed at that time table 2 2d gels realization in april allowed to validate and strengthen the link between iron and p cycle observed via core slicing profile within the upper part of the sediment in marans fig 4 pan et al 2019 moreover the overall trend of fed to increase in depth as for mnd suggested more favourable redox conditions for the om mineralization via the iron reduction route the om mineralization could also be identified via the sharp increase in alkalinity sholkovitz 1973 and mineralization products in sediment porewaters ʃnh3 si until may fig 3 the maximum concentrations of pasc in april fig 3 could be explained by srp sorption on the hydroxides during their diffusion throughout the sediment the minimum feasc pasc ratio fig 5 following the consumption of metal oxides could indicate a kind of saturation of the fe adsorption sites with respect to p anschutz et al 1998 the excess in mobilization of srp in the upper part of the sediment could explain the diffusive flux into the water column in april and may table 2 however an feasc pasc ratio 2 showed the non sufficiency of feooh to prevent the diffusion of p into the water column in lake systems gächter and müller 2003 the constant feasc pasc 3 in this work could suggest the existence of another phase that precipitates with fe3 such as fesx which could be consistent with the potential sulfate reduction supposed by the decrease of soluble sulfur compounds over time fig 3 the increasing of fed in depth in april and may figs 3 4 could be coming from the fe2 resolubilisation following abiotic reduction between s2 and a fe3 source or fesx dissolution johnston et al 2014 below the iron hydroxide respiration zone the increase of feasc concentrations in may in the first 3 cm may also suggest a highly crystallised ferric form that would not react with p and thus explain the non correlation between feasc and pasc in this sediment layer on this assumption the probable non saturation of the surface sites of iron oxides by phosphate ions high feasc pasc ratio could allow fe3 to recrystallize anschutz et al 1998 and explained the slight srp efflux observed in may table 2 moreover the more important residence time of dissolved p compared to fed in sediment could explain this feasc pasc phase shifting in may millero et al 1987 neupane et al 2014 giles et al 2016 smolders et al 2017 ding et al 2018 and favor p mobilization thibault de chanvalon et al 2016 the chemical species distribution presented vertical and horizontal heterogeneity at centimeter scale and could make difficult the interpretation of their layering in the sediment column this heterogeneity could be directly observed through 2d det probes especially concerning iron and nitrite gels fig 4 these distributions can be impaired by macroorganisms burrows or root systems in the sediment which can strongly influence its geochemistry by promoting o2 and nitrate inputs christensen et al 1997 frederiksen and glud 2006 cesbron et al 2014 aller et al 2019 or impacting the vertical and horizontal distribution of solids thibault de chanvalon et al 2016 such heterogeneity is also evidenced at the station scale by the variability between core triplicates 4 3 sediment and biochemical parameters retroaction of the water column the flux directions from profiles out of the core slicing method were relatively consistent with the surface gradients observed via mean nutrient profiles in the sediment indicating a good fit between actual and modelled data the high resolution method tends to decrease fluxes by reducing the chemical gradients at the interface table 3 the heterogeneity in chemical species distribution evidenced on the nitrite gel fig 4 makes the placement of the interface critical and explains the flux variations on a small scale table 3 the no3 increase in the water column in march in spite of its ingoing flux toward sediment seemed to be largely explained by allochthonous inputs the influx in april and may could be in part explained by large nitrogen demand for denitrification in the upper layers of the sediment in winter with regard to the degradation products of om the permanent ʃnh3 outflows coincided with the progressive loading of the water column until april the reverse of this trend in may despite the strong remobilization of ammonium at depth and the not significant increase in srp in the water column despite the srp efflux in march and april could reflect a vegetation pumping of ammonium and p explaining the downward shift of the p peak during this period fig 3 or even primary producer bloom sand jensen and borum 1991 rozan et al 2002 moreover forms of water stratification which can exist in pounds or even marshes condie and webster 2001 chimney et al 2006 could counteract the link between fluxes at the interface and water column response especially through the phosphate availability crockford et al 2015 however the shallow depth of the marshes the site s windward catch and the variations in water level caused by management of marsh water may favor the mixing and thus allow efficient nutrient accessibility throughout the water column however this work strongly suggested the link between the outflow of srp and the triggering of the nanophytoplankton development in april by reducing p limitation of this system in addition to the physical parameters being favorable to such development it highlighted the link between phytoplankton dynamics and mineralization processes by showing congruence between temporal patterns of benthic srp regeneration and small phytoplanktonic cells i e nano picophytoplankton development indeed the evolution of n p ratios strongly suggests a prevalence of internal recycling of p rather than external input for the development of phytoplankton although temporal patterns between benthic regeneration and planktonic production have potentially been shown in coastal environments kemp and boyton 1984 cowan and boyton 1996 the high nitrate content at marans influenced the dynamics of this system both at the sediment compartment and the water column scale which could decrease benthos pelagos interactions kelly et al 1985 indeed denitrification processes inhibited for about a month the respiration of metal oxides and thus the potential release of srp into the water column this phenomenon suggested a completely different behavior of the sediment compartment in lower nitrate systems and therefore a different response of the chemical and biological parameters of the water column however the conceptual model presented in this work could be deployed in other sites of interest in order to propose new tools for observatories to characterize the aquatic environment quality and predict future trends 5 conclusions and perspectives the strong phosphate limitation and huge nitrogen content in water column suggested a high nitrate control on the temporal patterns of diagenetic processes and phytoplankton development denitrification processes inhibited phosphates mobilization in winter by preventing iron hydroxide reduction and seemed to be the main route for nitrogen removal in the sediment depletion in nitrates in the sediment from early spring triggered iron hydroxide respiration and phosphate mobilization on the upper part of the sediment a significant phosphate efflux was observed in april congruent with nanophytoplankton development the multiscale heterogeneity on chemical species distribution highlighted the importance of biotic parameters on the distribution and mobilization of such species in the sediment the complexity in evaluating nutrient flux feedback on the water column leads to the necessity of a better understanding of the nutrient catchment control by autotrophs an annual monitoring in such anthropogenic environment duplicated on less nitrate rich systems would provide a broader view of the importance and

17330,in freshwater systems sediment can be an important source for the internal loading of po4 the limiting character of this element in such system leads to consider this phenomenon in terms of eutrophication risks and water quality stakes a four months follow up january march april and may 2019 was carried out in a strong phosphate po4 limited secondary channel from an artificial irrigation system of charente maritime france to link the mobilization of remineralization products in the upper 6 cm layer of sediment conventional core slicing centrifugation and det probes and the phytoplankton biomass dynamics in the water column results showed congruent patterns between the temporal succession of the organic matter mineralization processes in the sediment and the primary biomass dynamics in the water column in january and march considered in winter po4 proved to be retained by adsorption onto iron oxides in anoxic sediment since pore water nitrate inhibited for about a month the respiration of metal oxides in the first cm of sediment thus limiting po4 availability and the phytoplankton growth in april and may early spring after exhaustion of pore water nitrate the dissolutive reduction of iron oxides released po4 into pore water generated a significant diffusive outgoing flux from the sediment to the water column with a maximum in april 1 10e 04 2 81e 05 nmol cm 2 s 1 this release coincided with the nanophytoplankton bloom 5 50 µg chla l 1 and a potential increase of po4 concentration in the water column this work provides some insight on the importance of benthic pelagic coupling in anthropogenic systems this conceptual model has to be deployed on other sites of interest where internal loading of p takes precedence over external inputs and nitrate mitigation drives its benthic recycling and ultimately its bioavailability this is to be essential to characterize the aquatic environment quality in order to limit eutrophication risks graphical

freshwater environments soballe and kimmel 1987 søndergaard et al 2017 temporarily two blooms are generally mentioned in saline environments in early spring and late summer morais et al 2003 toompuu et al 2003 however little is known about marsh ecosystems research focusing on the variation of water column settings on these dynamics shows a close relation to physical and chemical parameters of the environment both in freshwater or brackish environments while the phytoplankton dynamics seems to depend less on the season in brackish environments but more on the renewal of water tortajada et

factor of phytoplankton growth especially in freshwater systems schindler 1974 søndergaard et al 2000 kraal et al 2015 human activities can alter the growth limiting nutrients especially through wastewater or various surfaces runoff withers and jarvie 2008 and can cause eutrophication schindler 1974 smith 2003 the reduction of external growth limiting nutrients as p from shift in management framework would lead to an increase in the importance of sediment as an internal source perkins and underwood 2001 in some lowland river systems p released from organic matter om remineralization in the sediment may even be the main source of p in the water column van dael et al 2020 and thus for the phytoplankton productivity this loading from sediment could also determinate the p limitation in freshwater ecosystems such as lakes wu et al 2017 many techniques exist for calculating diffusive fluxes at the sediment water interface swi such as the in situ use of benthic chambers or ex situ measures through the use of fick s law grenz et al 1991 viollier et al 2003 the latter allow an evaluation of redox processes in the sediment through the modeling of sediment profiles grüneberg et al 2015 more recent techniques such as the use of 2d gel probes provide results flux and profile modeling with better vertical and horizontal resolution jézéquel et al 2007 santner et al 2015 thibault de chanvalon et al 2017 they make it possible to document the intense gradients that can be expected during p remobilization benthic phosphorus dynamics is well documented in both marine and freshwater systems boström et al 1988 caraco et al 1990 anschutz et al 1998 ekholm and lehtoranta 2012 and depends on the evolution of the oxide stocks in the sediment the iron cycle is of particular interest in understanding the phosphate po4 remobilization having the capacity of forming relatively stable fe ooh p complexes preventing its dissolution herzsprung et al 2010 the dynamics of elements interacting with the iron cycle in sediment and influencing its mobilization such as oxygen nitrates manganese and sulfur is therefore a major issue in understanding the mechanisms governing the release of po4

diagenesis are well known in marine environments froelich et al 1979 aller 2004 however temporal succession of these processes is poorly documented thibault de chanvalon et al 2016 moreover retrospective reports on the response of pelagic nutrient and biota are quite frequent jeppesen et al 2005 welch and cooke 2005 but rarely combined with the in situ sediment analysis grüneberg et al 2015 liu et al 2016 the high productivity of the marans site already observed despite the strong p limitation masclaux et al 2014 testifies to the importance of internal p recycling in this system the objective of this study is to propose for the first time an interdisciplinary seasonal benthos pelagos in situ monitoring in a strong p limited coastal freshwater marsh it is of interest to target such p limited site as environmental policies focuses on limiting p release into natural aquatic systems which consequence is the increase of water bodies characterized by high n p ratios the main hypothesis of this work lies on the importance of temporal variation of benthic mineralization processes for the phytoplankton development through generated nutrient fluxes at the swi benthos pelagos coupling was assessed through a combined ecological and biogeochemical approach with temporal phytoplankton biomass measurements and nutrient and metal oxides profiling diffusive fluxes were obtained from porewater chemical gradients from core slicing 0 5 cm resolution and 2d det gel deployment submillimeter resolution 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the charente maritime marshes french atlantic west coast present a high diversity of freshwater marsh types differing by their locality their role and the way they are managed a eutrophic freshwater marsh based on tortajada classification 2011 used for anthropogenic activities e g field irrigation was chosen to carry out this work among the artificial hydrographic networks the study site took place in a secondary channel of the sèvre niortaise river marshes 46 282 0 969 located closed to the commune of marans fig s1 as supplementary material the station is surrounded by crops and cattle lands and the management i e replenishment drainage and dredging is provided by a trade union association 2 2 sampling strategy and parameters studied the sediment and the water column compartments were sampled simultaneously and monthly from winter to early spring 2019 the sampling campaigns were realized in january the 30th march the 5th april the 2nd and may the 1st 2 2 1 water column 2 2 1 1 abiotic parameters at each campaign in situ temperature salinity and oxygen concentration in the water column were measured with multiparametric sensors vwr in addition these three parameters were monitored continuously one measurement per 15 min between january the 30th and may the 1st with hobo u 26 sensor 2 2 1 2 phytoplankton compartment a volume of 15 l of surface water was collected for the phytoplankton sampling in the middle of the channel the chlorophyll a biomass chla was evaluated for three size classes of phytoplankton micro 20 µm nano 3 to 20 µm and picophytoplankton 3 µm filters made in triplicate 20 µm 3 µm and 0 7 µm were used to separate the 3 different size fractions by fractional filtration the biomass of chla of each size class was determined by fluorimetry according to the yentsch and menzel method 1963 2 2 2 sediment compartment 2 2 2 1 core sampling and processing four cylindrical cores were collected using pvc tubes 8 2 cm diameter 20 cm long with taking care to keep a water thickness of at least 5 cm above the sediment to preserve the sediment water interface and for bottom water chemistry three cores were sliced every 5 mm to a depth of 6 cm i e 12 layers under nitrogen atmosphere porewater was extracted from each sediment layer by centrifugation 20 min at 2 700 g and at in situ temperature then filtered through 0 2 µm filters overlying and pore waters were conserved at 20 c for nutrients analyses an aliquot was conserved at 5 c for silica analysis in both bottom and pore waters aliquots were immediately used for alkalinity measurement and hno3 acidification 0 01 mol l 1 suprapur merck for metal analysis nutrients i e nitrates no3 nitrites no2 soluble reactive phosphorus srp ammonium nh3 and silica si concentrations were determined by a colorimetric autoanalyser scalar seal whit a detection limit of 0 02 µmol l 1 the acidified aliquot was analyzed by icp aes thermo scientific icap 6300 radial to measure dissolved iron fed manganese mnd and sulfur sd alkalinity was determined according to the colorimetric sarazin et al 1999 method absorbance measurements were carried out with a spectrophotomer spectrostar nano bmg labtech the remaining sediment from centrifugation was then frozen at 20 c samples were freeze dried and manually grounded for solid phase analyses once the samples have been reweighed the porosity was determined for use in fluxes modeling see next section an aliquot 100 mg was used for the ascorbate extraction of reactive manganese mn3 and mn4 iron amorphous fe3 and p according to the method used in kostka and luther 1994 and anschutz et al 1998 2 2 2 2 high resolution methods microprofiling a core was placed in an aquarium thermoregulated at the in situ temperature and air was injected at the overlying water to maintain o2 saturation and keep a thin benthic boundary layer oxygen was analysed with clark type electrodes 50 µm tip diameter revsbech 1989 connected to a unisense multimeter and a motorized vertical micromanipulator a two point calibration was made from saturated overlying water and anoxic sediment 2d det probes in april two supplementary cores were collected for a 2d det probes deployment this method uses a diffusive equilibrium in thin films det probe davison et al 1991 coupled with a colorimetric technique to visualize in two dimensions the repartition of dissolved nitrite iron and p concentrations along the core jézéquel et al 2007 pagès et al 2011 metzger et al 2016 firstly a det gel probe which samples the dissolved chemical species from the pore water at high resolution fixed to a plexiglas plate was introduced into the sediment core this probe was made of a 185 mm 125 mm 0 8 mm polyacrylamide thin film krom et al 1994 laid on an acrylic support and a pvdf porous 0 2 µm membrane that maintained and protected the gel in order to minimize lateral heterogeneity for a single support 2 gels were placed back to back to make a double faced probe the first probe had a gel dedicated to nitrite and another to iron the second had a probe dedicated to p the other to iron after 5 hours equilibrium time gel probes were quickly processed to minimize lateral diffusion within the sampling gel and subsequent loss of 2d resolution it consisted in superimposing each gel into a specific reagent gel previously equilibrated with no2 po4 and fe colorimetric reagents griess molybdate ferrozine reagents see references cited above twenty minutes after contact a picture was taken with a standard scanner images were analyzed by densitometry of different rgb spectral bandwidths using imagej software the iron was treated in the blue channel this channel was chosen despite its lower sensibility compared to the green one in order to avoid saturation range between 0 and 500 µmol l 1 for the blue channel between 0 and 200 µmol l 1 for the green one phosphates and nitrites were analyzed in the red and green channel respectively 2 2 2 3 diffusive fluxes modeling no3 no2 ʃnh3 srp si fed and oxygen o2 diffusive fluxes at the swi were determined using the profile software berg et al 1998 based on a transport reaction model this software allowed to describe the sedimentary column as a succession of layers with a specific reaction rate for a dissolved chemical species and the fluxes above and below that sediment column modeling vertical domain this work focused on the vertical diffusion and the transport was assumed to be dominated by molecular diffusion without bioturbation as described in lewandowski et al 2002 since the sediment is impermeable silt clay the flux f was calculated at the swi thanks the fick law as 1 f ϕ d s d c d z with the sediment porosity ds the diffusion coefficient c the element concentration and z the depth of calculation in profile ds was calculated using rasmussen and jorgensen 1992 as below 2 d s d 1 3 1 ϕ diffusion coefficient d was determined with previous studies varying with temperature o2 fluxes modeling were made using data from microprofiling d was taken from the unisense gas table the no3 no2 ʃnh3 and srp coefficient diffusion were taken from li and gregory 1974 and the si one from rebreanu et al 2008 modeling was based on data from the core slicing and 2d det profiles in case of too few points with quantified concentrations a linear model was used to calculate the flux manually boudreau 1997 using the formula 1 and ds as 3 d s d 1 ln φ 2 in this work the negative flux values corresponded to fluxes leaving the sediment the positive values to fluxes entering the sediment o2 no3 ʃnh3 and si fluxes were calculated through profiles obtained with the core slicing method no2 srp and fe fluxes were calculated through both core slicing method profiles and 2d det probes the fluxes calculated from the 2d det probes represented the width integrated average fluxes of the gel at three interfaces positioning 0 swi swi 1 mm and swi 1 mm the flux was modeled from the mean concentrations per gel line the overlying water was not used for the calculation of the gradients at the interface because of the very strong chemical gradients near the diffusive boundary layer dbl and not reflecting its chemical properties 2 3 statistical tests all statistical tests were made with the software r studio 1 2 1335 analyses of variance anova and tuckey post hoc tests threshold α 0 05 were made to determinate significant differences between replicates to respect the validity of this statistical test data could be log transformed if residuals did not followed normality kruskal wallis and wilcoxon post hoc tests were made 3 results 3 1 physical chemical parameters of the water column temperature increased regularly between the end of january and may rising from 8 c to 15 c on average in the channel fig 1 discrete sampling points indicated measured with wtw sensor 7 5 10 14 and 14 c for january march april and may respectively conductivity was relatively stable around

calculations fig s2 as supplementary material the study site was only phosphate limited for planktonic primary producers all along the survey 3 2 phytoplankton dynamics from january to march the phytoplankton biomass was between 1 and 3 4 µg chla l 1 depending on the size class and dominated by the microphytoplankton fig 2 however no significant difference was observed between the three size classes neither in january anova f 2 1 21 p 0 05 nor in march anova f 2 3 55 p 0 05 in april a significant nanophytoplankton development was observed with 5 5 µg chla l 1 tuckey post hoc test p 0 001 a similar pattern was observed in may with a dominant nanophytoplankton biomass four times higher than that of the other two size classes 4 and 1 µg chla l 1 respectively tuckey post hoc test p 0 001 within each size class the april nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton biomasses 5 and 3 µg chla l 1 respectively were higher than in january march and may tuckey post hoc test p 0 03 and p 0 001 respectively 3 3 sediment geochemistry in late january no3 mean concentration was around 200 µmol l 1 with high spatial variability between 0 and 2 cm depth and decreased sharply to reach about 5 µmol l 1 at 3 5 cm depth fig 3 same pattern was observed for no2 with a maximum mean concentration in the top layer 43 µmol l 1 which decreased rapidly to reach the detection limit at 3 5 cm depth early in march only the first sediment layer showed detectable nitrate and nitrite with 37 and 6 µmol l 1 respectively then no sample showed detectable concentrations mnasc showed a maximum concentration in late january in the first layer of sediment 3 2 mmol kg 1 and remained constant downwards at 1 5 mmol kg 1 for march april and may values ranged between 1 0 to 1 5 mmol kg 1 mnd presented a linear increase along the core in january april and may between 1 and 60 µmol kg 1 a peak was observed in march between 0 and 3 cm with a maximum of 35 µmol kg 1 feasc was higher in january and may around 25 mmol kg 1 and lower in march and april around 20 mmol kg 1 until 4 cm depth in late january fed was near the detection limit from 0 to 5 cm and in march a first peak was observed at 1 5 cm 47 µmol kg 1 at the same depth as the manganese one in april a strong mobilization was detected between the surface and 4 cm deep with a peak of 152 µmol kg 1 it then increased to 238 µmol kg 1 in the deepest layers in may at the same depth dissolved iron peaked at 70 µmol kg 1 to then reach 232 µmol kg 1 at 6 cm depth in april and may fed increased from 4 to 3 cm depth respectively to reach more than 200 µmol l 1 at the core bottom pasc ranged between 4 and 5 mmol kg 1 in january march and may without any real trend with depth it was higher in april to reach between 5 and 6 mmol kg 1 srp was under detection limit in january a first peak of 3 µmol l 1 appeared at 1 5 cm depth in march concomitant with manganese and the first iron peak to increase in april with a strong mobilization in the first 2 cm with a maximum of 32 µmol l 1 in may a weaker and deeper peak was observed 3 cm depth 22 µmol l 1 these two peaks seemed to coincide with the globally increase of dissolved iron mobilization in the first 4 cm of sediment especially in april sulfate profiles showed generally increasing concentrations with depth with the highest concentrations observed in january 2 to 8 mmol kg 1 at surface and depth respectively in march april and may concentrations ranged from about 0 5 mmol kg 1 at the surface to 3 mmol kg 1 at depth concentrations in april were the lowest and showed the smallest gradient between 0 5 and 1 5 mmol kg 1 along the sediment for both january and march ʃnh3 concentrations ranged from nearly 50 µmol l 1 to 130 µmol l 1 between top layer and 6 cm deep respectively with a slight increase in the last centimeter ʃnh3 concentrations in april and may were about 4 times higher than those obtained in winter in the surface layer 193 and 175 µmol l 1 respectively and presented a maximum peak in may at 3 cm depth to reach 439 µmol l 1 si had the same vertical trend for every month with a slightly increasing concentration along both the core column and time maxima observed were at around 5 cm depth with 411 496 583 and 682 µmol l 1 for january march april and may respectively the alkalinity increased over months and was positively correlated with ʃnh3 concentration in porewater p 0 001 r2 0 76 in january it ranged between 6 5 and 7 7 mmol kg 1 at the surface and core bottom layer respectively with a slight increase in the last centimeter it then increased from marsh between 7 0 and 8 9 mmol kg 1 to april between 10 5 and 13 5 mmol kg 1 the 2d representation of dissolved iron nitrite and srp in the sediment pore water was made in april fig 4 both iron gels probe 1 and 2 showed an increasing concentration with depth fig 4 with mobilization starting at nearly 0 5 cm below the swi and increased sharply from 15 to 170 µmol l 1 at 1 5 cm depth for probe 1 and from 30 to 170 µmol l 1 at 2 5 cm depth for probe 2 the concentrations then increased slightly to reach a maximum of 290 µmol l 1 and 240 µmol l 1 at 12 cm deep for probe 1 and probe 2 respectively on probe 1 nitrite was only present in a thin layer between the swi and 1 cm depth maximum concentrations of about 65 µmol l 1 the average srp probe 2 presented a strong mobilization between 1 and 6 cm with a maximum concentration about 90 µmol l 1 the lateral heterogeneity was more pronounced on probe 1 e g fed depleted and no2 rich zones between 5 9 cm and 0 2 cm depth respectively on a 2 cm width the feasc pasc ratio is an interesting indicator to understand the effects of the adsorption site saturation on the remobilization of p in the porewater anschutz et al 1998 thibault de chanvalon et al 2016 between 1 and 5 cm deep in january and may feasc pasc ratio was quite similar around 6 fig 5 in march and april this ratio was lower around 5 and 4 respectively 3 4 benthic fluxes and high spatial resolution consideration incoming oxygen fluxes were observed around 10 2 nmol cm 2 s 1 with maximum fluxes in may significantly higher than those of march kruskal wallis test χ2 3 12 19 p 0 03 the nitrogen nutrient fluxes were most heterogeneous recording ingoing and outgoing fluxes depending on the element studied ingoing no3 and no2 fluxes were observed for each date with a significantly higher flux in january 4 53e 03 nmol cm 2 s 1 tuckey test f 3 6 48 p 0 05 and 5 06e 04 nmol cm 2 s 1 tuckey test f 3 5 87 p 0 05 for no3 and no2 respectively lastly ʃnh3 fluxes tended to be outgoing for each date no significant differences were noted between dates kruskal wallis test χ2 3 4 59 p 0 20 a slight srp influx in january and efflux between march and may was observed the outgoing flux in april 1 10e 04 nmol cm 2 s 1 was significantly higher and 10 times greater compared to ones in march tuckey test f 3 12 51 p 0 005 the si fluxes showed an outgoing flux for each date no significant differences were noted tuckey test f 3 2 06 p 0 18 finally the iron flowed out regardless of the date the february flux 2 10e 06 nmol cm 2 s 1 was significantly lower than those of march april and may tuckey test f 3 10 38 p 0 05 the fluxes calculations via the modeling of 2d gel concentrations showed the impact of the core scale heterogeneity on the fluxes and the importance of interface positioning table 3 at the 0 interface no2 and srp presented an incoming flux of the order of 10 5 and 10 6 µmol cm 2 s 1 respectively a fed efflux was observed around 2e 04 nmol cm 2 s 1 the change in the interface positioning generated variability in flux directions for no2 a 1 mm positioning generated a mean outgoing 10 5 µmol cm 2 s 1 and incoming 10 4 µmol cm 2 s 1 flux respectively for srp these two positions produced an outgoing flux of the same magnitude order 10 5 µmol cm 2 s 1 only the averaged iron fluxes were always outgoing whatever the interface considered which showed a better homogeneity in the upper part of the gel 4 discussion 4 1 phytoplankton dynamics and nutrients availability the phytoplanktonic dynamics observed at marans can be qualified as relatively classic for a freshwater system tortajada et al 2011 a poor development in winter regardless of the size classes was explained by the unfavorable physical conditions low temperature and probably luminosity despite huge nitrates values in march table 1 probably coming from near agricultural soil leaching tortajada et al 2011 the nanophytoplankton bloom observed in april could be attributed to much more favorable physical conditions increase in temperature and probably luminosity but also in nutrient charging of the system and especially in dissolved phosphorus see below for link benthos pelagos coupling as strong limiting factor kraal et al 2015 horppila 2019 these very weak concentrations of srp not exceeding 0 4 µmol l 1 were of the same magnitude order as those measured in the work of david et al 2020a in a comparable environment such weak concentration could suggest a constant upstream to downstream flow of water preventing its accumulation or a rapid withdrawal by autotrophic organisms masclaux et al 2014 the p limitation at marans could induce competition between different phytoplanktonic communities the high surface area volume ratio and the active metabolism of nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton make them more efficient to uptake nutrients than larger cells microphytoplankton legendre et rasoulzadegan 1995 masclaux et al 2014 which could explain the dominance of nanophytoplankton at early spring in this study however these dynamics over time was not entirely consistent to those observed in comparable systems if a slight spring development of nano microphytoplankton was observed in david et al 2020a the real difference appeared to occur in march when a strong microphytoplankton development has been observed in other works in addition to the pico nanophytoplankton masclaux et al 2014 the absence of such a development in this work would suggest that a possible bloom took place between sampling dates in line with the potential fast phytoplankton response to environmental changes thyssen et al 2008 indeed the decrease of nitrate in the water column from march to may 668 to 371 µmol l 1 as well as the increase of the dissolved o2 concentration fig 1 could indicate a nutrient uptake by primary producers as observed in april that would have started before masclaux et al 2014 moreover p limitation in marans did not allow a strong development with regard to the redfield ratio justić et al 1995 but shift in such limitation could be possible attributed to the endogenous recycling of p wu et al 2017 through diagenetic processes 4 2 temporal succession of dominant diagenetic processes 4 2 1 initial condition winter situation the high no3 concentration in the water column and the high no3 no2 concentration in january between the interface and 3 cm depth suggested water column as the main nitrate source for the sediment rather than nitrification in the sediment of low nitrate environments middelburg et al 1996 the strong no3 no2 gradient in these sediment layers fig 3 led to consider denitrification as the main process for nitrogen removal since the only slight reduction to ammonia dnra occur in the sediment binnerup et al 1992 rysgaard et al 1993 here denitrification appeared to indirectly inhibit the srp remobilization by inhibiting the reduction of iron oxides wauer et al 2005 petzoldt and uhlmann 2006 schauser et al 2006 grüneberg et al 2015 whereas mn and fe cycles quickly dominated early diagenetic processes in coastal marine sediment pastor et al 2018 indeed the only trace state presence of srp congruent with the non detection of fed and the relatively large stock of iron oxide along the profile fig 3 suggested a low iron oxide reactivity the high no3 concentration in the surficial sediment in winter plus the probable thin oxic layer could promote iron oxidation and explain the maximum feasc values and the mnasc peak at the sediment surface fig 3 hansen et al 2003 burgin et al 2011 these high oxides concentrations allow a great amount of adsorption sites for po4 which would be immediately uptaken during om mineralization the deeper feasc values could be explained by a ferrous fraction fe2 associated with iron monosulphide kostka and luther 1994 anschutz et al 1999 the constant increasing gradient of mnd could be generated by dissolutive manganese reduction during om mineralization following the appearance of favourable redox conditions another possible source of dissolved manganese could be the reduction of manganese oxides by reduced iron diffusion from a deeper source moreover the concomitant low pasc fig 3 and low srp values in january could suggest that mineralization was still low at this time of the year moreover in considering ʃnh3 and alkalinity in porewater as a tracer of anaerobic mineralization processes their slight increase in the last cm seemed to indicate the occurrence of such processes under the sampling area fig 3 4 2 2 spring time evolution in march the slight presence of nitrate and nitrite in sediment surface indicated that the denitrification became shallower overlying waters were more concentrated table 1 probably due to inputs from watershed suggesting that denitrification was relatively fast limiting diffusion of nitrate and nitrite downwards moreover the non accumulation of ʃnh3 between january and march fig 3 would be consistent with annamox reaction for the nitrogen removal possible as long as no3 was not totally depleted canfield et al 1993 however weak gradients of ʃnh3 in the surficial sediment made this hypothesis unlikely the peak of mnd also suggested a consumption of manganese oxides for mineralization of om in the first 3 cm fig 3 as evidenced by the decrease in mnasc at the surface between january and march which could lead to the first remobilization of phosphorus explained by the slight peak of srp at 1 5 cm depth the presence of a first fe dissolved peak concurrent to the dissolved mn one also suggested the beginning of the consumption of fe3 hydroxides as a terminal electron acceptor for the degradation of om this seemed to be consistent with the decrease of feasc in the sediment at that time this decrease could also be attributed to the non efficient fe2 reoxidation due to the absence of no3 and the thin oxic layer the quantities of oxides were certainly still too high to permit a significant diffusive p flux into water column table 2 as shown by the high ratio feasc pasc fig 5 and the rather weak mineralization the total depletion of nitrate and nitrite in the sediment from april fig 3 and the increase in temperature fig 1 were favourable factors for triggering the chemical and microbial reduction of iron hydroxides jensen et al 1995 as om mineralization pathway the sharp increase in fed in the porewaters within the first 4 cm in april and the second peak in the first 3 cm in may was an evidence of the iron oxides consumption fig 3 as a result the phosphate sorbed onto iron hydroxides was released into interstitial waters and seemed to be the main route for srp mobilization rather than the dissimilatory sulfate reduction observed in estuarine systems pan et al 2020 the phosphate mobilization attributed to the 4 first cm in spring was the highest and most superficial in april according to pasc diminution in the first cm fig 3 a significant srp efflux was observed at that time table 2 2d gels realization in april allowed to validate and strengthen the link between iron and p cycle observed via core slicing profile within the upper part of the sediment in marans fig 4 pan et al 2019 moreover the overall trend of fed to increase in depth as for mnd suggested more favourable redox conditions for the om mineralization via the iron reduction route the om mineralization could also be identified via the sharp increase in alkalinity sholkovitz 1973 and mineralization products in sediment porewaters ʃnh3 si until may fig 3 the maximum concentrations of pasc in april fig 3 could be explained by srp sorption on the hydroxides during their diffusion throughout the sediment the minimum feasc pasc ratio fig 5 following the consumption of metal oxides could indicate a kind of saturation of the fe adsorption sites with respect to p anschutz et al 1998 the excess in mobilization of srp in the upper part of the sediment could explain the diffusive flux into the water column in april and may table 2 however an feasc pasc ratio 2 showed the non sufficiency of feooh to prevent the diffusion of p into the water column in lake systems gächter and müller 2003 the constant feasc pasc 3 in this work could suggest the existence of another phase that precipitates with fe3 such as fesx which could be consistent with the potential sulfate reduction supposed by the decrease of soluble sulfur compounds over time fig 3 the increasing of fed in depth in april and may figs 3 4 could be coming from the fe2 resolubilisation following abiotic reduction between s2 and a fe3 source or fesx dissolution johnston et al 2014 below the iron hydroxide respiration zone the increase of feasc concentrations in may in the first 3 cm may also suggest a highly crystallised ferric form that would not react with p and thus explain the non correlation between feasc and pasc in this sediment layer on this assumption the probable non saturation of the surface sites of iron oxides by phosphate ions high feasc pasc ratio could allow fe3 to recrystallize anschutz et al 1998 and explained the slight srp efflux observed in may table 2 moreover the more important residence time of dissolved p compared to fed in sediment could explain this feasc pasc phase shifting in may millero et al 1987 neupane et al 2014 giles et al 2016 smolders et al 2017 ding et al 2018 and favor p mobilization thibault de chanvalon et al 2016 the chemical species distribution presented vertical and horizontal heterogeneity at centimeter scale and could make difficult the interpretation of their layering in the sediment column this heterogeneity could be directly observed through 2d det probes especially concerning iron and nitrite gels fig 4 these distributions can be impaired by macroorganisms burrows or root systems in the sediment which can strongly influence its geochemistry by promoting o2 and nitrate inputs christensen et al 1997 frederiksen and glud 2006 cesbron et al 2014 aller et al 2019 or impacting the vertical and horizontal distribution of solids thibault de chanvalon et al 2016 such heterogeneity is also evidenced at the station scale by the variability between core triplicates 4 3 sediment and biochemical parameters retroaction of the water column the flux directions from profiles out of the core slicing method were relatively consistent with the surface gradients observed via mean nutrient profiles in the sediment indicating a good fit between actual and modelled data the high resolution method tends to decrease fluxes by reducing the chemical gradients at the interface table 3 the heterogeneity in chemical species distribution evidenced on the nitrite gel fig 4 makes the placement of the interface critical and explains the flux variations on a small scale table 3 the no3 increase in the water column in march in spite of its ingoing flux toward sediment seemed to be largely explained by allochthonous inputs the influx in april and may could be in part explained by large nitrogen demand for denitrification in the upper layers of the sediment in winter with regard to the degradation products of om the permanent ʃnh3 outflows coincided with the progressive loading of the water column until april the reverse of this trend in may despite the strong remobilization of ammonium at depth and the not significant increase in srp in the water column despite the srp efflux in march and april could reflect a vegetation pumping of ammonium and p explaining the downward shift of the p peak during this period fig 3 or even primary producer bloom sand jensen and borum 1991 rozan et al 2002 moreover forms of water stratification which can exist in pounds or even marshes condie and webster 2001 chimney et al 2006 could counteract the link between fluxes at the interface and water column response especially through the phosphate availability crockford et al 2015 however the shallow depth of the marshes the site s windward catch and the variations in water level caused by management of marsh water may favor the mixing and thus allow efficient nutrient accessibility throughout the water column however this work strongly suggested the link between the outflow of srp and the triggering of the nanophytoplankton development in april by reducing p limitation of this system in addition to the physical parameters being favorable to such development it highlighted the link between phytoplankton dynamics and mineralization processes by showing congruence between temporal patterns of benthic srp regeneration and small phytoplanktonic cells i e nano picophytoplankton development indeed the evolution of n p ratios strongly suggests a prevalence of internal recycling of p rather than external input for the development of phytoplankton although temporal patterns between benthic regeneration and planktonic production have potentially been shown in coastal environments kemp and boyton 1984 cowan and boyton 1996 the high nitrate content at marans influenced the dynamics of this system both at the sediment compartment and the water column scale which could decrease benthos pelagos interactions kelly et al 1985 indeed denitrification processes inhibited for about a month the respiration of metal oxides and thus the potential release of srp into the water column this phenomenon suggested a completely different behavior of the sediment compartment in lower nitrate systems and therefore a different response of the chemical and biological parameters of the water column however the conceptual model presented in this work could be deployed in other sites of interest in order to propose new tools for observatories to characterize the aquatic environment quality and predict future trends 5 conclusions and perspectives the strong phosphate limitation and huge nitrogen content in water column suggested a high nitrate control on the temporal patterns of diagenetic processes and phytoplankton development denitrification processes inhibited phosphates mobilization in winter by preventing iron hydroxide reduction and seemed to be the main route for nitrogen removal in the sediment depletion in nitrates in the sediment from early spring triggered iron hydroxide respiration and phosphate mobilization on the upper part of the sediment a significant phosphate efflux was observed in april congruent with nanophytoplankton development the multiscale heterogeneity on chemical species distribution highlighted the importance of biotic parameters on the distribution and mobilization of such species in the sediment the complexity in evaluating nutrient flux feedback on the water column leads to the necessity of a better understanding of the nutrient catchment control by autotrophs an annual monitoring in such anthropogenic environment duplicated on less nitrate rich systems would provide a broader view of the importance and

17331,in this study a combined alkaline alk and ultrasonication uls sludge lysis cryptic pretreatment and anoxic oxic ao system ao alk uls was developed to enhance biological nitrogen removal bnr in domestic wastewater with a low carbon nitrogen c n ratio a real time control strategy for the ao alk uls system was designed to optimize the sludge lysate return ratio rslr under variable sludge

neural network real time control low c n ratio wastewater biological nitrogen removal bnr lysis cryptic bnr system 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps are fundamental for treating municipal and industrial wastewater soares 2020 and are crucial in improving the water environments jin et al 2014 currently the treatment efficiency and capacity of existing wwtps worldwide are facing increasingly severe challenges bao et al 2019 pang et al 2019 for example excess sludge is an unpleasant byproduct of wastewater treatment it is produced in large quantities and accounts for approximately 50 60 of the total operational cost of wwtps guo et al 2013 the substantial production of excess sludge creates a heavy environmental burden and poses a significant hazard if not appropriately handled existing wwtps also experience issues related to the considerable amount of non standard wastewater discharge and significant irregular operational problems zhang et al 2016 in chine 3508 wwtps had been built in 31 provinces by the end of 2013 xie 2020 of these almost 90 have unavoidable problems with nutrient removal jin et al 2014 found that approximately 50 of wwtps could not meet the nitrogen discharge standard ammonia nitrogen nh4 n is the main compound of the reactive nitrogen introduced into natural waters by industrial domestic and agricultural wastewater and is therefore the target of most nitrogen removal processes in domestic wastewater the influent nh4 n accounts for approximately 60 of the total nitrogen which ranges in concentrations from 20 mg l to 80 mg l gao et al 2011 akaboci et al 2018 pijuan et al 2020 high nitrogen loading reactors are typically run with nh4 n concentrations above 200 mg l pelaz et al 2018 mojiri et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 and are used with industrial wastewater or side stream municipal wastewater li et al 2020 one of the factors that limit the efficiency of biological nitrogen removal bnr from domestic wastewater is an insufficient supply of organic carbon sources in low strength wastewater unfavorable conditions such as a low influent carbon to nitrogen c n ratio make it harder for a single sludge operation process to meet strict discharge standards chen et al 2011 solutions for addressing this problem consistently apply external organic compounds which increases the operating costs or the denitrification time antileo et al 2013 there is growing interest in mechanisms for reutilizing excess sludge as a valuable organic resource previous studies have developed various physical chemical and biological combination lysis cryptic methods to address this need kim et al 2010 yang et al 2012 tian et al 2015 bashir et al 2019 the microbial cell lysate released from the disintegration of sludge can be used as a valuable carbon source to improve bnr during the wastewater treatment process pilli et al 2011 yang et al 2015 fathali et al 2019 many studies have explored enhanced bnr processes combined with different lysis cryptic methods lysis cryptic bnr system guo et al 2013 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2015 however in practice the optimal real time operation of this lysis cryptic bnr system is difficult or even impossible due to the large variability involved in the coupled wastewater treatment process some of these variations include different sludge disintegration parameters that are applied to the sludge yields from the bnr system different domestic wastewater with low c n ratios and different influent organic loading levels induced by the sludge lysate return ratio rslr chen et al 2011 yang et al 2015 li et al 2018 owing to the complicated relationships among these influencing factors and their nonlinear dynamic behaviors optimizing the performance of this combined system is a challenge artificial intelligence techniques such as artificial neural networks anns can be used for complex problems to attain high operational performance in a nonlinear fashion chen et al 2017 they can also learn and capture the nonlinear relationships among variables multi input output in a complex coupled system without pre existing knowledge of the system physics antwi et al 2018 huggi and mise 2019 ismail et al 2019 in recent years anns have been employed for numerous wastewater treatment issues due to their high precision and predictability compared to other models such as the support vector machine statistical regression models or mathematical stochastic methods djeddou and achour 2015 giwa et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 khatri et al 2020 the ann model is used to predict the removal efficiency dehghani et al 2020a 2020b the biotreatment effluent variables of wastewater khatri et al 2019 wastewater decolorization asgari et al 2020 shokoohi et al 2020 bioreactor performance nadiri et al 2018 and real time chemical dosing wu and lo 2008 during wastewater treatment process many researchers recommend anns for predicting water quality measures such as total suspended solids tss biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and nh4 n ráduly et al 2007 abba and elkiran 2017 the performance of wwtps can also be predicted using ann and they generally outperform regression based models for wastewater treatment bagheri et al 2015 although in relevant literatures a number of experimental and numerical analyses have been conducted on wastewater contaminant removal and in situ sludge reduction by different lysis cryptic methods lin et al 2012 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2015 the performance of bnr from the combined system involving the biological reaction and the sludge lysis cryptic pretreatment is complicated and dependent on many factors such as the non uniformity and variability of influent organic loadings influent cod nh4 n no3 n etc the initial sludge concentration the optimized sludge lysis cryptic parameters and the coupled operation conditions reaction time rslr etc owing to the strong coupling and large variability the optimal real time operation of the lysis cryptic bnr system requires a non linear modeling technique such as ann that can account for the complexity and interdependence of the combined process to the authors knowledge the ann technique has not been used to study how to realize real time intelligent decision making and continuous optimal control strategies for the combined lysis cryptic bnr system treating wastewater with a low c n ratio furthermore there is still a lack of ann models that map multivariable of biological wastewater treatment and sludge lysis cryptic pretreatment in a combined lysis cryptic bnr system following a reliable and intelligent decision making strategy this is crucial in order to provide wwtps with information for proactive management and decision making this study applied the ann model to study the combined lysis cryptic bnr system with the goal of real time dynamic response and process optimization control as a result the study also developed new optimization modeling methods in the field of enhanced bnr and in situ sludge reduction for wastewater with low cod n ratios as a model system a conventional anoxic oxic ao bioreactor fig 1 a was constructed then a combined alkaline and ultrasonication alk uls pretreatment was applied to represent the sludge lysis cryptic method due to their previously demonstrated impressive synthetic effects kim et al 2010 tian et al 2015 finally a combined ao alk uls system equipped with online cod nh4 n no3 n and sludge concentration monitoring devices was developed fig 1b the objectives of this study were i to determine the optimal sludge disintegration parameters for the combined alk uls pretreatment under variable sludge concentrations produced from the ao system and ii to develop the ann ao alk uls system to establish a real time control strategy for the rslr under different influent low c n ratios 2 material and methods 2 1 sewage sludge the waste activated sludge was used in this study was collected from a local full scale municipal wwtp in harbin china before the experiments debris was filtered out of the was different concentrations of was were then obtained through settling was samples at 4 c for 24 48 h the supernatant was discarded different sludge concentrations with thicknesses ranging from 10 g total solid ts l to 35 g ts l were prepared for further study table 1

pretreatment step at specific energy inputs seis of 15 18 and 21 kj g ts see supporting information si sections s1 1 and s1 2 to simulate the sludge concentration in the sludge pretreatment tank of

selected to align with levels in the pretreatment tank from the sludge thickening tank the disintegration degree dd of excess sludge was calculated as the ratio of the increase in soluble cod scod due to the combined alk uls pretreatment to the maximum possible increase in scod as described in the si for the combined alk uls optimization each test was conducted for 60 min with sampling every 10 min the sludge samples were first centrifuged and then filtered through a 0 45 μm filter prior to determine the scod each test was conducted in triplicate 2 3 ao alk uls system operation and selection of input and output variables for ann model this study applied two parallel lab scale continuous flow ao systems the sludge characteristics and effluent concentrations in the systems were maintained at a steady state after one month of cultivation one ao system was operated as the control fig 1a the other ao system was modified into an ao alk uls system by inserting the alk uls pretreatment tank in the sludge return line fig 1b for the modified ao alk uls system a peristaltic pump with a time relay pumped the settled sludge from the secondary settling tank into the sludge thickening tank the was in the thickening tank was further concentrated for 4 h it was then pumped into the sludge pretreatment tank after 1 h of alk uls pretreatment the prepared sludge lysate was pumped into the sludge lysate tank for recycling an online sludge concentration detection probe mlss 530 yantai chemins instrument co ltd china was inserted into the sludge pretreatment tank to detect the sludge concentration then the sludge in the sludge pretreatment tank was disintegrated this was done by applying the optimized alk uls pretreatment parameters obtained in section 3 1 2 throughout the experiment the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss was controlled at 3500 500 mg l by discharging sludge from the secondary settling tank the dissolved oxygen do in the aerobic zone was controlled at 2 4 mg l table s1 provides detailed operation parameters of the two systems the synthetic wastewater which fed to the control and to the ao alk uls reactors was prepared daily nh4cl was added to the synthetic wastewater to simulate the nh4 n concentrations found in wastewater 100 mg l 120 mg l 125 mg l and 150 mg l the mineral composition was as follows 43 9 mg l kh2po4 40 mg l cacl2 and 75 mg l mgso4 sodium acetate in chemical oxygen demand solution was used as a carbon source at the following concentrations 150 mg cod l 600 mg cod l table 3 to achieve the desired initial c n ratios a trace element solution 1 ml was added as described by cui et al 2020 detection probes were inserted into the influent effluent and sludge lysate tanks to assess the different influent variables related to different recycled sludge lysate the variables included online cod cod 206 yantai chemins instrument co ltd china online nh4 n nhn 202 yantai chemins instrument co ltd china and online no3 n nitratax sc hach usa concentrations the goal was to optimize the rslr in the bpann ao alk uls system as such the ao alk uls system was fed with the synthetic substrate at low c n ratios ranging from 1 to 5 the influent cod and nh4 n concentrations ranged from 150 to 600 mg l and 100 150 mg l respectively data were collected for 14 days at each concentration combination for the ann training process before recycling the pretreated sludge samples were neutralized to a ph of 7 0 0 5 using an automatic ph control liquid adding instrument sc 200a changsha sichen instrument technology co ltd china the same process was used for the influent 2 4 development of ann model in this study the backpropagation bp algorithm was used to develop the backpropagation artificial neural network bpann model the bpann model with the input vector and target vector consisted of neurons ordered in 3 layers input hidden and output layers the input neurons represented the independent process variables the output neurons were the dependent predicted variables the neurons count at each layer depended on the complexity of the process antwi et al 2018 the neurons at different layers were connected through weights serving as the adjustable parameter of the network therefore neurons at the input layer were introduced to the hidden layer using weights ismail et al 2019 this was accomplished after adding weighted inputs

parameters n is the number of input variables and i is the integer index the developed bpann was trained on a neural network toolbox of matlab r2018a mathworks inc the goal was to optimize rslr in real time in the ao alk uls by considering different low c n influents related to different influent organic loading impacted by the recycled sludge lysate to develop the bpann ao alk uls model a set

individual alk and uls pretreatments fig s2 presents the effects of individual alk and uls pretreatments on was disintegration for the alk pretreatment increases in ph resulted in more solubilization of organics into a liquid phase the released scod concentrations were 1987 89 2565 85 3466 101 3767 117 4042 150 and 4121 136 mg l which corresponded to dds of 15 1 0 7 19 6 0 6 26 8 0 8 29 1 0 9 31 3 1 2 and 31 9 1 1 respectively at naoh dosages of 0 025 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 g naoh g ts respectively figs s2a and b as a result the sludge ph increased from 6 69 to 7 6 9 3 10 4 11 8 12 4 and 12 7 respectively by the end of each test compared to previous studies increased ph values in was created a hypertonic environment in microbial cells this resulted in a loss of turgor pressure and integrity neyens et al 2003 which led to a release of internal organic matter into the liquid results showed that the significant dd at a higher naoh dosage 0 15 naoh g ts was more conducive to microbial cell lysis the results of the individual uls pretreatment experiments are shown in figs s2c and d similar to alk pretreatment there was a significant transfer of organic matter from the particulate matter to the soluble fraction that occurred through individual uls pretreatment figs s2d shows that when sei changed from 15 to 21 kj g ts between reaction times of 40 60 min the individual uls pretreatment caused considerable increases in dds of was according to the results of the two individual pretreatments naoh dosages of 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 g g ts and sei dosages of 15 18 and 21 kj g ts fig s2 were observed to be the optimum dosages for cell lysis these levels were selected for the subsequent combined pretreatment studies 3 1 2 sludge solubilization by combined alk uls pretreatments as expected the combined alk uls pretreatments synergetic effect significantly enhanced the dds in all experimental conditions fig 3 for example this study found that 31 9 and 34 8 of dds achieved with a naoh dosage of 0 25 g g ts and a sei of 18 kj g ts respectively were obtained in individual tests under sludge concentration of 15 23 0 71 g l fig s2 a high dd of 78 6 was achieved with the combined pretreatment due to the synergetic effect of the combined alk uls pretreatments an 11 9 increase in solubilization was achieved when the same sei 18 kj g ts and naoh dosage 0 25 g g ts were combined and applied to the was the structure of cell walls weakened by alk pretreatment was more vulnerable to the generation of shear forces by the uls pretreatment enabling hydroxyl radicals to reach deep inside the was cells in an exceedingly effective way kim et al 2010 notably consistent with the results with individual tests fig s2 the curve trends of the scod released into liquid were markedly divided into a rapid raising stage and a gradual stabilization stage fig 3 fig 3 shows that a maximum dd of 78 6 was achieved when applying a combined pretreatment of a naoh dosage of 0 25 g naoh g ts and a sei of 18 kj g ts under an initial sludge concentration of 15 23 0 71 g l however only a 0 9 increase in dd was achieved when the naoh dosage was increased from 0 20 to 0 25 g naoh g ts combined with a sei of 18 kj g based on these results a 0 20 g dose of naoh g ts combined with a 18 kj g ts dose of sei was considered to be optimal and profitable for sludge disintegration and could efficiently reduce the economic burden more importantly fig 3 shows that sludge concentrations thickening from 10 g l to 35 g l resulted in a critical increment of organic matter entering into the soluble phases this is because the solid matter in was is mostly organic matter and microorganisms which served as the main cod sources bashir et al 2019 kim et al 2010 yang et al 2013 meanwhile the disintegration of was from the combined alk uls pretreatments significantly increased soluble nh4 n and no3 n levels in the supernatant fig s3 this is consistent with previous studies pilli et al 2011 fathali et al 2019 the results suggested that the concentration of the discharged was was another significant factor affecting sludge solubilization when exposed to different combined alk uls pretreatments parameters fig 3 from an efficiency and economic perspective the optimal combined parameters for sludge disintegration at sludge concentrations from 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 g l were selected based on results of the orthogonal experiment shown in fig 3 table 3 shows there were 8 30 experimental sets alk dosage sei t ts and the corresponding c o d r e l n h 4 n r e l and n o 3 n r e l released from was these were collected as the dataset to develop the bpann model according to eq 3 3 2 performance of the modified ao alk uls system the ao alk uls system for treating synthetic wastewater at low c n ratios table 3 was operated under different rslr values and the associated values of cod nitrogen removal rates and excess sludge reduction were assessed the nh4 n concentrations and c n loading rates ranged from 100 to 150 and 1 to 5 respectively and were introduced at the influent of the ao alk uls system table 3 the lysates released from sludge disintegration using optimal combined parameters at different sludge concentrations section 3 1 fig s3 were supplied as an external carbon source for the ao alk uls system fig 4 a shows the cod removal efficiency performances in the control and the combined ao alk uls systems at a sludge concentration of 15 23 0 71 g l in the sludge pretreatment tank the average effluent cod removal efficiencies in the control ao system were 78 2 84 4 93 4 94 3 and 95 4 at influent c n ratios of 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively the effluent cod concentrations from the ao alk uls system were 41 38 35 32 and 43 mg l respectively corresponding to cod removal efficiencies of approximately 73 0 93 6 in comparison cod removal efficiencies in the combined ao alk uls system slightly deteriorated this was because a portion of sludge lysates could not participate in the microorganism anabolism but remained in the effluent lin et al 2012 yang et al 2015 besides when the pretreated sludge lysate was recycled with a low c n of 1 5 into the ao alk uls system the actual influent c n ratios were 8 2 8 3 8 4 9 6 and 8 0 at rslr values of 12 7 9 8 and 4 respectively fig 4a shows that the cod removal efficiencies experienced an upward trend with the increase in cod n ratios from the ao alk uls system this result was consistent with the study of gong et al 2018 fig 4b compares the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in influent and effluent for the control ao and the combined ao alk uls systems in fig 4b shows that effluent nh4 n concentrations for the control ao were 28 4 14 4 18 7 12 1 and 7 6 mg l while the average effluent nh4 n concentrations for the ao alk uls system were 3 1 2 6 2 1 1 2 and 3 3 mg l respectively this corresponded to nh4 n removal efficiencies of 97 99 0 under the same conditions lower average no3 n concentration in the effluent from the combined ao alk uls systems were 10 9 11 6 12 1 13 6 and 9 5 mg l respectively fig 4c cod generally acts as a limiting factor in the denitrification process to remove nitrogen yang et al 2015 applying pretreated sludge lysate as the external carbon source offers an appropriate solution to this problem results showed that the bnr efficiency was significantly improved in the ao alk uls system treating low c n wastewater this indicated that the denitrification occurring in the anoxic process principally depended on the supply of alk uls pretreated sludge lysate as the external carbon source compared with the ao alk uls system denitrification was not efficient in the control ao due to low organic carbon in influent figs 4b and c during 14 days of the lab scale experiment the cumulative excess sludge yields from the control ao system were approximately 5 7 8 1 20 2 22 7 and 28 2 g under low c n ratios ranging from 1 to 5 respectively however there was no excess sludge production from the combined ao alk uls system at the optimal rslr of 12 7 9 8 and 4 at the same respective c n ratios this finding was consistent with previous studies yoon et al 2004 yoon and lee 2005 in this study comparative results with respect to the effect revealed that an influent c n between 8 0 1 0 would be ideal to efficiently achieve good nutrient removal performance and to reduce in situ sludge within the combined ao alk uls system for treating low c n wastewater see table 3 this study found that good effluent quality and zero sludge production could be successfully achieved in this ao alk uls system operated under a suitable rslr economic assessment of the combined alk uls pretreatment is an essential factor for evaluating the feasibility of ao alk uls system for practical application the conventional ao system supplied with naac as the external carbon source to achieve the same c n ratio in the influent was run as the control a comparative analysis of energy and profit was performed for both systems and the results are summarized in section s2 and table s3 si in this study a 12 of the pretreated sludge lysate recycled with a low c n of 1 was computed energy and cost requirement for the ao alk uls system for instance the control system requires a higher cost than the ao alk uls system 32 20 10 3 us d vs 9 56 10 3 us d respectively the ao alk uls system was economically more feasible with a 70 3 reduction in costs per day compared with the control system table s3 the cost of the combined ao alk uls system is associated with three factors the amount of naoh used into the sludge pretreatment tank the electricity cost of uls energy during the sludge pretreatment and the saved electricity cost of additional excess sludge disposal the sludge lysate reutilized to the ao alk uls system shows a cleaner production of excess sludge with a higher economic benefit the proposed mode of ao alk uls system is energetically and economically beneficial than traditional wastewater treatment this study compared each sludge concentration with different influent c n ratios the effluent cod nh4 n and no3 n and the excess sludge yields from ao alk uls system these were controlled and compared at different rslr values data was not given in this study the optimal rslr under each condition was selected as the dataset to develop the bpann model as shown in table 3 to assess the real time control strategy of rslr that could yield the optimum performances of the effluent quality and excess sludge reduction results from different low c n loads with different pretreated sludge concentrations were applied as the dataset sections 3 1 and 3 2 table 3 to develop the bpann model after selecting the effective data set the original data set was divided randomly into three bpann subsets train validation and test with 30 data sets including 8 30 input vectors and 3 30 output vectors to develop the bpann model 80 of the original data set was randomly assigned to the training subset and 20 to the validation subset to represent the testing subset 20 of the original data was randomly chosen to ensure the stability of the model the bpann was trained by using the levenberg marquardt training algorithm for a maximum of 10 000 epochs the levenberg marquardt algorithm gives the optimum models for training and testing data the input and output variables selected to be used with the bpann and that predicted the optimum rslr in the combined ao alk uls system are provided in table 3 3 3 combined ao alk uls system optimization using bpann modeling the topology of a bpann is determined by the quantity of layers total of neurons in each layer and the nature of the transmission functions the training of the bpann is the next vital step in model development da silva ribeiro et al 2019 all applied bpann models in this study had an input layer with 8 neurons corresponding to cod inf nh 4 n inf no 3 n inf naoh dosage sei t and rslr the output layer was comprised of 3 neurons corresponding to effluent concentrations of co d eff nh 4 n eff and no 3 n eff from the ao alk uls system in addition the topology contained 12 neurons in hidden layer 1 8 neurons in hidden layer 2 and 4 neurons in hidden layer 3 these were adopted for the bpann modeling process fig s1 to develop the bpann in this study the activation functions applied to the neurons of the hidden and output layers were logsig and purelin respectively the applied training algorithm was levenberg marquardt before the training of the bpann network the data were normalized between 0 1 to minimize the influence of larger values on the smaller ones and to decrease the computation time by using eq 6 fig 5 a displays the changes in mse values obtained using the levenberg marquardt training algorithm by selecting several functions the training was completed after 64 iterations fig 5b shows the training state the gradient value adaptive value and validation check value at epoch 64 were 1 07 10 4 1 0 10 5 and 44 respectively the adaptive value was responsible for the weight adjustments during network training hu et al 2017 in each iteration the model self studies the weight and bias parameters involved in the bpann topology structure the learning effect is evaluated by the mse according to eq s4 and the learning method is given as a gradient descent fig 6 shows the corresponding visual agreement and correlations between the experimental data and the bpann output the proposed bpann model demonstrated significant performance in predicting and simulating experimental datasets effluent quality the correlation plots and associated coefficient of determination r2 indicated that the bpann efficiently predicted the experimental dataset hu et al 2017 performance with the training validation testing and all subsets achieved a level of 0 9987 0 9566 0 9406 and 0 9513 respectively this indicated a good fit between the predicted and experimental values for effluent co d eff nh 4 n eff and no 3 n eff from the ao alk uls system using bpann for different inputs the positive performance efficacy of the bpann from this study could be explained by the interactions between the input and output parameters antwi et al 2018 consequently using the proposed bpann as a model for a real time control strategy for the rslr under different influent low c n ratios successfully captured complex behavior and trends present among the variables of the combined ao alk uls system 4 discussion data availability is no longer a limiting factor when using process modeling algorithms due to the development of real time data monitoring approaches gopakumar et al 2018 han et al 2018 pang et al 2019 the quick response nature of bpann modeling enables them to provide effective online system optimizing control strategies for wwtps this study was the first to implement real time optimal control strategies for a combined lysis cryptic bnr system using bpann modeling under different influent low c n loads the verification tests assessing model performance found a high goodness of fit between the model and the results fig 6 the results demonstrated that the proposed bpann model provides proper and successful intelligent modeling and stable optimal control strategies under fluctuating low c n loads with changes in the pretreated sludge concentrations the proposed bpann model offers the significant advantage that can ensure inherent adaptability for a dynamic environment future studies in this area should consider other factors that influence the selection and operation of the combined lysis cryptic bnr systems these could include different influent components distinct technic characteristics natural conditions and social situations the many possible variations in factors increase the challenges and difficulties involved in implementing the optimal operational control tasks in practical applications moreover ann efficiency could be further improved by adjusting their network topology and through further training to demonstrate the robustness of the method chen et al 2019 the robustness of anns has paved a new way to study optimized control strategies in a way that addresses nonlinear and multivariable biological wastewater treatment systems with complex dynamics 5 conclusions in this study we constructed a multi layered bpann model to realize real time decision making strategies with respect to rslr in an ao alk uls system treating low c n domestic wastewater compared to the control ao system ao alk uls system removed more than 97 99 of the ammonia nitrogen with zero excess sludge production the bpann model demonstrated significant performance of all subset r2 of 0 9513 this indicates that a highly complex and dynamic system such as the lysis cryptic bnr system could be modeled in real time using a more

municipal and industrial wastewater soares 2020 and are crucial in improving the water environments jin et al 2014 currently the treatment efficiency and capacity of existing wwtps worldwide are facing increasingly severe challenges bao et al 2019 pang et al 2019 for example excess sludge is an unpleasant byproduct of wastewater treatment it is produced in large quantities and accounts for approximately 50 60 of the total operational cost of wwtps guo et al 2013 the substantial production of excess sludge creates a heavy environmental burden and poses a significant hazard if not appropriately handled existing wwtps also experience issues related to the considerable amount of non standard wastewater discharge and significant irregular operational problems zhang et al 2016 in chine 3508 wwtps had been built in 31 provinces by the end of 2013 xie 2020 of these almost 90 have unavoidable problems with nutrient removal jin et al 2014 found that approximately 50 of wwtps could not meet the nitrogen discharge standard ammonia nitrogen nh4 n is the main compound of the reactive nitrogen introduced into natural waters by industrial domestic and agricultural wastewater and is therefore the target of most nitrogen removal processes in domestic wastewater the influent nh4 n accounts for approximately 60 of the total nitrogen which ranges in concentrations from 20 mg l to 80 mg l gao et al 2011 akaboci et al 2018 pijuan et al 2020 high nitrogen loading reactors are typically run with nh4 n concentrations above 200 mg l pelaz et al 2018 mojiri et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 and are used with industrial wastewater or side stream municipal wastewater li et al 2020 one of the factors that limit the efficiency of biological nitrogen removal bnr from domestic wastewater is an insufficient supply of organic carbon sources in low strength wastewater unfavorable conditions such as a low influent carbon to nitrogen c n ratio make it harder for a single sludge operation process to meet strict discharge standards chen et al 2011 solutions for addressing this problem consistently apply external organic compounds which increases the operating costs or the denitrification time antileo et al 2013 there is growing interest in mechanisms for reutilizing excess sludge as a valuable organic resource previous studies have developed various physical chemical and biological combination lysis cryptic methods to address this need kim et al 2010 yang et al 2012 tian et al 2015 bashir et al 2019 the microbial cell lysate released from the disintegration of sludge can be used as a valuable carbon source to improve bnr during the wastewater treatment process pilli et al 2011 yang et al 2015 fathali et al 2019 many studies have explored enhanced bnr processes combined with different lysis cryptic methods lysis cryptic bnr system guo et al 2013 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2015 however in practice the optimal real time operation of this lysis cryptic bnr system is difficult or even impossible due to the large variability involved in the coupled wastewater treatment process some of these variations include different sludge disintegration parameters that are applied to the sludge yields from the bnr system different domestic wastewater with low c n ratios and different influent organic loading levels induced by the sludge lysate return ratio rslr chen et al 2011 yang et al 2015 li et al 2018 owing to the complicated relationships among these influencing factors and their nonlinear dynamic behaviors optimizing the performance of this combined system is a challenge artificial intelligence techniques such as artificial neural networks anns can be used for complex problems to attain high operational performance in a nonlinear fashion chen et al 2017 they can also learn and capture the nonlinear relationships among variables multi input output in a complex coupled system without pre existing knowledge of the system physics antwi et al 2018 huggi and mise 2019 ismail et al 2019 in recent years anns have been employed for numerous wastewater treatment issues due to their high precision and predictability compared to other models such as the support vector machine statistical regression models or mathematical stochastic methods djeddou and achour 2015 giwa et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 khatri et al 2020 the ann model is used to predict the removal efficiency dehghani et al 2020a 2020b the biotreatment effluent variables of wastewater khatri et al 2019 wastewater decolorization asgari et al 2020 shokoohi et al 2020 bioreactor performance nadiri et al 2018 and real time chemical dosing wu and lo 2008 during wastewater treatment process many researchers recommend anns for predicting water quality measures such as total suspended solids tss biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod and nh4 n ráduly et al 2007 abba and elkiran 2017 the performance of wwtps can also be predicted using ann and they generally outperform regression based models for wastewater treatment bagheri et al 2015 although in relevant literatures a number of experimental and numerical analyses have been conducted on wastewater contaminant removal and in situ sludge reduction by different lysis cryptic methods lin et al 2012 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2015 the performance of bnr from the combined system involving the biological reaction and the sludge lysis cryptic pretreatment is complicated and dependent on many factors such as the non uniformity and variability of influent organic loadings influent cod nh4 n no3 n etc the initial sludge concentration the optimized sludge lysis cryptic parameters and the coupled operation conditions reaction time rslr etc owing to the strong coupling and large variability the optimal real time operation of the lysis cryptic bnr system requires a non linear modeling technique such as ann that can account for the complexity and interdependence of the combined process to the authors knowledge the ann technique has not been used to study how to realize real time intelligent decision making and continuous optimal control strategies for the combined lysis cryptic bnr system treating wastewater with a low c n ratio furthermore there is still a lack of ann models that map multivariable of biological wastewater treatment and sludge lysis cryptic pretreatment in a combined lysis cryptic bnr system following a reliable and intelligent decision making strategy this is crucial in order to provide wwtps with information for proactive management and decision making this study applied the ann model to study the combined lysis cryptic bnr system with the goal of real time dynamic response and process optimization control as a result the study also developed new optimization modeling methods in the field of enhanced bnr and in situ sludge reduction for wastewater with low cod n ratios as a model system a conventional anoxic oxic ao bioreactor fig 1 a was constructed then a combined alkaline and ultrasonication alk uls pretreatment was applied to represent the sludge lysis cryptic method due to their previously demonstrated impressive synthetic effects kim et al 2010 tian et al 2015 finally a combined ao alk uls system equipped with online cod nh4 n no3 n and sludge concentration monitoring devices was developed fig 1b the objectives of this study were i to determine the optimal sludge disintegration parameters for the combined alk uls pretreatment under variable sludge concentrations produced from the ao system and ii to develop the ann ao alk uls system to establish a real time control strategy for the rslr under different influent low c n ratios 2 material and methods 2 1 sewage sludge the waste activated sludge was used in this study was collected from a local full scale municipal wwtp in harbin china before the experiments debris was filtered out of the was different concentrations of was were then obtained through settling was samples at 4 c for 24 48 h the supernatant was discarded different sludge concentrations with thicknesses ranging from 10 g total solid ts l to 35 g ts l were prepared for further study table 1 provides the main characteristics of the sludge samples 2 2 combined alk uls pretreatment optimization and selection of input variables for ann model in the combined alk uls pretreatment excess sludge was disintegrated using an alk pretreatment at naoh dosages of 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 g naoh g ts this is described in the alk pretreatment single factor experiment and the combined treated with uls pretreatment step at specific energy inputs seis of 15 18 and 21 kj g ts see supporting information si sections s1 1 and s1 2 to simulate the sludge concentration in the sludge pretreatment tank of the ao alk uls system fig 1b six sludge concentrations ranging from 10 to 35 g l ts concentrations of 10 43 0 45 15 23 0 71 20 38 0 68 24 77 0 82 30 61 0 75 34 68 1 33 g l respectively table 1 were selected to align with levels in the pretreatment tank from the sludge thickening tank the disintegration degree dd of excess sludge was calculated as the ratio of the increase in soluble cod scod due to the combined alk uls pretreatment to the maximum possible increase in scod as described in the si for the combined alk uls optimization each test was conducted for 60 min with sampling every 10 min the sludge samples were first centrifuged and then filtered through a 0 45 μm filter prior to determine the scod each test was conducted in triplicate 2 3 ao alk uls system operation and selection of input and output variables for ann model this study applied two parallel lab scale continuous flow ao systems the sludge characteristics and effluent concentrations in the systems were maintained at a steady state after one month of cultivation one ao system was operated as the control fig 1a the other ao system was modified into an ao alk uls system by inserting the alk uls pretreatment tank in the sludge return line fig 1b for the modified ao alk uls system a peristaltic pump with a time relay pumped the settled sludge from the secondary settling tank into the sludge thickening tank the was in the thickening tank was further concentrated for 4 h it was then pumped into the sludge pretreatment tank after 1 h of alk uls pretreatment the prepared sludge lysate was pumped into the sludge lysate tank for recycling an online sludge concentration detection probe mlss 530 yantai chemins instrument co ltd china was inserted into the sludge pretreatment tank to detect the sludge concentration then the sludge in the sludge pretreatment tank was disintegrated this was done by applying the optimized alk uls pretreatment parameters obtained in section 3 1 2 throughout the experiment the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss was controlled at 3500 500 mg l by discharging sludge from the secondary settling tank the dissolved oxygen do in the aerobic zone was controlled at 2 4 mg l table s1 provides detailed operation parameters of the two systems the synthetic wastewater which fed to the control and to the ao alk uls reactors was prepared daily nh4cl was added to the synthetic wastewater to simulate the nh4 n concentrations found in wastewater 100 mg l 120 mg l 125 mg l and 150 mg l the mineral composition was as follows 43 9 mg l kh2po4 40 mg l cacl2 and 75 mg l mgso4 sodium acetate in chemical oxygen demand solution was used as a carbon source at the following concentrations 150 mg cod l 600 mg cod l table 3 to achieve the desired initial c n ratios a trace element solution 1 ml was added as described by cui et al 2020 detection probes were inserted into the influent effluent and sludge lysate tanks to assess the different influent variables related to different recycled sludge lysate the variables included online cod cod 206 yantai chemins instrument co ltd china online nh4 n nhn 202 yantai chemins instrument co ltd china and online no3 n nitratax sc hach usa concentrations the goal was to optimize the rslr in the bpann ao alk uls system as such the ao alk uls system was fed with the synthetic substrate at low c n ratios ranging from 1 to 5 the influent cod and nh4 n concentrations ranged from 150 to 600 mg l and 100 150 mg l respectively data were collected for 14 days at each concentration combination for the ann training process before recycling the pretreated sludge samples were neutralized to a ph of 7 0 0 5 using an automatic ph control liquid adding instrument sc 200a changsha sichen instrument technology co ltd china the same process was used for the influent 2 4 development of ann model in this study the backpropagation bp algorithm was used to develop the backpropagation artificial neural network bpann model the bpann

were the dependent predicted variables the neurons count at each layer depended on the complexity of the process antwi et al 2018 the neurons at different layers were connected through weights serving as the adjustable parameter of the network therefore neurons at the input layer were introduced to the hidden layer using weights ismail et al 2019 this was accomplished after adding weighted inputs

factory ningbo china triplicate measurements were performed in this study n 3 mean error bar 3 results and discussion 3 1 combined alk uls pretreatment optimization 3 1 1 sludge solubilization by individual alk and uls pretreatments fig s2 presents the effects of individual alk and uls pretreatments on was disintegration for the alk pretreatment increases in ph resulted in more solubilization of organics into a liquid phase the released scod concentrations were 1987 89 2565 85 3466 101 3767 117 4042 150 and 4121 136 mg l which corresponded to dds of 15 1 0 7 19 6 0 6 26 8 0 8 29 1 0 9 31 3 1 2 and 31 9 1 1 respectively at naoh dosages of 0 025 0 05 0 10 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 g naoh g ts respectively figs s2a and b as a result the sludge ph increased from 6 69 to 7 6 9 3 10 4 11 8 12 4 and 12 7 respectively by the end of each test compared to previous studies increased ph values in was created a hypertonic environment in microbial cells this resulted in a loss of turgor pressure and integrity neyens et al 2003 which led to a release of internal organic matter into the liquid results showed that the significant dd at a higher naoh dosage 0 15 naoh g ts was more conducive to microbial cell lysis the results of the individual uls pretreatment experiments are shown in figs s2c and d similar to alk pretreatment there was a significant transfer of organic matter from the particulate matter to the soluble fraction that occurred through individual uls pretreatment figs s2d shows that when sei changed from 15 to 21 kj g ts between reaction times of 40 60 min the individual uls pretreatment caused considerable increases in dds of was according to the results of the two individual pretreatments naoh dosages of 0 15 0 20 and 0 25 g g ts and sei dosages of 15 18 and 21 kj g ts fig s2 were observed to be the optimum dosages for cell lysis these levels were selected for the subsequent combined pretreatment studies 3 1 2 sludge solubilization by combined alk uls pretreatments as expected the combined alk uls pretreatments synergetic effect significantly enhanced the dds in all experimental conditions fig 3 for example this study found that 31 9 and 34 8 of dds achieved with a naoh dosage of 0 25 g g ts and a sei of 18 kj g ts respectively were obtained in individual tests under sludge concentration of 15 23 0 71 g l fig s2 a high dd of 78 6 was achieved with the combined pretreatment due to the synergetic effect of the combined alk uls pretreatments an 11 9 increase in solubilization was achieved when the same sei 18 kj g ts and naoh dosage 0 25 g g ts were combined and applied to the was the structure of cell walls weakened by alk pretreatment was more vulnerable to the generation of shear forces by the uls pretreatment enabling hydroxyl radicals to reach deep inside the was cells in an exceedingly effective way kim et al 2010 notably consistent with the results with individual tests fig s2 the curve trends of the scod released into liquid were markedly divided into a rapid raising stage and a gradual stabilization stage fig 3 fig 3 shows that a maximum dd of 78 6 was achieved when applying a combined pretreatment of a naoh dosage of 0 25 g naoh g ts and a sei of 18 kj g ts under an initial sludge concentration of 15 23 0 71 g l however only a 0 9 increase in dd was achieved when the naoh dosage was increased from 0 20 to 0 25 g naoh g ts combined with a sei of 18 kj g based on these results a 0 20 g dose of naoh g ts combined with a 18 kj g ts dose of sei was considered to be optimal and profitable for sludge disintegration and could efficiently reduce the economic burden more importantly fig 3 shows that sludge concentrations thickening from 10 g l to 35 g l resulted in a critical increment of organic matter entering into the soluble phases this is because the solid matter in was is mostly organic matter and microorganisms which served as the main cod sources bashir et al 2019 kim et al 2010 yang et al 2013 meanwhile the disintegration of was from the combined alk uls pretreatments significantly increased soluble nh4 n and no3 n levels in the supernatant fig s3 this is consistent with previous studies pilli et al 2011 fathali et al 2019 the results suggested that the concentration of the discharged was was another significant factor affecting sludge solubilization when exposed to different combined alk uls pretreatments parameters fig 3 from an efficiency and economic perspective the optimal combined parameters for sludge disintegration at sludge concentrations from 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 g l were selected based on results of the orthogonal experiment shown in fig 3 table 3 shows there were 8 30 experimental sets alk dosage sei t ts and the corresponding c o d r e l n h 4 n r e l and n o 3 n r e l released from was these were collected as the dataset to develop the bpann model according to eq 3 3 2 performance of the modified ao alk uls system the ao alk uls system for treating synthetic wastewater at low c n ratios table 3 was operated under different rslr values and the associated values of cod nitrogen removal rates and excess sludge reduction were assessed the nh4 n concentrations and c n loading rates ranged from 100 to 150 and 1 to 5 respectively and were introduced at the influent of the ao alk uls system table 3 the lysates released from sludge disintegration using optimal combined parameters at different sludge concentrations section 3 1 fig s3 were supplied as an external carbon source for the ao alk uls system fig 4 a shows the cod removal efficiency performances in the control and the combined ao alk uls systems at a sludge concentration of 15 23 0 71 g l in the sludge pretreatment tank the average effluent cod removal efficiencies in the control ao system were 78 2 84 4 93 4 94 3 and 95 4 at influent c n ratios of 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively the effluent cod concentrations from the ao alk uls system were 41 38 35 32 and 43 mg l respectively corresponding to cod removal efficiencies of approximately 73 0 93 6 in comparison cod removal efficiencies in the combined ao alk uls system slightly deteriorated this was because a portion of sludge lysates could not participate in the microorganism anabolism but remained in the effluent lin et al 2012 yang et al 2015 besides when the pretreated sludge lysate was recycled with a low c n of 1 5 into the ao alk uls system the actual influent c n ratios were 8 2 8 3 8 4 9 6 and 8 0 at rslr values of 12 7 9 8 and 4 respectively fig 4a shows that the cod removal efficiencies experienced an upward trend with the increase in cod n ratios from the ao alk uls system this result was consistent with the study of gong et al 2018 fig 4b compares the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in influent and effluent for the control ao and the combined ao alk uls systems in fig 4b shows that effluent nh4 n concentrations for the control ao were 28 4 14 4 18 7 12 1 and 7 6 mg l while the average effluent nh4 n concentrations for the ao alk uls system were 3 1 2 6 2 1 1 2 and 3 3 mg l respectively this corresponded to nh4 n removal efficiencies of 97 99 0 under the same conditions lower average no3 n concentration in the effluent from the combined ao alk uls systems were 10 9 11 6 12 1 13 6 and 9 5 mg l respectively fig 4c cod generally acts as a limiting factor in the denitrification process to remove nitrogen yang et al 2015 applying pretreated sludge lysate as the external carbon source offers an appropriate solution to this problem results showed that the bnr efficiency was significantly improved in the ao alk uls system treating low c n wastewater this indicated that the denitrification occurring in the anoxic process principally depended on the supply of alk uls pretreated sludge lysate as the external carbon source compared with the ao alk uls system denitrification was not efficient in the control ao due to low organic carbon in influent figs 4b and c during 14 days of the lab scale experiment the cumulative excess sludge yields from the control ao system were approximately 5 7 8 1 20 2 22 7 and 28 2 g under low c n ratios ranging from 1 to 5 respectively however there was no excess sludge production from the combined ao alk uls system at the optimal rslr of 12 7 9 8 and 4 at the same respective c n ratios this finding was consistent with previous studies yoon et al 2004 yoon and lee 2005 in this study comparative results with respect to the effect revealed that an influent c n between 8 0 1 0 would be ideal to efficiently achieve good nutrient removal performance and to reduce in situ sludge within the combined ao alk uls system for treating low c n wastewater see table 3 this study found that good effluent quality and zero sludge production could be successfully achieved in this ao alk uls system operated under a suitable rslr economic assessment of the combined alk uls pretreatment is an essential factor for evaluating the feasibility of ao alk uls system for practical application the conventional ao system supplied with naac as the external carbon source to achieve the same c n ratio in the influent was run as the control a comparative analysis of energy and profit was performed for both systems and the results are summarized in section s2 and table s3 si in this study a 12 of the pretreated sludge lysate recycled with a low c n of 1 was computed energy and cost requirement for the ao alk uls system for instance the control system requires a higher cost than the ao alk uls system 32 20 10 3 us d vs 9 56 10 3 us d respectively the ao alk uls system was economically more feasible with a 70 3 reduction in costs per day compared with the control system table s3 the cost of the combined ao alk uls system is associated with three factors the amount of naoh used into the sludge pretreatment tank the electricity cost of uls energy during the sludge pretreatment and the saved electricity cost of additional excess sludge disposal the sludge lysate reutilized to the ao alk uls system shows a cleaner production of excess sludge with a higher economic benefit the proposed mode of ao alk uls system is energetically and economically beneficial than traditional wastewater treatment this study compared each sludge concentration with different influent c n ratios the effluent cod nh4 n and no3 n and the excess sludge yields from ao alk uls system these were controlled and compared at different rslr values data was not given in this study the optimal rslr under each condition was selected as the dataset to develop the bpann model as shown in table 3 to assess the real time control strategy of rslr that could yield the optimum performances of the effluent quality and excess sludge reduction results from different low c n loads with different pretreated sludge concentrations were applied as the dataset sections 3 1 and 3 2 table 3 to develop the bpann model after selecting the effective data set the original data set was divided randomly into three bpann subsets train validation and test with 30 data sets including 8 30 input vectors and 3 30 output vectors to develop the bpann model 80 of the original data set was randomly assigned to the training subset and 20 to the validation subset to represent the testing subset 20 of the original data was randomly chosen to ensure the stability of the model the bpann was trained by using the levenberg marquardt training algorithm for a maximum of 10 000 epochs the levenberg marquardt algorithm gives the optimum models for training and testing data the input and output variables selected to be used with the bpann and that predicted the optimum rslr in the combined ao alk uls system are provided in table 3 3 3 combined ao alk uls system optimization using bpann modeling the topology of a bpann is determined by the quantity of layers total of neurons in each layer and the nature of the transmission functions the training of the bpann is the next vital step in model development da silva ribeiro et al 2019 all applied bpann models in this study had an input layer with 8 neurons corresponding to cod inf nh 4 n inf no 3 n inf naoh dosage sei t and rslr the output layer was comprised of 3 neurons corresponding to effluent concentrations of co d eff nh 4 n eff and no 3 n eff from the ao alk uls system in addition the topology contained 12 neurons in hidden layer 1 8 neurons in hidden layer 2 and 4 neurons in hidden layer 3 these were adopted for the bpann modeling process fig s1 to develop the bpann in this study the activation functions applied to the neurons of the hidden and output layers were logsig and purelin respectively the applied training algorithm was levenberg marquardt before the training of the bpann network the data were normalized between 0 1 to minimize the influence of larger values on the smaller ones and to decrease the computation time by using eq 6 fig 5 a displays the changes in mse values obtained using the levenberg marquardt training algorithm by selecting several functions the training was completed after 64 iterations fig 5b shows the training state the gradient value adaptive value and validation check value at epoch 64 were 1 07 10 4 1 0 10 5 and 44 respectively the adaptive value was responsible for the weight adjustments during network training hu et al 2017 in each iteration the model self studies the weight and bias parameters involved in the bpann topology structure the learning effect is evaluated by the mse according to eq s4 and the learning method is given as a gradient descent fig 6 shows the corresponding visual agreement and correlations between the experimental data and the bpann output the proposed bpann model demonstrated significant performance in predicting and simulating experimental datasets effluent quality the correlation plots and associated coefficient of determination r2 indicated that the bpann efficiently predicted the experimental dataset hu et al 2017 performance with the training validation testing and all subsets achieved a level of 0 9987 0 9566 0 9406 and 0 9513 respectively this indicated a good fit between the predicted and experimental values for effluent co d eff nh 4 n eff and no 3 n eff from the ao alk uls system using bpann for different inputs the positive performance efficacy of the bpann from this study could be explained by the interactions between the input and output parameters antwi et al 2018 consequently using the proposed bpann as a model for a real time control strategy for the rslr under different influent low c n ratios successfully captured complex behavior and trends present among the variables of the combined ao alk uls system 4 discussion data availability is no longer a limiting factor when using process modeling algorithms due to the development of real time data monitoring approaches gopakumar et al 2018 han et al 2018 pang et al 2019 the quick response nature of bpann modeling enables them to provide effective online system optimizing control strategies for wwtps this study was the first to implement real time optimal control strategies for a combined lysis cryptic bnr system using bpann modeling under different influent low c n loads the verification tests assessing model performance found a high goodness of fit between the model and the results fig 6 the results demonstrated that the proposed bpann model provides proper and successful intelligent modeling and stable optimal control strategies under fluctuating low c n loads with changes in the pretreated sludge concentrations the proposed bpann model offers the significant advantage that can ensure inherent adaptability for a dynamic environment future studies in this area should consider other factors that influence the selection and operation of the combined lysis cryptic bnr systems these could include different influent components distinct technic characteristics natural conditions and social situations the many possible variations in factors increase the challenges and difficulties involved in implementing the optimal operational control tasks in practical applications moreover ann efficiency could be further improved by adjusting their network topology and through further training to demonstrate the robustness of the method chen et al 2019 the robustness of anns has paved a new way to study optimized control strategies in a way that addresses nonlinear and multivariable biological wastewater treatment systems with complex dynamics 5 conclusions in this study we constructed a multi layered bpann model to realize real time decision making strategies with respect to rslr in an ao alk uls system treating low c n domestic wastewater compared to the control ao system ao alk uls system removed more than 97 99 of the ammonia nitrogen with zero excess sludge production the bpann model demonstrated significant performance of all subset r2 of 0 9513 this indicates that a highly complex and dynamic system such as the lysis cryptic bnr system could be modeled in real time using a more feasible and quicker approach than in the past using the bpann model author contribution shan shan yang conceptualization methodology supervision validation writing original draft review editing

17332,dams are important for flood control water storage irrigation electric generation navigation and have been regarded as the largest anthropogenic disturbance in aquatic ecosystems however how dams impact nitrogen transformation on a large watershed scale remained less studied to explicitly address the impact of dams on nitrogen transformation we used 16s rrna gene sequencing to investigate the microbial dynamics and ecological processes under different dam conditions along the yangtze river as microbial communities are playing a key role in aquatic nitrogen transformation compared with landforms dams exerted a more significant impact on the distribution patterns of microbial communities along the yangtze river the results showed that by controlling suspended sand concentration dams filtered keystone species reshaped distribution of metacommunities and mediated ecological assembly processes of microbial communities moreover direct causal relationships between dams and nitrogen transformation were chained via microbial communities to summarize by combining knowledge in hydrology microbial ecology and biogeochemistry this research exhibited the impact of different dams on the nitrogen transformation along a large river and the key roles of suspended sand and microbial communities were emphasized we anticipate a more precise modelling and prediction of nitrogen transformation in large watersheds which may provide new perspectives for controlling the nitrogen in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dams microbial community assembly process nitrogen yangtze river 1 introduction nitrogen transport and transformation have always been a research focus in the aquatic environment especially in large river networks schmadel et al 2018 alexander et al 2000 gomez velez et al 2015 quantification of these processes is of increasing importance for water quality restoration and related environmental policy making le moal et al 2019 yu et al 2019 dams influence more than half of the world s large river networks nilsson et al 2005 wang et al 2018 they change hydrological conditions of natural rivers form environmental gradients and provide unique habitats in diverse landforms thus facilitating distinct distribution patterns of microbial communities in fluvial networks poff and schmidt 2016 wang et al 2017 liu et al 2018 and finally impact the nitrogen transformation kuypers et al 2018 wang et al 2018 however little research is focused on how dams impact microbial communities and nitrogen transformation in large river networks hydrological conditions and microbial activities are two main factors controlling the transport and transformation processes of nitrogen gomez velez et al 2015 effects of hydrological conditions on nitrogen transformation have been systematically explored yet the important role of microbial communities has been neglected or implicitly represented by damköhler number a hydrologic parameter marzadri et al 2017 schmadel et al 2018 since nitrogen transformation was mainly driven by microbial communities in aquatic environments graham et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 li et al 2019 microbial ecological concepts were adopted to better elucidate the mechanism of nitrogen transformation under dam impacts in ecology both composition and diversity of species in communities are influenced by basic ecological processes selection drift speciation and dispersal vellend 2010 among these deterministic processes i e homogeneous selection and variable selection and stochastic processes i e speciation ecological drift dispersal limitation and homogenizing dispersal have been well described by niche theory macarthur and wilson 2001 and neutral theory hubbell 2001 respectively in practice however these processes are combined to explain and model assembly and turnover of microbial communities chase et al 2011 stegen et al 2013 2012 vellend 2010 specifically the beta nearest taxon index βnti a metric based on a null model statistical framework has been used to quantify deterministic and stochastic ecological processes stegen et al 2013 2012 more recently the coupling of microbial communities with chemical mechanisms was proven in the hyporheic zone by the positive correlation between βnti and the change of carbon composition stegen et al 2018 2016 analogously we expect to integrate microbial communities in the effects of dams on the nitrogen transformation in the aquatic environment and provide new insights into the multidisciplinary intersection the yangtze river the longest river in asia runs through a watershed of 1 8 million km2 and houses a population of over 400 million liu et al 2019 in this large river the hydrological conditions are directly influenced by cascade dams and the three gorges dam the world s largest dam in terms of installed electric generating capacity tang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 on a large watershed scale hydrologic models nitrogen cycling diversity and ecology of microbial communities etc have been explored individually yet the influence of different types of dams on microbial communities and nitrogen biogeochemistry remain unexplored therefore to fill the gap between these disciplines our objectives were 1 to explore the microbial communities under different dam impacts along the mainstream of the yangtze river from 44 sites in 3 seasons 2 to analyse the distribution diversity and assembly patterns of these microbial communities 3 to evaluate the importance of dams in shifting nitrogen transformation in the yangtze river summarizing this research cascade dams and the three gorges dam led to distinct hydrological conditions in different zones along the yangtze river hence the microbial communities assembly processes and functions were shifted and finally nitrogen transformation in this large river network was imprinted 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sediment sampling yangtze river the largest river in china and the third longest river in the world originates in the qinghai tibetan plateau and flows eastward to the east china sea in this study from shigu to wusongkou a total of 44 sites along the mainstream of the yangtze river were sampled in august 2016 december 2016 and april 2017 from the upper reach of the yangtze river to the yangtze estuary the sampling range spanned 4 327 km all study sites were partitioned into groups according to the types of influences of dams they bear cascade dams and the three gorges dam the landforms where they were located mountain foothill basin foothill mountain and plain and the seasons when they were sampled april august and december partition by dam conditions were detailed hereafter according to the locations of the cascade dams and the three gorges dam 44 sampling sites were divided into 4 regions the first was cascade dams influenced region wherein 8 dams were operated this region contained 10 sites from shigu to luzhou the second region large dam influenced region where the water level fluctuated due to the impoundment and discharge of the three gorges reservoir contained 13 sites from zhutuo to miaohe the third region was directly downstream of the three gorges reservoir this large dam controlled region was in the middle reach of the yangtze river and it contained 12 sites from yichang to jiujiang in the fourth region no dams were constructed 9 non influenced sites from hukou to wusongkou near the yangtze estuary were in this region no extreme weather occurred during sampling periods physiochemical properties of surface sediment samples were measured almost synchronously i e within 1 week along the mainstream of the yangtze all the sampling sites

generate standard curves 2 4 partitioning of microbial communities two general approaches dirichlet multinomial mixture dmm and partitioning around the medoid pam were attempted to partition different environmental samples into different metacommunity types according to the structure of microbial communities i e genera level relative abundance ding and schloss 2014 holmes et al 2012 nakatsu et al 2015 metacommunity types represent different envirotypes of microbial communities different types of microbial communities with the impact of distinctive environmental conditions and they are automatically clustered by the algorithms without subjective decision of number of groups or arbitrarily decided cut off threshold for clustering analysis the number of dirichlet components was selected using the laplace approximation to the negative log model evidence the number which gives the minimum approximation is selected in comparison the number of pam components was selected using the maximum calinski harabasz or silhouette values for different partitions to validate the correlation between the partitioning results from metacommunity and other empirical grouping methods i e groupings based on landform types damming conditions and seasons fisher s exact tests and chi square tests were conducted using r language r core team 2013 2 5 distance dissimilarity correlation of microbial communities distance dissimilarity correlation patterns between microbial community and geographic distance or environmental distance were explored and visualized using linear regressions in r language r core team 2013 the bray curtis dissimilarity metric was used to examine differences in species composition and was quantified using the distance function in the ecodist package the weighted unique fraction weighted unifrac metric measuring the phylogenetic relatedness of whole communities was calculated using the gunifrac function in the unifrac package to measure the difference between observed phylogenetic community turnover and the mean of the null model deviations β nearest taxon index βnti was calculated using a modified comdistnt function in the picante package chase et al 2011 stegen et al 2012 the slope of the linear regression analysis was used as the indicator of the correlation the pairwise geographic distance was measured as the continuous actual sinuous channel length along the yangtze river between sampling sites the environmental distance was the standardized euclidean distance calculated using 10 physiochemical characteristics from each sampling site chen et al 2018 wu et al 2019 2 6 quantification of ecological processes of microbial communities niche theory and neutral theory are opposite to each other in the development of various ecological perspectives to detect which ecological processes are more important and to what magnitude they are influential in the assembly of microbial communities in this research region the quantifying calculation has been applied with parameters identical to the original algorithm proposed by stegen et al stegen et al 2013 2012 in short the beta mean nearest taxon distance βmntd were calculated between communities to represent the pairwise phylogenetic turnover subsequently based on the βmntd values of a null model the standard deviation of the observed βmntd were calculated this standard deviation is βnti representing the strength of environmental impacts in the community assembly and turnover processes to evaluate potential drivers of turnover of composition in microbial communities we correlated the pairwise βnti with changes in all measured physical and hydrologic variables i e depth velocity suspended sand concentration and median particle diameter tripathi et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the statistical significances of the resulting relationships were further tested with permutation based partial mantel tests 1 000 permutations using the mantel function in the ecodist package stegen et al 2016 2 7 construction of co occurrence networks of microbial communities the construction of co occurrence networks was achieved in three steps 1 selection of otus as nodes hubs of network 2 selection of highly correlated relations as edges connections 3 identification of keystones regional associated and persistent otus in the network according to the mass ratio hypothesis the dominant species and their traits contribute most to ecosystem functions as energies flow mostly through them smith and knapp 2003 finally 784 dominant otus were selected with both prevalence and abundance thresholds each selected otu presented in more than 20 of all samples and had a mean number of reads larger than 5 with all 784 otus involved 306 936 pairwise spearman correlations were calculated among all the pairwise correlations 45 014 of them were selected to represent the significant and strong co occurrence relationships with the absolute value of coefficient number ρ 0 4 and a p value 0 05 using these dominant otus as nodes and significant co occurrence relationships as edges a co occurrence network of all microbial communities along the yangtze river was established using r r core team 2013 similar to co occurrence network of all communities co occurrence networks of 4 regions described in study site and sediment sampling were also established topological properties for each node were calculated using igraph package csardi and nepusz 2006 degree and betweenness centrality are the most used properties of nodes in a network degree is the number of edges connected to the focused node and betweenness centrality is the number of shortest paths passing through the focused node röttjers and faust 2018 keystone taxa are defined with high degree 100 and low betweenness centrality values 3 000 and they are often regarded as key players in the community ma et al 2016 to better distinguish otus in the informative co occurrence network the definition of regional associated otus has been introduced to describe otus significantly more abundant mann whitney wilcoxon test p value 0 05 in one region than other regions inspired by the seasonal associated otus proposed by liu et al barberán et al 2012 liu et al 2018 contrast with regional associated otus persistent otus are defined as otus present in more than 20 of all samples whereas not significantly more abundant in any region liao et al 2016 saunders et al 2016 2 8 structural equation modelling structural equation modelling sem was used to explore direct and indirect relationships among all variables envisaged in the model in this study sem was conducted using lavaan package in r r core team 2013 before the sem analysis indices of alpha diversity quantities of functional genes and concentrations of nitrogen in different forms were treated using the principal component analysis pca to reduce the dimensions of variables guo et al 2013 liu et al 2018 for each variable group the first principal component explained more than 80 of the total variance therefore the first principal component from each pca was used in the sem several different conceptual structures were tested and the optimal one was identified with the highest comparative fit index cfi and the lowest root mean square error of approximation rmsea to exhibit and illustrate the importance and impact of microbial communities on the transformation of nitrogen taking place in the fluvial network two conceptual structures containing and not containing microbial communities were modelled respectively and compared deliberately li et al 2019 3 results 3 1 metacommunities along the yangtze river partitioned by different dam impacts in river networks microbial communities are influenced by different types of factors to differentiate effects of dam conditions landforms and seasons samples were accordingly grouped see study site and sediment sampling dmm and pam partitions were conducted to partition microbial communities into different metacommunity types see partitioning of microbial communities the dmm partitioning was more robust than pam partitioning of microbial communities with different rarity thresholds fig 1 a therefore was selected as the optimal partitioning method and 5 metacommunity types were finally clustered these distinctive metacommunities represent different types of microbial communities structures acclimated in a variety of habitats envirotypes they were clustered automatically into 5 groups without biased expectations and were illustrated both in the nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds plot fig 1b and in the map of the yangtze river basin fig 1c to get a more intuitive visualization to test the different associations between dam conditions landforms and seasons with the microbial communities preliminary groupings were tested with the optimal partitioning result of metacommunities using both fisher s exact test with monte carlo simulation and chi square test these tests indicated a more significant association of metacommunities partitioning to dam condition types fisher s exact test q 1 50 10 6 chi square test p 1 50 10 4 than to landform types fisher s exact test q 1 50 10 4 chi square test p 1 50 10 2 while no significant association between metacommunities partition with season types fisher s exact test q 0 05 chi square test p 0 05 was found fig 1d and supplementary table 1 3 2 divergent patterns of distance dissimilarity caused by cascade dams and the large dam to better explore the relationships between bacterial community dissimilarity and geographic and environmental distances the linear regressions of dissimilarities with these two distances were plotted in fig 2 to emphasize the divergent patterns of impacts caused by different types of dams samples were separated into 4 groups based on different impact of dams bray curtis dissimilarity weighted unifrac and βnti were calculated based on otus phylogenetic tree and correspondent taxonomic annotations these three metrics represent the bacterial community diversity phylogenetic diversity and significance of phylogenetic turnover separately and they were selected to describe the bacterial community dissimilarity and turnover see quantification of ecological processes of microbial communities comparing the relationships between bacterial community dissimilarity and geographic distance fig 2a c e among the four groups y1 y4 the influence of geographic distance showed a significant difference among the four regions and increased from upstream to downstream the distributions of bacterial communities within non influenced sites were largely controlled by geographic distance while communities in cascade dams influenced sites or large dam influenced sites were less affected by geographic properties sites under the influence or control of the large dam were taken together in the linear regression y5 comparing the impacts of large dam y5 and cascade dams y1 geographic distance played a more important role with higher r2 values and greater slope in the impacts of large dam y5 than in the cascade dams y1 furthermore all the three metrics of diversity were negatively correlated with geographic distance except βnti within the cascade dams influenced sites fig 2e y1 this indicated that bacterial community assembly processes in the cascade dams were less influenced by geographic distance which could also be demonstrated by the low correlation coefficient r 2 0 00 of this region taken together this series of linear regressions showed that both geographic distance and environmental distance were correlated p 0 001 with bacterial community dissimilarity in all regions suggesting their potential influence on the distribution of bacterial communities along the yangtze river the 6 linear regression results y0 y5 indicated that bray curtis unifrac and βnti all showed closer correlations with higher r2 values with geographic distance than with environmental distance in all groups 3 3 microbial ecological processes connected with hydrological conditions from a perspective of ecology turnover in microbial community assembly was governed by different proportions of deterministic processes homogeneous and variable selection stochastic processes dispersal limitation and homogenizing dispersal and a small proportion of undominated process ecological drift with all samples acquired in 44 sites in 3 seasons the ecological processes influencing the microbial communities were quantified separately in different dam impacted groups as shown in fig 3 in the algorithm βnti is a measure of community diversity which includes both the phylogenetic relations of species as well as the randomization of individuals replacement and dispersion see quantification of ecological processes of microbial community with the distribution of βnti values we quantified that deterministic processes played the dominant role 69 to 76 in the assembly and turnover of microbial communities along the yangtze river while stochastic processes and ecological drift only contributed 24 to 31 specifically comparing between groups the intervention of homogeneous selection is stronger in dams affected sites indicating that homogeneous environmental conditions in the dams affected region led to more similar structures among communities and the variable selection played a more important role in non influenced sites emphasizing the dissimilarity in communities caused by the effects of different biotic and abiotic conditions in the downstream non influenced region to get a deeper understanding of the assembly and turnover of microbial communities controlled by stochastic and deterministic processes a series of mantel tests between changes in physiochemical variables and βnti were evaluated only changes in suspended sand concentration and ammonium concentration showed a significant correlation p value 0 05 mantel coefficient r 0 13 and 0 25 with βnti supplementary table 2 separately in the cascade dams influenced region and the large dam influenced region no significant correlation was found between changes in physiochemical variables and βnti but downstream in the large dam controlled region and non influenced region changes in total nitrogen concentration ammonium concentration and velocity showed their correlations with βnti different correlations in separate regions reflected that different types of dams had distinct impacts on hydrological conditions and then the microbial communities in separate regions were altered these results showed that hydrological conditions represented by suspended sand concentration directly influence the assembly and turnover of microbial communities and microbial communities have direct correlations with nitrogen 3 4 co occurrence networks dominated by persistent otus in keystone otus to explore the topology of interspecies interactions co occurrence networks were established using dominant otus otus presenting in more than 20 of all samples and having a mean number of reads larger than 5 and significantly strong co occurrence relationships ρ 0 4 and p value 0 05 in spearman correlations in each topologic network otus were represented as nodes and their co occurrence relationships were represented as edges links more specifically nodes with high degree 100 and low betweenness centrality values 3 000 were identified as keystone otus for microbial communities along the yangtze river see construction of co occurrence networks of microbial communities finally 784 dominant otus and 45 014 significant strong co occurrence relationships were focused to represent the microbial communities in this research fig 4 differences were found between the keystone otus in 4 regions of different impacts of dams fig 4 the numbers of keystone otus augmented from the upper stream towards the downstream so did the abundance of keystone otus some keystone otus showed great regional distribution patterns implying different dam conditions influencing the microbial communities acidobacteria was identified as a keystone phylum in all regions but the cascade dams influenced region while cyanobacteria was identified as keystone phylum only in the large dam controlled region however more than 90 of keystone otus were persistent otus appeared in all regions fig 4 showing that prevalent persistent otus played key roles in the microbial communities in the fluvial network implying the transferring of most microorganisms by attaching themselves to suspended sands in water 3 5 aquatic nitrogen transformation imprinted by microbial communities to investigate a chain of direct and indirect effects of fluvial conditions suspended sands microbial communities on the nitrogen transformation structural equation modelling sem was used in this study to better exhibit and illustrate the impact of microbial communities on the nitrogen transformation models with and without microbial communities were compared in both models with and without microbial communities direct and reliable influences of depth on the velocity median particle diameter and suspended sand concentration were proven as illustrated in concrete arrows in fig 5 these direct and reliable influences were in coherence with existing research chen et al 2019 as shown in fig 5b microbial communities diversity genes and nitrogen concentration were also influenced by endogenous variables with significant and convincing correlations contrasting to the model with microbial communities in fig 5a without microbial communities and genes the endogenous dependent variables showed that their influences on nitrogen concentration links pointing to nitrogen concentration in dashed arrows were not statistically convincing moreover the model containing microbial communities and genes fig 5b significantly enhanced the predictability of nitrogen concentration on a global scale as the total variance of nitrogen concentration explained by the fixed factors improved to 3 6 times r 2 from 0 017 to 0 061 this distinction between both models could illustrate the contribution of microbial communities to the nitrogen transformation in the fluvial ecosystem 4 discussion in aquatic environments dams are influential to activities of organisms and quantities of matters hence impact a variety of biogeochemical processes maavara et al 2017 among these processes nitrogen cycling is of paramount importance for the restoration of water quality yu et al 2019 however research on dam altered nitrogen transformation in the aquatic environment was overlooked by combining ecological processes of microbial communities and structural equations modelling of causal relations we observed the distinct impacts of different types of dams on the structure and assembly processes of microbial communities which resulted in imprints on the nitrogen transformation in a large fluvial network with systematic samplings along the yangtze river and a series of analyses our findings provide insight into the nitrogen transformation in a large river in research on the relations between microbial communities and abiotic factors in a large river network aquatic microbial communities were reported influenced by different types of landforms hassell et al 2018 liu et al 2018 or differently dedicated land use yao et al 2018 our result showed that different landforms did have an influence on the microbial communities composition however when comparing impact of different landforms with that of different dams the latter was more influencing fig 1d and supplementary table 1 in fluvial ecosystems damming has been seen as the largest anthropogenic disturbance as dams alter the physiochemical conditions in natural aquatic habitats and break down the connectivity of fluvial network directly floehr et al 2015 mann and plummer 2000 ward 1927 this alteration is not only influential to macro organisms but also posing potential changes in microbial communities carrara et al 2012 in this research partitioned by dirichlet multinomial mixture dmm algorithm 5 metacommunities showed their distinct distributions in different dams influenced regions fig 1c and 1d exhibiting the dissimilarity of microbial communities distribution caused by dams moreover distance dissimilarity linear regressions showed the differences between dams influenced regions confirming the influence of different dams on aquatic microbial communities existing large scale research on microbial communities reported a correlation between geographic distance and community dissimilarity chen et al 2018 chu et al 2016 liu et al 2015 liu et al 2018 niño garcía et al 2016 savio et al 2015 wu et al 2019 and some discussed the relations between geographical distance and environmental distance chen et al 2018 chu et al 2016 niño garcía et al 2016 in these correlations geographic and environmental distances had different correlations with dissimilarity of microbial communities in different groups of samples some selected one single important variable and discussed its dominating role in shaping microbial communities niño garcía et al 2016 tripathi et al 2018 whilst others take all environmental variables as a whole and discuss its important role in ecological distribution patterns of microbial communities chen et al 2018 liu et al 2015 liu et al 2018 in this research different strengths of correlations were displayed in contrasting colours in fig 2 and a gradient of impacts was found from the cascade dams influenced sites to the yangtze estuary showing that different impacts of dams were received by microbial communities in different regions of sites moreover measuring with no matter which diversity metric geographic distance showed a stronger correlation with a higher correlation coefficient calculated to community dissimilarity than environmental distance did large rivers are often under human control nilsson et al 2005 wang et al 2018 and the yangtze river is no exception hydrological conditions in the yangtze river are subject to the regulations of dams tang et al 2018 among all the parameters describing hydrological conditions suspended sand concentration velocity and depth are most commonly measured and they were also strictly controlled in the yangtze river by different dams maavara et al 2017 xia et al 2017 as exhibited in the partitioning of metacommunities and distance dissimilarity correlations different dams impacted microbial communities differently furthermore the neglected underlying mechanism by which different dams influence the microbial communities was identified as the suspended sand concentration from the view of hydrologic and biogeochemistry suspended sands are as important as water in the fluvial network niederdorfer et al 2016 xia et al 2017 they are offering nutrients and interfaces for the living of microorganisms which are deeply involved in the biogeochemical processes and elemental cycling gomez velez et al 2015 lansdown et al 2016 maavara et al 2017 in this research with the calculation of βnti not only the different portions of ecological processes have been quantified but also the variation of βnti was explained by the variation of suspended sand concentration the correlation between the metric of phylogenetic diversity βnti and a hydrologic parameter suspended sand concentration was statistically significant and this relation reduced the gap between ecology and hydrology another confirmation to the strong relation between sand and microbial communities in the fluvial network is that the majority of keystone otus identified in different dams affected groups were persistent otus fig 4 which were ubiquitous and present in different groups of samples and this pattern was reported in various aquatic ecosystems banerjee et al 2018 flemming and wuertz 2019 liu et al 2015 some studies attributed the variation of suspended sand concentration and composition of suspended sands to the controlling of dams maavara et al 2017 marzadri et al 2017 wang et al 2012 xia et al 2017 and this research further proved the impact of suspended sand concentration on microbial communities putting together a direct chain of causal relationships indicating the influence of dams on fluvial microbial communities via the suspended sand concentration was drawn by sem analysis fig 5 showed the direct and indirect explanatory causes for the nitrogen concentration in this model the initial variable was depth of river representing the disturbances and regulations of dams subsequently important hydrologic parameters i e suspended sand concentration median particle diameter and velocity were altered they further influenced the microbial communities and activities represented using the diversity indices and the quantity of functional genes and at last both hydrologic parameters and microbial activities influenced the nitrogen concentration together on the scale of a large river network the imprints of different dams on the nitrogen transformation were confirmed and the comparison of the two sem models and the statistical significance of correlations emphasized the domination of activities of microorganisms in the aquatic nitrogen transformation similarly by comparing two sem models including and excluding the microbial biomass li et al argued the importance of microbes in driving global nitrogen mineralization in soil li et al 2019 without the contribution of microbial communities the hydrological conditions i e suspended sand concentration median particle diameter and velocity would not have direct and significant influence on the nitrogen transformation and the coefficient of regression of nitrogen concentration would not have risen to 3 6 folds although the regression factors were relatively low they demonstrated the imprint of dams on the nitrogen transformation along the yangtze river tributaries and riverine cities may also alter the input of nitrogen however due to the difficulty in including them in the sem they were possible explanations for the low regression factor in the models 5 conclusions this study uses a combination of 16s rrna gene sequencing metacommunities partitioning distance dissimilarity linear modelling keystone species identification and structural equation modelling to gain insights into how dams shift ecological assembly and imprint nitrogen transformation along the yangtze river the geographic patterns of metacommunities proved dam impacts on aquatic microbial communities the distinct distance dissimilarity patterns as well as differently quantified ecological processes presented in different dam influenced regions further delineated the impacts of dams the dominance of persistent otus in keystone otus in interspecies co occurrence networks indicated the importance of suspended sands which were further proven as the key to the direct influence of dams on microbial communities in the structural equation modelling in summary our study argued for the important role the microbial communities playing in aquatic nitrogen transformation and recognized the suspended sand concentration as the controlling factor via which dams impact microbial communities these findings have important implications for understanding aquatic nitrogen dynamics across the yangtze river basin and global river network moreover the significant links between the microbial communities and nitrogen concentration supported the unneglectable function of microorganisms in the nitrogen transformation in aquatic ecosystem more efforts and global collaborations are expected to disentangle the different response to different types of dams impacts of microbial communities for a better

17332,dams are important for flood control water storage irrigation electric generation navigation and have been regarded as the largest anthropogenic disturbance in aquatic ecosystems however how dams impact nitrogen transformation on a large watershed scale remained less studied to explicitly address the impact of dams on nitrogen transformation we used 16s rrna gene sequencing to investigate the microbial dynamics and ecological processes under different dam conditions along the yangtze river as microbial communities are playing a key role in aquatic nitrogen transformation compared with landforms dams exerted a more significant impact on the distribution patterns of microbial communities along the yangtze river the results showed that by controlling suspended sand concentration dams filtered keystone species reshaped distribution of metacommunities and mediated ecological assembly processes of microbial communities moreover direct causal relationships between dams and nitrogen transformation were chained via microbial communities to summarize by combining knowledge in hydrology microbial ecology and biogeochemistry this research exhibited the impact of different dams on the nitrogen transformation along a large river and the key roles of suspended sand and microbial communities were emphasized we anticipate a more precise modelling and prediction of nitrogen transformation in large watersheds which may provide new perspectives for controlling the nitrogen in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dams microbial community assembly process nitrogen yangtze river 1 introduction nitrogen transport and transformation have always been a research focus in the aquatic environment especially in large river networks schmadel et al 2018 alexander et al 2000 gomez velez et al 2015 quantification of these processes is of increasing importance for water quality restoration and related environmental policy making le moal et al 2019 yu et al 2019 dams influence more than half of the world s large river networks nilsson et al 2005 wang et al 2018 they change hydrological conditions of natural rivers form environmental gradients and provide unique habitats in diverse landforms thus facilitating distinct distribution patterns of microbial communities in fluvial networks poff and schmidt 2016 wang et al 2017 liu et al 2018 and finally impact the nitrogen transformation kuypers et al 2018 wang et al 2018 however little research is focused on how dams impact microbial communities and nitrogen transformation in large river networks hydrological conditions and microbial activities are two main factors controlling the transport and transformation processes of nitrogen gomez velez et al 2015 effects of hydrological conditions on nitrogen transformation have been systematically explored yet the important role of microbial communities has been neglected or implicitly represented by damköhler number a hydrologic parameter marzadri et al 2017 schmadel et al 2018 since nitrogen transformation was mainly driven by microbial communities in aquatic environments graham et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 li et al 2019 microbial ecological concepts were adopted to better elucidate the mechanism of nitrogen transformation under dam impacts in ecology both composition and diversity of species in communities are influenced by basic ecological processes selection drift speciation and dispersal vellend 2010 among these deterministic processes i e homogeneous selection and variable selection and stochastic processes i e speciation ecological drift dispersal limitation and homogenizing dispersal have been well described by niche theory macarthur and wilson 2001 and neutral theory hubbell 2001 respectively in practice however these processes are combined to explain and model assembly and turnover of microbial communities chase et al 2011 stegen et al 2013 2012 vellend 2010 specifically the beta nearest taxon index βnti a metric based on a null model statistical framework has been used to quantify deterministic and stochastic ecological processes stegen et al 2013 2012 more recently the coupling of microbial communities with chemical mechanisms was proven in the hyporheic zone by the positive correlation between βnti and the change of carbon composition stegen et al 2018 2016 analogously we expect to integrate microbial communities in the effects of dams on the nitrogen transformation in the aquatic environment and provide new insights into the multidisciplinary intersection the yangtze river the longest river in asia runs through a watershed of 1 8 million km2 and houses a population of over 400 million liu et al 2019 in this large river the hydrological conditions are directly influenced by cascade dams and the three gorges dam the world s largest dam in terms of installed electric generating capacity tang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 on a large watershed scale hydrologic models nitrogen cycling diversity and ecology of microbial communities etc have been explored individually yet the influence of different types of dams on microbial communities and nitrogen biogeochemistry remain unexplored therefore to fill the gap between these disciplines our objectives were 1 to explore the microbial communities under different dam impacts along the mainstream of the yangtze river from 44 sites in 3 seasons 2 to analyse the distribution diversity and assembly patterns of these microbial communities 3 to evaluate the importance of dams in shifting nitrogen transformation in the yangtze river summarizing this research cascade dams and the three gorges dam led to distinct hydrological conditions in different zones along the yangtze river hence the microbial communities assembly processes and functions were shifted and finally nitrogen transformation in this large river network was imprinted 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sediment sampling yangtze river the largest river in china and the third longest river in the world originates in the qinghai tibetan plateau and flows eastward to the east china sea in this study from shigu to wusongkou a total of 44 sites along the mainstream of the yangtze river were sampled in august 2016 december 2016 and april 2017 from the upper reach of the yangtze river to the yangtze estuary the sampling range spanned 4 327 km all study sites were partitioned into groups according to the types of influences of dams they bear cascade dams and the three gorges dam the landforms where they were located mountain foothill basin foothill mountain and plain and the seasons when they were sampled april august and december partition by dam conditions were detailed hereafter according to the locations of the cascade dams and the three gorges dam 44 sampling sites were divided into 4 regions the first was cascade dams influenced region wherein 8 dams were operated this region contained 10 sites from shigu to luzhou the second region large dam influenced region where the water level fluctuated due to the impoundment and discharge of the three gorges reservoir contained 13 sites from zhutuo to miaohe the third region was directly downstream of the three gorges reservoir this large dam controlled region was in the middle reach of the yangtze river and it contained 12 sites from yichang to jiujiang in the fourth region no dams were constructed 9 non influenced sites from hukou to wusongkou near the yangtze estuary were in this region no extreme weather occurred during sampling periods physiochemical properties of surface sediment samples were measured almost synchronously i e within 1 week along the mainstream of the yangtze all the sampling sites were located along the longitudinal centreline of river channel at each site three replicate sediment samples were collected from 10 cm depth of the streambed each individual sample was a mixture of five sediment samples that were collected randomly within a given plot with an area of 1 m2 a total of 132 sediment samples were collected for chemical and molecular analysis samples were sealed in sterilized sampling bags 14 cm 20 cm and placed in an ice box 4 c for physiochemical analysis and were sealed in sterilized polypropylene tubes 10 ml and stored in dry ice 80 c for dna extraction the

quality score over a 50 bp sliding window and the sequences shorter than 50 bp were discarded second reads containing more than 2 nucleotide mismatches or ambiguous bases were removed third pair ended sequences with longer than 10 bp overlaps were merged to one single sequence 97 similarity operational taxonomic units otus were clustered using uparse and chimeric sequences were removed using uchime the taxonomic annotation of sequences was assigned using the rdp classifier trained by the silva ssu128 16s rrna database 2 3 real time quantitative pcr real time quantitative pcr qpcr was performed

amplicons were gel purified and cloned using the peasy t1 cloning kit transgen china according to the manufacturer s instructions plasmid dna was extracted determined and diluted in 10 fold series to generate standard curves 2 4 partitioning of microbial communities two general approaches dirichlet multinomial mixture dmm and partitioning around the medoid pam were attempted to partition different environmental samples into different metacommunity types according to the structure of microbial communities i e genera level relative abundance ding and schloss 2014 holmes et al 2012 nakatsu et al 2015 metacommunity types represent different envirotypes of microbial communities different types of microbial communities with the impact of distinctive environmental conditions and they are automatically clustered by the algorithms without subjective decision of number of groups or arbitrarily decided cut off threshold for clustering analysis the number of dirichlet components was selected using the laplace approximation to the negative log model evidence the number which gives the minimum approximation is selected in comparison the number of pam components was selected using the maximum calinski harabasz or silhouette values for different partitions to validate the correlation between the partitioning results from metacommunity and other empirical grouping methods i e groupings based on landform types damming conditions and seasons fisher s exact tests and chi square tests were conducted using r language r core team 2013 2 5 distance dissimilarity correlation of microbial communities distance dissimilarity correlation patterns between microbial community and geographic distance or environmental distance were explored and visualized using linear regressions in r language r core team 2013 the bray curtis dissimilarity metric was used to examine differences in species composition and was quantified using the distance function in the ecodist package the weighted unique fraction weighted unifrac metric measuring the phylogenetic relatedness of whole communities was calculated using the gunifrac function in the unifrac package to measure the difference between observed phylogenetic community turnover and the mean of the null model deviations β nearest taxon index βnti was calculated using a modified comdistnt function in the picante package chase et al 2011 stegen et al 2012 the slope of the linear regression analysis was used as the indicator of the correlation the pairwise geographic distance was measured as the continuous actual sinuous channel length along the yangtze river between sampling sites the environmental distance was the standardized euclidean distance calculated using 10 physiochemical characteristics from each sampling site chen et al 2018 wu et al 2019 2 6 quantification of ecological processes of microbial communities niche theory and neutral theory are opposite to each other in the development of various ecological perspectives to detect which ecological processes are more important and to what magnitude they are influential in the assembly of microbial communities in this research region the quantifying calculation has been applied with parameters identical to the original algorithm proposed by stegen et al stegen et al 2013 2012 in short the beta mean nearest taxon distance βmntd were calculated between communities to represent the pairwise phylogenetic turnover subsequently based on the βmntd values of a null model the standard deviation of the observed βmntd were calculated this standard deviation is βnti representing the strength of environmental impacts in the community assembly and turnover processes to evaluate potential drivers of turnover of composition in microbial communities we correlated the pairwise βnti with changes in all measured physical and hydrologic variables i e depth velocity suspended sand concentration and median particle diameter tripathi et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 the statistical significances of the resulting relationships were further tested with permutation based partial mantel tests 1 000 permutations using the mantel function in the ecodist package stegen et al 2016 2 7 construction of co occurrence networks of microbial communities the construction of co occurrence networks was achieved in three steps 1 selection of otus as nodes hubs of network 2 selection of highly correlated relations as edges connections 3 identification of keystones regional associated and persistent otus in the network according to the mass ratio hypothesis the dominant species and their traits contribute most to ecosystem functions as energies flow mostly through them smith and knapp 2003 finally 784 dominant otus were selected with both prevalence and abundance thresholds each selected otu presented in more than 20 of all samples and had a mean number of reads larger than 5 with all 784 otus involved 306 936 pairwise spearman correlations were calculated among all the pairwise correlations 45 014 of them were selected to represent the significant and strong co occurrence relationships with the absolute value of coefficient number ρ 0 4 and a p value 0 05 using these dominant otus as nodes and significant co occurrence relationships as edges a co occurrence network of all microbial communities along the yangtze river was established using r r core team 2013 similar to co occurrence network of all communities co occurrence networks of 4 regions described in study site and sediment sampling were also established topological properties for each node were calculated using igraph package csardi and nepusz 2006 degree and betweenness centrality are the most used properties of nodes in a network degree is the number of edges connected to the focused node and betweenness centrality is the number of shortest paths passing through the focused node röttjers and faust 2018 keystone taxa are defined with high degree 100 and low betweenness centrality values 3 000 and they are often regarded as key players in the community ma et al 2016 to better distinguish otus in the informative co occurrence network the definition of regional associated otus has been introduced to describe otus significantly more abundant mann whitney wilcoxon test p value 0 05 in one region than other regions inspired by the seasonal associated otus proposed by liu et al barberán et al 2012 liu et al 2018 contrast with regional associated otus persistent otus are defined as otus present in more than 20 of all samples whereas not significantly more abundant in any region liao et al 2016 saunders et al 2016 2 8 structural equation modelling structural equation modelling sem was used to explore direct and indirect relationships among all variables envisaged in the model in this study sem was conducted using lavaan package in r r core team 2013 before the sem analysis indices of alpha diversity quantities of functional genes and concentrations of nitrogen in different forms were treated using the principal component analysis pca to reduce the dimensions of variables guo et al 2013 liu et al 2018 for each variable group the first principal component explained more than 80 of the total variance therefore the first principal component from each pca was used in the sem several different conceptual structures were tested and the optimal one was identified with the highest comparative fit index cfi and the lowest root mean square error of approximation rmsea to exhibit and illustrate the importance and impact of microbial communities on the transformation of nitrogen taking place in the fluvial network two conceptual structures containing and not containing microbial communities were modelled respectively and compared deliberately li et al 2019 3 results 3 1 metacommunities along the yangtze river partitioned by different dam impacts in river networks microbial communities are influenced by different types of factors to differentiate effects of dam conditions landforms and seasons samples were accordingly grouped see study site and sediment sampling dmm and pam partitions were conducted to partition microbial communities into different metacommunity types see partitioning of microbial communities the dmm partitioning was more robust than pam partitioning of microbial communities with different rarity thresholds fig 1 a therefore was selected as the optimal partitioning method and 5 metacommunity types were finally clustered these distinctive metacommunities represent different types of microbial communities structures acclimated in a variety of habitats envirotypes they were clustered automatically into 5 groups without biased expectations and were illustrated both in the nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds plot fig 1b and in the map of the yangtze river basin fig 1c to get a more intuitive visualization to test the different associations between dam conditions landforms and seasons with the microbial communities preliminary groupings were tested with the optimal partitioning result of metacommunities using both fisher s exact test with monte carlo simulation and chi square test these tests indicated a more significant association of metacommunities partitioning to dam condition types fisher s exact test q 1 50 10 6 chi square test p 1 50 10 4 than to landform types fisher s exact test q 1 50 10 4 chi square test p 1 50 10 2 while no significant association between metacommunities partition with season types fisher s exact test q 0 05 chi square test p 0 05 was found fig 1d and supplementary table 1 3 2 divergent patterns of distance dissimilarity caused by cascade dams and the large dam to better explore the relationships between bacterial community dissimilarity and geographic and environmental distances the linear regressions of dissimilarities with these two distances were plotted in fig 2 to emphasize the divergent patterns of impacts caused by different types of dams samples were separated into 4 groups based on different impact of dams bray curtis dissimilarity weighted unifrac and βnti were calculated based on otus phylogenetic tree and correspondent taxonomic annotations these three metrics represent the bacterial community diversity phylogenetic diversity and significance of phylogenetic turnover separately and they were selected to describe the bacterial community dissimilarity and turnover see quantification of ecological processes of microbial communities comparing the relationships between bacterial community dissimilarity and geographic distance fig 2a c e among the four groups y1 y4 the influence of geographic distance showed a significant difference among the four regions and increased from upstream to downstream the distributions of bacterial communities within non influenced sites were largely controlled by geographic distance while communities in cascade dams influenced sites or large dam influenced sites were less affected by geographic properties sites under the influence or control of the large dam were taken together in the linear regression y5 comparing the impacts of large dam y5 and cascade dams y1 geographic distance played a more important role with higher r2 values and greater slope in the impacts of large dam y5 than in the cascade dams y1 furthermore all the three metrics of diversity were negatively correlated with geographic distance except βnti within the cascade dams influenced sites fig 2e y1 this indicated that bacterial community assembly processes in the cascade dams were less influenced by geographic distance which could also be demonstrated by the low correlation coefficient r 2 0 00 of this region taken together this series of linear regressions showed that both geographic distance and environmental distance were correlated p 0 001 with bacterial community dissimilarity in all regions suggesting their potential influence on the distribution of bacterial communities along the yangtze river the 6 linear regression results y0 y5 indicated that bray curtis unifrac and βnti all showed closer correlations with higher r2 values with geographic distance than with environmental distance in all groups 3 3 microbial ecological processes connected with hydrological conditions from a perspective of ecology turnover in microbial community assembly was governed by different proportions of deterministic processes homogeneous and variable selection stochastic processes dispersal limitation and homogenizing dispersal and a small proportion of undominated process ecological drift with all samples acquired in 44 sites in 3 seasons the ecological processes influencing the microbial communities were quantified separately in different dam impacted groups as shown in fig 3 in the algorithm βnti is a measure of community diversity which includes both the phylogenetic relations of species as well as the randomization of individuals replacement and dispersion see quantification of ecological processes of microbial community with the distribution of βnti values we quantified that deterministic processes played the dominant role 69 to 76 in the assembly and turnover of microbial communities along the yangtze river while stochastic processes and ecological drift only contributed 24 to 31 specifically comparing between groups the intervention of homogeneous selection is stronger in dams affected sites indicating that homogeneous environmental conditions in the dams affected region led to more similar structures among communities and the variable selection played a more important role in non influenced sites emphasizing the dissimilarity in communities caused by the effects of different biotic and abiotic conditions in the downstream non influenced region to get a deeper understanding of the assembly and turnover of microbial communities controlled by stochastic and deterministic processes a series of mantel tests between changes in physiochemical variables and βnti were evaluated only changes in suspended sand concentration and ammonium concentration showed a significant correlation p value 0 05 mantel coefficient r 0 13 and 0 25 with βnti supplementary table 2 separately in the cascade dams influenced region and the large dam influenced region no significant correlation was found between changes in physiochemical variables and βnti but downstream in the large dam controlled region and non influenced region changes in total nitrogen concentration ammonium concentration and velocity showed their correlations with βnti different correlations in separate regions reflected that different types of dams had distinct impacts on hydrological conditions and then the microbial communities in separate regions were altered these results showed that hydrological conditions represented by suspended sand concentration directly influence the assembly and turnover of microbial communities and microbial communities have direct correlations with nitrogen 3 4 co occurrence networks dominated by persistent otus in keystone otus to explore the topology of interspecies interactions co occurrence networks were established using dominant otus otus presenting in more than 20 of all samples and having a mean number of reads larger than 5 and significantly strong co occurrence relationships ρ 0 4 and p value 0 05 in spearman correlations in each topologic network otus were represented as nodes and their co occurrence relationships were represented as edges links more specifically nodes with high degree 100 and low betweenness centrality values 3 000 were identified as keystone otus for microbial communities along the yangtze river see construction of co occurrence networks of microbial communities finally 784 dominant otus and 45 014 significant strong co occurrence relationships were focused to represent the microbial communities in this research fig 4 differences were found between the keystone otus in 4 regions of different impacts of dams fig 4 the numbers of keystone otus augmented from the upper stream towards the downstream so did the abundance of keystone otus some keystone otus showed great regional distribution patterns implying different dam conditions influencing the microbial communities acidobacteria was identified as a keystone phylum in all regions but the cascade dams influenced region while cyanobacteria was identified as keystone phylum only in the large dam controlled region however more than 90 of keystone otus were persistent otus appeared in all regions fig 4 showing that prevalent persistent otus played key roles in the microbial communities in the fluvial network implying the transferring of most microorganisms by attaching themselves to suspended sands in water 3 5 aquatic nitrogen transformation imprinted by microbial communities to investigate a chain of direct and indirect effects of fluvial conditions suspended sands microbial communities on the nitrogen transformation structural equation modelling sem was used in this study to better exhibit and illustrate the impact of microbial communities on the nitrogen transformation models with and without microbial communities were compared in both models with and without microbial communities direct and reliable influences of depth on the velocity median particle diameter and suspended sand concentration were proven as illustrated in concrete arrows in fig 5 these direct and reliable influences were in coherence with existing research chen et al 2019 as shown in fig 5b microbial communities diversity genes and nitrogen concentration were also influenced by endogenous variables with significant and convincing correlations contrasting to the model with microbial communities in fig 5a without microbial communities and genes the endogenous dependent variables showed that their influences on nitrogen concentration links pointing to nitrogen concentration in dashed arrows were not statistically convincing moreover the model containing microbial communities and genes fig 5b significantly enhanced the predictability of nitrogen concentration on a global scale as the total variance of nitrogen concentration explained by the fixed factors improved to 3 6 times r 2 from 0 017 to 0 061 this distinction between both models could illustrate the contribution of microbial communities to the nitrogen transformation in the fluvial ecosystem 4 discussion in aquatic environments dams are influential to activities of organisms and quantities of matters hence impact a variety of biogeochemical processes maavara et al 2017 among these processes nitrogen cycling is of paramount importance for the restoration of water quality yu et al 2019 however research on dam altered nitrogen transformation in the aquatic environment was overlooked by combining ecological processes of microbial communities and structural equations modelling of causal relations we observed the distinct impacts of different types of dams on the structure and assembly processes of microbial communities which resulted in imprints on the nitrogen transformation in a large fluvial network with systematic samplings along the yangtze river and a series of analyses our findings provide insight into the nitrogen transformation in a large river in research on the relations between microbial communities and abiotic factors in a large river network aquatic microbial communities were reported influenced by different types of landforms hassell et al 2018 liu et al 2018 or differently dedicated land use yao et al 2018 our result showed that different landforms did have an influence on the microbial communities composition however when comparing impact of different landforms with that of different dams the latter was more influencing fig 1d and supplementary table 1 in fluvial ecosystems damming has been seen as the largest anthropogenic disturbance as dams alter the physiochemical conditions in natural aquatic habitats and break down the connectivity of fluvial network directly floehr et al 2015 mann and plummer 2000 ward 1927 this alteration is not only influential to macro organisms but also posing potential changes in microbial communities carrara et al 2012 in this research partitioned by dirichlet multinomial mixture dmm algorithm 5 metacommunities showed their distinct distributions in different dams influenced regions fig 1c and 1d exhibiting the dissimilarity of microbial communities distribution caused by dams moreover distance dissimilarity linear regressions showed the differences between dams influenced regions confirming the influence of different dams on aquatic microbial communities existing large scale research on microbial communities reported a correlation between geographic distance and community dissimilarity chen et al 2018 chu et al 2016 liu et al 2015 liu et al 2018 niño garcía et al 2016 savio et al 2015 wu et al 2019 and some discussed the relations between geographical distance and environmental distance chen et al 2018 chu et al 2016 niño garcía et al 2016 in these correlations geographic and environmental distances had different correlations with dissimilarity of microbial communities in different groups of samples some selected one single important variable and discussed its dominating role in shaping microbial communities niño garcía et al 2016 tripathi et al 2018 whilst others take all environmental variables as a whole and discuss its important role in ecological distribution patterns of microbial communities chen et al 2018 liu et al 2015 liu et al 2018 in this research different strengths of correlations were displayed in contrasting colours in fig 2 and a gradient of impacts was found from the cascade dams influenced sites to the yangtze estuary showing that different impacts of dams were received by microbial communities in different regions of sites moreover measuring with no matter which diversity metric geographic distance showed a stronger correlation with a higher correlation coefficient calculated to community dissimilarity than environmental distance did large rivers are often under human control nilsson et al 2005 wang et al 2018 and the yangtze river is no exception hydrological conditions in the yangtze river are subject to the regulations of dams tang et al 2018 among all the parameters describing hydrological conditions suspended sand concentration velocity and depth are most commonly measured and they were also strictly controlled in the yangtze river by different dams maavara et al 2017 xia et al 2017 as exhibited in the partitioning of metacommunities and distance dissimilarity correlations different dams impacted microbial communities differently furthermore the neglected underlying mechanism by which different dams influence the microbial communities was identified as the suspended sand concentration from the view of hydrologic and biogeochemistry suspended sands are as important as water in the fluvial network niederdorfer et al 2016 xia et al 2017 they are offering nutrients and interfaces for the living of microorganisms which are deeply involved in the biogeochemical processes and elemental cycling gomez velez et al 2015 lansdown et al 2016 maavara et al 2017 in this research with the calculation of βnti not only the different portions of ecological processes have been quantified but also the variation of βnti was explained by the variation of suspended sand concentration the correlation between the metric of phylogenetic diversity βnti and a hydrologic parameter suspended sand concentration was statistically significant and this relation reduced the gap between ecology and hydrology another confirmation to the strong relation between sand and microbial communities in the fluvial network is that the majority of keystone otus identified in different dams affected groups were persistent otus fig 4 which were ubiquitous and present in different groups of samples and this pattern was reported in various aquatic ecosystems banerjee et al 2018 flemming and wuertz 2019 liu et al 2015 some studies attributed the variation of suspended sand concentration and composition of suspended sands to the controlling of dams maavara et al 2017 marzadri et al 2017 wang et al 2012 xia et al 2017 and this research further proved the impact of suspended sand concentration on microbial communities putting together a direct chain of causal relationships indicating the influence of dams on fluvial microbial communities via the suspended sand concentration was drawn by sem analysis fig 5 showed the direct and indirect explanatory causes for the nitrogen concentration in this model the initial variable was depth of river representing the disturbances and regulations of dams subsequently important hydrologic parameters i e suspended sand concentration median particle diameter and velocity were altered they further influenced the microbial communities and activities represented using the diversity indices and the quantity of functional genes and at last both hydrologic parameters and microbial activities influenced the nitrogen concentration together on the scale of a large river network the imprints of different dams on the nitrogen transformation were confirmed and the comparison of the two sem models and the statistical significance of correlations emphasized the domination of activities of microorganisms in the aquatic nitrogen transformation similarly by comparing two sem models including and excluding the microbial biomass li et al argued the importance of microbes in driving global nitrogen mineralization in soil li et al 2019 without the contribution of microbial communities the hydrological conditions i e suspended sand concentration median particle diameter and velocity would not have direct and significant influence on the nitrogen transformation and the coefficient of regression of nitrogen concentration would not have risen to 3 6 folds although the regression factors were relatively low they demonstrated the imprint of dams on the nitrogen transformation along the yangtze river tributaries and riverine cities may also alter the input of nitrogen however due to the difficulty in including them in the sem they were possible explanations for the low regression factor in the models 5 conclusions this study uses a combination of 16s rrna gene sequencing metacommunities partitioning distance dissimilarity linear modelling keystone species identification and structural equation modelling to gain insights into how dams shift ecological assembly and imprint nitrogen transformation along the yangtze river the geographic patterns of metacommunities proved dam impacts on aquatic microbial communities the distinct distance dissimilarity patterns as well as differently quantified ecological processes presented in different dam influenced regions further delineated the impacts of dams the dominance of persistent otus in keystone otus in interspecies co occurrence networks indicated the importance of suspended sands which were further proven as the key to the direct influence of dams on microbial communities in the structural equation modelling in summary our study argued for the important role the microbial communities playing in aquatic nitrogen transformation and recognized the suspended sand concentration as the controlling factor via which dams impact microbial communities these findings have important implications for understanding aquatic nitrogen dynamics across the yangtze river basin and global river network moreover the significant links between the microbial communities and nitrogen concentration supported the unneglectable function of microorganisms in the nitrogen transformation in aquatic ecosystem more efforts and global collaborations are expected to disentangle the different response to different types of dams impacts of microbial communities for a better

17333,the formation and fate of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas in sludge during anaerobic digestion ad is of global importance since the sludge is a significant source of pfaas to the environment the formation of pfaas from polyfluorinated compounds namely pfaa precursors is poorly understood in ad this study aims to investigate the formation of pfaas from precursors and their partitioning behaviour in waste activated sludge was during ad process to achieve this three isotope labelled pfaas were spiked and monitored along with indigenous pfaas and precursors over eight weeks in a laboratory scale anaerobic digester fed with sludge from a local wastewater treatment plant and operated with a hydraulic retention time of 12 days under 35 in addition to isotope labelled pfaas twelve native pfaas and eight polyfluorinated compounds were detected in the feed and digested sludges a mass balance model validated by the spiking experiment was applied to predict the concentrations of pfaas and precursors assuming no formation degradation in ad the measured concentrations of short chain pfaas perfluoroalkyl carboxylates pfcas c 8 perfluoroalkane sulfonates pfsas c 6 in the ad sludge were significantly p 0 05 higher than the model predicted concentrations indicating the formation of these pfaas from precursors in ad in contrast the formation of long chain pfaas pfcas c 8 pfsas c 6 was not observed moreover the degradation of two polyfluoroalkyl phosphates paps 6 2 pap and 6 2 8 2 dipap occurred evidenced by their measured concentrations that were statistically lower than the mass balance predictions further the ad process reduced the amount of pfaas absorbed adsorbed to sludge particularly for the long chain ones due to the breakdown of solids graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic sludge digestion perfluoroalkyl acids precursors mass balance distribution coefficient adsorption 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass a group of fluorinated chemicals used in a variety of applications since the 1950s have been raising environmental and health concerns worldwide due to their persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity prevedouros et al 2006 epidemiological studies have shown that pfass are associated with adverse health effects such as low birth weight verner et al 2015 thyroid malfunction ballesteros et al 2017 lopez espinosa et al 2012 kidney and testicular cancer barry et al 2013 obesity braun 2017 elevated cholesterol levels nelson jessica et al 2010 starling et al 2014 and reduced fecundity fei et al 2009 as a major subgroup in pfass family perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas have received the most attention for being considered as essentially non degradable moreover an increasing amount of evidence is pointing to the biotic and or abiotic formation of pfaas from polyfluoroalkyl chemicals being a crucial contributor of pfaas in the environment liu and mejia avendaño 2013 these polyfluoroalkyl chemicals are termed as pfaa precursors pfaas can be further categorised by the functional group and the length of the fluorinated carbon chain such as long chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates pfcas f cf2 ncoo n 7 and perfluoroalkane sulfonates pfsas f cf2 nso3 n 6 wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been recognised as an important point source of pfass discharged into aquatic environment due to the 1 ineffective pfass degradation appleman et al 2014 chen et al 2018 and 2 secondary formation of pfaas from the degradation of numerous precursors such as fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs chen et al 2017 polyfluoroalkyl phosphates paps lee et al 2010 and fluorotelomer sulfonates fts wang et al 2011 substantial attention has been paid to the monitoring of pfass in the effluent of wwtps as it would discharge massive amount of pfass into the environment gallen et al 2018 guerra et al 2014 furthermore pfass in biosolids are potential threats to the environment and human health due to the accumulation of more water insoluble or long chain pfass in the sludge and growing land application of biosolids given the great amount of biosolids produced in wwtps worldwide guideline values for pfass in biosolids have been established in the united kingdom germany and austria the limit value is 46 ng g 1 dry weight for perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos in uk and 100 ng g 1 dry weight for pfos perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in germany and austria doee 2016 there is mounting evidence of pfaa formation during biological wastewater treatment based on the observation of higher concentrations of pfaas in the effluent compared to those of the influent coggan et al 2019 gallen et al 2018 loganathan et al 2007 shivakoti et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 the increased pfaas are considered to derive from the degradation of precursors via biotic or abiotic pathways during wastewater treatment but to date there is no conclusive answer as to whether formation of pfaas occurs during anaerobic sludge digestion previous studies of full scale wwtps indicated formation of pfaas from precursors breakdown is possible during anaerobic digestion ad guerra et al 2014 schultz et al 2006 however studies of biotransformation of pfaa precursors e g ftohs zhang et al 2013b n ethyl perfluoroalkane sulfonamido ethanols n etfose boulanger et al 2005 lange 2018 suggested that their anaerobic generation of pfaas was insignificant thus not likely the major sources of pfaas in anaerobic environmental matrices moreover concentration differences of pfaas ng g 1 dry weight between digested and non digested sludge are poor indicators of pfaa production from precursors due to other factors contributing to the concentration differences for instance daily or even hourly variations in the feed sludge gómez canela et al 2012 the decrease of dry matter concentration phenomenon mailler et al 2017 and improved sorption tendency of digested sludge guerra et al 2014 may complicate the discerning of pfaa formation in ad therefore a thorough mass balance analysis of pfaas during the ad process is needed for evaluating precursors contribution to total pfaas the partitioning of pfaas between the liquid and solid phases has been studied in wastewater combined with different types of sludge from wwtps arvaniti et al 2014 arvaniti et al 2012 coggan et al 2019 zhang et al 2013a however very few studies investigated the impact of ad on the partitioning of pfaas between the liquid and solid phases which is crucial for quantifying pfaas released into sludge centrate during the dewatering of digested sludge given that the centrate is normally mixed with the raw wastewater it warrants the need for a better understanding of the distribution of pfaas in the liquid and solid phases of sludge undergoing ad when assessing the overall fate of pfaas in wwtps at processes scale the objective of this study was to evaluate the contributions of pfaa precursors to pfaa formation during anaerobic sludge digestion through long term monitoring and rigorous mass balance analysis in order to provide quality assurance of the instrumental analysis and validate the method of mass balance analysis isotope labelled pfaas were spiked into the laboratory anaerobic digester and measured with native pfass furthermore the partitioning of pfaas between the liquid and solid phases was investigated in both the non digested and anaerobically digested sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents native pfass and isotope labelled standards were purchased

laboratory scale anaerobic digester a lab scale anaerobic digester with a working volume of 500 ml and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 days was operated semi continuously by daily manual sludge feeding for approximately one year before the monitoring campaign commenced fig s1 thickened waste activated sludge twas was collected weekly from a wwtp in brisbane australia and stored in a refrigerator at 4 prior to use the total solids ts and volatile solids vs concentrations varied between weeks and averaged at 38 4 g l 1 and 32 4 g l 1 respectively 42 ml of twas was fed to the digester each day with the same amount of anaerobically digested sludge ads discharged simultaneously once a day the digester was homogenised with a magnetic stirrer the temperature was maintained at 35 with a temperature controlled water jacket biogas production rate from the digester was recorded with a gas metre from which the exhaust gas was collected in a gas bag the reactor was in pseudo steady state achieving a vs reduction of 32 11 and produced methane at 154 26 ml g 1 vsadded in the 60 days prior to the monitoring campaign and spiking experiment described below 2 3 monitoring campaign and spiking of isotope labelled pfaas to the digester high frequency and long term sampling is the prerequisite for establishing accurate mass balance of the ad process the sampling scheme lasted 8 weeks during which twas and ads samples were collected once per week weeks 1 6 or three times per week weeks 7 8 on each sampling day samples were taken from both the feed sludge and the discharged ad sludge the experiment of spiking isotope labelled pfaas to the digester was conducted in parallel with the monitoring campaign owing to their similar properties to native pfaas and extremely low occurrence in the environment isotope labelled pfaas with known concentrations were used as benchmarkers for ensuring the accuracy of instrumental analysis and the validity of the model see section 2 7 2 developed for mass balance analysis a mixture of three isotope labelled pfaas 13c5 perfluoropentanoic acid 13c5 pfpea 13c8 perfluorooctanoic acid 13c8 pfoa and 13c8 perfluorooctane sulphonate 13c8 pfos was prepared in meoh at a concentration of 0 5 μg ml 1 for each compound the stock of twas containing isotope labelled pfaas was prepared weekly by spiking the mixture into freshly collected twas one day prior to use to obtain a final theoretical concentration of 100 ng l 1 sludge 42 ml of spiked twas was fed into the digester daily in the following week the three isotope labelled pfaas were measured along with the native pfas compounds 2 4 sample preparation and extraction of pfass each sludge sample was pretreated before extraction within one day after collection as follows 15 ml of sludge was directly freeze dried ground to a fine powder and aliquoted into duplicate solid samples of approximately 0 15 g another 27 ml of sludge was first centrifuged at 4750 rpm for 30 min with the supernatant stored as liquid samples the liquid samples were spiked with 10 μl of a mixture of surrogate analytes isotope labelled internal standard mix at 0 2 mg l 1 before performing the solid phase extraction spe with strata x aw cartridges 100 mg 6 ml as described in a previous study nguyen et al 2019 the freeze dried solid samples were spiked with surrogates followed by ultrasonic solvent extraction use using two cycles of 1 ammonia methanol solution w w detailed extraction protocols for solid and liquid samples are provided in the supplementary data 2 5

added into each batch and proceeded in the same way as the assay samples calibration standards were injected twice in each batch of samples quantification of pfass was performed using a liner regression analysis weighted by 1 x of the calibration curve with regression coefficients r2 higher than 0 993 limits of detection lods were set based on three times the standard deviation of the concentration of the lowest standard after eight injections with a signal to noise ratio higher than 10 limits of quantification loqs were set 10 times the standard deviation of the concentration of

deviation rsd of inter batch samples are described in table s2 2 7 data analysis 2 7 1 calculation of concentrations of pfass adsorbed onto the solid phase sludge comprises aqueous and solid phases part of pfass could remain in the aqueous phase as soluble matters and part in the solid phase attached to particulates consequently pfass extracted from solid samples obtained by lyophilisation of sludge without dewatering contained two parts the pfass adsorbed on the solid phase and those dissolved in the liquid phase water constitutes more than 90 of the sludge content pfass measured in the supernatant contained soluble compounds only therefore the mass of pfass truly adsorbed onto solids of sludge was estimated by subtracting mass in the liquid phase from that in sludge samples as formulated by eq 1 1 c sp c s c l ts where csp is the concentration of pfass adsorbed onto the solid phase ng g 1 ts cs is the concentration of pfass in sludge samples ng l 1 sludge cl is the concentration of pfass in liquid samples ng l 1 supernatant ts is the total solids concentration in sludge g l 1 solids water distribution coefficient kd is an important parameter used in determining affinity of organic pollutants to solids and in evaluating the fate of these compounds during sludge treatment carballa et al 2008 therefore kd l kg 1 values for pfass were estimated to indicate their tendencies to partition onto the solid phase of sludge and evaluate the effect of ad on their partitioning behaviour as shown in eq 2 ternes et al 2004 2 k d c s p c l 1000 2 7 2 modelling of pfas temporal trends in ads using monte carlo simulation based on mass balance analysis a model describing the temporal trends of pfaas in ads was developed to discern whether pfaas are formed or degraded in ad it was suggested that the degradation of pfaas was unlikely during anaerobic sludge treatment arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 which was confirmed in this work by continuous spiking of isotope labelled pfaas at a constant concentration a premise to bear in mind is that the generation of isotope labelled pfaas couldn t occur as a result of lack of the corresponding precursors in the sludge the mass balance method is illustrated in fig s2 followed by the brief deduction of the related equations pfaa formation is considered not to occur if the measured temporal concentration profiles do not differ significantly from the model predicted ones if the two concentration profiles deviate significantly then the formation measured is higher than predicted or degradation measured is lower than predicted takes place for a given compound paired samples hypothesis testing t test was conducted to determine if the mean difference between the two concentration profiles is significantly different from zero at 95 confidence interval the modelled concentrations of native pfass and isotope labelled pfaas were calculated at a temporal resolution of one day over the time course according to a simple mass balance equation eq 3 3 c c t w a s 1 e t q v c 0 e t q v where c is the modelled concentration of pfass in ads ng l 1 sludge ctwas is the measured concentration of pfass in twas ng l

distribution was assumed for the inputs based on the normality test of data in week 7 and 8 the simulation was executed for 10 000 iterations with a confidence level of 95 2 7 3 calculation of mass increase in the liquid phase and mass reduction in the solid phase the mass increase of pfaas in the liquid phase and mass reduction in the solid phase of the sludge after digestion per day were

changes of native pfaas were calculated for all samples collected over the eight week period while the mass changes of isotope labelled pfaas were calculated for samples collected in week 7 and 8 only when their concentrations could be assumed to have reached steady state in the digester 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of anaerobic digester the performance of the anaerobic digester was monitored before and during the spiking stage fig s3 the vs concentration decreased from 31 5 g l 1 to 23 6 g l 1 with a destruction ratio of 28 5 during the spiking experiment consistent with the vs destruction ratio before the spiking stage 32 11 the vs destruction at an hrt of 12 days in this study was comparable to those reported in previous studies by wei et al 2018 26 29 and zhang et al 2019 28 30 with an hrt of 15 days with the same full scale twas the average methane production during the spiking stage was 164 29 ml g 1 vsadded which was similar to the production prior to the spiking experiment and likewise comparable to those in studies by wei et al 2018 146 155 ml ch4 g 1 vsadded and zhang et al 2019 154 164 ml ch4 g 1 vsadded the ph was 7 6 0 1 both before and during the spiking stage the consistency of these parameters between the two stages indicates that the pseudo steady state was established and maintained suggesting the stability of biological activities in the anaerobic digester 3 2 validation of the model the measured and predicted concentrations of isotope labelled pfaas in ads and their measured concentrations in twas over the 8 weeks are presented in fig 1 and s4 during this time measured concentrations of 13c8 pfoa 13c8 pfos and 13c5 pfpea in twas were 97 17 90 17 and 88 10 ng l 1 sludge respectively table s3 compared to the theoretical spiking concentration of 100 ng l 1 the recovery ratios of 13c8 pfoa 13c8 pfos and 13c5 pfpea were in the range of 80 100 indicating the reliability of the analytical method for the three compounds in twas the measured trends of isotope labelled pfaa concentrations in ads during the 8 weeks were in good agreement with the modelled time series concentrations in ads increased rapidly in the first 4 weeks and gradually reached plateaus from week 5 onwards as predicted the reactor was operated at an hrt of 12 days moreover the results of paired samples t test showed that there were no significant differences between the measured and modelled time series table s4 pair 1 2 and 3 overall the results of the spiking experiment not only confirmed the absence of formation degradation of isotope labelled pfaas during ad but also validated the mass balance based model developed in this study to predict temporal variations of stable pfaas in ads 3 3 formation of pfaas and transformation of polyfluorinated chemicals 3 3 1 pfaas nine pfcas c5 c12 and c14 and three pfsas c4 c6 and c8 were detected at loqs in more than 80 of sludge samples it was found that the concentrations of these pfaas in the feed sludge varied significantly over time fig s5 these would cause variations of the pfaa concentrations in the ad sludge interfering with the dynamics caused by the potential formation of pfaas from their precursors in this study this problem was addressed using a mass balance approach eq 3 as demonstrated in fig 1 the mass balance model was able to predict the concentration variations of pfaas in ads over time based on their measured concentrations in the feed consequently the formation of pfaas in the ad reactor could be determined as the differences between the measured and predicted pfaa concentrations in ads the model predicted and measured concentrations of pfcas and pfsas in ads are shown in fig 2 for short chain pfaas i e c5 c7 pfcas and perfluorobutane sulphonate pfbs c4 their measured concentrations in digested sludge were higher than their model predictions fig 2 a b c j the differences between the two concentration profiles were statistically significant p 0 05 according to the paired samples t test table s4 indicating the generation of those short chain pfaas from their precursors during anaerobic sludge digestion it should be noted that the formation varied from week to week in the monitoring period likely due to the potential variations in the concentrations of pfaa precursors in the feed sludge in contrast to short chain pfaas concentrations of long chain pfaas in the majority of digested sludge samples were consistent with their modelled concentrations fig 2 d i k and l indicating no formation of long chain pfaas in anaerobic digester previous studies on biodegradation of pfaa precursors demonstrated that polyfluorinated chemicals typically transform into products with similarly sized or shorter fluorinated carbon chains for example aerobic biotransformation of 6 2 fts and 6 2 ftoh in activated sludge can yield shorter chain pfcas including pfpea c5 and perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa c6 wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 and 8 2 ftoh in activated sludge can be transformed into pfcas containing 7 or less fluorinated carbons under anaerobic condition li et al 2018 therefore long chain pfaas could only be transformed from precursors with similarly sized or longer fluorinated alkyl chains moreover pfaas are the terminal products resistant to further degradation due to the high carbon fluorine bond strength and the absence of structures susceptible to attacks from chemicals and microbes parsons et al 2008 the mass balance of isotope labelled pfaas also demonstrated the stability of pfaas in ad process consequently the lack of formation indicates that long chain precursors are not necessarily transformed into pfaa products of similar chain length during ad furthermore long chain pfaas and their potential precursors are being substituted by short chain alternatives driven by the concerns over their hazardous properties the shift may decrease the abundance of long chain precursors in the sludge thus limiting their transformation in ad 3 3 2 polyfluorinated chemicals in addition to pfaas a limited amount of known precursor chemicals were included in the analysis and eight polyfluorinated chemicals were detected at loqs in most sludge samples n methyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid n mefosaa was detected in ads only fig s6 c suggesting its generation from precursors during ad six compounds were modelled for their temporal trends in ads in the same way used for pfaas fig 3 the modelling of 8 2 pap temporal trend could be of inaccuracy due to its large variation in twas in week 7 and 8 the coefficient of variations were 51 and 39 respectively thus not reported 6 2 pap and 6 2 8 2 dipap showed statistically significant p 0 05 differences between the measured and modelled time series measured time series was lower indicating their degradation in the digester moreover they were detected in twas at the hundreds of ng l 1 sludge levels fig s7 suggesting they could be prominent sources for pfaas during ad 6 2 pap demonstrated higher transformation efficiency than 6 2 8 2 dipap as shown by the differences between the measured and modelled time series 73 23 and 33 10 ng l 1 sludge for 6 2 pap and 6 2 8 2 dipap respectively according to the biotransformation pathway of dipaps proposed in previous studies lee et al 2010 lewis et al 2016 monopaps are the first breakdown products from microbial hydrolysis of dipaps coinciding with the production of ftohs the produced monopaps can further transform into ftohs followed by the oxidation of ftohs into pfcas microbial hydrolysis of the phosphate ester bonds is considered to be the main degradation mechanism of paps and the critical factor affecting the subsequent transformation processes lee et al 2010 lee et al 2014 therefore the actual degraded mass of 6 2 pap in the study may be higher than 73 ng l 1 sludge considering the generation of 6 2 pap from microbial hydrolysis of 6 2 8 2 dipap in addition the chain length and number of phosphate substitutions have been shown to affect the biodegradation of paps the degradation rate of paps decreased significantly as the length of the fluorinated carbon chain increased lee et al 2010 liu and liu 2016 monopaps could be more liable to microbial hydrolysis than dipaps due to the steric hindrance at disubstituted phosphate centre of dipaps and stronger binding of monopap to biosolids lee et al 2010 consequently it could be expected that 6 2 pap was subject to microbial hydrolysis to a larger extent compared to paps with longer chains and more phosphate substitutions interestingly however 6 2 dipap and 8 2 dipap showed patterns different to that of 6 2 8 2 dipap with no significant differences observed between the modelled and measured time series the different behaviour of dipaps in ad warrants further investigation the difference between the measured and modelled 6 2 fts time series was insignificant p 0 515 suggesting the compound was stable under anaerobic conditions the finding is consistent with a previous study which reported that the biotransformation of 6 2 fts didn t occur in anaerobic sediments during 100 day incubation zhang et al 2016 n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid n etfosaa is the major intermediate product of n etfose according to the biodegradation pathway determined in activated sludge frömel and knepper 2010 thus the concentration of n etfosaa is dependent on two processes formation from n etfose and its own degradation as shown in fig 3 a and table s4 the consistency between the measured and modelled time series may imply the absence of both the generation and degradation of n etfosaa it is noteworthy that the hrt in ad process could have an impact on the efficiency of degradation of pfaa precursors further studies are required to investigate the relationship between hrt and pfaa formation 3 4 partitioning of pfass between solid and liquid phases of sludge a significant increase in concentration was observed for isotopically labelled pfaas as well as the native pfass in the liquid phase after ad except for 13c5 pfpea pfbs and 6 2 pap fig 4 there are two factors affecting concentrations of pfaas in the liquid phase 1 the formation of pfaas from precursors and 2 desorption of pfaas from solids during digestion according to the mass balance analysis there was no formation of long chain pfaas thus the increase in long chain pfaa concentrations in the liquid phase was mainly attributed to the desorption of pfaas from solids which were broken down in the digestion process as shown by the reduced ts concentrations in ads fig s3 this was also demonstrated by the consistency between the mass increase of pfaas in the liquid phase and mass reduction in the solid phase fig s8 pfaas that desorbed from the decomposed solids can either enter the liquid phase or be adsorbed again by the remaining solids in the digested sludge and the latter would lead to an increase in the concentrations of pfaas in the solid phase of ads however there were no significant changes found in the concentrations of pfass adsorbed onto solids after ad fig 5 indicating that the solids in twas were already in saturation with pfass the derived solids water distribution coefficients for pfass exhibited high variations with kd values ranging up to 3142 l kg 1 pfbs for ads and 1509 l kg 1 pfos for twas fig 6 table s5 partitioning of pfcas to solids increased with increasing alkyl chain length which is consistent with the conclusions of previous studies arvaniti et al 2014 arvaniti et al 2012 zhang et al 2013a this might be due to the strong hydrophobic effect of c f chain and decreasing hydrophobicity of pfcas with decreasing chain length given that hydrophobic compounds tend to partition to the organic matter hydrophobic partitioning has been considered to be an important mechanism for the sorption process of pfcas in sludge zhang et al 2013a zhou et al 2010 pfsas exhibited higher sorption capacity than analogous pfcas possibly attributed to higher hydrophobicity and acidic sulfonate groups of pfsas arvaniti et al 2014 higgins and luthy 2006 the trend of kd values for pfcas was not observed for pfsas since pfbs had higher kd value than pfhxs indicating that hydrophobic interaction plays a minor role and other interactions should be involved in the sorption of short chain pfsas onto sludge isotope labelled pfaas exhibited similar kd values as their respective native pfaas due to the same properties between the labelled and non labelled pfaas there was a significant decrease in kd values for pfaas with carbon chains longer than five after ad reflecting decreased sorption capacity for these pfaas to the solids of the ads changes in characteristics of sludge during digestion could be responsible for this phenomenon in contrast to twas ads contains a lower percentage of organic matter particularly lower concentrations of carbohydrates and lipids as a result of being consumed as substrates to support microbial growth barret et al 2010 the organic carbon content was shown to have stronger correlation with the sorption capacity of sludge for pfaas with carbon chain longer than five due to strong hydrophobic property zhang et al 2013a therefore the decrease of organic matter may have a negative effect on sorption capacity of sludge for pfaas with carbon chain higher than five whereas the effect was not significant for pfpea and pfbs due to their weaker hydrophobic property in addition to changes in sludge characteristics activities of microorganisms in ad could also impact the concentrations of pfaas in solid and liquid phases of sludge leading to changes of kd values future studies are needed to explore the effects of microbial activities on kd values for pfass in ads 4 conclusions the formation of pfaas and their partitioning behaviour in sludge during ad process were investigated using a laboratory scale anaerobic digester it can be concluded that short chain pfaas c5 c7 pfcas and pfbs c4 can be generated from their precursors in ad previous studies mainly focused on the transformation of pfaa precursors in aerobic systems while the anaerobic transformation remains largely unknown specific transformation pathways of pfaa precursors could lead to the formation of pfaas under anaerobic conditions resulting from the different enzymatic activities of anaerobic microbes long chain pfaas c8 c12 c14 pfcas and c6 c8 pfsas couldn t be formed from their precursors during ad process paps dominant among the polyfluorinated compounds detected in the sludge samples are degradable under anaerobic condition thus potential precursors of pfaas ad could cause the detachment of pfass from the solid phase into the liquid phase of sludge this should be taken into consideration when evaluating the fate and mass balance of pfass in wwtps given the centrate of ads is returned to the wastewater treatment process given the relatively short hrt 12 days in this study in comparison with full scale ad designs further studies are needed to investigate the effect

17333,the formation and fate of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas in sludge during anaerobic digestion ad is of global importance since the sludge is a significant source of pfaas to the environment the formation of pfaas from polyfluorinated compounds namely pfaa precursors is poorly understood in ad this study aims to investigate the formation of pfaas from precursors and their partitioning behaviour in waste activated sludge was during ad process to achieve this three isotope labelled pfaas were spiked and monitored along with indigenous pfaas and precursors over eight weeks in a laboratory scale anaerobic digester fed with sludge from a local wastewater treatment plant and operated with a hydraulic retention time of 12 days under 35 in addition to isotope labelled pfaas twelve native pfaas and eight polyfluorinated compounds were detected in the feed and digested sludges a mass balance model validated by the spiking experiment was applied to predict the concentrations of pfaas and precursors assuming no formation degradation in ad the measured concentrations of short chain pfaas perfluoroalkyl carboxylates pfcas c 8 perfluoroalkane sulfonates pfsas c 6 in the ad sludge were significantly p 0 05 higher than the model predicted concentrations indicating the formation of these pfaas from precursors in ad in contrast the formation of long chain pfaas pfcas c 8 pfsas c 6 was not observed moreover the degradation of two polyfluoroalkyl phosphates paps 6 2 pap and 6 2 8 2 dipap occurred evidenced by their measured concentrations that were statistically lower than the mass balance predictions further the ad process reduced the amount of pfaas absorbed adsorbed to sludge particularly for the long chain ones due to the breakdown of solids graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic sludge digestion perfluoroalkyl acids precursors mass balance distribution coefficient adsorption 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass a group of fluorinated chemicals used in a variety of applications since the 1950s have been raising environmental and health concerns worldwide due to their persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity prevedouros et al 2006 epidemiological studies have shown that pfass are associated with adverse health effects such as low birth weight verner et al 2015 thyroid malfunction ballesteros et al 2017 lopez espinosa et al 2012 kidney and testicular cancer barry et al 2013 obesity braun 2017 elevated cholesterol levels nelson jessica et al 2010 starling et al 2014 and reduced fecundity fei et al 2009 as a major subgroup in pfass family perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas have received the most attention for being considered as essentially non degradable moreover an increasing amount of evidence is pointing to the biotic and or abiotic formation of pfaas from polyfluoroalkyl chemicals being a crucial contributor of pfaas in the environment liu and mejia avendaño 2013 these polyfluoroalkyl chemicals are termed as pfaa precursors pfaas can be further categorised by the functional group and the length of the fluorinated carbon chain such as long chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylates pfcas f cf2 ncoo n 7 and perfluoroalkane sulfonates pfsas f cf2 nso3 n 6 wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been recognised as an important point source of pfass discharged into aquatic environment due to the 1 ineffective pfass degradation appleman et al 2014 chen et al 2018 and 2 secondary formation of pfaas from the degradation of numerous precursors such as fluorotelomer alcohols ftohs chen et al 2017 polyfluoroalkyl phosphates paps lee et al 2010 and fluorotelomer sulfonates fts wang et al 2011 substantial attention has been paid to the monitoring of pfass in the effluent of wwtps as it would discharge massive amount of pfass into the environment gallen et al 2018 guerra et al 2014 furthermore pfass in biosolids are potential threats to the environment and human health due to the accumulation of more water insoluble or long chain pfass in the sludge and growing land application of biosolids given the great amount of biosolids produced in wwtps worldwide guideline values for pfass in biosolids have been established in the united kingdom germany and austria the limit value is 46 ng g 1 dry weight for perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos in uk and 100 ng g 1 dry weight for pfos perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in germany and austria doee 2016 there is mounting evidence of pfaa formation during biological wastewater treatment based on the observation of higher concentrations of pfaas in the effluent compared to those of the influent coggan et al 2019 gallen et al 2018 loganathan et al 2007 shivakoti et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 the increased pfaas are considered to derive from the degradation of precursors via biotic or abiotic pathways during wastewater treatment but to date there is no conclusive answer as to whether formation of pfaas occurs during anaerobic sludge digestion previous studies of full scale wwtps indicated formation of pfaas from precursors breakdown is possible during anaerobic digestion ad guerra et al 2014 schultz et al 2006 however studies of biotransformation of pfaa precursors e g ftohs zhang et al 2013b n ethyl perfluoroalkane sulfonamido ethanols n etfose boulanger et al 2005 lange 2018 suggested that their anaerobic generation of pfaas was insignificant thus not likely the major sources of pfaas in anaerobic environmental matrices moreover concentration differences of pfaas ng g 1 dry weight between digested and non digested sludge are poor indicators of pfaa production from precursors due to other factors contributing to the concentration differences for instance daily or even hourly variations in the feed sludge gómez canela et al 2012 the decrease of dry matter concentration phenomenon mailler et al 2017 and improved sorption tendency of digested sludge guerra et al 2014 may complicate the discerning of pfaa formation in ad therefore a thorough mass balance analysis of pfaas during the ad process is needed for evaluating precursors contribution to total pfaas the partitioning of pfaas between the liquid and solid phases has been studied in wastewater combined with different types of sludge from wwtps arvaniti et al 2014 arvaniti et al 2012 coggan et al 2019 zhang et al 2013a however very few studies investigated the impact of ad on the partitioning of pfaas between the liquid and solid phases which is crucial for quantifying pfaas released into sludge centrate during the dewatering of digested sludge given that the centrate is normally mixed with the raw wastewater it warrants the need for a better understanding of the distribution of pfaas in the liquid and solid phases of sludge undergoing ad when assessing the overall fate of pfaas in wwtps at processes scale the objective of this study was to evaluate the contributions of pfaa precursors to pfaa formation during anaerobic sludge digestion through long term monitoring and rigorous mass balance analysis in order to provide quality assurance of the instrumental analysis and validate the method of mass balance analysis isotope labelled pfaas were spiked into the laboratory anaerobic digester and measured with native pfass furthermore the partitioning of pfaas between the liquid and solid phases was investigated in both the non digested and anaerobically digested sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents native pfass and isotope labelled standards were purchased

laboratory scale anaerobic digester a lab scale anaerobic digester with a working volume of 500 ml and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 days was operated semi continuously by daily manual sludge feeding for approximately one year before the monitoring campaign commenced fig s1 thickened waste activated sludge twas was collected weekly from a wwtp in brisbane australia and stored in a refrigerator at 4 prior to use the total solids ts and volatile solids vs concentrations varied between weeks and averaged at 38 4 g l 1 and 32 4 g l 1 respectively 42 ml of twas was fed to the digester each day with the same amount of anaerobically digested sludge ads discharged simultaneously once a day the digester was homogenised with a magnetic stirrer the temperature was maintained at 35 with a temperature controlled water jacket biogas production rate from the digester was recorded with a gas metre from which the exhaust gas was collected in a gas bag the reactor was in pseudo steady state achieving a vs reduction of 32 11 and produced methane at 154 26 ml g 1 vsadded in the 60 days prior to the monitoring campaign and spiking experiment described below 2 3 monitoring campaign and spiking of isotope labelled pfaas to the digester high frequency and long term sampling is the prerequisite for establishing accurate mass balance of the ad process the sampling scheme lasted 8 weeks during which twas and ads samples were collected once per week weeks 1 6 or three times per week weeks 7 8 on each sampling day samples were taken from both the feed sludge and the discharged ad sludge the experiment of spiking isotope labelled pfaas to the digester was conducted in parallel with the monitoring campaign owing to their similar properties to native pfaas and extremely low occurrence in the environment isotope labelled pfaas with known concentrations were used as benchmarkers for ensuring the accuracy of instrumental analysis and the validity of the model

freshly collected twas one day prior to use to obtain a final theoretical concentration of 100 ng l 1 sludge 42 ml of spiked twas was fed into the digester daily in the following week the three isotope labelled pfaas were measured along with the native pfas compounds 2 4 sample preparation and extraction of pfass each sludge sample was pretreated before extraction within one day after collection as follows 15 ml of sludge was directly freeze dried ground to a fine powder and aliquoted into duplicate solid samples of approximately 0 15 g another 27 ml of sludge was first centrifuged at 4750 rpm for 30 min with the supernatant stored as liquid samples the liquid samples were spiked with 10 μl of a mixture of surrogate analytes isotope labelled internal standard mix at 0 2 mg l 1 before performing the solid phase extraction spe with strata x aw cartridges 100 mg 6 ml as described in a previous study nguyen et al 2019 the freeze dried solid samples were spiked with surrogates followed by ultrasonic solvent extraction use using two cycles of 1 ammonia methanol solution w w detailed extraction protocols for solid and liquid samples are provided in the supplementary data 2 5

added into each batch and proceeded in the same way as the assay samples calibration standards were injected twice in each batch of samples quantification of pfass was performed using a liner

deviation rsd of inter batch samples are described in table s2 2 7 data analysis 2 7 1 calculation of concentrations of pfass adsorbed onto the solid phase sludge comprises aqueous and solid phases part of pfass could remain in the aqueous phase as soluble matters and part in the solid phase attached to particulates consequently pfass extracted from solid samples obtained by lyophilisation of sludge without dewatering contained two parts the pfass adsorbed on the solid phase and those dissolved in the liquid phase water constitutes more than 90 of the sludge content pfass measured in the supernatant contained soluble compounds only therefore the mass of pfass truly adsorbed onto solids of sludge was estimated by subtracting mass in the liquid phase from that in sludge samples as formulated by eq 1 1 c sp c s c l ts where csp is the concentration of pfass adsorbed onto the solid phase ng g 1 ts cs is the concentration of pfass in sludge samples ng l 1 sludge cl is the concentration of pfass in liquid samples ng l 1 supernatant ts is the total solids concentration in sludge g l 1 solids water distribution coefficient kd is an important parameter used in determining affinity of organic pollutants to solids and in evaluating the fate of these compounds during sludge treatment carballa et al 2008 therefore kd l kg 1 values for pfass were estimated to indicate their tendencies to partition onto the solid phase of sludge and evaluate the effect of ad on their partitioning behaviour as shown in eq 2 ternes et al 2004 2 k d c s p c l 1000 2 7 2 modelling of pfas temporal trends in ads using monte carlo simulation based on mass balance analysis a model describing the temporal trends of pfaas in ads was developed to discern whether pfaas are formed or degraded in ad it was suggested that the degradation of pfaas was unlikely during anaerobic sludge treatment arvaniti and stasinakis 2015 which was confirmed in this work by continuous spiking of isotope labelled pfaas at a constant concentration a premise to bear in mind is that the generation of isotope labelled pfaas couldn t occur as a result of lack of the corresponding precursors in the sludge the mass balance method is illustrated in fig s2 followed by the brief deduction of the related equations pfaa formation is considered not to occur if the measured temporal concentration profiles do not differ significantly from the model predicted ones if the two concentration profiles deviate significantly then the formation measured is higher than predicted or degradation measured is lower than predicted takes place for a given compound paired samples hypothesis testing t test was conducted to determine if the mean difference between the two concentration profiles is significantly different from zero at 95 confidence interval the modelled concentrations of native pfass and isotope labelled pfaas were calculated at a temporal resolution of one day over the time course according to a simple mass balance equation eq 3 3 c c t w a s 1 e t q v c 0 e t q v where c is the modelled concentration of pfass in ads ng l 1 sludge ctwas is the measured concentration of pfass in twas ng l

digester 0 5 l c0 is the modelled centration of pfass in the digester before new feeding of twas ng l 1 sludge as initial conditions c0 was assumed to be 0 ng l 1 sludge for isotope labelled pfaas while for native pfass c0 was the measured concentrations in ads collected on the first day ctwas was regarded constant in the week when the digester was fed with the same batch of sludge monte carlo simulation was conducted on oracle crystal ball to generate the range of the modelled concentrations with the propagation of the uncertainties of the inputs i e ctwas and c0 fed into the eq 3 normal distribution was assumed for the inputs based on the normality test of data in week 7 and 8 the simulation was executed for 10 000 iterations with a confidence level of 95 2 7 3 calculation of mass increase in the liquid phase and mass reduction in the solid phase the mass increase of pfaas in the liquid phase and mass reduction in the solid phase of the sludge after digestion per day were calculated according to eqs 4 and 5 respectively 4 δ m l i c l a d s i c l t w a s i q 5 δ m s i c s p t w a s i t s t w a s i c s p a d s i t s a d s i q where δml i is the mass increase of pfaas in

changes of native pfaas were calculated for all samples collected over the eight week period while the mass changes of isotope labelled pfaas were calculated for samples collected in week 7 and 8 only when their concentrations could be assumed to have reached steady state in the digester 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of anaerobic digester the performance of the anaerobic digester was monitored before and during the spiking stage fig s3 the vs concentration decreased from 31 5 g l 1 to 23 6 g l 1 with a destruction ratio of 28 5 during the spiking experiment consistent with the vs destruction ratio before the spiking stage 32 11 the vs destruction at an hrt of 12 days in this study was comparable to those reported in previous studies by wei et al 2018 26 29 and zhang et al 2019 28 30 with an hrt of 15 days with the same full scale twas the average methane production during the spiking stage was 164 29 ml g 1 vsadded which was similar to the production prior to the spiking experiment and likewise comparable to those in studies by wei et al 2018 146 155 ml ch4 g 1 vsadded and zhang et al 2019 154 164 ml ch4 g 1 vsadded the ph was 7 6 0 1 both before and during the spiking stage the consistency of these parameters between the two stages indicates that the pseudo steady state was established and maintained suggesting the stability of biological activities in the anaerobic digester 3 2 validation of the model the measured and predicted concentrations of isotope labelled pfaas in ads and their measured concentrations in twas over the 8 weeks are presented in fig 1 and s4 during this time measured concentrations of 13c8 pfoa 13c8 pfos and 13c5 pfpea in twas were 97 17 90 17 and 88 10 ng l 1 sludge respectively table s3 compared to the theoretical spiking concentration of 100 ng l 1 the recovery ratios of 13c8 pfoa 13c8 pfos and 13c5 pfpea were in the range of 80 100 indicating the reliability of the analytical method for the three compounds in twas the measured trends of isotope labelled pfaa concentrations in ads during the 8 weeks were in good agreement with the modelled time series concentrations in ads increased rapidly in the first 4 weeks and gradually reached plateaus from week 5 onwards as predicted the reactor was operated at an hrt of 12 days moreover the results of paired samples t test showed that there were no significant differences between the measured and modelled time series table s4 pair 1 2 and 3 overall the results of the spiking experiment not only confirmed the absence of formation degradation of isotope labelled pfaas during ad but also validated the mass balance based model developed in this study to predict temporal variations of stable pfaas in ads 3 3 formation of pfaas and transformation of polyfluorinated chemicals 3 3 1 pfaas nine pfcas c5 c12 and c14 and three pfsas c4 c6 and c8 were detected at loqs in more than 80 of sludge samples it was found that the concentrations of these pfaas in the feed sludge varied significantly over time fig s5 these would cause variations of the pfaa concentrations in the ad sludge interfering with the dynamics caused by the potential formation of pfaas from their precursors in this study this problem was addressed using a mass balance approach eq 3 as demonstrated in fig 1 the mass balance model was able to predict the concentration variations of pfaas in ads over time based on their measured concentrations in the feed consequently the formation of pfaas in the ad reactor could be determined as the differences between the measured and predicted pfaa concentrations in ads the model predicted and measured concentrations of pfcas and pfsas in ads are shown in fig 2 for short chain pfaas i e c5 c7 pfcas and perfluorobutane sulphonate pfbs c4 their measured concentrations in digested sludge were higher than their model predictions fig 2 a b c j the differences between the two concentration profiles were statistically significant p 0 05 according to the paired samples t test table s4 indicating the generation of those short chain pfaas from their precursors during anaerobic sludge digestion it should be noted that the formation varied from week to week in the monitoring period likely due to the potential variations in the concentrations of pfaa precursors in the feed sludge in contrast to short chain pfaas concentrations of long chain pfaas in the majority of digested sludge samples were consistent with their modelled concentrations fig 2 d i k and l indicating no formation of long chain pfaas in anaerobic digester previous studies on biodegradation of pfaa precursors demonstrated that polyfluorinated chemicals typically transform into products with similarly sized or shorter fluorinated carbon chains for example aerobic biotransformation of 6 2 fts and 6 2 ftoh in activated sludge can yield shorter chain pfcas including pfpea c5 and perfluorohexanoic acid pfhxa c6 wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 and 8 2 ftoh in activated sludge can be transformed into pfcas containing 7 or less fluorinated carbons under anaerobic condition li et al 2018 therefore long chain pfaas could only be transformed from precursors with similarly sized or longer fluorinated alkyl chains moreover pfaas are the terminal products resistant to further degradation due to the high carbon fluorine bond strength and the absence of structures susceptible to attacks from chemicals and microbes parsons et al 2008 the mass balance of isotope labelled pfaas also demonstrated the stability of pfaas in ad process consequently the lack of formation indicates that long chain precursors are not necessarily transformed into pfaa products of similar chain length during ad furthermore long chain pfaas and their potential precursors are being substituted by short chain alternatives driven by the concerns over their hazardous properties the shift may decrease the abundance of long chain precursors in the sludge thus limiting their transformation in ad 3 3 2 polyfluorinated chemicals in addition to pfaas a limited amount of known precursor chemicals were included in the analysis and eight polyfluorinated chemicals were detected at loqs in most sludge samples n methyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid n mefosaa was detected in ads only fig s6 c suggesting its generation from precursors during ad six compounds were modelled for their temporal trends in ads in the same way used for pfaas fig 3 the modelling of 8 2 pap temporal trend could be of inaccuracy due to its large variation in twas in week 7 and 8 the coefficient of variations were 51 and 39 respectively thus not reported 6 2 pap and 6 2 8 2 dipap showed statistically significant p 0 05 differences between the measured and modelled time series measured time series was lower indicating their degradation in the digester moreover they were detected in twas at the hundreds of ng l 1 sludge levels fig s7 suggesting they could be prominent sources for pfaas during ad 6 2 pap demonstrated higher transformation efficiency than 6 2 8 2 dipap as shown by the differences between the measured and modelled time series 73 23 and 33 10 ng l 1 sludge for 6 2 pap and 6 2 8 2 dipap respectively according to the biotransformation pathway of dipaps proposed in previous studies lee et al 2010 lewis et al 2016 monopaps are the first breakdown products from microbial hydrolysis of dipaps coinciding with the production of ftohs the produced monopaps can further transform into ftohs followed by the oxidation of ftohs into pfcas microbial hydrolysis of the phosphate ester bonds is considered to be the main degradation mechanism of paps and the critical factor affecting the subsequent transformation processes lee et al 2010 lee et al 2014 therefore the actual degraded mass of 6 2 pap in the study may be higher than 73 ng l 1 sludge considering the generation of 6 2 pap from microbial hydrolysis of 6 2 8 2 dipap in addition the chain length and number of phosphate substitutions have been shown to affect the biodegradation of paps the degradation rate of paps decreased significantly as the length of the fluorinated carbon chain increased lee et al 2010 liu and liu 2016 monopaps could be more liable to microbial hydrolysis than dipaps due to the steric hindrance at disubstituted phosphate centre of dipaps and stronger binding of monopap to biosolids lee et al 2010 consequently it could be expected that 6 2 pap was subject to microbial hydrolysis to a larger extent compared to paps with longer chains and more phosphate substitutions interestingly however 6 2 dipap and 8 2 dipap showed patterns different to that of 6 2 8 2 dipap with no significant differences observed between the modelled and measured time series the different behaviour of dipaps in ad warrants further investigation the difference between the measured and modelled 6 2 fts time series was insignificant p 0 515 suggesting the compound was stable under anaerobic conditions the finding is consistent with a previous study which reported that the biotransformation of 6 2 fts didn t occur in anaerobic sediments during 100 day incubation zhang et al 2016 n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid n etfosaa is the major intermediate product of n etfose according to the biodegradation pathway determined in activated sludge frömel and knepper 2010 thus the concentration of n etfosaa is dependent on two processes formation from n etfose and its own degradation as shown in fig 3 a and table s4 the consistency between the measured and modelled time series may imply the absence of both the generation and degradation of n etfosaa it is noteworthy that the hrt in ad process could have an impact on the efficiency of degradation of pfaa precursors further studies are required to investigate the relationship between hrt and pfaa formation 3 4 partitioning of pfass between solid and liquid phases of sludge a significant increase in concentration was observed for isotopically labelled pfaas as well as the native pfass in the liquid phase after ad except for 13c5 pfpea pfbs and 6 2 pap fig 4 there are two factors affecting concentrations of pfaas in the liquid phase 1 the formation of pfaas from precursors and 2 desorption of pfaas from solids during digestion according to the mass balance analysis there was no formation of long chain pfaas thus the increase in long chain pfaa concentrations in the liquid phase was mainly attributed to the desorption of pfaas from solids which were broken down in the digestion process as shown by the reduced ts concentrations in ads fig s3 this was also demonstrated by the consistency between the mass increase of pfaas in the liquid phase and mass reduction in the solid phase fig s8 pfaas that desorbed from the decomposed solids can either enter the liquid phase or be adsorbed again by the remaining solids in the digested sludge and the latter would lead to an increase in the concentrations of pfaas in the solid phase of ads however there were no significant changes found in the concentrations of pfass adsorbed onto solids after ad fig 5 indicating that the solids in twas were already in saturation with pfass the derived solids water distribution coefficients for pfass exhibited high variations with kd values ranging up to 3142 l kg 1 pfbs for ads and 1509 l kg 1 pfos for twas fig 6 table s5 partitioning of pfcas to solids increased with increasing alkyl chain length which is consistent with the conclusions of previous studies arvaniti et al 2014 arvaniti et al 2012 zhang et al 2013a this might be due to the strong hydrophobic effect of c f chain and decreasing hydrophobicity of pfcas with decreasing chain length given that hydrophobic compounds tend to partition to the organic matter hydrophobic partitioning has been considered to be an important mechanism for the sorption process of pfcas in sludge zhang et al 2013a zhou et al 2010 pfsas exhibited higher sorption capacity than analogous pfcas possibly attributed to higher hydrophobicity and acidic sulfonate groups of pfsas arvaniti et al 2014 higgins and luthy 2006 the trend of kd values for pfcas was not observed for pfsas since pfbs had higher kd value than pfhxs indicating that hydrophobic interaction plays a minor role and other interactions should be involved in the sorption of short chain pfsas onto sludge isotope labelled pfaas exhibited similar kd values as their respective native pfaas due to the same properties between the labelled and non labelled pfaas there was a significant decrease in kd values for pfaas with carbon chains longer than five after ad reflecting decreased sorption capacity for these pfaas to the solids of the ads changes in characteristics of sludge during digestion could be responsible for this phenomenon in contrast to twas ads contains a lower percentage of organic matter particularly lower concentrations of carbohydrates and lipids as a result of being consumed as substrates to support microbial growth barret et al 2010 the organic carbon content was shown to have stronger correlation with the sorption capacity of sludge for pfaas with carbon chain longer than five due to strong hydrophobic property zhang et al 2013a therefore the decrease of organic matter may have a negative effect on sorption capacity of sludge for pfaas with carbon chain higher than five whereas the effect was not significant for pfpea and pfbs due to their weaker hydrophobic property in addition to changes in sludge characteristics activities of microorganisms in ad could also impact the concentrations of pfaas in solid and liquid phases of sludge leading to changes of kd values future studies are needed to explore the effects of microbial activities on kd values for pfass in ads 4 conclusions the formation of pfaas and their partitioning behaviour in sludge during ad process were investigated using a laboratory scale anaerobic digester it can be concluded that short chain pfaas c5 c7 pfcas and pfbs c4 can be generated from their precursors in ad previous studies mainly focused on the transformation of pfaa precursors in aerobic systems while the anaerobic transformation remains largely unknown specific transformation pathways of pfaa precursors could lead to the formation of pfaas under anaerobic conditions resulting from the different enzymatic activities of anaerobic microbes long chain pfaas c8 c12 c14 pfcas and c6 c8 pfsas couldn t be formed from their precursors during ad process paps dominant among the polyfluorinated compounds detected in the sludge samples are degradable under anaerobic condition thus potential precursors of pfaas ad could cause the detachment of pfass from the solid phase into the liquid phase of sludge this should be taken into consideration when evaluating the fate and mass balance of pfass in wwtps given the centrate of ads is returned to the wastewater treatment process given the relatively short hrt 12 days in this study in comparison with full scale ad designs further studies are needed to investigate the effect

17334,membrane distillation md has the high potential to circumvent conventional desalination limitations in treating highly saline brines however the performance of md is limited by its low thermal efficiencyand temperature polarization tp effect consequently the driving force decreases when heat loss increases in this study we propose to minimize tp through localized heating where the thin feed channel was heated uniformly at the membrane liquid interface without changing the properties of the membrane this concept was further improved by implementing a new dead end md configuration investigated for the first time this configuration eliminated circulation heat losses which cannot be realized in conventional md due to a rapid temperature stratification in addition the accumulation of foulants on the membrane surface was successfully controlled by intermittent flushing 3 dimensional conjugate heat transfer modeling revealedmore uniform heat transfer and temperature gradient across the membrane due to the increased feed water temperature over a larger membrane area the increase of water vapor flux 45 and the reduction of heat lossobserved in the new dead end concept led to a decrease of the specific energy consumption by 57 corresponding to a gain output ratio increase of about 132 compared to a conventional bulk heating while preserving membrane integrity a conjugate heat transfer model was deployed in ansys fluent framework to elucidate on the mechanism of flux enhancement associated with the proposed technique this study provides a framework for future sustainable md developmentby maintaining a stable vapor flux while minimizing energy consumption graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation md desalination localized

arid regions of the middle east and northern africa mena but also in coastal countries with moderate weather conditions caldera and breyer 2017 ghaffour et al 2013 consequently the water desalination industry has grown exponentially in recent decades currently employing more than 18 000 desalination plants around the world ida 2015 jones et al 2019 membrane distillation md is an emerging desalination process which can produce high quality water from both natural water sources like seawater andrés mañas et al 2018 shim et al 2015 or groundwater naji et al 2020 plattner et al 2017 as well as from brines elcik et al 2020 sanmartino et al 2017 schwantes et al 2018 its moderate operating conditions make it a promising economical and energy saving desalination approach alsaadi et al 2015 curcio and drioli 2005 subramani and jacangelo 2015 yang et al 2014 contrary to seawater reverse osmosis swro md does not require high grade electrical energy for its operation and works in a lower feed water temperature range compared to multi stage flush msf while producing high quality freshwater md also has an advantage in treating highly saline feed waters facilitating high salt rejection and low fouling propensity as compared to other well established desalination technologies kim et al 2016 subramani and jacangelo 2015 wang 2018 wang and chung 2015 however despite the high potential of the md process to circumvent conventional desalination technologies its energy consumption remains ambiguous due to inherent heat loss by conduction and evaporation eleiwi et al 2016 summers et al 2012 yang et al 2014 in the conventional md system the bulk feed water is heated externally causing up to 50 of the conduction heat loss due to the heat releasedinthe atmosphere fane et al 1987 lokare et al 2018 furthermore when the feed water enters the md module its bulk temperature is higher compared to the membrane surface because ofconvective energy losses and latent heat release during the liquid to gas phase transition elmarghany et al 2019 lee et al 2016 the extent to which feed temperature at the membrane surface differs from its bulk value is knownas temperature polarization tp tp can be as high as 10 c leading to decreased heat and mass transport rates across the membrane alsaadi et al 2018 rezaei et al 2018 consequently the md energy efficiency decreasesdue to the limitations of the thermal boundary layer at the membrane liquid interface alsaadi et al 2018 santoro et al 2017 several studies have mitigated tp by using turbulence creators such as spacers however this approach creates additional pressure on energy requirements kim et al 2018 l martinez and diaz 1998 seo et al 2017 shakaib et al 2012 taamneh and bataineh 2017 taking into consideration that tp and conduction heat loss is an inherent process deficiency which cannot be fully mitigated it is highly desirable to seek alternative approaches to alleviate heat loss and achieve a sustainable md performance a recently developed approach called localized heating supplies the heat energy directly to the membrane liquid interface maintaining a stable temperature regime across the membrane as a result the evaporation process can be augmented at the membrane s surface the concept of localized heating can be realized throughthe self heating membranes some researchers have attempted to develop these membranes using photo thermal materialswhich can convert light energy into heat using the thermo plasmonic effect dongare et al 2017 politano et al 2017 tan et al 2018 wu et al 2018 ye et al 2019 thejoule heating phenomenon in which the kinetic energy of electrons is converted into thermal energy upon passing electrical currents anvari et al 2019 boo and elimelech 2017 dudchenko et al 2017 song et al 2019 is another example of supplying energy to a membrane surface dudchenko et al investigatedlocalized heating in md using joule heating on a carbon nanotube composite md membrane dudchenko et al 2017 shukla et al also studied the concept of localized heating of a hollow fiber membrane in sweeping gas md shukla et al 2015 in a morerecent approach anvari et al demonstrated localized heating with radio frequency based induction coupling where energy was transferred remotely through an induction heating power supply anvari et al 2019 the concept of self heating membranes has been well explored in the context of localized heating and has obtained improved flux results jiang et al 2019 however all such approaches are based on manipulating the membrane surface properties the membrane surface properties such as wettability and adhesiveness are crucial in ensuring the membrane functionality in md in addition the stability of coating material may degrade leading to a decrease in water flux and overall system performance especially for larger scale applications to push md technology into new energy efficient realms a viable solution to confront tp while maintaining membrane integrity needs to be found to the best of our knowledge no studies have been demonstrated to conceptualize localized heating that does not affect the membrane surface properties in our study we propose to provide the heat energy locally inside the membrane module close to the feed membrane liquid interface using an electric heating coil by delivering the heat locally a stable temperature regime can be maintained without manipulating the membrane as the heating coil only heats a thin layer of the feed water at the membrane liquid interface the tp effect will decrease hence the water vapor flux will increase leading to a decrease in the specific energy consumption improved gain output ratio gor compared to the conventional bulk feed water heating additionally a new dead end dcmd configuration zero feed circulation combined with localized heating was investigated and reported for the first time this showedthe elimination of circulation heat loss which cannot be realized in conventional md due to rapid temperature stratification the system s overall performance significantly improved with the energy efficacy approaching the thermodynamic minimum energy requirement for water evaporation three dimensional 3 d numerical calculations were simultaneously performed for each tested md configuration to elucidate the heat transfer mechanism and associated permeate flux enhancement we embedded a nichrome heating coil in a circular shaped md flow cell setup and performed experiments on different md configurations in order to compare the performance parameters between the conventional bulk heating and the localized heating 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed and coolant waters red sea water conductivity 58 8 ms cm see detailed

the localized heating concept and for simplicity a commercial heating coil nichrome wire was utilized as shown in fig 1 a such a coil is expected to be stable under the highly ionic environments

where a is the membrane s active surface area m2 and δ t is md time h 2 5 localized heating configurations in the localized heating cross flow configuration fig 1c the feed water was heated by a build in heating coil embedded next to a membrane surface the feed and coolant feed flow rates and temperatures were the same as in the bulk heating configuration in the localized heating dead end configuration fig 1d the feed water was fed by gravity from a feed tank which was positioned above the md module and heated by a heating coil inside the md module the localized heating dead end with intermittent flush configuration was similar to that of the localized heating dead end except that the feed water inside the md module was flushed out to a new portion of feed the feed pump at a flow rate of 1000 ml min was used to flush the feed channel for 1 min at 30 minutes interval all the md experiments were conducted based on 1 kwh of the energy input the same energy consumption which was recorded by the energy meter hisence china each experiment was replicated to ensure its repeatability 2 6 analytical and surface characterization techniques a conductivity meter model 3310 wtw usa was used to monitor the coolant conductivity to ensure the membrane s integrity during the md runs the coolant conductivity was below 15 µs cm during all experiments in order to investigate the heating effect on a surface of polymeric membrane the membrane was placed inside the md module and heated locally to 60 c using the same feed water the membranes were extracted and subjected to a range of surface characterization techniques to ensure no surface damage or loss in hydrophobicity occurred after the localized heating process a scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss merlin gemini ii germany was employed to observe the changes in membrane morphology the samples were coated by a 4 nm iridium layer and sem imaging was performed at an acceleration voltage of 5 kv a fouriertransform infrared ft ir spectrometer spectrum 100 perkin elmer with an attenuated total reflectance atr attachment in a scanning range of 500 cm 1 4000 cm 1 was utilized to investigate the functional groups present on the membrane surfaces before and after localized heating the membrane hydrophobicity was determined by measuring surface contact angles using a drop shape analyzer attension theta nanoscience usa to ensure that md module was not damaged upon the coil heating its surface temperature was measured by using fluke tis40 thermal infrared camera and no visual signs of module buckling bending or melting were observed 2 7 numerical model a numerical model was utilized to predict the mass transport through the tested md configurations at the pore level the mass transport through the membrane is primarily determined by the ratio of the mean free path of water vapor molecule to the membrane pore diameter d p referred to as knudsen number kn olatunji and camacho 2018 7 k n λ d p the water vapor mean free path λ can be determined as olatunji and camacho 2018 8 λ k b t m 2 p m σ v 2 where kb is the boltzmann constant 1 38 10 23 j k pm is the mean average pressure in membrane pores pa tm is the membrane surface temperature and σ is the water vapor collision diameter 0 2641 nm depending on the value of kn three possible mass transfer modes exist as follows a knudsen diffusion kn 1 in which molecular collisions with the walls dominate as compared to the gas gas collisions b molecular diffusion kn 0 01 in which the frequency of gas molecule collisions is much higher than those with the pore walls and c knudsen molecular diffusion 0 01 kn 1 in which the frequency of molecular collisions with the pore walls is similar to that of the gas gas collisions often referred to as transitional regime olatunji and camacho 2018 based on the membrane pore diameter the knudsen number was calculated to be kn 0 5 it implies that for the membrane used in the experiments the mass transport mode is primarily determined by the knudsen molecular diffusion theory olatunji and camacho 2018 according to theknudsen molecular diffusion theory the flux of an ideal gas through a pore is directly proportional to that of the pressure difference according to the following equation 9 j c m p m f p m p where c m is the mass transfer coefficient lm 2s 1pa 1 p m f and p m p are the vapor pressures

coefficient average air pressure pa total pressure pa ideal gas constant j mole k and mean temperature k respectively in order to predict membrane surface temperatures t m on the feed and permeate sides a conjugate heat transfer calculation coupled with the navier stokes equation was performed on the exact replicate of the md module and configurations which were used in this study see section s1 si for computational domainused and mesh independence the numerical details including appropriate governing equations and relevant boundary conditions are presented elsewhere subramanian et al 2019 the computations were simultaneously coupled in the fluid domains feed and permeate channels with the solid domain membrane by appropriate boundary conditions present model does not take into account the fouling process and presented modeling results only help to understand the hydrodynamics and the associated physical heat transfer occurring inside the module in different md configurations in this model we assumed the feed and permeate to behave like newtonian fluid with incompressible properties the governing equations and the parametric values used in the present work are provided in section s2 si at each time step the conservation equations 3 dimensional mass momentum and energy equations were solved using the conjugate heat transfer formulation ansys 2019 the spatial temperature distribution flow velocity and pressure distribution were determined on each discretized control volume total 30 million in all computation domains feed permeate and membrane the surface temperature profiles were extracted to compute the vapor pressures as given by the empirical antoine equation eq 10 based on the pressure difference the permeate flux j eq 9 at each time was computed using the knudsen molecular diffusion theory through a user define function udf in the ansys fluent framework this procedure was continued until a quasi steady steady state was achieved the whole numerical framework was incorporated in ansys fluent software version 19 0 by employing a second order space quick ansys 2019 qamar et al 2014 and time discretization the temperature polarization coefficient tpc was calculated as below 12 τ t p t f m t p m t f t p where tfm and tpm are the average membrane surface temperatures on the feed and permeate sides respectively and tf 60 c and tp 25 c are the bulk feed and permeate temperatures respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 improvement of permeate flux by localized heating fig 2 shows permeatefluxes and feed temperatures inside the md module achieved in different md configurations as a function of process time at a total energy input of 1 kwh when the md system was operated in bulk heating mode fig 2a it took approximately 50 mins for the feed temperature to reach its set point of 60 c the permeate flux gradually increased until it reached a steady state value of 5 6 0 3kg m2h the mass of produced permeate in this modewas 362 2 g fig 3 when the process was run in the localized heating cross flow mode a significant improvement in permeate flux was observed fig 2b in this mode the feed water was heated only inside the md module so that the feed temperature reached its set point 60 c around 1 7 times faster compared to that of a bulk heating mode a 10 5 increase in permeate flux was observed once the feed temperature reached its set point 60 c due to diminishing tp upon localized heating therefore the elimination of tp and circulation heat loss leads to longer md duration per 1 kwh of input energy consequently permeate production increased by almost 80 reaching 650 22 g fig 3 thelocalized heating dead end mode exhibited a significantly better md performance than the localized heating cross flow reachingthe set feed temperaturefive times faster compared with the bulk heating fig 2c this was accompanied by an additional 20 increase in the permeate flux from 6 0 1 kg m2h to 7 2 1 3 kg m2h once the feed water temperature reached 60 c under this condition a substantially enhanced permeateproduction of 825 81 gwas observed however when the md system was operated in localized heating cross flow mode the permeate flux decreased with the increase in process time fig 2b this phenomenon was more pronounced in case of localized heating dead end configuration fig 2c compared to that of localized heating cross flow configuration although the md process is the least affectedby the feed water salinity as comparedto other membrane desalination processes curcio and drioli 2005 olatunji and camacho 2018 soukane et al 2017 yang et al 2014 a continuous permeate flux decrease was observed in the localized heating dead end mode during the entire md operation due to the accumulation of feed water constituents at the membrane surface the localized heating dead end could promote membrane fouling as a result of the rapid development of the concentration boundary layer whichmay causethe accumulation of foulants near the membrane surface hence reducing the mass and heat transfers across the membrane to address this issue we introduced an intermittent flush configuration localized heating dead end with intermittent flush in which the feed water inside the md module is flushed at a predetermined time interval of 30 minutes so that the accumulated fouling is washedaway from the membrane surface and normal md operation is resumed as a result a maximum permeate flux of 9 8 1 6kg m2h fig 2d corresponding to a mass of produced permeate water per 1 kwh of 845 38 g fig 3 wasobserved theapplication of the intermittent flush allowed a more stable permeate flux which gradually reached its steadystate after the fourthflush cycle fig 2d as a result the permeate flux at the end of this process was higher than that achieved with the localized heating dead end configuration we therefore expect that the combined effect of localized heating and an intermittent flush will enable a more sustainable md performance during long term operations by maintaining a more stable permeate flux while alleviating membrane fouling 3 2 heat transfer mechanism and permeate flux enhancement in localized heating three dimensional simulations were conducted to comprehend the physical understanding of the localized heating in various md configurations and to elucidate the effect of hydrodynamic conditions on the heat transfer process prevailing in each md configuration to allow for the comparison of the experimental and modelling results all flow and geometric conditions as well as membrane properties were assumed similar to those utilized in experimental md runs parametric details of simulations including model geometry and meshing are available in the si the localized heating dead end with intermittent flush configuration was not simulated as flush requires a concentration polarization model to be implemented in numerical framework which is beyond the scope of this study nevertheless for the first cycle of a localized heating dead end with intermittent flush mode the hydrodynamics and thermal conditions inside the md module are expected to be the same as for the localized heating dead end configuration also evident from experimental flux behavior for the first flush cycle fig 2d thus for the initial physical insight the results of the localized heating dead end simulation are sufficient to gauge the localized heating dead end with intermittent flush performance fig 4 shows the hydrodynamic conditions fig 4 a c and corresponding thermal snapshots that predominated inside the feed channels fig 4 d e when the feed temperature inside the feed channel reached its set point of 60 c at a location corresponding to a temperature sensor location in the experiments as seen the streamtraces overlapped with the velocity magnitude indicatingthe path and velocity magnitude at various locations when the feed fluid passed through the channel with the heating element installed fig 4 a c for the bulk heating and localized heating cross flow configurations the feed and permeate flow rates were kept the same as in experimental runs the only difference was that in the bulk heating mode the inlet feed water temperature was set to 60 c and the heating element was not powered while in the localized heating mode the feed entered at 24 c ambient temperature with the powered element to provide thermal heat flux of 14 000 w m2 locally near the membrane surface for these two cases the hydrodynamics streamtraces and velocity magnitudes conditions look similar fig 4b as the feed fluid entered the md module it traveled straight until the fluid encountered the central region the void region with no heating coil filaments due to this design of the heating element two vortices were trapped in the center of the heating coil and divided the whole incoming flow into two sections as seen in fig 4a and b the recirculating region marked schematically in fig 4a swept the majority of the module with the low velocity having epicenter at the center of the coil ahead of this recirculation region the flow converged and exited out of the md module the highest velocity magnitude was observed in the middle region of the md module in general a relatively low velocity magnitude of 0 01 m s inside the feed channel was observed with a narrow region in the center achieving a higher velocity magnitude in the range of 0 06 to 0 07 m s fig 4a and b since there is no inlet velocity in the case of localized heating dead end mode the flow field evolution inside the feed channel was solely driven by the thermal convection which was generated by the heating coil consequently the fluid movement was scattered resulting in a significantly lower velocity magnitude 0 001m s fig 4c the thermal snapshot is presented in the form of a spatial temperature distribution along a slice which was extracted from the top of a feed channel at a depth of 9 mm this slice passed through the heating filament so that the associated thermal distribution and influence of localized heating could be visualized in the case of a bulk heating mode the feed liquid was heated outside the md module consequently the highest temperature was observed in the central region of the md module fig 4d as the feed residence time in this region was shorter due to a higher fluid velocity fig 4a thereby allowing minimal heat dissipation contrarily as indicated by lower feed temperatures less than the feed inlet temperature more heat dissipation was observed in the low velocity regions with existed fluid recirculation in the case of localized heating cross flow the spatial velocity and temperature distributions inside the module were completely reversed fig 4e as the incoming feed was not heated externally and the heating element was powered the central region of the md module had the lowest temperature related to the design of the coil similar to the bulk heating mode this effect was attributed to a higher feed flow velocity observed in this region which did not allow enough residence time for the feed water to extract heat from the heating element the low recirculating region however showed a significant increase in temperature with the maximum being in the range of 88 c 96 c due to a larger heat transfer caused by increased fluid residence time furthermore an asymmetry in temperature distribution was observed in the left and right recirculating regions as seen in fig 4e the left region was characterized by a slightly higher temperature as it had a larger recirculating region fig 4a thereby providing additional residence time for the fluid to extract the heat from the heating coil also the ends of the heating coil were closer to this region which also aided in supplying a larger coil surface area to improve the heat transfer finally for the localized heating dead end case an effective uniform feed heating was achieved due to a no flow condition as observed in fig 4f the feed in the vicinity of the heating coil was effectively heated and the void region of the coil central region had the lowest temperature the heat distribution inside the feed channel was primarily governed by the interaction between the heating coil and the incoming feed through the convection process however at the membrane surface the evaporation and heat loss by conduction primarily resulted in tp which significantly altered surface temperatures on the feed and permeate sides of the membrane as known permeate flux which passes through the membrane pores is solely dependent on the vapor pressure difference across the membrane khayet and matsuura 2011 therefore the membrane surface temperature is crucial and ultimately determines the performance of any md configuration to account for this effect the spatial membrane surface temperatures were extracted and utilized to compute the vapor pressures using the antoine equation eq 10 permeate flux at each computational node on the surface was computed using the knudsen molecular diffusion as described in section 2 6 fig 5 a c show the membrane surface temperatures at the feed and permeate sides as well as the spatial fluxes obtained through the numerical model for the md configurations modelled in this work for the case of bulk heating the central membrane region had the highest temperature of 60 c whereas the majority of other regions were characterized by lower temperatures in the range of 33 c 45 c the heat losses by conduction and evaporation were visible in the central region on the permeate side where permeate temperature increased locally however the highest permeate flux was still observed in the central region which is attributed to the largest temperature gradient corresponding to the highest vapor pressure difference across the membrane surface similarly in a localized heating cross flow configuration powered heating element instead of fluid bulk heating lower temperatures on the feed side were observed in the central region on both feed and permeate sides fig 5b moreover the high permeate flux region interchanged and higher local flux values were observed over a larger membrane surface area compared to that of a bulk heating configuration the elevated permeate fluxes observed in the localized heating dead end configuration were attributed to more uniform heat transfer from the heating coil which resulted in increased feed water temperature and corresponding temperature gradient over a larger membrane surface area compared to the bulk heatingconfiguration fig 5c as a result the temperature gradients across the membrane and corresponding permeate fluxes were enhanced besides tpc values shown in fig 5 indicate that highest polarization was observed in the bh mode 0 385 followed by the lhcf 0 437 and lhde 0 514 modes as a result lhde configuration was capable of effectively reducing tp by 33 as compared to that of bh mode the spatial average values of permeate fluxes over the membrane surface were further calculated and compared to those obtained during actual md experiments as seen in fig 5d the spatial average permeate fluxes predicted by the model had values of 4 86 kg m2 h 8 43 kg m2 h and 11 56 kg m2 h for the bulk heating localized heating cross flow and localized heating dead end respectively which is correlates well with permeate fluxes achieved experimentally when the feed temperature reached its pre set value of 60 c the slight variation between the experimental and model results was attributed to the following factors first the heat loss to the ambient environment through the acrylic md module could not be controlled whereas to simplify the simulations in adiabatic conditions no heat loss from the outer boundary was assumed furthermore possible membrane curvature inside the flow cell may have affected some heat transfer and channel hydrodynamic characteristics which are ignored in the present simulations 3 3 energy analysis since md is a thermally driven process it requires a liquid vapor phase change energy called enthalpy of vaporization which is two to three orders of magnitude higher than the gibbs energy of separation required in the ro process 650 kwh m3 versus 0 76 kwh m3 0 recovery in ro elimelech and phillip 2011 semiat 2008 furthermore the reported sec and gor values of the md system are albeit dispersed reported in the range of 1 kwh m3 9 000 kwh m3 ghaffour et al 2015 khayet 2013 yang et al 2014 and 0 1 5 summers et al 2012 respectively herein we comprehensively evaluated energy performance and heat transfer of the localized heating md system and compared the results with those achieved in bulk heating md to evaluate how the localized heating affects the md specificenergy consumption the total heat energy content of the feed flow are consumed through three main processes circulation conduction and evaporation the circulation heat existed only in the case of bulk heating calculated to be around 36 4 of the total heat input the circulation heat treated as wasted heat does not contribute to the distillation process unlike bulk heating the localized heating mode has anincorporated electric heating coil and no circulation heat loss since the localized heating cross flow maintained a stable temperature across the membrane the thermal boundary layer existed in its minimum form with the least tp the total heat energy utilized in evaporation q e v and conduction q c d across the membrane was calculated using eqs 2 and 3 as shown in fig 6 a the q c d dominates over q e v in bulk heating at 50 and 29 6 respectively it indicates the least amount of energy utilized in the distillation process in localized heating cross flow the evaporation heat increased to 47 7 compared to the 29 6 in bulk heating this illustrates the decrease in tp due to the inbuilt heating which provides a stable temperature regime further in localized heating cross flow and localized heating dead end with intermittent flush the conduction heat loss decreased to around 33 6 mainly due to the absence of feed circulation however the evaporation heat energy in the case of localized heating dead end decreased from the localized heating cross flow mainly due to the effect of concentration accumulation after a certain time a lower value of the heat required for evaporation could be attributed to the increased fouling accumulation at the membrane surface which suppressed vapor evaporation at the pore entrance chen et al 2020 fortunato et al 2018 sec values for all four md configurations were calculated according to eq 4 and are shown in fig 6c the bulk heating has the highest sec value around 2 762 kwh m3 22 kwh m3 the localized heating cross flow showed around a 44 decrease in sec compared with the bulk heating in localized heating dead endand localized heating dead end with intermittent flushing configurations the sec further decreased and reached the lowest value of 1183 kwh m3 for localized heating dead end with intermittent flush this significant decrease in sec is attributed to the increase in the permeate production resulting from the localized heating this elevatedpermeate water flux was caused by a decrease in tp and increased evaporation during the localized heating also a rapid increase of the feed water temperature to its set value of 60 c enhanced initial permeate flux and totalpermeate production so that the sec values were reduced to 1 213 139 kwh m3 and 1 183 57 kwh m3 in localized heating dead end and localized heating dead end with intermittent flush respectively when comparing calculated sec values with the theoretical thermodynamic minimum energy of thermal evaporation required to evaporate 1 kg of water 650 kwh m3 semiat 2008 shown as a dashed line in fig 6c we observed that the localized heating dead end and localized heating dead end with intermittent flush configurations were positioned almost twice as close to the thermodynamic minimum energy of evaporation value compared to that of thebulk heating mode moreover the localized dead end md energy consumptions 4258 kj kg demonstrated in this studyare significantly lower than those reported previously forthe conventional md systems 118 000 kj kg for the dcmd luo and lior 2017 42 696 kj kg for the vacuum md song et al 2019 and 82 800 kj kg for the air gap md alkhudhiri and hilal 2017 therefore a 44 57 increase in specific energy efficiency improvements was achieved in localized heating modes cross flow and dead end due to reduced tp and enhanced water evaporation on the membrane surface as shown in fig 6c the gor values of bulk heating and localized heating were calculated as per eq 5 and shown in fig 6b bulk heating has the lowest gor of 0 24 increasing with the localized heating which showed a 78 increase in localized heating cross flow the localized heating dead end with intermittent flush showed the highest gor value 0 6 the significant increase in the gor value in localized heating is associated with the higher flux resulting from a decreased thermal boundary layer furthermore the absence of a feed flow condition inside the md module and corresponding increase in evaporation allowed fora significant enhancement of gor values during the dead end localized heating 124 21 and 132 12 increases for the localized heating dead end and localized heating dead end with intermittent flush modes respectively 3 4 effect of the localized heating on membrane integrity and morphology given that the heating coil inside the md module is located next to the membrane surface it is essential to determine if localized heating would impose any adverse effects on the surface of the polymeric membrane the changes in the membrane s integrity and morphology were evaluated by a range of surface characterization techniques including sem atr ft ir and contact angle measurements a comparison of sem images of a virgin membrane with the membrane subjected to localized heating fig 7 a and b revealed no changes in surface morphology after surface heating so that both images exhibited typical node like ptfe structures this observation was further supported by the results of the atr ft ir spectroscopy fig 7c with both membrane surfaces producing characteristicptfe bands at 1204 cm 1 1150 cm 1 and 637 cm 1 these bands were ascribed to the asymmetrical stretching symmetrical stretching and waggling of cf2 groups respectively piwowarczyk et al 2019 the contact angle measurements revealed no significant difference between the virgin and after surface heating surfaces 135 1o 2 8 and 131 2o 1 1 respectively fig 7d and e hence it can be concluded that localized heating did not compromise membrane integrity nor affect its morphological properties yet we suggest the use of custom made flexible coils specifically designed for this application to be used for different module geometries aiming to eliminate dead zones ali et al 2019 qamar et al 2019 4 future prospects this proposed work aims to minimize the problem of intrinsic md process deficiency the phenomenon of tp which stems from the heat losses during water evaporation and conduction loss imposes substantial process limitations as a result md performance and permeate production are impended the localized heating targets fundamental issue of tp and offers innovative approach to mitigate this phenomenon so that thermal efficiency and permeate production are improved significant difference of this technology from the existing ones is that localized heating is capable of delivering thermal energy directly to the feed water membrane interface throughout the entire feed channel length by utilizing joule heating elements so that the stable feed temperature is maintained in terms of process control and scalability several routs are proposed for instance joule heating inside the md module can be achieved by filling the feed channel with metallic spacers tan et al 2020 similarly to incorporate localized heating into a spiral wound module thin nichrome wire mesh or nichrome wire weaved in polymeric spacer can be employed in case of a hollow fiber module a hollow fiber bundle can be inserted between the two helical shaped heating elements to ensure that both inner and outer fibers are equally heated alternatively a thin heating element could be pulled through the fiber lumen to provide precise heating of each fiber although these approaches deem viable they require sophisticated and accurate temperature control system to ensure process integrity application of multiple thermistors with the feedback controlled by the artificial intelligence technologies would be a potential future direction to transfer the localized heating technology to a commercial scale 5 conclusion in this study we have successfully applied localized heating by incorporating an electric heating coil inside the md module different configurations including a new dead end md mode were investigated numerically and validated through a series of experiments results showed that dead end md with localized heating outperformed all the other configurations in terms of vapor flux and energy consumption mainly due to the minimization of tp caused by temperature stratification occurring in conventional md the introduction of intermittent flush to the dead end concept further improved the md performance by reducing membrane fouling and associated heat losses modeling results revealed that localized heating provided more uniform heat transfer across the membrane due to increased feed water temperature over a larger membrane area as a result the tp across the membrane was mitigated and corresponding permeate fluxes were enhanced dead end localized heating showed 10 45 increase in water vapor flux for the different configurations 44 57 decrease in specific energy consumption for cross flow and dead end modes reaching 1183 kwh m3 dead end thus approaching the thermodynamic minimum energy limit for water evaporation 650 kwh m3 increase of gor values by 132 12 the surface characterization techniques confirmed no changes in membrane integrity and morphology after prolonged surface heating which provides a promising new framework for sustainable md development therefore we expect that the combined effect of localized heating and intermittent flush in dead end mode will enable more sustainable md for long term operations by maintaining more stable vapor flux while alleviating membrane fouling

17334,membrane distillation md has the high potential to circumvent conventional desalination limitations in treating highly saline brines however the performance of md is limited by its low thermal efficiencyand temperature polarization tp effect consequently the driving force decreases when heat loss increases in this study we propose to minimize tp through localized heating where the thin feed channel was heated uniformly at the membrane liquid interface without changing the properties of the membrane this concept was further improved by implementing a new dead end md configuration investigated for the first time this configuration eliminated circulation heat losses which cannot be realized in conventional md due to a rapid temperature stratification in addition the accumulation of foulants on the membrane surface was successfully controlled by intermittent flushing 3 dimensional conjugate heat transfer modeling revealedmore uniform heat transfer and temperature gradient across the membrane due to the increased feed water temperature over a larger membrane area the increase of water vapor flux 45 and the reduction of heat lossobserved in the new dead end concept led to a decrease of the specific energy consumption by 57 corresponding to a gain output ratio increase of about 132 compared to a conventional bulk heating while preserving membrane integrity a conjugate heat transfer model was deployed in ansys fluent framework to elucidate on the mechanism of flux enhancement associated with the proposed technique this study provides a framework for future

industry has grown exponentially in recent decades currently employing more than 18 000 desalination plants around the world ida 2015 jones et al 2019 membrane distillation md is an emerging desalination process which can produce high quality water from both natural water sources like seawater andrés mañas et al 2018 shim et al 2015 or groundwater naji et al 2020 plattner et al 2017 as well as from brines elcik et al 2020 sanmartino et al 2017 schwantes et al 2018 its moderate operating conditions make it a promising economical and energy saving desalination approach alsaadi et al 2015 curcio and drioli 2005 subramani and jacangelo 2015 yang et al 2014 contrary to seawater reverse osmosis swro md does not require high grade electrical energy for its operation and works in a lower feed water temperature range compared to multi stage flush msf while producing high quality freshwater md also has an advantage in treating highly saline feed waters facilitating high salt rejection and low fouling propensity as compared to other well established desalination technologies kim et al 2016 subramani and jacangelo 2015 wang 2018 wang and chung 2015 however despite the high potential of the md process to circumvent conventional desalination technologies its energy consumption remains ambiguous due to inherent heat loss by conduction and evaporation eleiwi et al 2016

al 1987 lokare et al 2018 furthermore when the feed water enters the md module its bulk temperature is higher compared to the membrane surface because ofconvective energy losses and latent heat release during the liquid to gas phase transition elmarghany et al 2019 lee et al 2016 the extent to which feed temperature at the membrane surface differs from its bulk value is knownas temperature polarization tp tp can be as high as 10 c leading to decreased heat and mass transport rates across the membrane alsaadi et al 2018 rezaei et al 2018 consequently the md energy efficiency decreasesdue to the limitations of the thermal boundary layer at the membrane liquid interface alsaadi et al 2018 santoro et al 2017 several studies have mitigated tp by using turbulence creators such as spacers however this approach creates additional pressure on energy requirements kim et al 2018 l martinez and diaz 1998 seo et al 2017 shakaib et al 2012 taamneh and bataineh 2017 taking into consideration that tp and conduction heat loss is an inherent process deficiency which cannot be fully mitigated it is highly desirable to seek alternative approaches to alleviate heat loss and achieve a sustainable md performance a recently developed approach called localized heating supplies the heat energy directly to the membrane liquid interface maintaining a stable temperature regime across the

demonstrated localized heating with radio frequency based induction coupling where energy was transferred remotely through an induction heating power supply anvari et al 2019 the concept of self heating membranes has been well explored in the context of localized heating and has obtained improved flux results jiang et al 2019 however all such approaches are based on manipulating the membrane surface properties the membrane surface properties such as wettability and adhesiveness are crucial in ensuring the membrane functionality in md in addition the stability of coating material may degrade leading to a decrease in water flux and overall system performance especially for larger scale applications to push md technology into new energy efficient realms a viable solution to confront tp while maintaining membrane integrity needs to be found to the best of our knowledge no studies have been demonstrated to conceptualize localized heating that does not affect the membrane surface properties in our study we propose to provide the heat energy locally inside the membrane module close to the feed membrane liquid interface using an electric heating coil by delivering the heat locally a stable temperature regime can be maintained without manipulating the membrane as the heating coil only heats a thin layer of the feed water at the membrane liquid interface the tp effect will decrease hence the water vapor flux will increase leading to a decrease in the specific energy consumption improved gain output ratio gor compared to the conventional bulk feed water heating additionally a new dead end dcmd configuration zero feed circulation combined with localized heating was investigated and reported for the first time this showedthe elimination of circulation heat loss which cannot be realized in conventional md due to rapid temperature stratification the system s overall performance significantly improved with the energy efficacy approaching the thermodynamic minimum energy requirement for water evaporation three dimensional 3 d numerical calculations were simultaneously performed for each tested md configuration to elucidate the heat transfer mechanism and associated permeate flux enhancement we embedded a nichrome heating coil in a circular shaped md flow cell setup and performed experiments on different md configurations in order to compare the

coil although we aspired to have a spacer shaped heating element it is challenging to fabricate such elements and achieve a stable performance in highly saline environments e g seawater thus to gauge the localized heating concept and for simplicity a commercial heating coil nichrome wire was utilized as shown in fig 1 a such a coil is expected to be stable under the highly ionic environments because the nichrome wire inside the coil is protected by the electrical insulation 2 3 heating configurations three different configurations were tested using a large membrane surface area as shown

presents a schematic diagram of the bulk heating configuration the dcmd process was conducted in a counter current mode and the feed and coolant were supplied to the module from the corresponding feed and coolant tanks by using gear pumps model 75211 cole parmer usa with flow rates of 300 ml min and 280 ml min respectively the feed flow rate was set to 20 ml min more than the permeate flow to compensate the flow effect of pump gear assembly at an elevated temperature the cooling and heating were achieved by circulation bathes model 600 f julabo germany the feed and coolant temperatures were set at 60 c and 25 c respectively the inlet and outlet temperatures of feed and coolant were measured by the 10k thermistors and recorded by a multiplexer data logger model 34972a keysight usa an additional 10k thermistor was used as a feedback control to maintain a stable feed water temperature of 60 c the mass of coolant was recorded by a digital balance model ml6002t mettler toledo usa 2 3

consisted of two circular channels to accommodate the feed and coolant waters a heating coil was implanted at the feed side of the module adjacent to the membrane surface the associated dimensions of the heating coil and its placement location inside the feed channel are shown in the supplementary information fig s1 si the temperature inside the module was monitored by the 10k thermistors omega engineering inc uk a hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane membrane solutions china with an average pore size of 0 22 μm and 85 porosity as provided by the manufacturer was utilized in all

in heating coil embedded next to a membrane surface the feed and coolant feed flow rates and temperatures were the same as in the bulk heating configuration in the localized heating dead end configuration fig 1d the feed water was fed by gravity from a feed tank which was positioned above the md module and heated by a heating coil inside the md module the localized heating dead end with intermittent flush configuration was similar to that of the localized heating dead end except that the feed water inside the md module was flushed out to a new portion of feed the feed pump at a flow rate of 1000 ml min was used to flush the feed channel for 1 min at 30 minutes interval all the md experiments were conducted based on 1 kwh of the energy input the same energy consumption which was recorded by the energy meter hisence china each experiment was replicated to ensure its repeatability 2 6 analytical and surface characterization techniques a conductivity meter model 3310 wtw usa was used to monitor the coolant conductivity to ensure the membrane s integrity during the md runs the coolant conductivity was below 15 µs cm during all experiments in order to investigate the heating effect on a surface of polymeric membrane the membrane was placed inside the md module and heated locally to 60 c using the same feed water the membranes were extracted and subjected to a range of surface characterization techniques to ensure no surface damage or loss in hydrophobicity occurred after the localized heating process a scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss merlin gemini ii germany was employed to observe the changes in membrane morphology the samples were coated by a 4 nm iridium layer and sem imaging was performed at an acceleration voltage of 5 kv a fouriertransform infrared ft ir spectrometer spectrum 100 perkin elmer with an attenuated total reflectance atr attachment in a scanning range of 500 cm 1 4000 cm 1 was utilized to investigate the functional groups present on the membrane surfaces before and after localized heating the membrane hydrophobicity was determined by measuring surface contact angles using a drop shape analyzer attension theta nanoscience usa to ensure that md module was not damaged upon the coil heating its surface temperature was measured by using fluke tis40 thermal infrared camera and no visual signs of module buckling bending or melting were observed 2 7 numerical model a numerical model was utilized to predict the mass transport through the tested md configurations at the pore level the mass transport through the membrane is primarily determined by the ratio of the mean free path of water vapor molecule to the membrane pore diameter d p referred to as knudsen number kn olatunji and camacho 2018 7 k n λ d p the water vapor mean free path λ can be determined as olatunji and camacho 2018 8 λ k b t m 2 p m σ v 2 where kb is the boltzmann constant 1 38 10 23 j k pm is the mean average pressure in membrane pores pa tm is the membrane surface temperature and σ is the water vapor collision diameter 0 2641 nm depending on the value of kn three possible mass transfer modes exist as follows a knudsen diffusion kn 1 in which molecular collisions with the walls dominate as compared to the gas gas collisions b molecular diffusion kn 0 01 in which the frequency of gas molecule collisions is much higher than those with the pore walls and c knudsen molecular diffusion 0 01 kn 1 in which the frequency of molecular collisions with the pore walls is similar to that of the gas gas collisions often referred to as transitional regime olatunji and camacho 2018 based on the membrane pore diameter the knudsen number was calculated to be kn 0 5 it implies that for the membrane used in the experiments the mass transport mode is primarily determined by the knudsen molecular diffusion theory olatunji and camacho 2018 according to theknudsen molecular diffusion theory the flux of an ideal gas through a pore is directly proportional to that of the pressure difference according to the following equation 9 j c m p m f p m p where c m is the mass transfer coefficient lm 2s 1pa 1 p m f and p m p are the vapor pressures

coefficient average air pressure pa total pressure pa ideal gas constant j mole k and mean temperature k respectively in order to predict membrane surface temperatures t m on the feed and permeate sides a conjugate heat transfer calculation coupled with the navier stokes equation was performed on the exact replicate of the md module and configurations which were used in this study see section s1 si for computational domainused and mesh independence the numerical details including appropriate governing equations and relevant boundary conditions are presented elsewhere subramanian et al 2019 the computations were simultaneously coupled in the fluid domains feed and permeate channels with the solid domain membrane by appropriate boundary conditions present model does not take into account the fouling process and presented modeling results only help to understand the hydrodynamics and the associated physical heat transfer occurring inside the module in different md configurations in this model we assumed the feed and permeate to behave like newtonian fluid with incompressible properties the governing equations and the parametric values used in the present work are provided in section s2 si at each time step the conservation equations 3 dimensional mass momentum and energy equations were solved using the conjugate heat transfer formulation ansys 2019 the spatial temperature distribution flow velocity and pressure distribution were determined on each discretized control volume total 30 million in all computation domains feed permeate and membrane the surface temperature profiles were extracted to compute the vapor pressures as given by the empirical antoine equation eq 10 based on the pressure difference the permeate flux j eq 9 at each time was computed using the knudsen molecular diffusion theory through a user define function udf in the ansys fluent framework this procedure was continued until a quasi steady steady state was achieved the whole numerical framework was incorporated in ansys fluent software version 19 0 by employing a second order space quick ansys 2019 qamar et al 2014 and time discretization the temperature polarization coefficient tpc was calculated as below 12 τ t p t f m t p m t f t p where tfm and tpm are the average membrane surface temperatures on the feed and permeate sides respectively and tf 60 c and tp 25 c are the bulk feed and permeate temperatures respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 improvement of permeate flux by localized heating fig 2 shows permeatefluxes and feed temperatures inside the md module achieved in different md configurations as a function of process time at a total energy input of 1 kwh when the md system was operated in bulk heating mode fig 2a it took approximately 50 mins for the feed temperature to reach its set point of 60 c the permeate flux gradually increased until it reached a steady state value of 5 6 0 3kg m2h the mass of produced permeate in this modewas 362 2 g fig 3 when the process was run in the localized heating cross flow mode a significant improvement in permeate flux was observed fig 2b in this mode the feed water was heated only inside the md module so that the feed temperature reached its set point 60 c around 1 7 times faster compared to that of a bulk heating mode a 10 5 increase in permeate flux was observed once the feed temperature reached its set point 60 c due to diminishing tp upon localized heating therefore the elimination of tp and circulation heat loss leads to longer md duration per 1 kwh of input energy consequently permeate production increased by almost 80 reaching 650 22 g fig 3 thelocalized heating dead end mode exhibited a significantly better md performance than the localized heating cross flow reachingthe set feed temperaturefive times faster compared with the bulk heating fig 2c this was accompanied by an additional 20 increase in the permeate flux from 6 0 1 kg m2h to 7 2 1 3 kg m2h once the feed water temperature reached 60 c under this condition a substantially enhanced permeateproduction of 825 81 gwas observed however when the md system was operated in localized heating cross flow mode the permeate flux decreased with the increase in process time fig 2b this phenomenon was more pronounced in case of localized heating dead end configuration fig 2c compared to that of localized heating cross flow configuration although the md process is the least affectedby the feed water salinity as comparedto other membrane desalination processes curcio and drioli 2005 olatunji and camacho 2018 soukane et al 2017 yang et al 2014 a continuous permeate flux decrease was observed in the localized heating dead end mode during the entire md operation due to the accumulation of feed water constituents at the membrane surface the localized heating dead end could promote membrane fouling as a result of the rapid development of the concentration boundary layer whichmay causethe accumulation of foulants near the membrane surface hence reducing the mass and heat transfers across the membrane to address this issue we introduced an intermittent flush configuration localized heating dead end with intermittent flush in which the feed water inside the md module is flushed at a predetermined time interval of 30 minutes so that the accumulated fouling is washedaway from the membrane surface and normal md operation is resumed as a result a maximum permeate flux of 9 8 1 6kg m2h fig 2d corresponding to a mass of produced permeate water per 1 kwh of 845 38 g fig 3 wasobserved theapplication of the intermittent flush allowed a more stable permeate flux which gradually reached its steadystate after the fourthflush cycle fig 2d as a result the permeate flux at the end of this process was higher than that achieved with the localized heating dead end configuration we therefore expect that the combined effect of localized heating and an intermittent flush will enable a more sustainable md performance during long term operations by maintaining a more stable permeate flux while alleviating membrane fouling 3 2 heat transfer mechanism and permeate flux enhancement in localized heating three dimensional simulations were conducted to comprehend the physical understanding of the localized heating in various md configurations and to elucidate the effect of hydrodynamic conditions on the heat transfer process prevailing in each md configuration to allow for the comparison of the experimental and modelling results all flow and geometric conditions as well as membrane properties were assumed similar to those utilized in experimental md runs parametric details of simulations including model geometry and meshing are available in the si the localized heating dead end with intermittent flush configuration was not simulated as flush requires a concentration polarization model to be implemented in numerical framework which is beyond the scope of this study nevertheless for the first cycle of a localized heating dead end with intermittent flush mode the hydrodynamics and thermal conditions inside the md module are expected to be the same as for the localized heating dead end configuration also evident from experimental flux behavior for the first flush cycle fig 2d thus for the initial physical insight the results of the localized heating dead end simulation are sufficient to gauge the localized heating dead end with intermittent flush performance fig 4 shows the hydrodynamic conditions fig 4 a c and corresponding thermal snapshots that predominated inside the feed channels fig 4 d e when the feed temperature inside the feed channel reached its set point of 60 c at a location corresponding to a temperature sensor location in the experiments as seen the streamtraces overlapped with the velocity magnitude indicatingthe path and velocity magnitude at various locations when the feed fluid passed through the channel with the heating element installed fig 4 a c for the bulk heating and localized heating cross flow configurations the feed and permeate flow rates were kept the same as in experimental runs the only difference was that in the bulk heating mode the inlet feed water temperature was set to 60 c and the heating element was not powered while in the localized heating mode the feed entered at 24 c ambient temperature with the powered element to provide thermal heat flux of 14 000 w m2 locally near the membrane surface for these two cases the hydrodynamics streamtraces and velocity magnitudes conditions look similar fig 4b as the feed fluid entered the md module it traveled straight until the fluid encountered the central region the void region with no heating coil filaments due to this design of the heating element two vortices were trapped in the center of the heating coil and divided the whole incoming flow into two sections as seen in fig 4a and b the recirculating region marked schematically in fig 4a swept the majority of the module with the low velocity having epicenter at the center of the coil ahead of this recirculation region the flow converged and exited out of the md module the highest velocity magnitude was observed in the middle region of the md module in general a relatively low velocity magnitude of 0 01 m s inside the feed channel was observed with a narrow region in the center achieving a higher velocity magnitude in the range of 0 06 to 0 07 m s fig 4a and b since there is no inlet velocity in the case of localized heating dead end mode the flow field evolution inside the feed channel was solely driven by the thermal convection which was generated by the heating coil consequently the fluid movement was scattered resulting in a significantly lower velocity magnitude 0 001m s fig 4c the thermal snapshot is presented in the form of a spatial temperature distribution along a slice which was extracted from the top of a feed channel at a depth of 9 mm this slice passed through the heating filament so that the associated thermal distribution and influence of localized heating could be visualized in the case of a bulk heating mode the feed liquid was heated outside the md module consequently the highest temperature was observed in the central region of the md module fig 4d as the feed residence time in this region was shorter due to a higher fluid velocity fig 4a thereby allowing minimal heat dissipation contrarily as indicated by lower feed temperatures less than the feed inlet temperature more heat dissipation was observed in the low velocity regions with existed fluid recirculation in the case of localized heating cross flow the spatial velocity and temperature distributions inside the module were completely reversed fig 4e as the incoming feed was not heated externally and the heating element was powered the central region of the md module had the lowest temperature related to the design of the coil similar to the bulk heating mode this effect was attributed to a higher feed flow velocity observed in this region which did not allow enough residence time for the feed water to extract heat from the heating element the low recirculating region however showed a significant increase in temperature with the maximum being in the range of 88 c 96 c due to a larger heat transfer caused by increased fluid residence time furthermore an asymmetry in temperature distribution was observed in the left and right recirculating regions as seen in fig 4e the left region was characterized by a slightly higher temperature as it had a larger recirculating region fig 4a thereby providing additional residence time for the fluid to extract the heat from the heating coil also the ends of the heating coil were closer to this region which also aided in supplying a larger coil surface area to improve the heat transfer finally for the localized heating dead end case an effective uniform feed heating was achieved due to a no flow condition as observed in fig 4f the feed in the vicinity of the heating coil was effectively heated and the void region of the coil central region had the lowest temperature the heat distribution inside the feed channel was primarily governed by the interaction between the heating coil and the incoming feed through the convection process however at the membrane surface the evaporation and heat loss by conduction primarily resulted in tp which significantly altered surface temperatures on the feed and permeate sides of the membrane as known permeate flux which passes through the membrane pores is solely dependent on the vapor pressure difference across the membrane khayet and matsuura 2011 therefore the membrane surface temperature is crucial and ultimately determines the performance of any md configuration to account for this effect the spatial membrane surface temperatures were extracted and utilized to compute the vapor pressures using the antoine equation eq 10 permeate flux at each computational node on the surface was computed using the knudsen molecular diffusion as described in section 2 6 fig 5 a c show the membrane surface temperatures at the feed and permeate sides as well as the spatial fluxes obtained through the numerical model for the md configurations modelled in this work for the case of bulk heating the central membrane region had the highest temperature of 60 c whereas the majority of other regions were characterized by lower temperatures in the range of 33 c 45 c the heat losses by conduction and evaporation were visible in the central region on the permeate side where permeate temperature increased locally however the highest permeate flux was still observed in the central region which is attributed to the largest temperature gradient corresponding to the highest vapor pressure difference across the membrane surface similarly in a localized heating cross flow configuration powered heating element instead of fluid bulk heating lower temperatures on the feed side were observed in the central region on both feed and permeate sides fig 5b moreover the high permeate flux region interchanged and higher local flux values were observed over a larger membrane surface area compared to that of a bulk heating configuration the elevated permeate fluxes observed in the localized heating dead end configuration were attributed to more uniform heat transfer from the heating coil which resulted in increased feed water temperature and corresponding temperature gradient over a larger membrane surface area compared to the bulk heatingconfiguration fig 5c as a result the temperature gradients across the membrane and corresponding permeate fluxes were enhanced besides tpc values shown in fig 5 indicate that highest polarization was observed in the bh mode 0 385 followed by the lhcf 0 437 and lhde 0 514 modes as a result lhde configuration was capable of effectively reducing tp by 33 as compared to that of bh mode the spatial average values of permeate fluxes over the membrane surface were further calculated and compared to those obtained during actual md experiments as seen in fig 5d the spatial average permeate fluxes predicted by the model had values of 4 86 kg m2 h 8 43 kg m2 h and 11 56 kg m2 h for the bulk heating localized heating cross flow and localized heating dead end respectively which is correlates well with permeate fluxes achieved experimentally when the feed temperature reached its pre set value of 60 c the slight variation between the experimental and model results was attributed to the following factors first the heat loss to the ambient environment through the acrylic md module could not be controlled whereas to simplify the simulations in adiabatic conditions no heat loss from the outer boundary was assumed furthermore possible membrane curvature inside the flow cell may have affected some heat transfer and channel hydrodynamic characteristics which are ignored in the present simulations 3 3 energy analysis since md is a thermally driven process it requires a liquid vapor phase change energy called enthalpy of vaporization which is two to three orders of magnitude higher than the gibbs energy of separation required in the ro process 650 kwh m3 versus 0 76 kwh m3 0 recovery in ro elimelech and phillip 2011 semiat 2008 furthermore the reported sec and gor values of the md system are albeit dispersed reported in the range of 1 kwh m3 9 000 kwh m3 ghaffour et al 2015 khayet 2013 yang et al 2014 and 0 1 5 summers et al 2012 respectively herein we comprehensively evaluated energy performance and heat transfer of the localized heating md system and compared the results with those achieved in bulk heating md to evaluate how the localized heating affects the md specificenergy consumption the total heat energy content of the feed flow are consumed through three main processes circulation conduction and evaporation the circulation heat existed only in the case of bulk heating calculated to be around 36 4 of the total heat input the circulation heat treated as wasted heat does not contribute to the distillation process unlike bulk heating the localized heating mode has anincorporated electric heating coil and no circulation heat loss since the localized heating cross flow maintained a stable temperature across the membrane the thermal boundary layer existed in its minimum form with the least tp the total heat energy utilized in evaporation q e v and conduction q c d across the membrane was calculated using eqs 2 and 3 as shown in fig 6 a the q c d dominates over q e v in bulk heating at 50 and 29 6 respectively it indicates the least amount of energy utilized in the distillation process in localized heating cross flow the evaporation heat increased to 47 7 compared to the 29 6 in bulk heating this illustrates the decrease in tp due to the inbuilt heating which provides a stable temperature regime further in localized heating cross flow and localized heating dead end with intermittent flush the conduction heat loss decreased to around 33 6 mainly due to the absence of feed circulation however the evaporation heat energy in the case of localized heating dead end decreased from the localized heating cross flow mainly due to the effect of concentration accumulation after a certain time a lower value of the heat required for evaporation could be attributed to the increased fouling accumulation at the membrane surface which suppressed vapor evaporation at the pore entrance chen et al 2020 fortunato et al 2018 sec values for all four md configurations were calculated according to eq 4 and are shown in fig 6c the bulk heating has the highest sec value around 2 762 kwh m3 22 kwh m3 the localized heating cross flow showed around a 44 decrease in sec compared with the bulk heating in localized heating dead endand localized heating dead end with intermittent flushing configurations the sec further decreased and reached the lowest value of 1183 kwh m3 for localized heating dead end with intermittent flush this significant decrease in sec is attributed to the increase in the permeate production resulting from the localized heating this elevatedpermeate water flux was caused by a decrease in tp and increased evaporation during the localized heating also a rapid increase of the feed water temperature to its set value of 60 c enhanced initial permeate flux and totalpermeate production so that the sec values were reduced to 1 213 139 kwh m3 and 1 183 57 kwh m3 in localized heating dead end and localized heating dead end with intermittent flush respectively when comparing calculated sec values with the theoretical thermodynamic minimum energy of thermal evaporation required to evaporate 1 kg of water 650 kwh m3 semiat 2008 shown as a dashed line in fig 6c we observed that the localized heating dead end and localized heating dead end with intermittent flush configurations were positioned almost twice as close to the thermodynamic minimum energy of evaporation value compared to that of thebulk heating mode moreover the localized dead end md energy consumptions 4258 kj kg demonstrated in this studyare significantly lower than those reported previously forthe conventional md systems 118 000 kj kg for the dcmd luo and lior 2017 42 696 kj kg for the vacuum md song et al 2019 and 82 800 kj kg for the air gap md alkhudhiri and hilal 2017 therefore a 44 57 increase in specific energy efficiency improvements was achieved in localized heating modes cross flow and dead end due to reduced tp and enhanced water evaporation on the membrane surface as shown in fig 6c the gor values of bulk heating and localized heating were calculated as per eq 5 and shown in fig 6b bulk heating has the lowest gor of 0 24 increasing with the localized heating which showed a 78 increase in localized heating cross flow the localized heating dead end with intermittent flush showed the highest gor value 0 6 the significant increase in the gor value in localized heating is associated with the higher flux resulting from a decreased thermal boundary layer furthermore the absence of a feed flow condition inside the md module and corresponding increase in evaporation allowed fora significant enhancement of gor values during the dead end localized heating 124 21 and 132 12 increases for the localized heating dead end and localized heating dead end with intermittent flush modes respectively 3 4 effect of the localized heating on membrane integrity and morphology given that the heating coil inside the md module is located next to the membrane surface it is essential to determine if localized heating would impose any adverse effects on the surface of the polymeric membrane the changes in the membrane s integrity and morphology were evaluated by a range of surface characterization techniques including sem atr ft ir and contact angle measurements a comparison of sem images of a virgin membrane with the membrane subjected to localized heating fig 7 a and b revealed no changes in surface morphology after surface heating so that both images exhibited typical node like ptfe structures this observation was further supported by the results of the atr ft ir spectroscopy fig 7c with both membrane surfaces producing characteristicptfe bands at 1204 cm 1 1150 cm 1 and 637 cm 1 these bands were ascribed to the asymmetrical stretching symmetrical stretching and waggling of cf2 groups respectively piwowarczyk et al 2019 the contact angle measurements revealed no significant difference between the virgin and after surface heating surfaces 135 1o 2 8 and 131 2o 1 1 respectively fig 7d and e hence it can be concluded that localized heating did not compromise membrane integrity nor affect its morphological properties yet we suggest the use of custom made flexible coils specifically designed for this application to be used for different module geometries aiming to eliminate dead zones ali et al 2019 qamar et al 2019 4 future prospects this proposed work aims to minimize the problem of intrinsic md process deficiency the phenomenon of tp which stems from the heat losses during water evaporation and conduction loss imposes substantial process limitations as a result md performance and permeate production are impended the localized heating targets fundamental issue of tp and offers innovative approach to mitigate this phenomenon so that thermal efficiency and permeate production are improved significant difference of this technology from the existing ones is that localized heating is capable of delivering thermal energy directly to the feed water membrane interface throughout the entire feed channel length by utilizing joule heating elements so that the stable feed temperature is maintained in terms of process control and scalability several routs are proposed for instance joule heating inside the md module can be achieved by filling the feed channel with metallic spacers tan et al 2020 similarly to incorporate localized heating into a spiral wound module thin nichrome wire mesh or nichrome wire weaved in polymeric spacer can be employed in case of a hollow fiber module a hollow fiber bundle can be inserted between the two helical shaped heating elements to ensure that both inner and outer fibers are equally heated alternatively a thin heating element could be pulled through the fiber lumen to provide precise heating of each fiber although these approaches deem viable they require sophisticated and accurate temperature control system to ensure process integrity application of multiple thermistors with the feedback controlled by the artificial intelligence technologies would be a potential future direction to transfer the localized heating technology to a commercial scale 5 conclusion in this study we have successfully applied localized heating by incorporating an electric heating coil inside the md module different configurations including a new dead end md mode were investigated numerically and validated through a series of experiments results showed that dead end md with localized heating outperformed all the other configurations in terms of vapor flux and energy consumption mainly due to the minimization of tp caused by temperature stratification occurring in conventional md the introduction of intermittent flush to the dead end concept further improved the md performance by reducing membrane fouling and associated heat losses modeling results revealed that localized heating provided more uniform heat transfer across the membrane due to increased feed water temperature over a larger membrane area as a result the tp across the membrane was mitigated and corresponding permeate fluxes were enhanced dead end localized heating showed 10 45 increase in water vapor flux for the different configurations 44 57 decrease in specific energy consumption for cross flow and dead end modes reaching 1183 kwh m3 dead end thus approaching the thermodynamic minimum energy limit for water evaporation 650 kwh m3 increase of gor values by 132 12 the surface characterization techniques confirmed no changes in membrane integrity and morphology after prolonged surface heating which provides a promising new framework for sustainable md development therefore we expect that the combined effect of localized heating and intermittent flush in dead end mode will enable more sustainable md for long term operations by maintaining more stable vapor flux while alleviating membrane fouling
