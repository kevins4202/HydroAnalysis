25100,density dependent habitat selection is a central theme in ecology empirical studies collect data with increasing resolution and provide greater opportunities for its testing however several different density dependent habitat selection models exist in the literature incorporating many different scenarios we attempt to unify some of these models in a single framework to increase our predictive power and assist researchers in making predictions from combinations of these models to achieve this we created the generalized ideal free distribution an expansion of the ideal free distribution model with this model we synthesize many of the previous theoretical developments in habitat selection to better incorporate temporal dynamics by using community matrices to represent the interaction between individuals we demonstrated that thirteen scenarios represented in other studies can be combined into a single model in addition for four of these scenarios our predictions are similar to the original studies that developed these scenarios additionally we derived four novel predictions that take advantage of using community matrices to represent distribution we discuss how this model creates a connection between community interactions and the distribution of individuals and its uses in other subjects in ecology keywords habitat selection isodars density dependence game theory ess 1 introduction research into habitat selection can link many fields of ecology including foraging ecology landscape ecology population dynamics and life history morris 2003 many of the theoretical models have focused on density dependent habitat selection cosner 2005 fretwell and lucas 1969 lessells 1995 moody et al 1996 ovadia and abramsky 1995 of these one of the most notable is fretwell and lucas s 1969 ideal free distribution model this model incorporated concepts of game theory to answer a complex question how should an animal choose between habitats that may provide different resource quantities and densities of competitors while other animals face the same challenges some empirical studies have found no evidence supporting the model s predictions boyce et al 2016 and many improvements have been offered with more than 450 studies dedicated to the subject of ideal free distribution krivan et al 2008 several models have added other variables such as more species rosenheim 2004 sih 1998 individuals with unequal competitive ability fretwell and lucas 1969 differences in food processing abilities ruxton et al 2001 individual responses to the environment pulliam and danielson 1991 nonlinear functional responses sutherland 1983 continuous input of resources lessells 1995 resource depletion sutherland 1983 and migration cressman and křivan 2006 instead of sequentially adding these improvements to create a more complete formula changes were modular with improvements being added over the basic ideal free distribution model tregenza 1995 in nature many of these processes can happen simultaneously so integrating these models would be of great value the likely goal of these studies was generalization and integration however each used different methods this makes it difficult to add up their developments and employ them simultaneously to generate predictions these studies have used a range of techniques to solve for the ideal free distribution from formal proofs cressman and křivan 2006 fretwell and lucas 1969 to dynamic programming mcnamara and houston 1990 to allow for better integration we developed a standard model based on linear algebra that can incorporate many of these individual models into a single formula this more general model may also help consistently incorporate habitat selection into trophic web studies ideal free distributions have been calculated for trophic chains with 3 and 4 species rosenheim 2004 sih 1998 and for studies on trophic webs holt 1984 křivan 2014 however these studies have used different methods and definitions with some modelling the distribution of effort among each prey e g kondoh 2003 křivan 2014 while others have modelled the distribution of effort among habitats and or patches holt 1984 rosenheim 2004 sih 1998 thus a general model that measures both the strength of the interactions and multi patch use could merge the two types of research investigating trophic webs linking trophic web studies and habitat selection is important but challenging as predictions may be difficult to observe field studies on habitat selection may not have precise information on species interactions especially if they are focused on a single species the natural history of a species may be known but measures such as average trophic level or percentage consumption of each prey are harder to obtain moreover a detailed summary of a species predators and their relative contribution to the species mortality is required thus a more general model must be able to handle different levels of detail depending on the accuracy of researcher s data lastly one of the advances of ideal free distribution is its predictive power since its inception the ideal free distribution generated prediction about the distribution of species that could be tested in field fretwell and lucas 1969 in our general model we aim to provide the same ability create a model that can generate predictions about the distribution of species from hypothesis about their interactions to address all these goals we developed a generalized ideal free distribution gifd model summarized in fig 1 this model is an extension of the ideal free distribution using community matrices it subsumes many of the previous models see review in tregenza 1995 fig 2 for some examples and can be applied to any trophic web or community we also demonstrate that our model can capture temporal dynamics at the cost of increased complexity and show numerically that the predicted distribution for all species is an evolutionary stable strategy maynard smith 1982 we also develop a unique prediction that can be tested with information of a single species and its natural history lastly we explore the model s implications for different fields of ecological research 2 theory 2 1 model definition in this model we assume the environment is comprised of discrete spatial units either habitats or patches since conclusions are the same irrespective of the scale we refer to those units as habitats unless discussing results from previous studies where we may use patches to remain consistent with their nomenclature in this environment there are a fixed number of individuals belonging to different species i e a community those individuals should decide what proportion of time they will spend in each habitat those individuals are free to move to any habitat at no cost hence this model keeps the assumption of free movement from the ideal free distribution since animals can also utilize more than one habitat the environment can be considered a fine grained habitat in the definition of macarthur and levins 1964 individuals are also aware of all other individuals their costs and benefits and can select for themselves this is the assumption of ideal behavior sensu fretwell and lucas 1969 through this model we will also group individuals depending on the scale we will be focusing these groups vary from entire species to a single individual in a single period of time when grouped all individuals are assumed to behave in the same way and to have the same costs and benefits for that reason we will refer to these groups as phenotypes further habitats by themselves have no intrinsic quality or costs all benefits and costs will depend solely on the distribution of individuals and phenotypes in each habitat the concept of phenotype is a central and novel development of this model as explained above we define phenotype as an individual or group of individuals with a unique reaction to the environment represented by a unique fitness function this fitness function describes how the phenotype interacts with other phenotypes and the weight of these interactions therefore it is possible that a single individual may have multiple phenotypes in a lifetime if their interactions with other phenotypes changes with time e g its prey changes with age or the number of predators decrease with time on the other hand a researcher with incomplete information may consider an entire species as a single phenotype ignoring individual differences or even a group of species for analysis of higher taxa as it will be shown later these different levels can also be mixed a focal species can have multiple phenotypes while others may have only one this structure allows the researcher to set the scale of this analysis by their own discretion and the dataset s level of detail a further development is the concept of fixed phenotypes these are phenotypes who do not perform habitat selection either they do not select habitats or their decision is not influenced by community composition in the previous ideal free distribution models these fixed phenotypes were the plant species resources or some measure of quality intrinsic to the habitat this concept is fundamental to solve a deadlock that would otherwise form in this model without a fixed phenotype it is impossible for an ideal individual or phenotype to choose a habitat all phenotypes would decide their distribution simultaneously with no phenotype set at the moment of decision since all benefits and costs are calculated based on other phenotypes at the moment of decision all habitats would have the value of zero as a result models without fixed phenotypes always give the same result for all phenotypes individuals should spread themselves evenly across habitats with a fixed phenotype an ideal individual can estimate the quality of each habitat by guessing another phenotype s presence based on their relation to the fixed phenotype mathematically these fixed phenotypes do not have a fitness function however they do influence non fixed phenotypes and are present in their fitness functions 2 2 fitness and quality functions to define the fitness function and the model we assume individuals are trying to maximize their fitness following cressman and křivan 2006 we measure fitness as fitness increments the quality of habitats times the proportion of time the phenotype spends there 1 f i h p h i q h i where i is the phenotype non fixed h is the habitat p is the proportion of time that the phenotype spends in this habitat and q is habitat quality with this formula the more time the phenotype stays in a good quality habitat the higher its fitness will be this model fits the immediate consumption sensu weber 1998 or continuous input sensu lessells 1995 family of ideal free distribution models this formula provides a simplification of the foraging and animal interaction ignoring at first resource dynamics lessells 1995 nevertheless this simplicity allows a much greater flexibility than standing crop models weber 1998 and we show in the results that it still can simulate depletion with some simplifications the next step is to calculate habitat quality for phenotypes we keep a reasoning similar to previous studies e g kacelnik et al 1992 sih 1998 quality should increase with the presence of species with positive influence prey individuals mutualists and decrease with negative competitors predators parasites 2 q h i j c i j p h j in this equation qhi is the quality of habitat h for the focal phenotype i c ij is the impact of phenotype j fixed or non fixed on the fitness of phenotype i non fixed phj is the proportion of time phenotype j spends in habitat h for multi individual phenotypes phj may also represent the proportion of individuals of phenotype j in habitat h both interpretations are valid and do not change the formula the quality of the habitat increases if it is highly used high p by phenotypes beneficial to the focal individual positive c 2 3 the community matrix with this definition of quality every non fixed phenotype in the community has an eq 2 with a high level of detail a community may have many of these equations to represent its members to group and summarize these equations we employ a matrix equation 3 q h c p h where q h is the vector of quality for habitat h for each phenotype in the community and p is the vector of proportion of time spend by each phenotype on the habitat c is an expanded version of the community matrix murray 2004 which dictates how column phenotypes influence row phenotypes the c values matrix c is rectangular all phenotypes fixed and non fixed can influence other phenotypes however only non fixed phenotypes can be influenced therefore the matrix has more columns than rows to make this equation more easily solvable we can separate fixed and non fixed phenotypes 4 q h c n f p h n f c f p h f where the subscript nf denotes non fixed phenotypes and the subscript f denotes fixed phenotypes c n f is now a square matrix with both rows and columns being equal to the number of non fixed phenotypes 2 4 calculating the generalized ideal free distribution from this measure of quality the generalized ideal free distribution gifd predicts equilibrium distribution of animals by stating that individuals will distribute themselves so that quality will be equal across habitats for every phenotype this criteria is a variation of the original criterion equal fitness across environments fretwell and lucas 1969 since we calculate fitness by taking all habitats in consideration this criterion cannot be used here instead we used an analogous concept of equal quality among habitats as a base it maintains the same logic an individual should not change its habitat distribution if it cannot increase its use of good quality habitats therefore when all habitats have the same quality the individuals do not a have stimulus to change their distribution and the community reaches an equilibrium to find the optimal distribution we solved this criterion for three patches adding as an extra condition that proportion of habitat use must sum to 1 5 q 1 q 2 q 3 6 q 1 q 2 0 q 2 q 3 0 p 1 n f p 2 n f p 3 n f 1 7 c f p 1 f p 2 f c n f p 1 n f p 2 n f 0 c f p 2 f p 3 f c n f p 2 n f p 3 n f 0 p 1 n f p 2 n f p 3 n f 1 this last system can be simplified to 8 p n f 1 n p c n f 1 c f p f s where np is the number of patches and s is a special matrix whose diagonal equals to np 1 np and 1 np everywhere else with rows and columns equal to the number of patches 1 n p is a matrix with the same dimensions as pnf whose elements are all 1 np this solution is not dependent on the number of habitats adding more habitats only increases the number of columns or rows in the matrix eq 8 can be viewed as a linear transformation with cnf representing the linear operator this implies there is only one optimal distribution pnf for each combination of cf pf and cnf nevertheless this solution may not be reachable by dynamics within the community since the pnf might contain probabilities above one or below zero similarly eq 8 can be reversed to find potential community matrices that could cause an observed distribution however the calculation is more complex since pnf might not be a square matrix and thus might not be invertible 9 c n f c f p f s 3 1 n p p n f t 1 n p p n f 1 n p p n f t 1 cnf in eq 9 is a valid community pnf only if rows phenotypes are linearly independent note that even if cnf is a valid community it might not be the only one if there are more habitats than species there is more than one community that can generate the same distribution if there are more species than habitats there is no solution but eq 9 gives a least squares approximation i e the community matrix that is the best approximation to one that could generate this distribution a unique solution only exists if pnf is a square matrix or can be reduced to one 2 5 matrix form of quality and fitness functions although not necessary to calculate gifd we also developed matrix equations for fitness and quality using eqs 4 and 1 as the basis quality and fitness of all phenotypes can be represented as 10 q c nf p nf c f p f 11 f pq 1 p c nf p nf c f p f 1 where q is a matrix with habitats as columns and phenotypes as rows f is the vector of fitness for each phenotype 2 6 support for an evolutionary stable strategy there is a special interest in showing that this equilibrium is an evolutionary stable strategy if the ideal free distribution is an evolutionary stable strategy the community will remain in this distribution as long as the environment is constant even when random mutations occur in the population and generate individuals who do not follow this distribution maynard smith and price 1973 thus being an evolutionary stable strategy makes this equilibrium more likely to be observed in nature gifd models are likely to be evolutionary stable strategy its concept of equal quality across habitats shows the same self regulating logic of equal fitness across patches criteria present in many studies both criteria behave as an equilibrium by the logic detailed in section 2 4 every individual who does not follow this equilibrium has a reduction in fitness this argument has been used in the original ideal free distribution fretwell and lucas 1969 plus having been proven mathematically correct for one species cressman and křivan 2006 however sih 1998 emphasizes this criterion is only an equilibrium if phenotypes face diminishing returns with increased use of habitats this effect can be direct competition or depletion or indirect for example reducing habitat use of a second positive phenotype thus a gifd should be an evolutionary stable strategy if all phenotypes face diminishing returns to provide quantitative evidence of that gifd is an evolutionary stable strategy we first must check if all phenotypes face diminishing returns interactions can be examined by looking at the community matrix however it is hard to spot indirect effects especially in large matrices where a positive effect may occur through intermediation of many species to summarize all the effects phenotypes have on themselves we can transform the matrix in a diagonal matrix i e only values on the diagonal are different from 0 and check if these values on the diagonal are negative the values in this diagonal are known as eigenvalues hence if all eigenvalues of the community matrix are negative we can infer phenotypes have an overall negative effect on themselves once we isolated communities with diminishing returns we used the replicator equation taylor and jonker 1984 to assess if communities indeed converge to the gifd the replicator equation describes the change in the phenotype distribution with the following formula 12 d p i d t p i f i f where pi is the proportion of time a phenotype spends on habitat i f i is the fitness if the phenotype used only habitat i and f is the average fitness of all phenotypes this formula represents how the proportion of each behavior changes in the population without the need to track population size in this formula the better a phenotype is in relation to another will increase its frequency according to the folk theorem of game theory a distribution that is a resting point for the replicator equation is a nash equilibrium cressman and tao 2014 further if a community tends towards the nash equilibrium then it is an evolutionary stable strategy cressman and tao 2014 to test this hypothesis we generated three sets of community matrices with increasing generality for the first set we assumed an environment with three non fixed phenotypes one fixed phenotype and two habitats we set cf to 1 for all species pf to 0 6 and 0 4 and generated all possible community matrices with values of 1 0 and 1 for all cells we then selected all matrices with negative diagonals and negative eigenvalues retaining 443 community matrices for the second set we created 10 000 groups with a random 3 3 community matrix with negative diagonals a cf with values between 0 and 10 and a random pf between 0 and 1 from these we selected sets where the solution to eq 9 was composed of valid probabilities and the eigenvalues of the community matrix were negative in their real parts only 38 66 of the matrices were valid for the last set we generated 10 000 groups with 3 3 10 10 community matrices with 3 10 habitats still keeping groups with negative diagonals on the community matrices the size of the matrices and the number of habitats in each group were also defined at random of the 10 000 only 0 51 had valid solutions to eq 8 and negative eigenvalues on the community matrices with all three sets prepared we added a random error to the solution of eq 8 that could range from 0 1 to 0 1 if the error led the probabilities above 1 or below 0 we corrected it back to these values we then analyzed how the distribution changed with time by numerically integrating eq 12 we used the routine lsoda available in the package desolve soetaert et al 2010 in r r core team 2016 we followed the population for 1000 time steps we repeated this disturbance procedure for all valid communities 10 times we found that the larger the matrix pnf the more likely the integration would fail generating probabilities above 1 or below 0 specifically the more species and habitats the harder it was to ascertain whether eq 9 is an evolutionary stable strategy for communities with 30 or more combinations of species and habitats integration failed to reach solutions in all 10 cases however in all cases where integration succeeded the distribution returned to the values before disturbance confirming that eq 9 is an evolutionary stable strategy 3 results 3 1 model scope the matrix structure makes it easier to show the many dynamics that the quality formula can represent communities and phenotypes are entirely described in the community matrix c almost all species interactions can be represented through this matrix eg fig 2 in addition global environmental factors can also be represented for example if temperature falls below the optimal level for a phenotype all its c values should be reduced to represent how increased thermoregulatory costs are decreasing its fitness since this matrix can have each individual phenotype as a row it can capture much finer processes than intraspecific interactions for example gifd can represent despotism the tendency of individuals to monopolize prey resources fretwell and calver 1969 despotism is represented by an inter asymmetric phenotype competition between phenotypes of the same species variations in individuals state can be represented by varying c values among phenotypes of the same individuals for example hungry individuals can have higher c values than its prey since hungrier individuals will give more value to food since we can represent the same individual at different states we can do a similar approximation with time each individual is represented by one phenotype per time step this allows individuals to have different c values at different times if we acknowledge that phenotypes from previous time steps can influence individuals from the current time step we can represent time dynamics for example depletion can be represented as a self competition if we have one individual foraging in two different times t 1 and t 2 we should expect c 21 0 c 12 0 the past phenotype reduces the fitness of the future but the opposite is not true another advantage of time specific phenotypes is the capacity of modelling extraneous births deaths emigrations and immigrations individuals might be represented only by phenotypes at specific times an individual with a phenotype in a specific time but no phenotype after can represent death or immigration likewise an individual only manifesting phenotypes after a specific time may represent birth immigration however this technique is not the same as tracking population dynamics while the researcher may represent death births emigrations and immigrations the model cannot predict these events with the community matrix the gifd can incorporate many processes that were previously modelled alone compared to the review by tregenza 1995 the following patterns and studies can be represented in this model non immediate consumption and depletion lessells 1995 phenotypical differences parker 1982 unequal competition sutherland 1983 korona 1989 phenotype based on asymmetric competition sutherland and parker 1985 kleptoparasitim parker and sutherland 1986 differences in search efficiency dominance and kleptoparasitims holmgren 1995 perceptual constrains through adding a naïve and experience phenotype abrahams 1986 trophic web conformation rosenheim 2004 schwinning and rosenzweig 1990 sih 1998 state dependency through adding hungry and fed phenotypes mcnamara and houston 1990 and learning by adding naïve and experienced phenotypes bernstein et al 1988 this generalization however cannot represent certain expansions of the ideal free distribution it assumes the interaction between phenotypes is linear or linearizable which may be overly simplistic it is based on pairwise interactions which might not represent interactions correctly neill 1974 it is also a deterministic model and hence cannot consider stochastic ideal free distributions hakoyama 2003 additionally it is based on patches habitats being discrete units while some new expansions consider ideal free distributions in continuous landscapes or using continuous time cantrell et al 2012 it also does not consider movement cressman and křivan 2006 flaxman and lou 2009 but chief among the issues is the fixed number of individuals many models incorporate population dynamic models cantrell et al 2012 doncaster 2000 kondoh 2003 e g lessells 1995 nevertheless the following advances demonstrated that the lack of dynamics does not invalidate this model populations and migration dynamics guide populations towards the distribution predicted by static ideal free distribution models cressman and křivan 2006 in addition some studies have combined matrix models with dispersal cantrell et al 2012 which indicates that these dynamic models may be integrated in the future therefore we believe a static generalization based on linear algebra provides the most successful framework in combining multiple models 3 2 support for previous ideal free distribution predictions insofar we have fully developed the model demonstrated that it can represent multiple previous models by using different matrices and showed it is an evolutionary stable strategy however it is possible that this model will lead to different predictions from those that it summarizes to gauge its consistency with previous studies we attempted to compare our predictions with theirs we found our predictions to be consistent with four existing models parker s matching rule parker 1974 sutherland 1983 s non ideal competition the leapfrog effect rosenheim 2004 sih 1998 and the ideal despotic distribution fretwell 1972 the proof of these similarities can be found in the supplementary material 3 3 new predictions using linear algebra also allows us to generate new predictions that were not possible without a model with multiple patches and multiple species we discuss some novel predictions in this section 3 3 1 third party interaction effect one of the difficulties with multi species ideal free distributions is the lack of data to test their predictions many studies in habitat selection focus on individuals from a single species without distinguishing between them therefore it would be best if this model would generate a prediction that can be falsifiable with information from only a few or one species we can generate a prediction like that by working with sums in a system with two patches recall from eq 3 that q 1 q 2 c p 1 c p 2 c p 1 0 5 0 this equation is a matrix representation of a system of equations therefore if we sum the rows we obtain a condition that must be true as when we sum the equations in a system of equations from summing all rows in that equation we get 13 c 1 1 c 2 1 c n 1 p 1 1 0 5 c 1 2 c 2 2 c n 2 p 1 2 0 5 c 1 3 c 2 3 c n 3 p 1 3 0 5 0 where p 1 1 represents proportion of time spent in habitat 1 by species 1 in that order as before c 2 1 represents the effect of species 1 on species 2 if we then isolate one phenotype from this equation for example phenotype 1 we get the following condition 14 p 1 1 0 5 i 1 k c k i p 1 i 0 5 k c k 1 where p 1 1 is the proportion of time spent in habitat 1 by phenotype 1 p 1 i is the proportion of time spent in habitat 1 by phenotype i c k i is the influence of phenotype i on k and c k 1 is the influence of phenotype 1 on k the interesting conclusion from this condition is the numerator c k i influences the distribution of phenotype 1 in the habitat even though phenotype k and i are different from 1 this indicates that interactions between third parties influence phenotype distributions the direction of this third party effect is determined by the denominator if the denominator is positive a positive third party interaction will repel the focal phenotype p 1 1 will decrease a negative third party interaction will attract the focal phenotype the opposite will be expected if the denominator is negative biologically we can interpret the denominator as a combination of the trophic level and the competitivity index a positive denominator indicates a docile phenotype which has positive effects on other phenotypes either by serving as a mutualist prey or by performing as an inexpressive predator and competitor on the other hand a negative denominator suggests an aggressive phenotype causing overall negative effects on the rest of the community like a predator competitor or parasite hence we can infer aggressive phenotypes are attracted by positive third party interactions while docile phenotypes avoid it this prediction may seem counterintuitive but it has been studied in the form of general anti predator behavior e g lima 1992 prey docile avoid habitats with predation events of other species positive interaction in addition there has been evidence that different predators aggressive can indirectly facilitate each other s foraging strategies bouskila 1995 losey and denno 1998 suggesting they might chose habitats with more predation events of the other species positive interaction if they are capable of identifying those habitats therefore this is the first time a model based on ideal free distribution made predictions about indirect effects outside trophic chains this initial oddity has another positive side this prediction can be tested in single species studies if the species is found to avoid habitats with predators or competitors that are not directly theirs it suggests species might be operating under a gifd 3 3 2 competitive exclusion is numerically rare with the new model we can represent how specific interactions can change individual distributions and isolate this effect from other interactions here we demonstrate this effect by analyzing inter specific competition this interaction is especially interesting since it shows diverse consequences to the resulting distribution for that analysis we represented strong inter specific competition in two patches with each species represented by a phenotype the result is the following c n f 15 c n f 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 with a c f 10 10 10 10 and p f 0 51 0 49 under this scenario inter specific competition is the main driving force of this community since both intraspecific competition and resource attraction are very small in this situation both species have an even distribution across habitats p n f 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 this effect can be explained in a similar way to the logic behind fixed phenotypes fitness is determined almost exclusively by avoiding the competitor hence it is impossible for each phenotype to find what is the best habitat since both are deciding simultaneously as a result the best action is to use habitats randomly when the fitness input of the fixed phenotype c f is raised to the same level as competitive costs both species match the resource distribution intermediate values lead to both species slowly increasing their use of the richer habitat until it matches the distribution of resources this is contrary to much of the literature on competition which predicts spatial segregation of the competitors e g diamond 1975 shigesada et al 1979 for actual segregation to occur due to competition a more specific condition must be satisfied this condition can be found with two habitats by solving for c n f in eq 8 given p n f 1 0 0 1 note that under this scenario p n f is always an identity matrix i 2 therefore eq 8 becomes 16 i 2 1 np c nf 1 c f p f s 3 subtracting the identity matrix from 1 n p gives the s 3 matrix 17 s 3 c n f 1 c f p f s 3 which lead us to conclude i 2 c n f 1 c f p f 18 c nf c f p f this calculation holds independently of how many habitats or species are in the system biologically eq 15 shows that segregation between two competing species is not the most common outcome to result in spatial segregation a complex interplay must be achieved between the abundance of their shared resources their importance to each prey and the strength of intra specific and inter specific competition eq 15 provides a few insights on the requirements firstly segregation cannot occur between two phenotypes that are exactly equal secondly for symmetric competition to result in segregation the shared resource cannot be valued equally by both species the difference in the value of the resource for the phenotypes must be equal to the difference between patch resources c f 1 c f 2 p f 1 p f 2 this shows that complete competitive exclusion requires a strict set of conditions to occur 3 3 3 beta diversity is as a result of species dominance the previous section focused on competitive exclusion but it can also be analyzed concentrating on habitats when each phenotype represents a species a complete competitive exclusion also tells us about species composition between habitats p n f 1 0 0 1 represents a metacommunity with high beta diversity between habitats but relatively low alpha diversity one species per habitat therefore we can infer metrics of diversity from the resulting p n f richness is represented as the column sums of the matrix likewise diversity indexes can be calculated for each habitat each column of the matrix represents abundance values for each phenotype in that habitat with this information we can generate predictions on species diversity from community matrices for example we can repurpose the calculation of eq 15 to generate predictions on what type of community generates the most beta diversity using two patches to demonstrate the maximum beta diversity occurs when each species is found in its own habitat i e p n f 1 0 0 1 and with the highest possible concentration on the fixed phenotype p f 1 0 since at p f 1 0 the gifd is not defined using eq 15 we can predict that if p f 1 0 c n f c f 1 0 c f 2 0 in other words the maximum beta diversity in a two species community should be expected when one species shows very low intra and inter specific competition compared to the other species 4 discussion in this study we demonstrated how the ideal free distribution can be expanded using linear algebra and how this pattern allows many different models to be built using the same structure we also showed that new predictions can be drawn taking advantage of the multi species capabilities of this model the gifd shows a potential to connect many different areas in ecology originating from behavior but generating predictions on spatial distribution diversity trends and even on community structure these connections are due to phenotypes in the model other studies attempted to model phenotypes in ideal free distribution but never to this detail parker 1982 and ruxton et al 2001 used scalar values to represent phenotype quality here we expand a phenotype to a set of c values towards other phenotypes as such the same individual can manifest different phenotypes in its life or a phenotype can represent an entire species the decision of how precise the phenotype should be is limited solely by the accuracy of the data that will be used to populate this model another key development was the use of a quality function based on summations this is different from the classical representation as a ratio fretwell and lucas 1969 hugie and dill 1994 ruxton et al 2001 sih 1998 this change comes at a cost of clarity the ratio formula is more easily visualized predators sharing a pie of resources and has a clear bound fitness was either 0 or positive nevertheless it gives a series of advantages chief among them is the elimination of an exponential behavior where the value of a habitat would grow to infinity when not used i e denominator equals 0 this exponential behavior lead previous studies to conclude that all patches would be occupied hugie and dill 1994 or to assume that the model cannot make inferences on unoccupied patches fretwell and lucas 1969 further the additional structure of this model allows us to represent imperfect competition i e inefficient resource consumption due to conflict by changing different c values in eq 2 without requiring a new parameter lastly it is scale free eq 2 can represent habitat quality for any arbitrary phenotype a species a group of individuals one individual or even a single individual in a moment of time without changing its sum of products structure one of the most interesting capabilities of this model is that it provides a standard framework to turn species distributions into inferences on community structure using eq 9 although it does not give a single result it uses the moore penrose pseudo inverse to find the community matrix from the results this widespread mathematical technique implies that the predicted community is the least squares approximation to the real community matrix eq 9 thus has a similar accuracy to methods derived from least squares such as regressions and anovas this allows gifd to be compared with other methods to deduce community interactions e g schoener 1974 although the strength of ideal free distribution models relies on their predictive power gifd is not tied to it and can be used as an ad hoc method our examples above demonstrate the large flexibility of this model but there are two points of rigidity if community matrices are generated at random there are relatively few communities that have feasible ideal free distributions p n f values between 0 and 1 the more phenotypes that are added the harder it is to randomly create a community matrix with feasible p n f in addition gifd very rarely had habitats with 0 occupancy or even habitats with 10 this suggests that most habitats are frequently used this conclusion was also reached by studies using classical ideal free distribution hugie and dill 1994 both patterns suggest that gifd is not a product of random combinations of species which indicates that if found in nature they presuppose some form of assemblage rule similar to this model several previous studies addressed the interplay of community forces and species distribution for example there was evidence indicating that asymmetric competition causes communities to diverge from parker s matching rule berec et al 2006 in another example more complex spatial models were developed to track overgrazing and fragmentation in a three level trophic chain kondoh 2003 isodars the lines showing distributions across habitats where fitness is equal can be calculated for systems with more than one species they can be used to describe the equilibrium distributions of competing species between habitats morris 2003 rosenzweig 1981 introduced the concept of isolegs lines in a state space of population densities that separate regions where the optimal behavior for a species is different using this technique he connected habitat selection population dynamics and competition doncaster 2000 proposed a more complete model predicting individual distributions along a scale of individuals to communities his model also tracked populations dynamics however it did not explicitly consider communities with multiple trophic levels in addition it tracked different variables depending on the scale those models related to areas that gifd still cannot analyze such as spatially explicit models or population dynamics however we believe that no other study provides a standard modelling tool such as gifd with gifd matrices it is relatively easy to add or remove other assumptions by changing the number of rows and the values of c a model can transition from the scale of species to the individuals by adding more rows the gifd is also very simple computationally the optimal distribution for hundreds of phenotypes can be found with a simple matrix inversion therefore although there is no lack of generalizations in the literature we believe gifd provides a more robust empirical modeling tool despite its advantages as a modelling tool gifd is mostly a predictive model it may be used to develop hypotheses about species interactions and to test them by comparing gifd distributions with field data however gifd does not perform as well to explain existing data especially since it requires a large number of parameters community matrices and fixed phenotypes distributions the value of this model rest on allowing new

25100,density dependent habitat selection is a central theme in ecology empirical studies collect data with increasing resolution and provide greater opportunities for its testing however several different density dependent habitat selection models exist in the literature incorporating many different scenarios we attempt to unify some of these models in a single framework to increase our predictive power and assist researchers in making predictions from combinations of these models to achieve this we created the generalized ideal free distribution an expansion of the ideal free distribution model with this model we synthesize many of the previous theoretical developments in habitat selection to better incorporate temporal dynamics by using community matrices to represent the interaction between individuals we demonstrated that thirteen scenarios represented in other studies can be combined into a single model in addition for four of these scenarios our predictions are similar to the original studies that developed these scenarios additionally we derived four novel predictions that take advantage of using community matrices to represent distribution we discuss how this model creates a connection between community interactions and the distribution of individuals and its uses in other subjects in ecology keywords habitat selection isodars density dependence game theory ess 1 introduction research into habitat selection can link many fields of ecology including foraging ecology landscape ecology population dynamics and life history morris 2003 many of the theoretical models have focused on density dependent habitat selection cosner 2005 fretwell and lucas 1969 lessells 1995 moody et al 1996 ovadia and abramsky 1995 of these one of the most notable is fretwell and lucas s 1969 ideal free distribution model this model incorporated concepts of game theory to answer a complex question how should an animal choose between habitats that may provide different resource quantities and densities of competitors while other animals face the same challenges some empirical studies have found no evidence supporting the model s predictions boyce et al 2016 and many improvements have been offered with more than 450 studies dedicated to the subject of ideal free distribution krivan et al 2008 several models have added other variables such as more species rosenheim 2004 sih 1998 individuals with unequal competitive ability fretwell and lucas 1969 differences in food processing abilities ruxton et al 2001 individual responses to the environment pulliam and danielson 1991 nonlinear functional responses sutherland 1983 continuous input of resources lessells 1995 resource depletion sutherland 1983 and migration cressman and křivan 2006 instead of sequentially adding these improvements to create a more complete formula changes were modular with improvements being added over the basic ideal free distribution model tregenza 1995 in nature many of these processes can happen simultaneously so integrating these models would be of great value the likely goal of these studies was generalization and integration however each used different methods this makes it difficult to add up their developments and employ them simultaneously to generate predictions these studies have used a range of techniques to solve for the ideal free distribution from formal proofs cressman and křivan 2006 fretwell and lucas 1969 to dynamic programming mcnamara and houston 1990 to allow for better integration we developed a standard model based on linear algebra that can incorporate many of these individual models into a single formula this more general model may also help consistently incorporate habitat selection into trophic web studies ideal free distributions have been calculated for trophic chains with 3 and 4 species rosenheim 2004 sih 1998 and for studies on trophic webs holt 1984 křivan 2014 however these studies have used different methods and definitions with some modelling the distribution of effort among each prey e g kondoh 2003 křivan 2014 while others have modelled the distribution of effort among habitats and or patches holt 1984 rosenheim 2004 sih 1998 thus a general model that measures both the strength of the interactions and multi patch use could merge the two types of research investigating trophic webs linking trophic web studies and habitat selection is important but challenging as predictions may be difficult to observe field studies on habitat selection may not have precise information on species interactions especially if they are focused on a single species the natural history of a species may be known but measures such as average trophic level or percentage consumption of each prey are harder to obtain moreover a detailed summary of a species predators and their relative contribution to the species mortality is required thus a more general model must be able to handle different levels of detail depending on the accuracy of researcher s data lastly one of the advances of ideal free distribution is its predictive power since its inception the ideal free distribution generated prediction about the distribution of species that could be tested in field fretwell and lucas 1969 in our general model we aim to provide the same ability create a model that can generate predictions about the distribution of species from hypothesis about their interactions to address all these goals we developed a generalized ideal free distribution gifd model summarized in fig 1 this model is an extension of the ideal free distribution using community matrices it subsumes many of the previous models see review in tregenza 1995 fig 2 for some examples and can be applied to any trophic web or community we also demonstrate that our model can capture temporal dynamics at the cost of increased complexity and show numerically that the predicted distribution for all species is an evolutionary stable strategy maynard smith 1982 we also develop a unique prediction that can be tested with information of a single species and its natural history lastly we explore the model s implications for different fields of ecological research 2 theory 2 1 model definition in this model we assume the environment is comprised of discrete spatial units either habitats or patches since conclusions are the same irrespective of the scale we refer to those units as habitats unless discussing results from previous studies where we may use patches to remain consistent with their nomenclature in this environment there are a fixed number of individuals belonging to different species i e a community those individuals should decide what proportion of time they will spend in each habitat those individuals are free to move to any habitat at no cost hence this model keeps the assumption of free movement from the ideal free distribution since animals can also utilize more than one habitat the environment can be considered a fine grained habitat in the definition of macarthur and levins 1964 individuals are also aware of all other individuals their costs and benefits and can select for themselves this is the assumption of ideal behavior sensu fretwell and lucas 1969 through this model we will also group individuals depending on the scale we will be focusing these groups vary from entire species to a single individual in a single period of time when grouped all individuals are assumed to behave in the same way and to have the same costs and benefits for that reason we will refer to these groups as phenotypes further habitats by themselves have no intrinsic quality or costs all benefits and costs will depend solely on the distribution of individuals and phenotypes in each habitat the concept of phenotype is a central and novel development of this model as explained above we define phenotype as an individual or group of individuals with a unique reaction to the environment represented by a unique fitness function this fitness function describes how the phenotype interacts with other phenotypes and the weight of these interactions therefore it is possible that a single individual may have multiple phenotypes in a lifetime if their interactions with other phenotypes changes with time e g its prey changes with age or the number of predators decrease with time on the other hand a researcher with incomplete information may consider an entire species as a single phenotype ignoring individual differences or even a group of species for analysis of higher taxa as it will be shown later these different levels can also be mixed a focal species can have multiple phenotypes while others may have only one this structure allows the researcher to set the scale of this analysis by their own discretion and the dataset s level of detail a further development is the concept of fixed phenotypes these are phenotypes who do not perform habitat selection either they do not select habitats or their decision is not influenced by community composition in the previous ideal free distribution models these fixed phenotypes were the plant species resources or some measure of quality intrinsic to the habitat this concept is fundamental to solve a deadlock that would otherwise form in this model without a fixed phenotype it is impossible for an ideal individual or phenotype to choose a habitat all phenotypes would decide their distribution simultaneously with no phenotype set at the moment of decision since all benefits and costs are calculated based on other phenotypes at the moment of decision all habitats would have the value of zero as a result models without fixed phenotypes always give the same result for all phenotypes individuals should spread themselves evenly across habitats with a fixed phenotype an ideal individual can estimate the quality of each habitat by guessing another phenotype s presence based on their relation to the fixed phenotype mathematically these fixed phenotypes do not have a fitness function however they do influence non fixed phenotypes and are present in their fitness functions 2 2 fitness and quality functions to define the fitness function and the model we assume individuals are trying to maximize their fitness following cressman and křivan 2006 we measure fitness as fitness increments the quality of habitats times the proportion of time the phenotype spends there 1 f i h p h i q h i where i is the phenotype non fixed h is the habitat p is the proportion of time that the phenotype spends in this habitat and q is habitat quality with this formula the more time the phenotype stays in a good quality habitat the higher its fitness will be this model fits the immediate consumption sensu weber 1998 or continuous input sensu lessells 1995 family of ideal free distribution models this formula provides a simplification of the foraging and animal interaction ignoring at first resource dynamics lessells 1995 nevertheless this simplicity allows a much greater flexibility than standing crop models weber 1998 and we show in the results that it still can simulate depletion with some simplifications the next step is to calculate habitat quality for phenotypes we keep a reasoning similar to previous studies e g kacelnik et al 1992 sih 1998 quality should increase with the presence of species with positive influence prey individuals mutualists and decrease with negative competitors predators parasites 2 q h i j c i j p h j in this equation qhi is the quality of habitat h for the focal phenotype i c ij is the impact of phenotype j fixed or non fixed on the fitness of phenotype i non fixed phj is the proportion of time phenotype j spends in habitat h for multi individual phenotypes phj may also represent the proportion of individuals of phenotype j in habitat h both interpretations are valid and do not change the formula the quality of the habitat increases if it is highly used high p by phenotypes beneficial to the focal individual positive c 2 3 the community matrix with this definition of quality every non fixed phenotype in the community has an eq 2 with a high level of detail a community may have many of these equations to represent its members to group and summarize these equations we employ a matrix equation 3 q h c p h where q h is the vector of quality for habitat h for each phenotype in the community and p is the vector of proportion of time spend by each phenotype on the habitat c is an expanded version of the community matrix murray 2004 which dictates how column phenotypes influence row phenotypes the c values matrix c is rectangular all phenotypes fixed and non fixed can influence other phenotypes however only non fixed phenotypes can be influenced therefore the matrix has more columns than rows to make this equation more easily solvable we can separate fixed and non fixed phenotypes 4 q h c n f p h n f c f p h f where the subscript nf denotes non fixed phenotypes and the subscript f denotes fixed phenotypes c n f is now a square matrix with both rows and columns being equal to the number of non fixed phenotypes 2 4 calculating the generalized ideal free distribution from this measure of quality the generalized ideal free distribution gifd predicts equilibrium distribution of animals by stating that individuals will distribute themselves so that quality will be equal across habitats for every phenotype this criteria is a variation of the original criterion equal fitness across environments fretwell and lucas 1969 since we calculate fitness by taking all habitats in consideration this criterion cannot be used here instead we used an analogous concept of equal quality among habitats as a base it maintains the same logic an individual should not change its habitat distribution if it cannot increase its use of good quality habitats therefore when all habitats have the same quality the individuals do not a have stimulus to change their distribution and the community reaches an equilibrium to find the optimal distribution we solved this criterion for three patches adding as an extra condition that proportion of habitat use must sum to 1 5 q 1 q 2 q 3 6 q 1 q 2 0 q 2 q 3 0 p 1 n f p 2 n f p 3 n f 1 7 c f p 1 f p 2 f c n f p 1 n f p 2 n f 0 c f p 2 f p 3 f c n f p 2 n f p 3 n f 0 p 1 n f p 2 n f p 3 n f 1 this last system can be simplified to 8 p n f 1 n p c n f 1 c f p f s where np is the number of patches and s is a special matrix whose diagonal equals to np 1 np and 1 np everywhere else with rows and columns equal to the number of patches 1 n p is a matrix with the same dimensions as pnf whose elements are all 1 np this solution is not dependent on the number of habitats adding more habitats only increases the number of columns or rows in the matrix eq 8 can be viewed as a linear transformation with cnf representing the linear operator this implies there is only one optimal distribution pnf for each combination of cf pf and cnf nevertheless this solution may not be reachable by dynamics within the community since the pnf might contain probabilities above one or below zero similarly eq 8 can be reversed to find potential community matrices that could cause an observed distribution however the calculation is more complex since pnf might not be a square matrix and thus might not be invertible 9 c n f c f p f s 3 1 n p p n f t 1 n p p n f 1 n p p n f t 1 cnf in eq 9 is a valid community pnf only if rows phenotypes are linearly independent note that even if cnf is a valid community it might not be the only one if there are more habitats than species there is more than one community that can generate the same distribution if there are more species than habitats there is no solution but eq 9 gives a least squares approximation i e the community matrix that is the best approximation to one that could generate this distribution a unique solution only exists if pnf is a square matrix or can be reduced to one 2 5 matrix form of quality and fitness functions although not necessary to calculate gifd we also developed matrix equations for fitness and quality using eqs 4 and 1 as the basis quality and fitness of all phenotypes can be represented as 10 q c nf p nf c f p f 11 f pq 1 p c nf p nf c f p f 1 where q is a matrix with habitats as columns and phenotypes as rows f is the vector of fitness for each phenotype 2 6 support for an evolutionary stable strategy there is a special interest in showing that this equilibrium is an evolutionary stable strategy if the ideal free distribution is an evolutionary stable strategy the community will remain in this distribution as long as the environment is constant even when random mutations occur in the population and generate individuals who do not follow this distribution maynard smith and price 1973 thus being an evolutionary stable strategy makes this equilibrium more likely to be observed in nature gifd models are likely to be evolutionary stable strategy its concept of equal quality across habitats shows the same self regulating logic of equal fitness across patches criteria present in many studies both criteria behave as an equilibrium by the logic detailed in section 2 4 every individual who does not follow this equilibrium has a reduction in fitness this argument has been used in the original ideal free distribution fretwell and lucas 1969 plus having been proven mathematically correct for one species cressman and křivan 2006 however sih 1998 emphasizes this criterion is only an equilibrium if phenotypes face diminishing returns with increased use of habitats this effect can be direct competition or depletion or indirect for example reducing habitat use of a second positive phenotype thus a gifd should be an evolutionary stable strategy if all phenotypes face diminishing returns to provide quantitative evidence of that gifd is an evolutionary stable strategy we first must check if all phenotypes face diminishing returns interactions can be examined by looking at the community matrix however it is hard to spot indirect effects especially in large matrices where a positive effect may occur through intermediation of many species to summarize all the effects phenotypes have on themselves we can transform the matrix in a diagonal matrix i e only values on the diagonal are different from 0 and check if these values on the diagonal are negative the values in this diagonal are known as eigenvalues hence if all eigenvalues of the community matrix are negative we can infer phenotypes have an overall negative effect on themselves once we isolated communities with diminishing returns we used the replicator equation taylor and jonker 1984 to assess if communities indeed converge to the gifd the replicator equation describes the change in the phenotype distribution with the following formula 12 d p i d t p i f i f where pi is the proportion of time a phenotype spends on habitat i f i is the fitness if the phenotype used only habitat i and f is the average fitness of all phenotypes this formula represents how the proportion of each behavior changes in the population without the need to track population size in this formula the better a phenotype is in relation to another will increase its frequency according to the folk theorem of game theory a distribution that is a resting point for the replicator equation is a nash equilibrium cressman and tao 2014 further if a community tends towards the nash equilibrium then it is an evolutionary stable strategy cressman and tao 2014 to test this hypothesis we generated three sets of community matrices with increasing generality for the first set we assumed an environment with three non fixed phenotypes one fixed phenotype and two habitats we set cf to 1 for all species pf to 0 6 and 0 4 and generated all possible community matrices with values of 1 0 and 1 for all cells we then selected all matrices with negative diagonals and negative eigenvalues retaining 443 community matrices for the second set we created 10 000 groups with a random 3 3 community matrix with negative diagonals a cf with values between 0 and 10 and a random pf between 0 and 1 from these we selected sets where the solution to eq 9 was composed of valid probabilities and the eigenvalues of the community matrix were negative in their real parts only 38 66 of the matrices were valid for the last set we generated 10 000 groups with 3 3 10 10 community matrices with 3 10 habitats still keeping groups with negative diagonals on the community matrices the size of the matrices and the number of habitats in each group were also defined at random of the 10 000 only 0 51 had valid solutions to eq 8 and negative eigenvalues on the community matrices with all three sets prepared we added a random error to the solution of eq 8 that could range from 0 1 to 0 1 if the error led the probabilities above 1 or below 0 we corrected it back to these values we then analyzed how the distribution changed with time by numerically integrating eq 12 we used the routine lsoda available in the package desolve soetaert et al 2010 in r r core team 2016 we followed the population for 1000 time steps we repeated this disturbance procedure for all valid communities 10 times we found that the larger the matrix pnf the more likely the integration would fail generating probabilities above 1 or below 0 specifically the more species and habitats the harder it was to ascertain whether eq 9 is an evolutionary stable strategy for communities with 30 or more combinations of species and habitats integration failed to reach solutions in all 10 cases however in all cases where integration succeeded the distribution returned to the values before disturbance confirming that eq 9 is an evolutionary stable strategy 3 results 3 1 model scope the matrix structure makes it easier to show the many dynamics that the quality formula can represent communities and phenotypes are entirely described in the community matrix c almost all species interactions can be represented through this matrix eg fig 2 in addition global environmental factors can also be represented for example if temperature falls below the optimal level for a phenotype all its c values should be reduced to represent how increased thermoregulatory costs are decreasing its fitness since this matrix can have each individual phenotype as a row it can capture much finer processes than intraspecific interactions for example gifd can represent despotism the tendency of individuals to monopolize prey resources fretwell and calver 1969 despotism is represented by an inter asymmetric phenotype competition between phenotypes of the same species variations in individuals state can be represented by varying c values among phenotypes of the same individuals for example hungry individuals can have higher c values than its prey since hungrier individuals will give more value to food since we can represent the same individual at different states we can do a similar approximation with time each individual is represented by one phenotype per time step this allows individuals to have different c values at different times if we acknowledge that phenotypes from previous time steps can influence individuals from the current time step we can represent time dynamics for example depletion can be represented as a self competition if we have one individual foraging in two different times t 1 and t 2 we should expect c 21 0 c 12 0 the past phenotype reduces the fitness of the future but the opposite is not true another advantage of time specific phenotypes is the capacity of modelling extraneous births deaths emigrations and immigrations individuals might be represented only by phenotypes at specific times an individual with a phenotype in a specific time but no phenotype after can represent death or immigration likewise an individual only manifesting phenotypes after a specific time may represent birth immigration however this technique is not the same as tracking population dynamics while the researcher may represent death births emigrations and immigrations the model cannot predict these events with the community matrix the gifd can incorporate many processes that were previously modelled alone compared to the review by tregenza 1995 the following patterns and studies can be represented in this model non immediate consumption and depletion lessells 1995 phenotypical differences parker 1982 unequal competition sutherland 1983 korona 1989 phenotype based on asymmetric competition sutherland and parker 1985 kleptoparasitim parker and sutherland 1986 differences in search efficiency dominance and kleptoparasitims holmgren 1995 perceptual constrains through adding a naïve and experience phenotype abrahams 1986 trophic web conformation rosenheim 2004 schwinning and rosenzweig 1990 sih 1998 state dependency through adding hungry and fed phenotypes mcnamara and houston 1990 and learning by adding naïve and experienced phenotypes bernstein et al 1988 this generalization however cannot represent certain expansions of the ideal free distribution it assumes the interaction between phenotypes is linear or linearizable which may be overly simplistic it is based on pairwise interactions which might not represent interactions correctly neill 1974 it is also a deterministic model and hence cannot consider stochastic ideal free distributions hakoyama 2003 additionally it is based on patches habitats being discrete units while some new expansions consider ideal free distributions in continuous landscapes or using continuous time cantrell et al 2012 it also does not consider movement cressman and křivan 2006 flaxman and lou 2009 but chief among the issues is the fixed number of individuals many models incorporate population dynamic models cantrell et al 2012 doncaster 2000 kondoh 2003 e g lessells 1995 nevertheless the following advances demonstrated that the lack of dynamics does not invalidate this model populations and migration dynamics guide populations towards the distribution predicted by static ideal free distribution models cressman and křivan 2006 in addition some studies have combined matrix models with dispersal cantrell et al 2012 which indicates that these dynamic models may be integrated in the future therefore we believe a static generalization based on linear algebra provides the most successful framework in combining multiple models 3 2 support for previous ideal free distribution predictions insofar we have fully developed the model demonstrated that it can represent multiple previous models by using different matrices and showed it is an evolutionary stable strategy however it is possible that this model will lead to different predictions from those that it summarizes to gauge its consistency with previous studies we attempted to compare our predictions with theirs we found our predictions to be consistent with four existing models parker s matching rule parker 1974 sutherland 1983 s non ideal competition the leapfrog effect rosenheim 2004 sih 1998 and the ideal despotic distribution fretwell 1972 the proof of these similarities can be found in the supplementary material 3 3 new predictions using linear algebra also allows us to generate new predictions that were not possible without a model with multiple patches and multiple species we discuss some novel predictions in this section 3 3 1 third party interaction effect one of the difficulties with multi species ideal free distributions is the lack of data to test their predictions many studies in habitat selection focus on individuals from a single species without distinguishing between them therefore it would be best if this model would generate a prediction that can be falsifiable with information from only a few or one species we can generate a prediction like that by working with sums in a system with two patches recall from eq 3 that q 1 q 2 c p 1 c p 2 c p 1 0 5 0 this equation is a matrix representation of a system of equations therefore if we sum the rows we obtain a condition that must be true as when we sum the equations in a system of equations from summing all rows in that equation we get 13 c 1 1 c 2 1 c n 1 p 1 1 0 5 c 1 2 c 2 2 c n 2 p 1 2 0 5 c 1 3 c 2 3 c n 3 p 1 3 0 5 0 where p 1 1 represents proportion of time spent in habitat 1 by species 1 in that order as before c 2 1 represents the effect of species 1 on species 2 if we then isolate one phenotype from this equation for example phenotype 1 we get the following condition 14 p 1 1 0 5 i 1 k c k i p 1 i 0 5 k c k 1 where p 1 1 is the proportion of time spent in habitat 1 by phenotype 1 p 1 i is the proportion of time spent in habitat 1 by phenotype i c k i is the influence of phenotype i on k and c k 1 is the influence of phenotype 1 on k the interesting conclusion from this condition is the numerator c k i influences the distribution of phenotype 1 in the habitat even though phenotype k and i are different from 1 this indicates that interactions between third parties influence phenotype distributions the direction of this third party effect is determined by the denominator if the denominator is positive a positive third party interaction will repel the focal phenotype p 1 1 will decrease a negative third party interaction will attract the focal phenotype the opposite will be expected if the denominator is negative biologically we can interpret the denominator as a combination of the trophic level and the competitivity index a positive denominator indicates a docile phenotype which has positive effects on other phenotypes either by serving as a mutualist prey or by performing as an inexpressive predator and competitor on the other hand a negative denominator suggests an aggressive phenotype causing overall negative effects on the rest of the community like a predator competitor or parasite hence we can infer aggressive phenotypes are attracted by positive third party interactions while docile phenotypes avoid it this prediction may seem counterintuitive but it has been studied in the form of general anti predator behavior e g lima 1992 prey docile avoid habitats with predation events of other species positive interaction in addition there has been evidence that different predators aggressive can indirectly facilitate each other s foraging strategies bouskila 1995 losey and denno 1998 suggesting they might chose habitats with more predation events of the other species positive interaction if they are capable of identifying those habitats therefore this is the first time a model based on ideal free distribution made predictions about indirect effects outside trophic chains this initial oddity has another positive side this prediction can be tested in single species studies if the species is found to avoid habitats with predators or competitors that are not directly theirs it suggests species might be operating under a gifd 3 3 2 competitive exclusion is numerically rare with the new model we can represent how specific interactions can change individual distributions and isolate this effect from other interactions here we demonstrate this effect by analyzing inter specific competition this interaction is especially interesting since it shows diverse consequences to the resulting distribution for that analysis we represented strong inter specific competition in two patches with each species represented by a phenotype the result is the following c n f 15 c n f 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 with a c f 10 10 10 10 and p f 0 51 0 49 under this scenario inter specific competition is the main driving force of this community since both intraspecific competition and resource attraction are very small in this situation both species have an even distribution across habitats p n f 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 this effect can be explained in a similar way to the logic behind fixed phenotypes fitness is determined almost exclusively by avoiding the competitor hence it is impossible for each phenotype to find what is the best habitat since both are deciding simultaneously as a result the best action is to use habitats randomly when the fitness input of the fixed phenotype c f is raised to the same level as competitive costs both species match the resource distribution intermediate values lead to both species slowly increasing their use of the richer habitat until it matches the distribution of resources this is contrary to much of the literature on competition which predicts spatial segregation of the competitors e g diamond 1975 shigesada et al 1979 for actual segregation to occur due to competition a more specific condition must be satisfied this condition can be found with two habitats by solving for c n f in eq 8 given p n f 1 0 0 1 note that under this scenario p n f is always an identity matrix i 2 therefore eq 8 becomes 16 i 2 1 np c nf 1 c f p f s 3 subtracting the identity matrix from 1 n p gives the s 3 matrix 17 s 3 c n f 1 c f p f s 3 which lead us to conclude i 2 c n f 1 c f p f 18 c nf c f p f this calculation holds independently of how many habitats or species are in the system biologically eq 15 shows that segregation between two competing species is not the most common outcome to result in spatial segregation a complex interplay must be achieved between the abundance of their shared resources their importance to each prey and the strength of intra specific and inter specific competition eq 15 provides a few insights on the requirements firstly segregation cannot occur between two phenotypes that are exactly equal secondly for symmetric competition to result in segregation the shared resource cannot be valued equally by both species the difference in the value of the resource for the phenotypes must be equal to the difference between patch resources c f 1 c f 2 p f 1 p f 2 this shows that complete competitive exclusion requires a strict set of conditions to occur 3 3 3 beta diversity is as a result of species dominance the previous section focused on competitive exclusion but it can also be analyzed concentrating on habitats when each phenotype represents a species a complete competitive exclusion also tells us about species composition between habitats p n f 1 0 0 1 represents a metacommunity with high beta diversity between habitats but relatively low alpha diversity one species per habitat therefore we can infer metrics of diversity from the resulting p n f richness is represented as the column sums of the matrix likewise diversity indexes can be calculated for each habitat each column of the matrix represents abundance values for each phenotype in that habitat with this information we can generate predictions on species diversity from community matrices for example we can repurpose the calculation of eq 15 to generate predictions on what type of community generates the most beta diversity using two patches to demonstrate the maximum beta diversity occurs when each species is found in its own habitat i e p n f 1 0 0 1 and with the highest possible concentration on the fixed phenotype p f 1 0 since at p f 1 0 the gifd is not defined using eq 15 we can predict that if p f 1 0 c n f c f 1 0 c f 2 0 in other words the maximum beta diversity in a two species community should be expected when one species shows very low intra and inter specific competition compared to the other species 4 discussion in this study we demonstrated how the ideal free distribution can be expanded using linear algebra and how this pattern allows many different models to be built using the same structure we also showed that new predictions can be drawn taking advantage of the multi species capabilities of this model the gifd shows a potential to connect many different areas in ecology originating from behavior but generating predictions on spatial distribution diversity trends and even on community structure these connections are due to phenotypes in the model other studies attempted to model phenotypes in ideal free distribution but never to this detail parker 1982 and ruxton et al 2001 used scalar values to represent phenotype quality here we expand a phenotype to a set of c values towards other phenotypes as such the same individual can manifest different phenotypes in its life or a phenotype can represent an entire species the decision of how precise the phenotype should be is limited solely by the accuracy of the data that will be used to populate this model another key development was the use of a quality function based on summations this is different from the classical representation as a ratio fretwell and lucas 1969 hugie and dill 1994 ruxton et al 2001 sih 1998 this change comes at a cost of clarity the ratio formula is more easily visualized predators sharing a pie of resources and has a clear bound fitness was either 0 or positive nevertheless it gives a series of advantages chief among them is the elimination of an exponential behavior where the value of a habitat would grow to infinity when not used i e denominator equals 0 this exponential behavior lead previous studies to conclude that all patches would be occupied hugie and dill 1994 or to assume that the model cannot make inferences on unoccupied patches fretwell and lucas 1969 further the additional structure of this model allows us to represent imperfect competition i e inefficient resource consumption due to conflict by changing different c values in eq 2 without requiring a new parameter lastly it is scale free eq 2 can represent habitat quality for any arbitrary phenotype a species a group of individuals one individual or even a single individual in a moment of time without changing its sum of products structure one of the most interesting capabilities of this model is that it provides a standard framework to turn species distributions into inferences on community structure using eq 9 although it does not give a single result it uses the moore penrose pseudo inverse to find the community matrix from the results this widespread mathematical technique implies that the predicted community is the least squares approximation to the real community matrix eq 9 thus has a similar accuracy to methods derived from least squares such as regressions and anovas this allows gifd to be compared with other methods to deduce community interactions e g schoener 1974 although the strength of ideal free distribution models relies on their predictive power gifd is not tied to it and can be used as an ad hoc method our examples above demonstrate the large flexibility of this model but there are two points of rigidity if community matrices are generated at random there are relatively few communities that have feasible ideal free distributions p n f values between 0 and 1 the more phenotypes that are added the harder it is to randomly create a community matrix with feasible p n f in addition gifd very rarely had habitats with 0 occupancy or even habitats with 10 this suggests that most habitats are frequently used this conclusion was also reached by studies using classical ideal free distribution hugie and dill 1994 both patterns suggest that gifd is not a product of random combinations of species which indicates that if found in nature they presuppose some form of assemblage rule similar to this model several previous studies addressed the interplay of community forces and species distribution for example there was evidence indicating that asymmetric competition causes communities to diverge from parker s matching rule berec et al 2006 in another example more complex spatial models were developed to track overgrazing and fragmentation in a three level trophic chain kondoh 2003 isodars the lines showing distributions across habitats where fitness is equal can be calculated for systems with more than one species they can be used to describe the equilibrium distributions of competing species between habitats morris 2003 rosenzweig 1981 introduced the concept of isolegs lines in a state space of population densities that separate regions where the optimal behavior for a species is different using this technique he connected habitat selection population dynamics and competition doncaster 2000 proposed a more complete model predicting individual distributions along a scale of individuals to communities his model also tracked populations dynamics however it did not explicitly consider communities with multiple trophic levels in addition it tracked different variables depending on the scale those models related to areas that gifd still cannot analyze such as spatially explicit models or population dynamics however we believe that no other study provides a standard modelling tool such as gifd with gifd matrices it is relatively easy to add or remove other assumptions by changing the number of rows and the values of c a model can transition from the scale of species to the individuals by adding more rows the gifd is also very simple computationally the optimal distribution for hundreds of phenotypes can be found with a simple matrix inversion therefore although there is no lack of generalizations in the literature we believe gifd provides a more robust empirical modeling tool despite its advantages as a modelling tool gifd is mostly a predictive model it may be used to develop hypotheses about species interactions and to test them by comparing gifd distributions with field data however gifd does not perform as well to explain existing data especially since it requires a large number of parameters community matrices and fixed phenotypes distributions the value of this model rest on allowing new

25101,forests are a critical resource and need proper management in the face of dire climatic changes facing the world today advances in modelling system result in the formulation of numerous forest modelling approaches to provide an estimation of forests services one such useful and straightforward forest modelling approach is process based modelling relying on physiological processes and biophysical parameters of forest ecosystems it is based on parametric calculations and allometric equations delivering crucial outputs for forest management the dynamic 3 pg physiological principles in predicting growth is a process based model pbm based on an ecosystem physiological process based modelling approach the various applications and flexible nature of the 3 pg model have resulted in its adoption and utilization over several regions of the world the 3 pgs physiological principles in predicting growth with satellite model is a modified and spatial version of the 3 pg model that took advantages of remote sensing gis geographical information system for estimation of biophysical variables like fapar fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation lai leaf area index and canopy water content cwc which are tedious and laborious to calculate manually the integration of remote sensing gis with pbms offers insights to predict forest biomass and productivity at a regional level also coupling of the 3 pg 3 pgs model with other modelling and statistical approaches in a gis environment provides insights into the prediction of species distributions and potential disturbances due to climatic changes the 3 pg model was originally designed for relatively homogenous forests but with the recent development the 3 pgmix has extended its use to mixed species forests in this review we have tried to emphasize the general overview structure applications and efficacy of the process based 3 pg model for forest management in future forests and their ecosystem services are expected to be rigorously influenced by climatic variations therefore it is important to understand the role and effectiveness of the forest growth model 3 pg under the influence of climate change the 3 pg model performs well for a diverse range of conditions for many forest types and species and could be integrated with other models and approaches in order to widen its functions and applications areas such as fertility rating fr sensitivity and uncertainty of outputs to the model inputs in the 3 pg model requires attention to remove the weaker side and to increase the effectiveness and accuracy of model outputs in addition the model performance can be improved by calculating its parameters from the population of interest rather than using default values or values from extant literature furthermore high resolution remote sensing datasets and accurate input field data could increase the accuracy of the 3 pg 3 pgs model predictions at a broad regional level in general the simple forest growth model 3 pg delivers practical outputs which are directly used in forest management additionally the functions and applications of the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model could be explored to deal with the impacts of climate change on forests and to ensure the sustainable management of forests keywords 3 pg process based modelling forest management sensitivity analysis

the global ecological health keenan et al 2015 at present nearly 30 of the anthropogenic emissions from the atmosphere are removed annually by forests and other ecosystems le quéré et al 2016 in the future additional c could be sequestered and removed by raising conservation efforts and sustainable management of forests keith et al 2014 houghton and nassikas 2018 in order to maximize ecosystem multifunctionality by maximizing forest services and benefits to users is the main challenge for forest managers hector and bagchi 2007 brockerhoff et al 2017 process based forest growth modelling is a technique by which the ecosystem behavior has been examined from individual physical and biological functional components vis a vis their interactions within themselves and the environment through varying physical and mechanistic procedures godfrey 1983 bossel 1994 mäkelä et al 2000 vacchiano et al 2012 the physiological processes centered forest growth and prediction models are powerful tools korzukhin et al 1996 battaglia and sands 1998 mäkelä et al 2000 johnsen et al 2001 wei et al 2014b to understand the c dynamics in forest ecosystems because these models can be incorporated and could explicitly describe the natural behavior of systems adams et al 2013 xia et al 2013 wu et al 2014 having a broad scope the pbms can be relatively simple forest growth models they have been operationalized as a practical tool for forest management in various countries in recent years mäkelä et al 2000 lasch et al 2005 fontes et al 2010 pbms are dependent on allometric equations to derive empirical relations of various underlying processes that provide multiple outputs fontes et al 2010 and have the potential to estimate and quantify the impacts of climate change on forest productivity bossel 1996 almeida et al 2004b the range of ecological functions and processes are interrupted by climate change whereby different forests differ in their sensitivity to climatic changes keenan 2015 thus the role of pbms is crucial for forest biomass and productivity assessment in the changing climatic conditions coops et al 2005 white et al 2006 almeida et al 2010 adhikari and white 2016 which are key outputs in research related to forest growth management and sustainability the performance of the empirical growth models is somewhat less decisive as compared to the performance of the pbms fontes et al 2006 miehle et al 2009 fontes et al 2010 because the former are not generally applicable as they do not take into account the mechanisms and environmental impacts underlying plantation growth for instance pinjuv et al 2006 on the other hand pbms have a broad range of applicability encompassing various mechanisms and environmental conditions relating to tree growth coops and waring 2011a generally an important issue with empirical models is the requirement of large input datasets to parameterize whereas pbms can be parameterized with only a small number of datasets use able across many more sites adams et al 2013 in the case of 3 pg for instance forrester et al 2017 showed that it could be used to predict many climate and site effects on growth that couldn t be predicted by empirical analyses of the same data set pretzsch et al 2015b process based forest growth modelling approach provides new insights to researchers modellers and forest managers to explore their ideas on forest sustainability pbms are practically compatible research tools for silvicultural regimes which help in decision making policies for sustainability in forest services landsberg et al 2003 2005 almeida et al 2004b an accurate assessment of forest growth and yield is required for quantifying the influence of silvicultural regimes on productivity profitability and risk assessment dye 2001 according to johnsen et al 2001 risk assessment in the changing climatic conditions is an important study area which could be explored using process based modelling the 3 pg model is a monospecific simple freely available and monthly time step stand level pbm landsberg and waring 1997 coops et al 1998 landsberg et al 2001 the 3 pgs model is a modified and spatial version of the 3 pg model coops et al 1998 the 3 pg model was further modified into the 3 pgmix model by forrester and tang 2016 having a small number of new and improved parameters that enable it to predict mixing effects in forests the credit for 3 pg model development goes to landsberg and waring 1997 the 3 pg model is merely a grouping of concepts like radiation use efficiency c balance model partitioning and simple stand nutritional parameters these parameter values are obtained either by direct measurements or by studies available on the species to be parameterized landsberg and waring 1997 xenakis et al 2008 3 pg is a deterministic model which calculates physiological processes like photosynthesis transpiration biomass partitioning to tree parts and litter production coops et al 2009 2011a additionally it provides simulation on the affects of climatic changes forest management practices site attributes impacts on stand growth species interactions biomass dynamics and hydrological impacts on forests coops and waring 2001a landsberg et al 2001 sands and landsberg 2002 stape et al 2004 coops et al 2010 bryars et al 2013 gonzalez benecke et al 2014 forrester et al 2017 meyer et al 2017 2018 xie et al 2017 the 3 pg model is a combination of empirical relations and physiological processes calculated from experimental measurements and field calculations into the c balance model thus it facilitates and reduces both data in terms of its quantity and the complexity in data calculations steps silva et al 2013 the process based 3 pg model bridges the gap between traditional mensuration centered models and complex pbms landsberg et al 2003 2005 zhao et al 2009 so far several pbms have been developed based more or less on physiological principles however simple structure readily obtainable input data and not very high number of parameters mark the 3 pg model a widely used forest growth model the variables generated by the 3 pg model are directly beneficial for forest managers rodríguez

impacts of hydrology and the availability of soil water on the growth of forests species dye 2001 it has been applied to various forest species in different countries such as australia finland brazil canada spain new zealand china south africa and the united states as shown in table 4 while much work has been done on the 3 pg model in plantations it has also performed well in natural forests which tend to be much more complex than plantations therefore the 3 pg model needs to applied on a larger scale and parameterized in natural forests which are the significant c absorbers potithep and yasuoka 2011 the 3 pg 3 pgs model in current form is simple as it works on basic allometric equations and requires a minimal input dataset the delivered outputs show a good correlation between observed and predicted data values the 3 pgpjs vsn 2 7 is the latest version of the 3 pg model available written in visual basic for applications offering greater flexibility to users in operation sands 2010 it can be easily downloaded from the 3 pg official website http 3pg forestry ubc ca 3 pg for excel a recent update of the 3 pgpjs vsn 2 7 is the 3 pgmix model almost identical to 3 pgpjs vsn 2 7 freely available and can be run to provide nearly the same outputs with the same inputs as 3 pgpjs vsn 2 7 the 3 pgmix model can be used for mixed species forests by dividing the population into a small number of age or species cohorts uneven aged forests deciduous species allows different versions of water balance calculations light calculations and includes diameter distributions also the 3 pgmix model includes some of the more recent developments such as the work by wei et al 2014a 2014b to allow stable c isotope data to be used for parameterization the 3 pgmix model is described in detail by forrester and tang 2016 and is freely downloaded from https sites google com site davidforresterssite home projects 3pgmix 3pgmixdownload formerly landsberg and sands 2010 reviewed the 3 pg model in a book chapter the 3 pg process based model in this study we have provided comprehensive coverage of all the major studies on the 3 pg model the objective of this study is to review earlier studies which use 3 pg 3 pgs model and identify the types of applications a simple process based 3 pg model can offer in forest management moreover this study underlines the role and importance of remote sensing gis in the process based 3 pg 3 pgs model the 3 pgmix model a recent modification of the 3 pg model has also been highlighted in this review furthermore we have attempted to introduce the role and need of the 3 pg model in changing climatic conditions to widen the range of model prediction from simple shorter term climatic changes to complex and longer term climatic changes affects on forest ecosystems while the scope of this review is somewhat limited to the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model at the same time it would be of interest to many researchers not only modellers as well as forest managers 2 methods this review paper is reviews extant literature covering the process based 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model fig 2 contains some main references which are helpful in finding out additional literature about the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model we have searched extant literature through the google search engine google scholar research gate and web of science besides the 3 pg homepage http 3pg forestry ubc ca publications listed major references on the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model we have found a major portion of literature on the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model in two elsevier journals one is forest ecology and management and the other is ecological modelling from 1997 to 2017 the total number of publications on the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model and cited in this review is 89 as shown in fig 1 an overview of the 3 pg 3 pgs model its various applications and usefulness is the primary focus of this review we have adopted a straightforward way of reviewing the 3 pg model fig 2 firstly we have provided a general overview and structure of the process based 3 pg 3 pgs model then we have discussed the need of the pbm like the 3 pg model for forest management in the changing climatic conditions after that we have discussed the sensitivity analysis sa and parameterization in the 3 pg 3 pgs model finally we have focused on the application part of the 3 pg 3 pgs model the various studies on the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model and their main findings are shown in table 4 3 need for forest growth modelling in changing climate to understand the global changes taking place in the forests and their services is a complicated task macdicken 2015 climate change is one of the most severe and significant problems that we are facing nowadays it is a great challenge for scientists and researchers to make future predictions about its impacts on the forests ecosystem climate change disturbs forest growth net primary productivity npp forest functions such as c inputs and decomposition rates morison and morecroft 2006 ashraf et al 2015 as well as the distribution of invasive species storkey et al 2014 moreover climate change has the potential to disrupt the entire natural forest ecosystem and transform the old structure of forest ecosystem into a new structure such as from spruce to pine forest forest to savannah ecosystem mendes 2007 forest growth and productivity are hindered by many factors such as deforestation stocking density species composition and competition zhang et al 2015 as well as diameter distribution coomes and allen 2007 macdicken 2015 from 1990 to 2015 a 3 net drop in forest area occurred the total forest area in 2015 was 31 of the global land area or 0 6 ha per individual fao 2015 keenan et al 2015 reducing deforestation would result in an expansion of forest cover which in turn would provide an excellent option for levelling carbon dioxide co2 concentration and mitigating climate change fang et al 2007 kanninen et al 2007 a sufficient modelling approach that estimates forests productivity across regions headlee et al 2013 predicts physiological changes in trees and species shifting measures mechanisms rates and disturbances in ecosystems as well as develop relations among these has been required in the changing climatic conditions turner et al 1995 loehle and leblanc 1996 tilman 1998 scheller and mladenoff 2005 process based modelling can estimate long term growth examine and quantify environmental variables that influence tree growth and also inspects the consequences of stocking and the silvicultural regime on yield according to franklin et al 2016 it is crucial to incorporate the dimension of climatic changes in the growth and productivity prediction models in order to understand the impact of climatic variations on the forest s ecosystem thoroughly forest growth models are basic tools that can be applied in simulating the c dynamics in forests vanderwel et al 2013 jin et al 2016 the reliability of outcomes from forest growth models is severely limited because very few models take account of climate change induced alterations like forest fire hazards extreme events like windstorms and invasion of insects and pathogens further the models used by ecologists to assess the climate change induced impacts on forests and models used by forest managers to determine the forest growth and yield have shown inconsistencies between themselves kirilenko and sedjo 2007 according to seidl et al 2011 we require an integrated modelling approach that integrates environmental disturbances and vegetation physiological processes thus that integrated modelling approach has the predictive ability to address interactions between these inclusions over a wide range of spatiotemporal scales primarily there are three forms of pbms simple physiological complex physiological and hybrid empirical physiological categorized based on complexity among physiological processes jin et al 2016 since the natural system involves complex and incorporated mechanisms of ecosystems pbms offer useful means to understand the complexity and linkages in the functionality of the ecosystem johnsen et al 2001 physiological processes such as photosynthesis are impacted by rising concentration of atmospheric co2 which effectively alters tree growth and productivity thus pbms offer an opportunity to assess the impact of rising co2 concentration on forest s growth productivity and functioning cropper et al 1998 weinstein et al 1998 johnsen et al 2001 it is difficult for any modelling approach to address the entire gamut of complex mechanisms involving interactions between environmental variables growth and the developmental processes in vegetation hence even if all models were to make accurate predictions they would merely simplify reality silva et al 2013 4 the process based model 3 pg modelling is a robust approach to understand the growth dynamics of forests balandier et al 2000 fontes et al 2010 provide a comprehensive explanation of empirical process based and hybrid models for forest management in changing climate environments further they stated that because of wide ranging environmental applicability and outputs pbms are the most versatile the strength of pbms lies in their competency to forecast responses to changing climatic conditions johnsen et al 2001 reviewed the significance of pbms as tools in forest management and discussed the components that need to be enhanced to raise model accuracy and applications according to johnsen et al 2001 pbms intended for research purposes generally require complex and intensive data whereas pbms intended for forest management practices require more straightforward and readily accessible data pretzsch et al 2015a made a comprehensive analysis of forest growth models to examine the growth dynamics in mixed forests according to them out of large number of forest growth models only a few can be suitably adjusted to evaluate the mixing effects of plantations the 3 pg is one such model and it has been adjusted for mixtures in the form of 3 pgmix forrester and tang 2016 forrester et al 2017 pbms can become more complex by increasing the parameter numbers and allometric equations battaglia and sands 1998 thus while accuracy is to be gained by adding more parameters it increases model complexity reducing thereby its simplicity and feasibility johnsen et al 2001 light is a chief driver for ecosystem functioning forrester 2014 its interception by the forest canopy cover plays a vital role in growth and biomass production bai et al 2016 the central concept in the 3 pg model is the conversion of absorbed photosynthetically active radiations apar into npp apar has been calculated from global solar radiations and lai using beer s law utilized apar aparu has been evaluated by reducing apar to an amount determined by environmental modifiers landsberg and waring 1997 these modifiers are temperature ft vapor pressure deficit fvpd frost ff available soil water fasw and soil fr ffr all these growth modifiers lie between zero fully limiting to one not limiting landsberg and waring 1997 coops et al 2001b landsberg and sands 2010 coops et al 2011a 2011b the analyses and quantification of these monthly imposed growth modifiers can offer an understanding of confinements in growth and productivity thus directed forest management strategies towards sustainable production almeida et al 2010 gonzález garcía et al 2015 hung et al 2016 3 pg model offers a comprehensive and integrated modelling framework the primary structure of the 3 pg model is presented in fig 3 mainly consisting of the following five sub models biomass production sub model based on c balance model mcmurtrie and wolf 1983 assimilation and allocation sub model based on fundamental laws and observations mortality and thinning sub model soil water balance sub model management and outputs sub model on multiplying aparu with canopy quantum efficiency it gives gross primary productivity gpp npp is calculated as a fraction of gpp with a constant value of 0 47 0 04 this constant value assumption avoids the requirement to calculate respiration rates waring et al 1998 landsberg et al 2003 this constant ratio is found to be almost equal for various types of forests and for the range of geographical sites and regions waring et al 1998 rodríguez et al 2002 in the second sub model allocation of npp to various parts of the plant or tree such as stems foliages and roots occur tree size influences the partitioning of npp to foliages and stems large tree size means less partitioning to foliages and stems factors such as vapour pressure deficit vpd soil moisture and soil fertility landsberg and waring 1997 sands and landsberg 2002 influence npp partitioning to roots in soil water balance sub model canopy conductance is calculated using a species specific maximum canopy conductance and lai measurements adjusting the values according to the vpd modifier and available soil water content aswc the penman monteith equation allen 2005 has been applied to compute the stand transpiration in the 3 pg model landsberg et al 2003 and the canopy evaporation has been computed by the use of lai canopy interception and the rainfall data stand evapotranspiration can be evaluated by adding canopy evaporation and transpiration aswc is also limited by upper and lower limits and that runoff is included in the calculation in addition to rainfall and evapotranspiration if aswc exceeds its maximum value runoff occurs the difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration gives aswc gonzalez benecke et al 2014 stand density has been adjusted for density dependent mortality using the 3 2 thinning law drew and flewelling 1977 sands and landsberg 2002 bryars et al 2013 stand basal area ba has been calculated from the diameter at breast height dbh and tree density the growth rate of the stand may be tuned to the age of stand to consider the age effect on stand growth mean tree height h has been calculated using a height diameter function gonzalez benecke et al 2014 data was required as an input to initialize the model the major outputs generated from the 3 pg model are shown in table 1 many studies landsberg and waring 1997 coops et al 2001a b 2009 fontes et al 2006 gonzalez benecke et al 2014 2016 hung et al 2016 forrester and tang 2016 meyer et al 2017 have elaborated on the 3 pg model 4 1 parameterization in the 3 pg model accuracy and efficacy of any model majorly depend on estimating the representative parameter value dye 2001 parameterization is the method to delineate the value of species specific parameters and can be assigned using the allometric relationship and tuning the growth modifiers it is important to measure or to obtain from the literature as many parameters as possible and only tune the minimum number of parameters that could not be obtained sands 2004 tuning of parameters may be achieved by adjusting the values of model parameters to give good fit of model output to observed data the 3 pg model may be parameterized for specific species or different genotypes of same species different type of parameters in the 3 pg model is shown in table 2 the 3 pgmix model has an additional number of parameters and allometric equations mainly to allow the prediction of apar by canopies of mixed species forests sands and landsberg 2002 derived values for a set of parameters that provide good fit to stem biomass lai and litterfall across a diverse range of e globulus species landsberg et al 2003 described the procedures for calibration in the 3 pg model and estimated the values of different parameters to best fit for widely ranged forest growth datasets almeida et al 2004a performed the 3 pg model parameterization for e grandis species by applying input parameter values from direct observation default values and by applying the best fit method according to amichev et al 2010 parameterization of the 3 pg model for fast growing hybrid poplar clones walker variety has multiple benefits the most significant benefit includes longer term biomass supply data which could be predictable and accessed by farmland managers along with commercial sector industries that are keen to grow hybrid poplars on cultivated land for the bioenergy production bryars et al 2013 modified various allometric equations of 3 pg to get outputs associated with the observed growth of p taeda species for the calibrated site according to them a generic set of parameters in the 3 pg model increases its effectiveness as an analytical tool to evaluate the growth and yield response to different silvicultural and fertilization regimes some studies suggested that the directly calculated parameters from population of interest and adjustments in default and optional parameters values could improve the performance of the 3 pg model rodríguez suárez et al 2010 adjusted the default values of two 3 pg parameters fullcanage and ns they ranged fullcanage from 3 5 to 7 years default value is 0 and ns ranged from 2 25 to 2 35 default value is 2 4 for e globulus species according to their observations 3 pg exhibited an improved growth prediction on modifying default values of 3 pg parameters fullcanage and ns amaral et al 2006 fontes et al 2006 also applied 3 pg in portugal for the estimation of biomass and volume of e globulus they showed that 3 pg provides improved initial results when default values of parameters alpha and pfs2 were replaced with directly measured values for species under study 4 2 sensitivity analysis complexity and limited knowledge about the ecosystem structure and function cause parameter uncertainty song et al 2013 accuracy in measurements and a better understanding of modelling procedures could reduce the uncertainty of parameters makler pick et al 2011 song et al 2012 2013 sa has been performed to examine the sensitivity of model outputs to input parameters it is related with allometric equations and biophysical processes therefore it offers an approach to understand and improve the 3 pg 3 pgs model variables and to extend the applications of the 3 pg model esprey et al 2004 nightingale et al 2008 zhao et al 2009 fig 2 shows some important studies which have focused on sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of outputs to 3 pg inputs esprey et al 2004 performed a detailed and first inclusive description of sa for the 3 pg model parameters by taking eucalyptus grandis species from 31 sites in south africa which were widely different in climatic and site conditions they performed the sa of stand volume and lai outputs for over twenty four 3 pg input parameters the sensitivity of model outputs to inputs such as monthly mean rainfall and temperature site fertility and maximum aswc was also examined by them wherein they revealed that the 3 pg model outputs like stand volume sv and wr are significantly sensitive to fr almeida et al 2004a performed sa for outputs like dbh water use efficiency wue sv root stem and foliage biomass by variating the values of input parameters a s n s g c x d k g ŋrn a a n d l c x between 20 to 20 and demonstrated that the ouputs like dbh and foliage biomass w f were most affected by these variations in inputs a similar sa was done for 3 pgmix by forrester and tang 2016 which indicated that this modified version had very similar behavior to the 3 pg model amichev et al 2010 made the sensitivity of the 3 pg model outputs to input paramters like topt sla1 specific leaf area for mature leaves fullcanage and minimum asw for hybrid poplar walker and revealed that the predictions of outputs like height h and diameter at breast height dbh are highly sensitive to variations in these inputs song et al 2013 stated that the stand age of vegetation markedly affects the sensitivity values of most of the 3 pg model parameters moreover climatic variations and soil properties are also found to be responsible for fluctuation in the sensitivity values of some of the 3 pg model parameters they described the time dependence sensitivity of the 3 pg model outputs to the 3 pg model inputs further the calculation of the 3 pg model sensitvity of outputs to input parameters only at a single simulation period lu and mohanty 2001 esprey et al 2004 makler pick et al 2011 is somewhat biased and thus they song et al 2013 proposed the time dependent sa which provide much better insights into the structure analysis and performance of the 3 pg model hung et al 2016 also supported the time dependent sa in his study on acacia hybrid at two different simulation ages a study by potithep and yasuoka 2011 on deciduous broadleaf forests in japan varied the range of input parameters between 20 to 20 and observed the affects of these variations on the 3 pg model outputs they found that the 3 pg model outputs are more sensitive to the 3 pg model input parameters α c x t m i n and t o p t than other 3 pg inputs parameters therefore these highly sensitive inputs need more attention for calculating their values in order to improve accuracy in outputs gpp was found to be highly sensitive and positively related with input parameters α c x and t m i n whereas with the input parameter t o p t gpp has shown an inverse relation overall the output gpp derived by potithep and yasuoka 2011 using the 3 pg model was found to be sensitive to each selected and varied input parameter a s n s p 2 p 20 α c x t m i n t o p t ws and wf according to vega nieva et al 2013 the variations in fr values would significantly alter the 3 pg model estimation of forest biomass and productivity therefore they developed a general modelling approach for the prediction of fr from soil profile relative nutrient contents rncs by comparing several general modelling frameworks of fr from rncs sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the 3 pg model outputs to input parameters needs further attention moreover attention also is required on the role of parameters value distributions on the uncertainties and sensitivities of input parameters for the model outputs as well as the affects of site specific data on parameters sensitivities to attain a more unbiased and representative model s sensitivity song et al 2013 4 3 fertility rating fr fertility rating fr is an essential and complicated site specific parameter that relates to the soil fertility to stand productivity subedi et al 2015 fr affects outputs of the 3 pg model moreover fr directly affects the partitioning coefficient m that is used to estimate npp partitioning to roots landsberg and waring 1997 subedi et al 2015 it is a challenging task to determine fr value whereby the fr is labelled as the weakest feature of the 3 pg model in various studies esprey et al 2004 almeida et al 2010 landsberg and sands 2010 bryars et al 2013 lack of knowledge about fr s role in forest growth will inevitably affect the quality of decision making practices based on model outputs both for productivity and management almeida et al 2004a hung et al 2016 several studies such as dye et al 2004 stape et al 2004 fontes et al 2006 paul et al 2007 pérez cruzado et al 2011 vega nieva et al 2013 gonzalez benecke et al 2014 subedi et al 2015 and subedi and fox 2016 have made significant contributions to improve the fr aspect of the 3 pg model 4 4 integration of remote sensing and gis in the 3 pg model remote sensing and gis technology play a remarkable role in the process based forest growth modelling these technologies offer a quick and synoptic view of things assessing the spatio temporal variations in the concerned attributes seen in combination both remote sensing and gis technology have become an important tool for assessing forest biomass at a broad scale kumar et al 2015 kumar and mutanga 2017 advances in geospatial technology and their integration with forest growth models offer promising advantages in forest assessment modelling management and research the 3 pgs model is a spatial version of the 3 pg model which derives results by taking advantages of remote sensing gis technology further there are different types of sensors located on satellites which provide data on a wide range of topographic features and climatic regions on the earth surface this satellite data can then be integrated with pbms like 3 pgs therefore remote sensing gis technology provides a promising opportunity to initialise run and test the model s outputs waring et al 2010 table 3 moreover changes in phenology and the indirect estimation of soil water storage capacity using the relation between soil water balance calculations and seasonal reductions in lai over a vast region spanning decades could be achieved through remote sensing and gis landsberg and waring 1997 development of pbms that works with the combination of remote sensing and gis technology raise the efficiency and measurement from the plot or stand level to a broad regional level and could be compared with estimations derived from remote sensing independently landsberg and waring 1997 coops and waring 2001a used the 3 pgs model to find the primary production of coniferous forest across southwest oregon and obtained r2 of 0 76 standard error se of 1 2 m3 ha 1 yr 1 and p 0 01 between the 3 pgs modelled maximum annual above ground production and predictions made from yield tables nightingale et al 2008 estimated fpar fractional photosynthetically active radiations from ndvi normalized difference vegetation index using noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration and avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer sensors and applied in the 3 pgs model for spatial assessment and growth dynamics of mature old growth australian tropical rainforest bioregion above ground biomass agb prediction from 3 pgs model and ground measurements are significantly correlated coops et al 1998 nightingale et al 2008 six vegetation indices vi are calculated from ten days modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer composite image to calculate the gpp of deciduous broadleaf forest in two sites of japan potithep et al 2009 a study by nolé et al 2009 to estimate the c sequestration in italian forests coupled with the 3 pgs model along with improved soil respiration model show that the 3 pgs model efficiently simulates forest gpp and net ecosystem production nep coops et al 2012a applied an inverse model approach whereby they inverted the 3 pg model to calculate fr and aswc from growth potential laimax using modis imagery at 1 km2 spatial resolution across forest region in western north america imagery generated by remote sensing are useful in spatial prediction of productivity therefore determines the planning and management of resources such as bioenergy production and its distribution ahamed et al 2011 waring et al 2010 briefly described the use of remote sensing and gis technology and their scope and discussed improvements in pbm like the 3 pg 3 pgs model for forest growth they reviewed the 3 pgs model and also discussed satellite sensors which may be suitable for generating information required to run the 3 pgs model table 3 all these abovesaid examples and discussion reveal that remote sensing and gis were widely used and integrated with the 3 pg 3 pgs model for measurements this integrated approach could be further explored in order to improve outputs for forest management in changing the climatic conditions sensors collect data over a range of the electromagnetic spectrum uv and visible range 200 700 nm ir range 700 3000 nm thermal 3 10 mm and microwave range up to 1 m and provide information to define forests with related structural properties nutritional limits on forest growth and interaction of soil properties with stand height that influence above ground net primary productivity nppa waring et al 2010 high resolution imagery is crucial for estimating the variables accurately several types of sensors are designed differing in their resolution power and their ability to describe the characteristics within a process based modelling approach as shown in table 3 sensors having coarse spatial resolution do not provide species level information sinha et al 2015 high resolution imagery is required for that purpose hyperspectral remote sensing is the latest advancement in remote sensing and gis which can be very useful for providing accurate information and quantification at the species level 5 applications of the 3 pg model a wide range of applications have been identified by reviewing literature on 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model table 4 outputs that are generated by the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model are commonly related to forest managers moreover outputs like biomass productivity aswc lai and evapotranspiration are very beneficial in environmental assessments monitoring and research biomass estimation of any forest is a well established scientific attempt which helps in calculating c stock npp and additional biophysical parameters deb et al 2017 vegetation productivity gross and net is a critical biophysical variable which can be evaluated using the 3 pg 3 pgs model this variable recognizes the spatial and temporal distribution of c along with its source sink and cycling which eventually help to understand climate change zhao et al 2012 spatial version 3 pgs of the 3 pg model offers a better opportunity than the standard 3 pg model to evaluate the gpp and npp the 3 pgs model can be more proficient in simulating the above and below ground productivity correctly if there are characteristic parametric values of canopy quantum efficiency α and aswc θ are supplied in the 3 pg model coops et al 2001a lai is also a crucial variable and can be calculated from either a direct method or remote sensing technique lai is useful in the calculation of variables like apar it determines the parameters value along with 3 pg variables fontes et al 2006 lai is useful in the calculation of variables like apar it determines the parameters value along with 3 pg variables fontes et al 2006 coops et al 2005 calculated lai for the 3 pg model from estimated foliage mass and specific leaf area of vegetation according to gonzalez benecke et al 2016 a more realistic lai evaluation has occurred through 3 pg when equations on the seasonal dynamics of needle fall rate introduced in it a successful occurrence of forest species and their productivity over the landscape largely depends on aswc the 3 pg model thereby provides an opportunity to compute species fluctuations and reactions to hydrological changes weltzin et al 2003 mathys et al 2014 the 3 pg model and other pbms are also useful to evaluate the shifts in the distribution of species by identifying seasonal limits on photosynthesis whereby its affects are assessed in the extent of absorbed radiations by the forest canopy cover waring et al 2014 various researchers performed biomass and productivity predictions using 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix table 4 today there is an increasing interest in biodiversity and mixed species plantations however there are often no mixed species plantations to provide empirical information about which species to mix on which sites and which silvicultural methods to employ for their management therefore forrester and tang 2016 to answer these questions developed the 3 pgmix model it can be parameterized using data from monocultures and used to predict the dynamics of mixed forests one of the primary objectives of many modellers appears to be that their models are used in practice by foresters i e not only by researchers battaglia et al 2007 also provided some examples on the 3 pg model for its use as a practical forestry tool 6 conclusion broad acceptance and successful performance of the 3 pg model and its spatial version 3 pgs indicate that the process based 3 pg 3 pgs model has a tremendous predictive ability for forest management along with practical research applications process based modelling can be further useful in simulating co2 induced climatic changes and their potential disturbances in forest ecosystems almeida et al 2009 additionally appropriate hybrid approaches such as the hybridization of the process based 3 pg model and decision tree analysis coops et al 2009 2011b could be useful in predicting the distribution of species offering thorough understanding about the confines of growth and species shifts than purely any empirical approach therefore the applications and performances of the process based model 3 pg could be augmented by coupling with other forest growth models sub models statistical calculations and supplementary methods for estimation of variables for instance coupling the 3 pg model with decision tree model use of inversion method to determine fr and aswc from laimax use of equations to determine unknown inputs and use of the 3 pg model in a gis environment to evaluate outputs at a regional level following the increasing interest in biodiversity and mixed species plantations the 3 pg model was recently modified into the 3 pgmix model and was used to examine the dynamics of mixed forests variability in mixed forests across sites and climates having implications even for silvicultural practices the 3 pgs model predictions could be accurate when high resolution remotely sensed dataset have been applied as an input additionally new advances in remote sensing gis technology such as hyperspectral remote sensing which is to be integrated into process based modelling approach could be advantageous in forestry research the 3 pg 3 pgs model provides a large number of outputs and proper estimations of variables however some features like species specific parameterization poor methods for fr evaluation sensitivity and uncertainty of outputs to input parameters song et al 2013 have required more attention as specified in different studies to establish high accuracy moreover some aspects like light interception calculations open canopies forest structures edge effects growth modifiers biomass allocation water balance calculations site fertility and silvicultural practices in the present form of the 3 pg model use either basic or not fully improved allometric equations for calculation of these aspects besides data unavailability at a large region site conditions and validation of model outputs against independent datasets are some of the issues with the 3 pg model data landsberg and sands 2010 provided some useful insights into some interesting improvement areas of these aspects however they also stated that on introducing various complex equations for improving these aspects the model could lose its simplicity while modifications and improvements in the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model make it a more accurate there s a possibility that the model becomes more complex depending on the modifications in its structure mechanisms and allometric equations on the other hand complexity would restrict the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model only up to the modelling community hence the complex nature of the model cannot be easily operationalized by forest managers as a practical tool for forest management therefore improvements accurateness and maintenance of simplicity and feasibility of the standard 3 pg model its spatial and mixed version are the chief challenges for the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model developers as mentioned in introduction natural forests play a significant role as a sinker for c emissions therefore there is certainly a need to add other natural and native forest species as well as commercial plantations to parameterize and study under the process based 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model in our next work we would apply the 3 pg 3 pgs model to investigate the forest growth in india acknowledgements the author wishes to

25101,forests are a critical resource and need proper management in the face of dire climatic changes facing the world today advances in modelling system result in the formulation of numerous forest modelling approaches to provide an estimation of forests services one such useful and straightforward forest modelling approach is process based modelling relying on physiological processes and biophysical parameters of forest ecosystems it is based on parametric calculations and allometric equations delivering crucial outputs for forest management the dynamic 3 pg physiological principles in predicting growth is a process based model pbm based on an ecosystem physiological process based modelling approach the various applications and flexible nature of the 3 pg model have resulted in its adoption and utilization over several regions of the world the 3 pgs physiological principles in predicting growth with satellite model is a modified and spatial version of the 3 pg model that took advantages of remote sensing gis geographical information system for estimation of biophysical variables like fapar fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation lai leaf area index and canopy water content cwc which are tedious and laborious to calculate manually the integration of remote sensing gis with pbms offers insights to predict forest biomass and productivity at a regional level also coupling of the 3 pg 3 pgs model with other modelling and statistical approaches in a gis environment provides insights into the prediction of species distributions and potential disturbances due to climatic changes the 3 pg model was originally designed for relatively homogenous forests but with the recent development the 3 pgmix has extended its use to mixed species forests in this review we have tried to emphasize the general overview structure applications and efficacy of the process based 3 pg model for forest management in future forests and their ecosystem services are expected to be rigorously influenced by climatic variations therefore it is important to understand the role and effectiveness of the forest growth model 3 pg under the influence of climate change the 3 pg model performs well for a diverse range of conditions for many forest types and species and could be integrated with other models and approaches in order to widen its functions and applications areas such as fertility rating fr sensitivity and uncertainty of outputs to the model inputs in the 3 pg model requires attention to remove the weaker side and to increase the effectiveness and accuracy of model outputs in addition the model performance can be improved by calculating its parameters from the population of interest rather than using default values or values from extant literature furthermore high resolution remote sensing datasets and accurate input field data could increase the accuracy of the 3 pg 3 pgs model predictions at a broad regional level in general the simple forest growth model 3 pg delivers practical outputs which are directly used in forest management additionally the functions and applications of the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model could be explored to deal with the impacts of climate change on forests and to ensure the sustainable management of forests keywords 3 pg process based modelling forest management sensitivity analysis

the global ecological health keenan et al 2015 at present nearly 30 of the anthropogenic emissions from the atmosphere are removed annually by forests and other ecosystems le quéré et al 2016 in the future additional c could be sequestered and removed by raising conservation efforts and sustainable management of forests keith et al 2014 houghton and nassikas 2018 in order to maximize ecosystem

a technique by which the ecosystem behavior has been examined from individual physical and biological functional components vis a vis their interactions within themselves and the environment through varying physical and mechanistic procedures godfrey 1983 bossel 1994 mäkelä et al 2000 vacchiano et al 2012 the physiological processes centered forest growth and prediction models are powerful tools korzukhin et al 1996 battaglia and sands 1998 mäkelä et al 2000 johnsen et al 2001 wei et al 2014b to understand the c dynamics in forest ecosystems because these models can be incorporated and could explicitly describe the natural behavior of systems adams et al 2013 xia et al 2013 wu et al 2014 having a broad scope the pbms can be relatively simple forest growth models they have been operationalized as a practical tool for forest management in various countries in recent years mäkelä et al 2000 lasch et al 2005 fontes et al 2010 pbms are dependent on allometric equations to derive empirical relations of various underlying processes that provide multiple outputs fontes et al 2010 and have the potential to estimate and quantify the impacts of climate change on forest productivity bossel 1996 almeida et al 2004b the range of ecological functions and processes are interrupted by climate change whereby different forests differ in their sensitivity to climatic changes keenan 2015 thus the role of pbms is crucial for forest biomass and productivity assessment in the changing climatic conditions coops et al 2005 white et al 2006 almeida et al 2010 adhikari and white 2016 which are key outputs in research related to forest growth management and sustainability the performance of the empirical growth models is somewhat less decisive as compared to the performance of the pbms fontes et al 2006 miehle et al 2009 fontes et al 2010 because the former are not generally applicable as they do not take into account the mechanisms and environmental impacts underlying plantation growth for instance pinjuv et al 2006 on the other hand pbms have a broad range of applicability encompassing various mechanisms and environmental conditions relating to tree growth coops and waring 2011a generally an important issue with empirical models is the requirement of large input datasets to parameterize whereas pbms can be parameterized with only a small number of datasets use able across many more sites adams et al 2013 in the case of 3 pg for instance forrester et al 2017 showed that it could be used to predict many climate and site effects on growth that couldn t be predicted by empirical analyses of the same data set pretzsch et al 2015b process based forest growth modelling approach provides new insights to researchers modellers and forest managers to explore their ideas on forest sustainability pbms are practically compatible research tools for silvicultural regimes which help in decision making policies for sustainability in forest services landsberg et al 2003 2005 almeida et al 2004b an accurate assessment of forest growth and yield is required for quantifying the influence of silvicultural regimes on productivity profitability and risk assessment dye 2001 according to johnsen et al 2001 risk assessment in the changing climatic conditions is an important study area which could be explored using process based modelling the 3 pg model is a monospecific simple freely available and monthly time step stand level pbm landsberg and waring 1997 coops et al 1998 landsberg et al 2001 the 3 pgs model is a modified and spatial version of the 3 pg model coops et al 1998 the 3 pg model was further modified into the 3 pgmix model by forrester and tang 2016 having a small number of new and improved parameters that enable it to predict mixing effects in forests the credit for 3 pg model development goes to landsberg and waring 1997 the 3 pg model is merely a grouping of concepts like radiation use efficiency c balance model partitioning and simple stand nutritional parameters these parameter values are obtained either by direct measurements or by studies available on the species to be parameterized landsberg and waring 1997 xenakis et al 2008 3 pg is a deterministic model which calculates physiological processes like photosynthesis transpiration biomass partitioning to tree parts and litter production coops et al 2009 2011a additionally it provides simulation on the affects of climatic changes forest management practices site attributes impacts on stand growth species interactions biomass dynamics and hydrological impacts on forests coops and waring 2001a landsberg et al 2001 sands and landsberg 2002 stape et al 2004 coops et al 2010 bryars et al 2013 gonzalez benecke et al 2014 forrester et al 2017 meyer et al 2017 2018 xie et al 2017 the 3 pg model is a combination of empirical relations and physiological processes calculated from experimental measurements and field calculations into the c balance model thus it facilitates and reduces both data in terms of its quantity and the complexity in data calculations steps silva et al 2013 the process based 3 pg model bridges the gap between traditional mensuration centered models and complex pbms landsberg et al 2003 2005 zhao et al 2009 so far several pbms have been developed based more or less on physiological principles however simple structure readily obtainable input data and not very high number of parameters mark the 3 pg model a widely used forest growth model the variables generated by the 3 pg model are directly beneficial for forest managers rodríguez

impacts of hydrology and the availability of soil water on the growth of forests species dye 2001 it has been applied to various forest species in different countries such as australia finland brazil canada spain new zealand china south africa and the united states as shown in table 4 while much work has been done on the 3 pg model in plantations it has also performed well in natural forests which tend to be much more complex than plantations therefore the 3 pg model needs to applied on a larger scale and parameterized in natural forests which are the significant c absorbers potithep and yasuoka 2011 the 3 pg 3 pgs model in current form is simple as it works on basic allometric equations and requires a minimal input dataset the delivered outputs show a good correlation between observed and predicted data values the 3 pgpjs vsn 2 7 is the latest version of the 3 pg model available written in visual basic for applications offering greater flexibility to users in operation sands 2010 it can be easily downloaded from the 3 pg official website http 3pg forestry ubc ca 3 pg for excel a recent update of the 3 pgpjs vsn 2 7 is the 3 pgmix model almost identical to 3 pgpjs vsn 2 7 freely available and can be run to provide nearly the same outputs with the same inputs as 3 pgpjs vsn 2 7 the 3 pgmix model can be used for mixed species forests by dividing the population into a small number of age or species cohorts uneven aged forests deciduous species allows different versions of water balance calculations light calculations and includes diameter distributions also the 3 pgmix model includes some of the more recent developments such as the work by wei et al 2014a 2014b to allow stable c isotope data to be used for parameterization the 3 pgmix model is described in detail by forrester and tang 2016 and is freely downloaded from https sites google com site davidforresterssite home projects 3pgmix 3pgmixdownload formerly landsberg and sands 2010 reviewed the 3 pg model in a book chapter the 3 pg process based model in this study we have provided comprehensive coverage of all the major studies on the 3 pg model the objective of this study is to review earlier studies which use 3 pg 3 pgs model and identify the types of applications a simple process based 3 pg model can offer in forest management moreover this study underlines the role and importance of remote sensing gis in the process based 3 pg 3 pgs model the 3 pgmix model a recent modification of the 3 pg model has also been highlighted in this review furthermore we have attempted to introduce the role and need of the 3 pg model in changing climatic conditions to widen the range of model prediction from simple shorter term climatic changes to complex and longer term climatic changes affects on forest ecosystems while the scope of this review is somewhat limited to the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model at the same time it would be of interest to many researchers not only modellers as well as forest managers 2 methods this review paper is reviews extant literature covering the process based 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model fig 2 contains some main references which are helpful in finding out additional literature about the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model we have searched extant literature through the google search engine google scholar research gate and web of science besides the 3 pg homepage http 3pg forestry ubc ca publications listed major references on the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model we have found a major portion of literature on the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model in two elsevier journals one is forest ecology and management and the other is ecological modelling from 1997 to 2017 the total number of publications on the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model and cited in this review is 89 as shown in fig 1 an overview of the 3 pg 3 pgs model its various applications and usefulness is the primary focus of this review we have adopted a straightforward way of reviewing the 3 pg model fig 2 firstly we have provided a general overview and structure of the process based 3 pg 3 pgs model then we have discussed the need of the pbm like the 3 pg model for forest management in the changing climatic conditions after that we have discussed the sensitivity analysis sa and parameterization in the 3 pg 3 pgs model finally we have focused on the application part of the 3 pg 3 pgs model the various studies on the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model and their main findings are shown in table 4 3 need for forest growth modelling in changing climate to understand the global changes taking place in the forests and their services is a complicated task macdicken 2015 climate change is one of the most severe and significant problems that we are facing nowadays it is a great challenge for scientists and researchers to make future predictions about its impacts on the forests ecosystem climate change disturbs forest growth net primary productivity npp forest functions such as c inputs and decomposition rates morison and morecroft 2006 ashraf et al 2015 as well as the distribution of invasive species storkey et al 2014 moreover climate change has the potential to disrupt the entire natural forest ecosystem and transform the old structure of forest ecosystem into a new structure such as from spruce to pine forest forest to savannah ecosystem mendes 2007 forest growth and productivity are hindered by many factors such as deforestation stocking density species composition and competition zhang et al 2015 as well as diameter distribution coomes and allen 2007 macdicken 2015 from 1990 to 2015 a 3 net drop in forest area occurred the total forest area in 2015 was 31 of the global land area or 0 6 ha per individual fao 2015 keenan et al 2015 reducing deforestation would result in an expansion of forest cover which in turn would provide an excellent option for levelling carbon dioxide co2 concentration and mitigating climate change fang et al 2007 kanninen et al 2007 a sufficient modelling approach that estimates forests productivity across regions headlee et al 2013 predicts physiological changes in trees and species shifting measures mechanisms rates and disturbances in ecosystems as well as develop relations among these has been required in the changing climatic conditions turner et al 1995 loehle and leblanc 1996 tilman 1998 scheller and mladenoff 2005 process based modelling can estimate long term growth examine and quantify environmental variables that influence tree growth and also inspects the consequences of stocking and the silvicultural regime on yield according to franklin et al 2016 it is crucial to incorporate the dimension of climatic changes in the growth and productivity prediction models in order to understand the impact of climatic variations on the forest s ecosystem thoroughly forest growth models are basic tools that can be applied in simulating the c dynamics in forests vanderwel et al 2013 jin et al 2016 the reliability of outcomes from forest growth models is severely limited because very few models take account of climate change induced alterations like forest fire hazards extreme events like windstorms and invasion of insects and pathogens further the models used by ecologists to assess the climate change induced impacts on forests and models used by forest managers to determine the forest growth and yield have shown inconsistencies between themselves kirilenko and sedjo 2007 according to seidl et al 2011 we require an integrated modelling approach that integrates environmental disturbances and vegetation physiological processes thus that integrated modelling approach has the predictive ability to address interactions between these inclusions over a wide range of spatiotemporal scales primarily there are three forms of pbms simple physiological complex physiological and hybrid empirical physiological categorized based on complexity among physiological processes jin et al 2016 since the natural system involves complex and incorporated mechanisms of ecosystems pbms offer useful means to understand the complexity and linkages in the functionality of the ecosystem johnsen et al 2001 physiological processes such as photosynthesis are impacted by rising concentration of atmospheric co2 which effectively alters tree growth and productivity thus pbms offer an opportunity to assess the impact of rising co2 concentration on forest s growth productivity and functioning cropper et al 1998 weinstein et al 1998 johnsen et al 2001 it is difficult for any modelling approach to address the entire gamut of complex mechanisms involving interactions between environmental variables growth and the developmental processes in vegetation hence even if all models were to make accurate predictions they would merely simplify reality silva et al 2013 4 the process based model 3 pg modelling is a robust approach to understand the growth dynamics of forests balandier et al 2000 fontes et al 2010 provide a comprehensive explanation of empirical process based and hybrid models for forest management in changing climate environments further they stated that because of wide ranging environmental applicability and outputs pbms are the most versatile the strength of pbms lies in their competency to forecast responses to changing climatic conditions johnsen et al 2001 reviewed the significance of pbms as tools in forest management and discussed the components that need to be enhanced to raise model accuracy and applications according to johnsen et al 2001 pbms intended for research purposes generally require complex and intensive data whereas pbms intended for forest management practices require more straightforward and readily accessible data pretzsch et al 2015a made a comprehensive analysis of forest growth models to examine the growth dynamics in mixed forests according to them out of large number of forest growth models only a few can be suitably adjusted to evaluate the mixing effects of plantations the 3 pg is one such model and it has been adjusted for mixtures in the form of 3 pgmix forrester and tang 2016 forrester et al 2017 pbms can become more complex by increasing the parameter numbers and allometric equations battaglia and sands 1998 thus while accuracy is to be gained by adding more parameters it increases model complexity reducing thereby its simplicity and feasibility johnsen et al 2001 light is a chief driver for ecosystem functioning forrester 2014 its interception by the forest canopy cover plays a vital role in growth and biomass production bai et al 2016 the central concept in the 3 pg model is the conversion of absorbed photosynthetically active radiations apar into npp apar has been calculated from global solar radiations and lai using beer s law utilized apar aparu has been evaluated by reducing apar to an amount determined by environmental modifiers landsberg and waring 1997 these modifiers are temperature ft vapor pressure deficit fvpd frost ff available soil water fasw and soil fr ffr all these growth modifiers lie between zero fully limiting to one not limiting landsberg and waring 1997 coops et al 2001b landsberg and sands 2010 coops et al 2011a 2011b the analyses and quantification of these monthly imposed growth modifiers can offer an understanding of confinements in growth and productivity thus directed forest management strategies towards sustainable production almeida et al 2010 gonzález garcía et al 2015 hung et al 2016 3 pg model offers a comprehensive and integrated modelling framework the primary structure of the 3 pg model is presented in fig 3 mainly consisting of the following five sub models biomass production sub model based on c balance model mcmurtrie and wolf 1983 assimilation and allocation sub model based on fundamental laws and observations mortality and thinning sub model soil water balance sub model management and outputs sub model on multiplying aparu with canopy quantum efficiency it gives gross primary productivity gpp npp is calculated as a fraction of gpp with a constant value of 0 47 0 04 this constant value assumption avoids the requirement to calculate respiration rates waring et al 1998 landsberg et al 2003 this constant ratio is found to be almost equal for various types of forests and for the range of geographical sites and regions waring et al 1998 rodríguez et al 2002 in the second sub model allocation of npp to various parts of the plant or tree such as stems foliages and roots occur tree size influences the partitioning of npp to foliages and stems large tree size means less partitioning to foliages and stems factors such as vapour pressure deficit vpd soil moisture and soil fertility landsberg and waring 1997 sands and landsberg 2002 influence npp partitioning to roots in soil water balance sub model canopy conductance is calculated using a species specific maximum canopy conductance and lai measurements adjusting the values according to the vpd modifier and available soil water content aswc the penman monteith equation allen 2005 has been applied to compute the stand transpiration in the 3 pg model landsberg et al 2003 and the canopy evaporation has been computed by the use of lai canopy interception and the rainfall data stand evapotranspiration can be evaluated by adding canopy evaporation and transpiration aswc is also limited by upper and lower limits and that runoff is included in the calculation in addition to rainfall and evapotranspiration if aswc exceeds its maximum value runoff occurs the difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration gives aswc gonzalez benecke et al 2014 stand density has been adjusted for density dependent mortality using the 3 2 thinning law drew and flewelling 1977 sands and landsberg 2002 bryars et al 2013 stand basal area ba has been calculated from the diameter at breast height dbh and tree density the growth rate of the stand may be tuned to the age of stand to consider the age effect on stand growth mean tree height h has been calculated using a height diameter function gonzalez benecke et al 2014 data was required as an input to initialize the model the major outputs generated from the 3 pg model are shown in table 1 many studies landsberg and waring 1997 coops et al 2001a b 2009 fontes et al 2006 gonzalez benecke et al 2014 2016 hung et al 2016 forrester and tang 2016 meyer et al 2017 have elaborated on the 3 pg model 4 1 parameterization in the 3 pg model accuracy and efficacy of any model majorly depend on estimating the representative parameter value dye 2001 parameterization is the method to delineate the value of species specific parameters and can be assigned using the allometric relationship and tuning the growth modifiers it is important to measure or to obtain from the literature as many parameters as possible and only tune the minimum number of parameters that could not be obtained sands 2004 tuning of parameters may be achieved by adjusting the values of model parameters to give good fit of model output to observed data the 3 pg model may be parameterized for specific species or different genotypes of same species different type of parameters in the 3 pg model is shown in table 2 the 3 pgmix model has an additional number of parameters and allometric equations mainly to allow the prediction of apar by canopies of mixed species forests sands and landsberg 2002 derived values for a set of parameters that provide good fit to stem biomass lai and litterfall across a diverse range of e globulus species landsberg et al 2003 described the procedures for calibration in the 3 pg model and estimated the values of different parameters to best fit for widely ranged forest growth datasets almeida et al 2004a performed the 3 pg model parameterization for e grandis species by applying input parameter values from direct observation default values and by applying the best fit method according to amichev et al 2010 parameterization of the 3 pg model for fast growing hybrid poplar clones walker variety has multiple benefits the most significant benefit includes longer term biomass supply data which could be predictable and accessed by farmland managers along with commercial sector industries that are keen to grow hybrid poplars on cultivated land for the bioenergy production bryars et al 2013 modified various allometric equations of 3 pg to get outputs associated with the observed growth of p taeda species for the calibrated site according to them a generic set of parameters in the 3 pg model increases its effectiveness as an analytical tool to evaluate the growth and yield response to different silvicultural and fertilization regimes some studies suggested that the directly calculated parameters from population of interest and adjustments in default and optional parameters values could improve the performance of the 3 pg model rodríguez suárez et al 2010 adjusted the default values of two 3 pg parameters fullcanage and ns they ranged fullcanage from 3 5 to 7 years default value is 0 and ns ranged from 2 25 to 2 35 default value is 2 4 for e globulus species according to their observations 3 pg exhibited an improved growth prediction on modifying default values of 3 pg parameters fullcanage and ns amaral et al 2006 fontes et al 2006 also applied 3 pg in portugal for the estimation of biomass and volume of e globulus they showed that 3 pg provides improved initial results when default values of parameters alpha and pfs2 were replaced with directly measured values for species under study 4 2 sensitivity analysis complexity and limited knowledge about the ecosystem structure and function cause parameter uncertainty song et al 2013 accuracy in measurements and a better understanding of modelling procedures could reduce the uncertainty of parameters makler pick et al 2011 song et al 2012 2013 sa has been performed to examine the sensitivity of model outputs to input parameters it is related with allometric equations and biophysical processes therefore it offers an approach to understand and improve the 3 pg 3 pgs model variables and to extend the applications of the 3 pg model esprey et al 2004 nightingale et al 2008 zhao et al 2009 fig 2 shows some important studies which have focused on sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of outputs to 3 pg inputs esprey et al 2004 performed a detailed and first inclusive description of sa for the 3 pg model parameters by taking eucalyptus grandis species from 31 sites in south africa which were widely different in climatic and site conditions they performed the sa of stand volume and lai outputs for over twenty four 3 pg input parameters the sensitivity of model outputs to inputs such as monthly mean rainfall and temperature site fertility and maximum aswc was also examined by them wherein they revealed that the 3 pg model outputs like stand volume sv and wr are significantly sensitive to fr almeida et al 2004a performed sa for outputs like dbh water use efficiency wue sv root stem and foliage biomass by variating the values of input parameters a s n s g c x d k g ŋrn a a n d l c x between 20 to 20 and demonstrated that the ouputs like dbh and foliage biomass w f were most affected by these variations in inputs a similar sa was done for 3 pgmix by forrester and tang 2016 which indicated that this modified version had very similar behavior to the 3 pg model amichev et al 2010 made the sensitivity of the 3 pg model outputs to input paramters like topt sla1 specific leaf area for mature leaves fullcanage and minimum asw for hybrid poplar walker and revealed that the predictions of outputs like height h and diameter at breast height dbh are highly sensitive to variations in these inputs song et al 2013 stated that the stand age of vegetation markedly affects the sensitivity values of most of the 3 pg model parameters moreover climatic variations and soil properties are also found to be responsible for fluctuation in the sensitivity values of some of the 3 pg model parameters they described the time dependence sensitivity of the 3 pg model outputs to the 3 pg model inputs further the calculation of the 3 pg model sensitvity of outputs to input parameters only at a single simulation period lu and mohanty 2001 esprey et al 2004 makler pick et al 2011 is somewhat biased and thus they song et al 2013 proposed the time dependent sa which provide much better insights into the structure analysis and performance of the 3 pg model hung et al 2016 also supported the time dependent sa in his study on acacia hybrid at two different simulation ages a study by potithep and yasuoka 2011 on deciduous broadleaf forests in japan varied the range of input parameters between 20 to 20 and observed the affects of these variations on the 3 pg model outputs they found that the 3 pg model outputs are more sensitive to the 3 pg model input parameters α c x t m i n and t o p t than other 3 pg inputs parameters therefore these highly sensitive inputs need more attention for calculating their values in order to improve accuracy in outputs gpp was found to be highly sensitive and positively related with input parameters α c x and t m i n whereas with the input parameter t o p t gpp has shown an inverse relation overall the output gpp derived by potithep and yasuoka 2011 using the 3 pg model was found to be sensitive to each selected and varied input parameter a s n s p 2 p 20 α c x t m i n t o p t ws and wf according to vega nieva et al 2013 the variations in fr values would significantly alter the 3 pg model estimation of forest biomass and productivity therefore they developed a general modelling approach for the prediction of fr from soil profile relative nutrient contents rncs by comparing several general modelling frameworks of fr from rncs sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the 3 pg model outputs to input parameters needs further attention moreover attention also is required on the role of parameters value distributions on the uncertainties and sensitivities of input parameters for the model outputs as well as the affects of site specific data on parameters sensitivities to attain a more unbiased and representative model s sensitivity song et al 2013 4 3 fertility rating fr fertility rating fr is an essential and complicated site specific parameter that relates to the soil fertility to stand productivity subedi et al 2015 fr affects outputs of the 3 pg model moreover fr directly affects the partitioning coefficient m that is used to estimate npp partitioning to roots landsberg and waring 1997 subedi et al 2015 it is a challenging task to determine fr value whereby the fr is labelled as the weakest feature of the 3 pg model in various studies esprey et al 2004 almeida et al 2010 landsberg and sands 2010 bryars et al 2013 lack of knowledge about fr s role in forest growth will inevitably affect the quality of decision making practices based on model outputs both for productivity and management almeida et al 2004a hung et al 2016 several studies such as dye et al 2004 stape et al 2004 fontes et al 2006 paul et al 2007 pérez cruzado et al 2011 vega nieva et al 2013 gonzalez benecke et al 2014 subedi et al 2015 and subedi and fox 2016 have made significant contributions to improve the fr aspect of the 3 pg model 4 4 integration of remote sensing and gis in the 3 pg model remote sensing and gis technology play a remarkable role in the process based forest growth modelling these technologies offer a quick and synoptic view of things assessing the spatio temporal variations in the concerned attributes seen in combination both remote sensing and gis technology have become an important tool for assessing forest biomass at a broad scale kumar et al 2015 kumar and mutanga 2017 advances in geospatial technology and their integration with forest growth models offer promising advantages in forest assessment modelling management and research the 3 pgs model is a spatial version of the 3 pg model which derives results by taking advantages of remote sensing gis technology further there are different types of sensors located on satellites which provide data on a wide range of topographic features and climatic regions on the earth surface this satellite data can then be integrated with pbms like 3 pgs therefore remote sensing gis technology provides a promising opportunity to initialise run and test the model s outputs waring et al 2010 table 3 moreover changes in phenology and the indirect estimation of soil water storage capacity using the relation between soil water balance calculations and seasonal reductions in lai over a vast region spanning decades could be achieved through remote sensing and gis landsberg and waring 1997 development of pbms that works with the combination of remote sensing and gis technology raise the efficiency and measurement from the plot or stand level to a broad regional level and could be compared with estimations derived from remote sensing independently landsberg and waring 1997 coops and waring 2001a used the 3 pgs model to find the primary production of coniferous forest across southwest oregon and obtained r2 of 0 76 standard error se of 1 2 m3 ha 1 yr 1 and p 0 01 between the 3 pgs modelled maximum annual above ground production and predictions made from yield tables nightingale et al 2008 estimated fpar fractional photosynthetically active radiations from ndvi normalized difference vegetation index using noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration and avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer sensors and applied in the 3 pgs model for spatial assessment and growth dynamics of mature old growth australian tropical rainforest bioregion above ground biomass agb prediction from 3 pgs model and ground measurements are significantly correlated coops et al 1998 nightingale et al 2008 six vegetation indices vi are calculated from ten days modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer composite image to calculate the gpp of deciduous broadleaf forest in two sites of japan potithep et al 2009 a study by nolé et al 2009 to estimate the c sequestration in italian forests coupled with the 3 pgs model along with improved soil respiration model show that the 3 pgs model efficiently simulates forest gpp and net ecosystem production nep coops et al 2012a applied an inverse model approach whereby they inverted the 3 pg model to calculate fr and aswc from growth potential laimax using modis imagery at 1 km2 spatial resolution across forest region in western north america imagery generated by remote sensing are useful in spatial prediction of productivity therefore determines the planning and management of resources such as bioenergy production and its distribution ahamed et al 2011 waring et al 2010 briefly described the use of remote sensing and gis technology and their scope and discussed improvements in pbm like the 3 pg 3 pgs model for forest growth they reviewed the 3 pgs model and also discussed satellite sensors which may be suitable for generating information required to run the 3 pgs model table 3 all these abovesaid examples and discussion reveal that remote sensing and gis were widely used and integrated with the 3 pg 3 pgs model for measurements this integrated approach could be further explored in order to improve outputs for forest management in changing the climatic conditions sensors collect data over a range of the electromagnetic spectrum uv and visible range 200 700 nm ir range 700 3000 nm thermal 3 10 mm and microwave range up to 1 m and provide information to define forests with related structural properties nutritional limits on forest growth and interaction of soil properties with stand height that influence above ground net primary productivity nppa waring et al 2010 high resolution imagery is crucial for estimating the variables accurately several types of sensors are designed differing in their resolution power and their ability to describe the characteristics within a process based modelling approach as shown in table 3 sensors having coarse spatial resolution do not provide species level information sinha et al 2015 high resolution imagery is required for that purpose hyperspectral remote sensing is the latest advancement in remote sensing and gis which can be very useful for providing accurate information and quantification at the species level 5 applications of the 3 pg model a wide range of applications have been identified by reviewing literature on 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model table 4 outputs that are generated by the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model are commonly related to forest managers moreover outputs like biomass productivity aswc lai and evapotranspiration are very beneficial in environmental assessments monitoring and research biomass estimation of any forest is a well established scientific attempt which helps in calculating c stock npp and additional biophysical parameters deb et al 2017 vegetation productivity gross and net is a critical biophysical variable which can be evaluated using the 3 pg 3 pgs model this variable recognizes the spatial and temporal distribution of c along with its source sink and cycling which eventually help to understand climate change zhao et al 2012 spatial version 3 pgs of the 3 pg model offers a better opportunity than the standard 3 pg model to evaluate the gpp and npp the 3 pgs model can be more proficient in simulating the above and below ground productivity correctly if there are characteristic parametric values of canopy quantum efficiency α and aswc θ are supplied in the 3 pg model coops et al 2001a lai is also a crucial variable and can be calculated from either a direct method or remote sensing technique lai is useful in the calculation of variables like apar it determines the parameters value along with 3 pg variables fontes et al 2006 lai is useful in the calculation of variables like apar it determines the parameters value along with 3 pg variables fontes et al 2006 coops et al 2005 calculated lai for the 3 pg model from estimated foliage mass and specific leaf area of vegetation according to gonzalez benecke et al 2016 a more realistic lai evaluation has occurred through 3 pg when equations on the seasonal dynamics of needle fall rate introduced in it a successful occurrence of forest species and their productivity over the landscape largely depends on aswc the 3 pg model thereby provides an opportunity to compute species fluctuations and reactions to hydrological changes weltzin et al 2003 mathys et al 2014 the 3 pg model and other pbms are also useful to evaluate the shifts in the distribution of species by identifying seasonal limits on photosynthesis whereby its affects are assessed in the extent of absorbed radiations by the forest canopy cover waring et al 2014 various researchers performed biomass and productivity predictions using 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix table 4 today there is an increasing interest in biodiversity and mixed species plantations however there are often no mixed species plantations to provide empirical information about which species to mix on which sites and which silvicultural methods to employ for their management therefore forrester and tang 2016 to answer these questions developed the 3 pgmix model it can be parameterized using data from monocultures and used to predict the dynamics of mixed forests one of the primary objectives of many modellers appears to be that their models are used in practice by foresters i e not only by researchers battaglia et al 2007 also provided some examples on the 3 pg model for its use as a practical forestry tool 6 conclusion broad acceptance and successful performance of the 3 pg model and its spatial version 3 pgs indicate that the process based 3 pg 3 pgs model has a tremendous predictive ability for forest management along with practical research applications process based modelling can be further useful in simulating co2 induced climatic changes and their potential disturbances in forest ecosystems almeida et al 2009 additionally appropriate hybrid approaches such as the hybridization of the process based 3 pg model and decision tree analysis coops et al 2009 2011b could be useful in predicting the distribution of species offering thorough understanding about the confines of growth and species shifts than purely any empirical approach therefore the applications and performances of the process based model 3 pg could be augmented by coupling with other forest growth models sub models statistical calculations and supplementary methods for estimation of variables for instance coupling the 3 pg model with decision tree model use of inversion method to determine fr and aswc from laimax use of equations to determine unknown inputs and use of the 3 pg model in a gis environment to evaluate outputs at a regional level following the increasing interest in biodiversity and mixed species plantations the 3 pg model was recently modified into the 3 pgmix model and was used to examine the dynamics of mixed forests variability in mixed forests across sites and climates having implications even for silvicultural practices the 3 pgs model predictions could be accurate when high resolution remotely sensed dataset have been applied as an input additionally new advances in remote sensing gis technology such as hyperspectral remote sensing which is to be integrated into process based modelling approach could be advantageous in forestry research the 3 pg 3 pgs model provides a large number of outputs and proper estimations of variables however some features like species specific parameterization poor methods for fr evaluation sensitivity and uncertainty of outputs to input parameters song et al 2013 have required more attention as specified in different studies to establish high accuracy moreover some aspects like light interception calculations open canopies forest structures edge effects growth modifiers biomass allocation water balance calculations site fertility and silvicultural practices in the present form of the 3 pg model use either basic or not fully improved allometric equations for calculation of these aspects besides data unavailability at a large region site conditions and validation of model outputs against independent datasets are some of the issues with the 3 pg model data landsberg and sands 2010 provided some useful insights into some interesting improvement areas of these aspects however they also stated that on introducing various complex equations for improving these aspects the model could lose its simplicity while modifications and improvements in the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model make it a more accurate there s a possibility that the model becomes more complex depending on the modifications in its structure mechanisms and allometric equations on the other hand complexity would restrict the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model only up to the modelling community hence the complex nature of the model cannot be easily operationalized by forest managers as a practical tool for forest management therefore improvements accurateness and maintenance of simplicity and feasibility of the standard 3 pg model its spatial and mixed version are the chief challenges for the 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model developers as mentioned in introduction natural forests play a significant role as a sinker for c emissions therefore there is certainly a need to add other natural and native forest species as well as commercial plantations to parameterize and study under the process based 3 pg 3 pgs 3 pgmix model in our next work we would apply the 3 pg 3 pgs model to investigate the forest growth in india acknowledgements the author wishes to

25102,we address the problem of how to estimate a hypothetical fundamental niche from presence data we do this by a postulating a simple shape for the physiologically defined niche hutchinson s fundamental niche b providing prior information for the estimation of the parameters that define the shape of the niche and c interpreting the results taking into account how the actual observables are conditioned on the existing environmental universe we provide a probabilistic i e bayesian statement of the problem and the posterior distribution for estimating the parameters of fundamental niches as well as software to perform the estimations keywords fundamental niche occurrence data environmental space bayesian model 1 introduction in ecology the term niche has been associated to a very large sometimes contradictory number of meanings chase and leibold 2003 perhaps the most influential niche concept is that of hutchinson 1957 who defined it in terms of combinations of conditions and resources that would enable populations of a species to grow later however hutchinson made the distinction between variables that can be depleted by consumption and those that are conditions for existence i e not consumed by the species population and called the later scenopoetic hutchinson 1978 which are the ones we use in this work hutchinson defined the fundamental niche n f in the absence of biotic interactions as the set of environmental combinations that would lead to a positive growth rate for the population and the realized niche n r as a reduction of the fundamental niche due to the action of competitive interactions that would prevent a species of using available and favorable environmental combinations other factors that can reduce the actual extent of a fundamental niche like dispersal disequilibrium or unavailability of favorable conditions peterson et al 2011 were not considered by hutchinson 1957 after hutchinson 1957 theoretical elaborations of niche very much included the lotka volterra theory of competition leading to a phase that remained in hindsight mostly theoretical empirical niche studies were almost abandoned during the 1980s since the 1990s however estimating scenopoetic niches in a practical way became possible with the advent of three circumstances 1 very large amounts of global climatic data became available at resolutions of 1 km or coarser hijmans et al 2005 2 openly accessible databases of species occurrence data edwards et al 2002 were created and 3 a variety of correlative algorithms were developed that allow extrapolation of points occurrence data to areas distributional ranges of different types on the basis of finding similarities between environments where a species has been detected guisan and zimmermann 2000 franklin 2009 this has led to an explosion in the number of papers published jiménez valverde et al 2008 estimating niches sensu lato it is quite puzzling then to realize that there is still some debate about what exactly these correlative algorithms estimate elith and graham 2009 most people believe that the output of correlative algorithms estimate something related to the realized niche and that estimating the fundamental niche is impossible without physiological data kearney and porter 2004 kearney 2006 soberón 2007 which is in general time consuming and expensive to obtain mostly relatively to the ease at what correlative modeling of realized niches can be done although strictly speaking estimating fundamental niches requires experimental data some clarifications on the types of multivariate sets representing niches suggest ways for defining models that produce good estimates of the fundamental niche without necessarily resorting to expensive and time consuming physiological experiments in this paper we discuss this problem and present a method for estimating a fundamental niche using presence data supplemented with physiological data we highlight the issue that presence data is normally biased and we examine how the relationship between the sampled realized niche and the fundamental niche influences how well the fundamental niche can be estimated our approach uses bayesian inference and this means that a priori information about niche axes may be incorporated when available and a priori and a posteriori statements are inherently probabilistic 1 1 a hierarchy of niches we begin by restating the relationships between three niche concepts soberón and peterson 2011a b peterson and soberón 2012 the first is n f the fundamental niche hutchinson 1957 which is defined by physiological limits to environmental conditions and represents the tolerance of a species to ranges of environmental variables if there is a function of environmental space to fitness the level surface of such function for a value interpretable as minimum survivorship constitutes the border of the fundamental niche in symbols if e is the multidimensional space of environmental variables f x is the fitness function given by f x e r and k is the threshold above which the fitness is enough as to support a population then n f x e f x k notice that equality to k defines the border of the fundamental niche points inside correspond to suitable environments there are reasons to think that n f is likely to have a simple shape merow et al 2014 such as a convex set since there appears to be no reason to expect good extreme tolerances and bad intermediate ones drake 2015 therefore several authors have assumed that the fitness function should be bell shaped which means that for a given fitness threshold for instance k 1 n f may be modelled as an ellipsoid in multivariate space maguire 1973 brown 1984 maguire 1973 brown 1984 the very little available empirical evidence is consistent with this idea birch 1953 haefner 1969 hooper et al 2008 on the other hand physiological evidence suggests that tolerance limits could be non symmetric austin and gaywood 1994 angilletta 2009 brewer et al 2016 and therefore fundamental niches cannot be strictly ellipsoidal in this work we begin by assuming an ellipsoidal shape for the fundamental niche which produces a model based on a multivariate normal distribution that is easily generalized into a non symmetrical model there are also good theoretical reasons and empirical evidence to suppose that n f is relatively conserved evolutionarily speaking holt and gomulkiewicz 1997 peterson 2011 however certain non evolutionary factors that can distort the simple convex shape of n f should be taken into account one important distorting factor is the case where not all possible conditions favorable for a species actually exist this was noticed in passing by hutchinson 1957 and later highlighted by green 1971 who coined the term available niche for those conditions in the fundamental niche that were actually available jackson and overpeck 2000 used the term potential niche for the same set and finally peterson et al 2011 used existing niche which is the terminology we will follow if the niche is modeled using mainly climatic variables in some region g then it is the configuration of changing climate e t g where t represents time intersected with the n f which will produce the existing niche denoted as n t g in other words n t g is the set of favorable conditions actually existing in a given region of space at some point in time colwell and futuyma 1971 finally n t g can be further modified by interactions with competitors hutchinson 1957 other negative interactors peterson 2011 and by dispersal limitations colwell and rangel 2009 to yield the perhaps reduced and distorted realized niche n r t g the above is expressed in the following inequality and in fig 1 soberón and arroyo peña 2017 1 n f n f e t g n t g n r t g any observations of species occurrences in the field assuming no errors in taxonomy or spatial georeference will come from inside the set n r t g the blue points in fig 1 and an important problem is to understand to what extent and by what methods such data can be used to estimate the sets n r t g n t g and n f this is the field of ecological niche modeling enm in a strict sense peterson et al 2011 notice that the notation we are using suggests that the fundamental niche being a physiological property of a species may be invariant to time and space transformations niche conservatism whereas the existing and the realized are relative to a time and spatial region estimation of the niches is interesting in itself but since niches can be projected into geographic space using gis tools species distribution models sdms can be created guisan and zimmermann 2000 these are extremely valuable in many applications as well as in basic macroecology and biogeography peterson et al 2011 this is the field of correlative sdm correlative niche algorithms are regularly used as sdms or enms without stating explicitly a theoretical shape of n f nor any a priori information about it some exceptions are brewer et al 2016 and drake 2015 and using the cloud of points e t g only as background to contrast the observations like in maxent elith et al 2011 merow et al 2013 or in some other specialized algorithms doledec et al 2000 hirzel et al 2002 therefore in the enm literature the distinctions regarding different niches and their different shapes is seldom made a result is that when correlative niche models are projected geographically to get sdms these are estimates of regions which are in between the occupied and the potential distribution jiménez valverde et al 2008 sometimes they may even coincide kearney et al 2010 but it is seldom the case that the point is even raised 1 2 estimation of different niches in the fields of enm mostly in its correlative version guisan and zimmermann 2000 estimating n r t g is the objective or the occupied area if performing sdm the data that can be used for the estimation of n r t g are observations of the species over g and its corresponding sets of spatially defined climatic covariates guisan and zimmermann 2000 franklin 2009 since the realized niche has been affected by a variety of very different filtering processes its final shape may be a rather complex and convoluted subset of the swarm of points that belong to the fundamental niche merow et al 2014 thus assuming a specific shape for the realized niche may be inappropriate correlative enm is performed using any among a large variety of methods franklin 2009 and it has been widely assumed that a good algorithm should be capable of fitting complex and convoluted forms characteristic of n r t g elith and graham 2009 when true absences in environmental space are available and unbiased it is assumed that the fit to the realized niche may be quite good franklin 2009 but in any case correlative enm probably seldom estimates objects close to the n f on the other hand strictly speaking the estimation of n f requires mechanistic first principle biophysics kearney and porter 2004 or experimental methods buckley 2008 however based on the logical relationship showed in 1 we propose a rigorous statistical framework for estimating the fundamental niche n f for this purpose we shall use besides the occurrence points and the climatic covariates a hypothesis regarding the shape of the fundamental niche and a priori information about the parameters of such shape by adding these two factors we expect to estimate an object that better represents a fundamental niche than what conventional niche modeling does by applying our approach to virtual species we explore some scenarios that hinder estimating the theoretical fundamental niche we also show that adding physiological priors create a difference from conventional niche models using only occurrences 2 methods 2 1 assumptions and modeling first we assume that n f has a simple convex form in the multivariate space defined by the climatic covariates that are of interest for the species in this we follow maguire 1973 drake 2015 and brown 1984 and some scant empirical data birch 1953 haefner 1969 green 1971 hooper et al 2008 a simple and manageable convex shape is an ellipsoid thus we assume that an ellipsoid that comes from a bell shaped fitness function would provide an estimate of n f two parameters define such an ellipsoid a centroid and a covariance matrix these two parameters would define a multivariate normal distribution as a model of the fitness function instead of attempting to give the fitness function some hypothetical units we will simply use a gaussian density function and specific level curves and assume that the closer an environmental combination is to the mean of the gaussian density the higher the chances of making an observation of an individual second prior information about the centroid and variances of the multivariate normal distribution is sometimes available for instance the range of tolerance for some variables usually temperature is now available for thousands of species sunday et al 2011 bennett et al 2018 we propose to use physiological tolerance ranges that come from experiments as prior data to inform the shape of n f we will use a bayesian approach to include this a priori information in the model critical temperatures from laboratory experiments are not easy to compare to climatic data because temperatures that individuals experience in the field may not correlate well with macroclimate kennedy 1997 this can be solved by parameterizing macro to micro climate models kearney et al 2014 unfortunately this is also very data demanding and for most regions of the world inapplicable however many macroecological i e coarse spatial resolution patterns are assumed to be the result of interactions between macroclimate and physiology chown et al 2004 bozinovic et al 2011 moreover some recent studies document positive correlations between environmental temperature and physiological thermal limits calosi et al 2007 pörtner and knust 2007 araújo et al 2013 barve et al 2014 gouveia et al 2014 and therefore we are assuming that it is possible to use such laboratory obtained limits of tolerances to inform priors in our approach we are very aware to the fact that behavior and habitat structure may complicate the relationship between physiological limits of tolerance as measured in the laboratory for instance by extending the capacity to tolerate extremes beyond laboratory ranges de frenne et al 2013 bozinovic and naya 2015 ortega garcia et al 2017 essentially this is a problem of linking processes at very contrasting spatiotemporal scales the problem of relating processes occurring at contrasting scales permeates ecology levin 1992 and only empirical experience will show whether our approach is valuable or not third we define a reference region of the world called g barve et al 2011 and we build our model taking into account the shape of its multivariate climate space e t g the data we use to estimate niches are occurrences of the species in a smaller geographical space called m that can be projected into climatic space by assigning measurements of the corresponding climatic covariates the region m represents the geographical region that is accessible to the species peterson et al 2011 under this framework our objective is to calculate the posterior distribution for the parameters of a hypothetical fundamental niche the resulting expression for the posterior comes from 1 assuming an ellipsoidal shape for the niche and 2 the addition of a priori information for the centroid and variances describing the niche the information provided by the shape of the climatic space e will be used mostly for interpretation again although we are attempting to estimate a fitness function we will simply use the probability density that can be converted into a fitness function by multiplication by the appropriate factor in fitness units 2 2 statistical model we now proceed to transform the heuristics described above to a rigorous procedure to estimating the hypothetical fundamental niche n f we assume that the environmental space e t g has d dimensions one for each environmental covariate affecting the species thus each point in e t g is a combination of d environmental measurements denoted by x i x i 1 x i d and it represents a sample unit where the species can be observed at each environmental combination x i it is assumed that the species will have a fitness proportional to the distance from x i to an optimum value which is the centroid of the ellipsoid austin 1999 martínez meyer et al 2013 osorio olvera et al 2016 specifically we define the probability of detecting the species in a site with environmental features x i using unbiased methods and the sufficient amount of time through a multivariate normal density with mean vector μ and covariance matrix σ 2 f 1 x i μ σ 2 π d 2 σ 1 2 e 1 2 x i μ t σ 1 x i μ the multivariate normal model is easily generalized to a skewed normal distribution if looking for further flexibility beyond what an ellipsoid niche model can offer the skewed normal distribution involves the incorporation of extra parameters in the model one for each dimension that leads to a richer and reasonable class of niche distributions see appendix b notice that eq 2 does not take into account any restriction about the existing climatic combinations but the irregular shape of e t g suggests that eventually this must be taken into consideration since it creates a very non uniform sampling space the set of available climate combinations constitutes a mask for the environmental space that suggests transforming the multivariate normal distribution into a discrete probability distribution defined at every point in e t g 3 f 2 x i μ σ e 1 2 x i μ t σ 1 x i μ y e t g e 1 2 y μ t σ 1 y μ 1 x i e t g the denominator is a normalizing constant ensuring that f 2 x i μ σ adds up to one over all x i in e t g and the indicator function 1 x i e t g guarantees that the occurrences of the species really exists in the available environmental space suppose that the data consists of n independent occurrences of the species of interest the set of environmental combinations where the species has been observed is denoted by d x 1 x n where x i is a vector of length d that contributes to the likelihood function with its density value f 2 x i μ σ thus the likelihood and the log likelihood functions for the parameters of interest μ σ given the set of occurrences have the following expressions respectively 4 ℒ μ σ d i 1 n e 1 2 x i μ t σ 1 x i μ y e t g e 1 2 y μ t σ 1 y μ 1 x i e t g 5 l μ σ d 1 2 i 1 n x i μ t σ 1 x i μ n log y e t g e 1 2 y μ t σ 1 y μ additional information about the centroid and variances describing the niche may be available for the species this information usually comes from physiological experiments recording biological performance for a gradient of environmental conditions sunday et al 2011 from these type of experiments we obtain some idea of what the range of tolerance is for each environmental variable relevant to describing the fundamental niche here we propose a bayesian approach to incorporate the information provided by the tolerance ranges as a priori distributions for the parameters of interest μ σ the posterior distribution for the parameters of the hypothetical fundamental niche will be obtained by combining the priors and the likelihood function as described in eq 4 6 f μ σ d e t g ℒ μ σ d g 1 μ μ 0 σ 0 g 2 σ 1 α w where g 1 μ μ 0 σ 0 is a multivariate normal distribution with mean μ 0 and covariance matrix σ 0 and g 2 σ 1 α w is a wishart distribution with parameters α and w jackson et al 2011 since much of the physiological experiments provide only ranges of tolerance for a single environmental variable sunday et al 2011 we use the method suggested by hozo et al hozo et al 2005 to estimate means and variances from the range of a random sample which are then used to define the parameters of the a priori distributions μ 0 σ 0 w the posterior distribution therefore becomes the objective function of the analysis since it comprises all the information about the parameters that describe the fundamental niche μ σ we use an mcmc algorithm called t walk christen and fox 2010 to generate a number m of simulations from the posterior the set of m draws provides posterior values of the mean μ and the covariance matrix σ which can be used to construct ellipsoids and to calculate metrics reflecting the uncertainty in the estimated parameters 2 3 virtual species and simulations in general terms real occurrence data can only give a partial understanding of the fundamental niche of a species hirzel et al 2001 factors such as dispersal barriers or interspecific competition may introduce biases in the samples that are not easy to assess guisan and thuiller 2005 another important complex factor is behavior individuals of a species may expand the range of physiologically defined tolerable conditions by actively searching for refuges or simply by changing their conduct ortega garcia et al 2017 however these spatial behavioral and ecological factors add complexity to the problem of disentangling the fundamental niche of real species using only occurrence data therefore working with virtual species has a big advantage since the true parameters that represent a fundamental niche are completely controlled the resulting estimations from different scenarios can be accurately compared to the true model in order to determine under which circumstances we get a good estimation of the fundamental niche we generated four virtual species each one corresponding to a theoretical fundamental niche and a hypothetical spatial restriction fig 2 for the n f the set of parameters μ σ was completely determined in advance the spatial restriction was established a posteriori inspecting the actual projection of environmental conditions in the map and attempting to establish reasonably large and connected regions of similar environmental conditions although virtual species are used to analyze the method environmental data are real for both the occurrence points d and the environmental space e t g represented with gray points in fig 2b we used two layers of environmental variables the mean annual temperature bio1 in celsius scale multiplied by 10 and the accumulated annual precipitation bio12 in mm both obtained from the worldclim database with a resolution of 1 km hijmans et al 2005 we scaled each environmental layer and used the scaled data for the rest of the analysis a set of 20 000 points inside the americas were randomly selected and recorded as latitude longitude pairs then we matched each point with its environmental measurements ending with a matrix of four columns two coordinates and two environmental values and 20 000 rows the latitude longitude values are drawn in fig 2a using an ordinary geographical representation while its projection in e t g corresponds to points in a space whose axes are standardized environmental variables fig 2 b therefore each point drawn in geographical space match with exactly one of the points in environmental space and vice versa a fundamental niche n f is represented here by the contour line that correspond to the 95 probability level of a bivariate normal distribution we first chose the values of a single covariance matrix σ f and then a set of four two dimensional vectors μi as their centroids the vectors μ i together with the matrix σ f generate four theoretical fundamental niches and give rise to different ecological scenarios each one representing a different species since the covariance matrix is the same for all four species the contour lines of its fundamental niches look the same but they are placed around different centroids fig 2b shows the 95 contour lines ellipses in each case the points inside these ellipses were drawn with different colors and projected back into the geographical space notice that when projected into geographical space g the points inside the ellipses no longer have a regular shape and some points that are close to each other in the environmental space are no longer close in geographical space this is the second part of the definition of the virtual species a connected spatial restriction for all the possible favorable environments as shown in fig 2 furthermore because of the irregular shape of the environmental space e t g the number of points inside the theoretical fundamental niches ellipses is different for each species we think of the sets of points projected to geographical space as the potential locations where a species can be present a potential distribution map we used the four different distribution maps to simulate the sampling of occurrence points in the field first we selected regions m i soberón and peterson 2005 in g encompassing subsets of the geographic projections in fig 2 a these sub regions are represented with rectangles of different colors for each species since the potential distribution map covers a broad area inside the americas composed by different disconnected subsets by using the sub regions m i we arbitrarily model geographic barriers furthermore as an expert would do in the field we focus on the areas where the species is known to exist since the entire potential distribution map is unknown after selecting m i we randomly picked occurrence points inside this sub region until a targeted sample size was reached we used these sets of points as our virtual samples to analyze the cases in which the fundamental niche can be recovered from the sample when we apply our proposed model for each species we obtained 20 different replicates of size n 50 we include one of the sets of 20 samples from species c highlighted in blue in fig 2 in appendix a we defined artificial tolerance ranges for each of the axes in environmental space and for each species in order to define the parameters of the a priori distributions for μ and σ these tolerance ranges have rectangular shapes yellow rectangles in fig 2b meaning that no information regarding the correlation among climatic variables is available a priori thus the values of μ 0 and the diagonal elements of σ 0 were defined through the minimum and maximum values of the tolerances see hozo et al 2005 and the off diagonal elements of σ 0 were set as zeros since no information about the covariances between environmental variables is given in the case of the wishart distribution α was fixed equal to 2 and w was defined as a the product of α and σ 0 1 using the replicated samples from the virtual species and the prior distributions defined we ran simulations from each of the posterior distributions by running a t walk in r christen and fox 2010 for each case each of the four species and all of the 20 replicates we ran the mcmc algorithm until reaching 7000 iterations in total after discarding the first 2000 values burn in time and from the remaining set of 5000 values we kept only those separated by 200 iterations thinning to avoid correlation among nearby simulations then we ended up with m 26 simulations from the posterior that were later used to explore the uncertainty about the parameters of interest after simulating from the corresponding posterior distributions we calculated the maximum a posteriori values map s for each sample namely μ ˆ and σ ˆ the map s are the values of μ and σ generated by the mcmc algorithm that provide the highest value of the posterior among all the k simulations of these parameters with the map s we calculated an index of overlap between the theoretical fundamental niche the 95 probability ellipse produced with parameters μ i and σ f and the fitted ellipsoid the 95 probability ellipse with parameters μ ˆ and σ ˆ we used the jaccard similarity index whose values range from 0 to 1 legendre and legendre 1998 to measure the overlap between the two ellipses the greater the index value the more similar the ellipses and vice versa meaning a better estimation of the fundamental niche moreover to make the most of our probabilistic bayesian approach for niche inference for each simulated sample from the posterior distribution after burn in and thinning we created an uncertainty plot for the ellipses for each simulation we plotted the corresponding normal distribution choosing the concentric ellipses at the first quartile a median b and upper quartile c the pixels between a and b were plotted in dark red the pixels between b and c in yellow and inside c in white that is at each simulated value a simple three level heatmap color palette with an alpha transparency level is used to plot the normal distribution when adding all the simulations on the same plot we obtain a sense of uncertainty in the inferred niche beyond the above explained point estimates thus representing the full posterior distribution in our inference see for example fig 4 3 results our method varies in its capacity to calculate the original hypothetical n f the median overlap between the theoretical and the 20 fitted ellipses ranged from slightly above 40 for species a to near 80 for species d fig 3 the high similarity values obtained for species d indicates that the theoretical fundamental niche and the estimated niche are very similar for most of the samples however we only recovered 78 of the theoretical fundamental niche in the best case the similarity values that we got for species b and c are similar in both cases we recover near to 50 of the theoretical niche the lowest overlap values are observed in species a meaning that in this case the theoretical fundamental niche is not well recovered another way of displaying the result is by comparing the simulations from the posterior distribution to the theoretical n f this is shown in fig 4 for one of the samples from species a left panel and one sample from species d right panel for species a where the overlap between the ellipses from the posterior distribution and the original n f is worse the points in the sample are biased towards the upper left part of the n f this bias is due to i the very non uniform structure of the space e t g and ii the fact that we selected a sub region m a where the samples were taken both the shape of the space e t g and the projection of m a into environmental space will bias sampling the niche in such case the estimated niche is then closer to the realized niche n r t g on the other hand for species d the overlap between the original n f and the ellipses from the posterior distribution is high this is due to i the fact that the fundamental niche of species d is located in a region of the environmental space with high density of points in e t g and ii the corresponding sub region m d allows for sampling all the niche thus in this case the estimation of the fundamental niche is better finally in the supplementary materials we show 1 results of maxent models with the same occurrence data but without prior information to compare them with our bayesian approach adding the priors clearly affects the results and 2 results of five real species for which prior information in two dimensions is available to illustrate some of the difficulties of applying the method to real species 4 discussion using ellipsoids as niche models is not a new thing green 1974 carnes and slade 1982 farber and kadmon 2003 jackson et al 2011 swanson et al 2015 qiao et al 2016 what is new in the approach we present is 1 we are explicitly using the ellipses as models for the fundamental niche n f fully aware that the realized niche probably has a complex shape that requires other approaches to be modelled austin et al 1990 elith and graham 2009 blonder et al 2014 2 we propose a bayesian argument to add a priori ideally experimental information about the fundamental niche 3 we present a likelihood function that represents the assumptions of the model and finally 4 we are explicit in our definitions of the fundamental the existing and the realized niches in terms of their relationships eq 1 our theoretical emphasis on distinguishing types of niches likely with very contrasting geometries is one of the major points of our contribution how approximate then are the calculations of our method to a true fundamental niche for real species the fundamental niche is a concept and thus there is no truth in its estimation however it is reasonable to ask how consistent the results of an estimation to the features of the concept are our method aims to estimate a convex object surrounding observations samples of the realized niche modified by the a priori information and subject to the ellipsoidal or approximately ellipsoidal shape appendix and therefore it makes sense to ask about the proportion of points inside the estimated shape and how congruent the shape is to the prior information a discussion of this is presented in the supplementary materials section in terms of how consistent are the observations and the priors we are fully aware of the preliminary nature of our results and discussion this is a complicated topic that will be explored further in the future now in the virtual species case we do have a true fundamental niche of some sort how well the software is capable of estimating it in the results section we showed the proportion of overlap between the calculated and the known true ellipsoid shape representing the fundamental niche fig 3 shows that for some species d the algorithm can recapture around 75 of the original n f why does species d get uniformly better results we attribute species d getting estimations closer to the fundamental niche to the fact that the sampling points of this species are inside of a cloud of points in e t g that can be well sampled inside the sub region m d whereas the other species sampling points are all in the periphery of the cloud of existing environmental points or are biased after limiting the sampling space to m this means that for some hypothetical species a and c for instance the sampling points may occupy biased regions inside the n f ellipsoids with priors being shifted away from the observations although this may appear to be a problem with the design of the virtual species we assert that it provides an important and probably unappreciated insight indeed n f is a quantity defined experimentally by the physiology of a species either the ellipsoids which are the theoretical models of the contour lines from the fitness function or the yellow rectangles that represent experimental information are independent of what conditions actually exist in a region at a time colwell and rangel 2009 on the other hand the sampling points come from populations in geographic space these populations are the result of a complex of processes that include physiological tolerance but also climate availability which changes in time the results of interactions with other species and the presence of barriers or dispersal disequilibrium peterson et al 2011 behavior and habitat heterogenity therefore geographic samples may or may not be good samples of the actual physiological requirements of a species although should be contained in them soberón and arroyo peña 2017 as we see in fig 2 the geographic points may provide an extremely biased sample of the space inside the ellipsoids in terms of eq 1 the only direct information about n f the object to estimate comes from the prior data the georeferenced occurrence points when projected into environmental space are distorted by the shape of e t g and in our case by modelling geographic barriers we do not model the effects of biotic interactions in this paper therefore samples taken from the shape n r t g the realized niche may include these severe biases that might even be considered as truncated samples if some environmental combinations do not exist this may not be a problem when the objective is to model the environment of occurrences realized niches but it is certainly a problem when modeling a fundamental niche one important practical lesson from this is that our method as presented here should not be applied in the case that observational points come from the periphery or from sparsely populated regions of the environmental space something that may be assessed visually including the form of e t g is a very important part of the problem of niche modeling this has been recognized since the beginnings of niche studies colwell and futuyma 1971 and it is part of some enm algorithms like maxent elith et al 2011 or enfa hirzel et al 2002 these two methods explicitly include the shape of e t g in their algorithms however it is also probably true that the shape of e t g is mostly ignored at the time of interpreting results and the far reaching consequences of the fact that first the shape of e t g is extremely irregular and second it changes in time and space is just beginning to be taken into account soberón and peterson 2011a 2011b broennimann et al 2012 petitpierre et al 2012 guisan et al 2014 saupe et al 2017 in our case including the effects of the shape of e t g on the bias that is induced into the sampling points is still work in progress brewer et al 2016 presented a plausible plateau method including a priori information to fit a parametric shape that can be regarded as a truncated cone this shape is biologically realistic when referring to the fundamental biological requirements although not necessarily for a realized niche see above the main argument to prefer the shape of a frustum to a multivariate bell shaped curve is a valid one symmetric response curves are less realistic that asymmetric ones 1992 araújo et al 2013 however as we show in appendix b it is easy to modify our method to include non symmetric normal niche functions and the basic likelihood equation remains valid brewer et al 2016 use presence absence data but in our approach we use presence only data peterson et al 2011 we suspect that in practice both methods presented with presence only data which brewer et al 2016 claim can be used with their plateau method and the same a priori information will yield similar estimates of a n f this is a test for the future however the problem as we see it is more than a mere statistical fitting exercise because in our approach we are specifically assuming a shape for the n f an interpretation in terms of fitness and in terms of the form of the environmental space and the existence of spatial limitations to the regions where points can be sampled these are issues of interpretation and the next steps in our research aim to test the method using data from real species and include explicitly the shape of e g t and of the spatial limitations in the definition of the likelihood function using real species add a number of decisions and complications see supplementary materials about whether physiological details matter and in what ways ectothermy endothermy body mass aquatic vs terrestrial habitat however it is only using real data that the validity and usefulness of the insights derived from virtual species will be assessed finally some words about why it is important to estimate n f rather than simply to characterize in environmental space some set of observations which is what most of enm do first n f is what evolves in the sense that their limits are subject to natural selection in populations holt and gomulkiewicz 1997 and thus it is also what is conserved or not after speciation events peterson et al 1999 peterson 2011 if a reliable hypothesis about the shape of n f could be proposed it would be possible to create a parametric evolutionary model for n f second interpreting results of enm analyses would be much more straightforward if a convex shape could be assumed in particular transfers of enms to other sets of conditions would be far more robust and straightforward peterson 2003 additionally transferring predictions of enms to climate conditions that are not represented in or near the species present day range depends on good estimates of n f and as such interpretation of enms is presently limited to conditions represented on the area across which the model was calibrated vanderwal et al 2009 owens et al 2013 estimating the n f is thus of theoretical and practical importance and what we present here is an attempt to a practical methodology to getting close to it with reasonably available data acknowledgements j s was supported by the nsf grant abi 1458640 j a c

blue points the gray points represent the existing climatic combinations in e t g and the blue ellipse is the representation of the fundamental niche for species c fig a1 appendix b skew multivariate normal distribution looking for further flexibility beyond what an ellipse niche distribution model can offer we propose to use a skew normal distribution that is taken as a generalization of the conventional gaussian distribution this skew normal distribution produces intensity level sets that are 1 connected 2 convex and 3 possibly asymmetric see left panel in fig b1 the bidimensional skew normal is defined as follows f x μ σ β 2 π 1 σ 1 2 e 1 2 x μ t σ 1 x μ φ x 1 μ 1 σ 1 β 1 x 2 μ 2 σ 2 β 2 where x x 1 x 2 t μ μ 1 μ 2 t β β 1 β 2 t and φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution one dimensional therefore we only need to multiply the φ term in the conventional normal model it is important that the skewness parameter be restricted a priori to the interval 2 2 otherwise we obtain undesired extreme skewness commonly we set β n 0 u 0 i 2 x 2 choosing u 0 such that β 1 β 2 2 2 with 0 99 probability an added difficulty is that μ is not equal to the center of mass of the skew normal as it is the case with the conventional gaussian additional care needs to be accounted for when coding the prior distribution and other technical details but inference is viable and not much more complex that with the above mentioned gaussian further technical details may be found in soto galindo 2016 the result is that niche estimation has richer forms as seen in the corresponding uncertainty plot in the right panel of fig b1 the biological adequacy and soundness of this generalization are still to be thoroughly discussed and is left for future

25102,we address the problem of how to estimate a hypothetical fundamental niche from presence data we do this by a postulating a simple shape for the physiologically defined niche hutchinson s fundamental niche b providing prior information for the estimation of the parameters that define the shape of the niche and c interpreting the results taking into account how the actual observables are conditioned on the existing environmental universe we provide a probabilistic i e bayesian statement of the problem and the posterior distribution for estimating the parameters of fundamental niches as well as software to perform the estimations keywords fundamental niche occurrence data environmental space bayesian model 1 introduction in ecology the term niche has been associated to a very large sometimes contradictory number of meanings chase and leibold 2003 perhaps the most influential niche concept is that of hutchinson 1957 who defined it in terms of combinations of conditions and resources that would enable populations of a species to grow later however hutchinson made the distinction between variables that can be depleted by consumption and those that are conditions for existence i e not consumed by the species population and called the later scenopoetic hutchinson 1978 which are the ones we use in this work hutchinson defined the fundamental niche n f in the absence of biotic interactions as the set of environmental combinations that would lead to a positive growth rate for the population and the realized niche n r as a reduction of the fundamental niche due to the action of competitive interactions that would prevent a species of using available and favorable environmental combinations other factors that can reduce the actual extent of a fundamental niche like dispersal disequilibrium or unavailability of favorable conditions peterson et al 2011 were not considered by hutchinson 1957 after hutchinson 1957 theoretical elaborations of niche very much included the lotka volterra theory of competition leading to a phase that remained in hindsight mostly theoretical empirical niche studies were almost abandoned during the 1980s since the 1990s however estimating scenopoetic niches in a practical way became possible with the advent of three circumstances 1 very large amounts of global climatic data became available at resolutions of 1 km or coarser hijmans et al 2005 2 openly accessible databases of species occurrence data edwards et al 2002 were created and 3 a variety of correlative algorithms were developed that allow extrapolation of points occurrence data to areas distributional ranges of different types on the basis of finding similarities between environments where a species has been detected guisan and zimmermann 2000 franklin 2009 this has led to an explosion in the number of papers published jiménez valverde et al 2008 estimating niches sensu lato it is quite puzzling then to realize that there is still some debate about what exactly these correlative algorithms estimate elith and graham 2009 most people believe that the output of correlative algorithms estimate something related to the realized niche and that estimating the fundamental niche is impossible without physiological data kearney and porter 2004 kearney 2006 soberón 2007 which is in general time consuming and expensive to obtain mostly relatively to the ease at what correlative modeling of realized niches can be done although strictly speaking estimating fundamental niches requires experimental data some clarifications on the types of multivariate sets representing niches suggest ways for defining models that produce good estimates of the fundamental niche without necessarily resorting to expensive and time consuming physiological experiments in this paper we discuss this problem and present a method for estimating a fundamental niche using presence data supplemented with physiological data we highlight the issue that presence data is normally biased and we examine how the relationship between the sampled realized niche and the fundamental niche influences how well the fundamental niche can be estimated our approach uses bayesian inference and this means that a priori information about niche axes may be incorporated when available and a priori and a posteriori statements are inherently probabilistic 1 1 a hierarchy of niches we begin by restating the relationships between three niche concepts soberón and peterson 2011a b peterson and soberón 2012 the first is n f the fundamental niche hutchinson 1957 which is defined by physiological limits to environmental conditions and represents the tolerance of a species to ranges of environmental variables if there is a function of environmental space to fitness the level surface of such function for a value interpretable as minimum survivorship constitutes the border of the fundamental niche in symbols if e is the multidimensional space of environmental variables f x is the fitness function given by f x e r and k is the threshold above which the fitness is enough as to support a population then n f x e f x k notice that equality to k defines the border of the fundamental niche points inside correspond to suitable environments there are reasons to think that n f is likely to have a simple shape merow et al 2014 such as a convex set since there appears to be no reason to expect good extreme tolerances and bad intermediate ones drake 2015 therefore several authors have assumed that the fitness function should be bell shaped which means that for a given fitness threshold for instance k 1 n f may be modelled as an ellipsoid in multivariate space maguire 1973 brown 1984 maguire 1973 brown 1984 the very little available empirical evidence is consistent with this idea birch 1953 haefner 1969 hooper et al 2008 on the other hand physiological evidence suggests that tolerance limits could be non symmetric austin and gaywood 1994 angilletta 2009 brewer et al 2016 and therefore fundamental niches cannot be strictly ellipsoidal in this work we begin by assuming an ellipsoidal shape for the fundamental niche which produces a model based on a multivariate normal distribution that is easily generalized into a non symmetrical model there are also good theoretical reasons and empirical evidence to suppose that n f is relatively conserved evolutionarily speaking holt and gomulkiewicz 1997 peterson 2011 however certain non evolutionary factors that can distort the simple convex shape of n f should be taken into account one important distorting factor is the case where not all possible conditions favorable for a species actually exist this was noticed in passing by hutchinson 1957 and later highlighted by green 1971 who coined the term available niche for those conditions in the fundamental niche that were actually available jackson and overpeck 2000 used the term potential niche for the same set and finally peterson et al 2011 used existing niche which is the terminology we will follow if the niche is modeled using mainly climatic variables in some region g then it is the configuration of changing climate e t g where t represents time intersected with the n f which will produce the existing niche denoted as n t g in other words n t g is the set of favorable conditions actually existing in a given region of space at some point in time colwell and futuyma 1971 finally n t g can be further modified by interactions with competitors hutchinson 1957 other negative interactors peterson 2011 and by dispersal limitations colwell and rangel 2009 to yield the perhaps reduced and distorted realized niche n r t g the above is expressed in the following inequality and in fig 1 soberón and arroyo peña 2017 1 n f n f e t g n t g n r t g any observations of species occurrences in the field assuming no errors in taxonomy or spatial georeference will come from inside the set n r t g the blue points in fig 1 and an important problem is to understand to what extent and by what methods such data can be used to estimate the sets n r t g n t g and n f this is the field of ecological niche modeling enm in a strict sense peterson et al 2011 notice that the notation we are using suggests that the fundamental niche being a physiological property of a species may be invariant to time and space transformations niche conservatism whereas the existing and the realized are relative to a time and spatial region estimation of the niches is interesting in itself but since niches can be projected into geographic space using gis tools species distribution models sdms can be created guisan and zimmermann 2000 these are extremely valuable in many applications as well as in basic macroecology and biogeography peterson et al 2011 this is the field of correlative sdm correlative niche algorithms are regularly used as sdms or enms without stating explicitly a theoretical shape of n f nor any a priori information about it some exceptions are brewer et al 2016 and drake 2015 and using the cloud of points e t g only as background to contrast the observations like in maxent elith et al 2011 merow et al 2013 or in some other specialized algorithms doledec et al 2000 hirzel et al 2002 therefore in the enm literature the distinctions regarding different niches and their different shapes is seldom made a result is that when correlative niche models are projected geographically to get sdms these are estimates of regions which are in between the occupied and the potential distribution jiménez valverde et al 2008 sometimes they may even coincide kearney et al 2010 but it is seldom the case that the point is even raised 1 2 estimation of different niches in the fields of enm mostly in its correlative version guisan and zimmermann 2000 estimating n r t g is the objective or the occupied area if performing sdm the data that can be used for the estimation of n r t g are observations of the species over g and its corresponding sets of spatially defined climatic covariates guisan and zimmermann 2000 franklin 2009 since the realized niche has been affected by a variety of very different filtering processes its final shape may be a rather complex and convoluted subset of the swarm of points that belong to the fundamental niche merow et al 2014 thus assuming a specific shape for the realized niche may be inappropriate correlative enm is performed using any among a large variety of methods franklin 2009 and it has been widely assumed that a good algorithm should be capable of fitting complex and convoluted forms characteristic of n r t g elith and graham 2009 when true absences in environmental space are available and unbiased it is assumed that the fit to the realized niche may be quite good franklin 2009 but in any case correlative enm probably seldom estimates objects close to the n f on the other hand strictly speaking the estimation of n f requires mechanistic first principle biophysics kearney and porter 2004 or experimental methods buckley 2008 however based on the logical relationship showed in 1 we propose a rigorous statistical framework for estimating the fundamental niche n f for this purpose we shall use besides the occurrence points and the climatic covariates a hypothesis regarding the shape of the fundamental niche and a priori information about the parameters of such shape by adding these two factors we expect to estimate an object that better represents a fundamental niche than what conventional niche modeling does by applying our approach to virtual species we explore some scenarios that hinder estimating the theoretical fundamental niche we also show that adding physiological priors create a difference from conventional niche models using only occurrences 2 methods 2 1 assumptions and modeling first we assume that n f has a simple convex form in the multivariate space defined by the climatic covariates that are of interest for the species in this we follow maguire 1973 drake 2015 and brown 1984 and some scant empirical data birch 1953 haefner 1969 green 1971 hooper et al 2008 a simple and manageable convex shape is an ellipsoid thus we assume that an ellipsoid that comes from a bell shaped fitness function would provide an estimate of n f two parameters define such an ellipsoid a centroid and a covariance matrix these two parameters would define a multivariate normal distribution as a model of the fitness function instead of attempting to give the fitness function some hypothetical units we will simply use a gaussian density function and specific level curves and assume that the closer an environmental combination is to the mean of the gaussian density the higher the chances of making an observation of an individual second prior information about the centroid and variances of the multivariate normal distribution is sometimes available for instance the range of tolerance for some variables usually temperature is now available for thousands of species sunday et al 2011 bennett et al 2018 we propose to use physiological tolerance ranges that come from experiments as prior data to inform the shape of n f we will use a bayesian approach to include this a priori information in the model critical temperatures from laboratory experiments are not easy to compare to climatic data because temperatures that individuals experience in the field may not correlate well with macroclimate kennedy 1997 this can be solved by parameterizing macro to micro climate models kearney et al 2014 unfortunately this is also very data demanding and for most regions of the world inapplicable however many macroecological i e coarse spatial resolution patterns are assumed to be the result of interactions between macroclimate and physiology chown et al 2004 bozinovic et al 2011 moreover some recent studies document positive correlations between environmental temperature and physiological thermal limits calosi et al 2007 pörtner and knust 2007 araújo et al 2013 barve et al 2014 gouveia et al 2014 and therefore we are assuming that it is possible to use such laboratory obtained limits of tolerances to inform priors in our approach we are very aware to the fact that behavior and habitat structure may complicate the relationship between physiological limits of tolerance as measured in the laboratory for instance by extending the capacity to tolerate extremes beyond laboratory ranges de frenne et al 2013 bozinovic and naya 2015 ortega garcia et al 2017 essentially this is a problem of linking processes at very contrasting spatiotemporal scales the problem of relating processes occurring at contrasting scales permeates ecology levin 1992 and only empirical experience will show whether our approach is valuable or not third we define a reference region of the world called g barve et al 2011 and we build our model taking into account the shape of its multivariate climate space e t g the data we use to estimate niches are occurrences of the species in a smaller geographical space called m that can be projected into climatic space by assigning measurements of the corresponding climatic covariates the region m represents the geographical region that is accessible to the species peterson et al 2011 under this framework our objective is to calculate the posterior distribution for the parameters of a hypothetical fundamental niche the resulting expression for the posterior comes from 1 assuming an ellipsoidal shape for the niche and 2 the addition of a priori information for the centroid and variances describing the niche the information provided by the shape of the climatic space e will be used mostly for interpretation again although we are attempting to estimate a fitness function we will simply use the probability density that can be converted into a fitness function by multiplication by the appropriate factor in fitness units 2 2 statistical model we now proceed to transform the heuristics described above to a rigorous procedure to estimating the hypothetical fundamental niche n f we assume that the environmental space e t g has d dimensions one for each environmental covariate affecting the species thus each point in e t g is a combination of d environmental measurements denoted by x i x i 1 x i d and it represents a sample unit where the species can be observed at each environmental combination x i it is assumed that the species will have a fitness proportional to the distance from x i to an optimum value which is the centroid of the ellipsoid austin 1999 martínez meyer et al 2013 osorio olvera et al 2016 specifically we define the probability of detecting the species in a site with environmental features x i using unbiased methods and the sufficient amount of time through a multivariate normal density with mean vector μ and covariance matrix σ 2 f 1 x i μ σ 2 π d 2 σ 1 2 e 1 2 x i μ t σ 1 x i μ the multivariate normal model is easily generalized to a skewed normal distribution if looking for further flexibility beyond what an ellipsoid niche model can offer the skewed normal distribution involves the incorporation of extra parameters in the model one for each dimension that leads to a richer and reasonable class of niche distributions see appendix b notice that eq 2 does not take into account any restriction about the existing climatic combinations but the irregular shape of e t g suggests that eventually this must be taken into consideration since it creates a very non uniform sampling space the set of available climate combinations constitutes a mask for the environmental space that suggests transforming the multivariate normal distribution into a discrete probability distribution defined at every point in e t g 3 f 2 x i μ σ e 1 2 x i μ t σ 1 x i μ y e t g e 1 2 y μ t σ 1 y μ 1 x i e t g the denominator is a normalizing constant ensuring that f 2 x i μ σ adds up to one over all x i in e t g and the indicator function 1 x i e t g guarantees that the occurrences of the species really exists in the available environmental space suppose that the data consists of n independent occurrences of the species of interest the set of environmental combinations where the species has been observed is denoted by d x 1 x n where x i is a vector of length d that contributes to the likelihood function with its density value f 2 x i μ σ thus the likelihood and the log likelihood functions for the parameters of interest μ σ given the set of occurrences have the following expressions respectively 4 ℒ μ σ d i 1 n e 1 2 x i μ t σ 1 x i μ y e t g e 1 2 y μ t σ 1 y μ 1 x i e t g 5 l μ σ d 1 2 i 1 n x i μ t σ 1 x i μ n log y e t g e 1 2 y μ t σ 1 y μ additional information about the centroid and variances describing the niche may be available for the species this information usually comes from physiological experiments recording biological performance for a gradient of environmental conditions sunday et al 2011 from these type of experiments we obtain some idea of what the range of tolerance is for each environmental variable relevant to describing the fundamental niche here we propose a bayesian approach to incorporate the information provided by the tolerance ranges as a priori distributions for the parameters of interest μ σ the posterior distribution for the parameters of the hypothetical fundamental niche will be obtained by combining the priors and the likelihood function as described in eq 4 6 f μ σ d e t g ℒ μ σ d g 1 μ μ 0 σ 0 g 2 σ 1 α w where g 1 μ μ 0 σ 0 is a multivariate normal distribution with mean μ 0 and covariance matrix σ 0 and g 2 σ 1 α w is a wishart distribution with parameters α and w jackson et al 2011 since much of the physiological experiments provide only ranges of tolerance for a single environmental variable sunday et al 2011 we use the method suggested by hozo et al hozo et al 2005 to estimate means and variances from the range of a random sample which are then used to define the parameters of the a priori distributions μ 0 σ 0 w the posterior distribution therefore becomes the objective function of the analysis since it comprises all the information about the parameters that describe the fundamental niche μ σ we use an mcmc algorithm called t walk christen and fox 2010 to generate a number m of simulations from the posterior the set of m draws provides posterior values of the mean μ and the covariance matrix σ which can be used to construct ellipsoids and to calculate metrics reflecting the uncertainty in the estimated parameters 2 3 virtual species and simulations in general terms real occurrence data can only give a partial understanding of the fundamental niche of a species hirzel et al 2001 factors such as dispersal barriers or interspecific competition may introduce biases in the samples that are not easy to assess guisan and thuiller 2005 another important complex factor is behavior individuals of a species may expand the range of physiologically defined tolerable conditions by actively searching for refuges or simply by changing their conduct ortega garcia et al 2017 however these spatial behavioral and ecological factors add complexity to the problem of disentangling the fundamental niche of real species using only occurrence data therefore working with virtual species has a big advantage since the true parameters that represent a fundamental niche are completely controlled the resulting estimations from different scenarios can be accurately compared to the true model in order to determine under which circumstances we get a good estimation of the fundamental niche we generated four virtual species each one corresponding to a theoretical fundamental niche and a hypothetical spatial restriction fig 2 for the n f the set of parameters μ σ was completely determined in advance the spatial restriction was established a posteriori inspecting the actual projection of environmental conditions in the map and attempting to establish reasonably large and connected regions of similar environmental conditions although virtual species are used to analyze the method environmental data are real for both the occurrence points d and the environmental space e t g represented with gray points in fig 2b we used two layers of environmental variables the mean annual temperature bio1 in celsius scale multiplied by 10 and the accumulated annual precipitation bio12 in mm both obtained from the worldclim database with a resolution of 1 km hijmans et al 2005 we scaled each environmental layer and used the scaled data for the rest of the analysis a set of 20 000 points inside the americas were randomly selected and recorded as latitude longitude pairs then we matched each point with its environmental measurements ending with a matrix of four columns two coordinates and two environmental values and 20 000 rows the latitude longitude values are drawn in fig 2a using an ordinary geographical representation while its projection in e t g corresponds to points in a space whose axes are standardized environmental variables fig 2 b therefore each point drawn in geographical space match with exactly one of the points in environmental space and vice versa a fundamental niche n f is represented here by the contour line that correspond to the 95 probability level of a bivariate normal distribution we first chose the values of a single covariance matrix σ f and then a set of four two dimensional vectors μi as their centroids the vectors μ i together with the matrix σ f generate four theoretical fundamental niches and give rise to different ecological scenarios each one representing a different species since the covariance matrix is the same for all four species the contour lines of its fundamental niches look the same but they are placed around different centroids fig 2b shows the 95 contour lines ellipses in each case the points inside these ellipses were drawn with different colors and projected back into the geographical space notice that when projected into geographical space g the points inside the ellipses no longer have a regular shape and some points that are close to each other in the environmental space are no longer close in geographical space this is the second part of the definition of the virtual species a connected spatial restriction for all the possible favorable environments as shown in fig 2 furthermore because of the irregular shape of the environmental space e t g the number of points inside the theoretical fundamental niches ellipses is different for each species we think of the sets of points projected to geographical space as the potential locations where a species can be present a potential distribution map we used the four different distribution maps to simulate the sampling of occurrence points in the field first we selected regions m i soberón and peterson 2005 in g encompassing subsets of the geographic projections in fig 2 a these sub regions are represented with rectangles of different colors for each species since the potential distribution map covers a broad area inside the americas composed by different disconnected subsets by using the sub regions m i we arbitrarily model geographic barriers furthermore as an expert would do in the field we focus on the areas where the species is known to exist since the entire potential distribution map is unknown after selecting m i we randomly picked occurrence points inside this sub region until a targeted sample size was reached we used these sets of points as our virtual samples to analyze the cases in which the fundamental niche can be recovered from the sample when we apply our proposed model for each species we obtained 20 different replicates of size n 50 we include one of the sets of 20 samples from species c highlighted in blue in fig 2 in appendix a we defined artificial tolerance ranges for each of the axes in environmental space and for each species in order to define the parameters of the a priori distributions for μ and σ these tolerance ranges have rectangular shapes yellow rectangles in fig 2b meaning that no information regarding the correlation among climatic variables is available a priori thus the values of μ 0 and the diagonal elements of σ 0 were defined through the minimum and maximum values of the tolerances see hozo et al 2005 and the off diagonal elements of σ 0 were set as zeros since no information about the covariances between environmental variables is given in the case of the wishart distribution α was fixed equal to 2 and w was defined as a the product of α and σ 0 1 using the replicated samples from the virtual species and the prior distributions defined we ran simulations from each of the posterior distributions by running a t walk in r christen and fox 2010 for each case each of the four species and all of the 20 replicates we ran the mcmc algorithm until reaching 7000 iterations in total after discarding the first 2000 values burn in time and from the remaining set of 5000 values we kept only those separated by 200 iterations thinning to avoid correlation among nearby simulations then we ended up with m 26 simulations from the posterior that were later used to explore the uncertainty about the parameters of interest after simulating from the corresponding posterior distributions we calculated the maximum a posteriori values map s for each sample namely μ ˆ and σ ˆ the map s are the values of μ and σ generated by the mcmc algorithm that provide the highest value of the posterior among all the k simulations of these parameters with the map s we calculated an index of overlap between the theoretical fundamental niche the 95 probability ellipse produced with parameters μ i and σ f and the fitted ellipsoid the 95 probability ellipse with parameters μ ˆ and σ ˆ we used the jaccard similarity index whose values range from 0 to 1 legendre and legendre 1998 to measure the overlap between the two ellipses the greater the index value the more similar the ellipses and vice versa meaning a better estimation of the fundamental niche moreover to make the most of our probabilistic bayesian approach for niche inference for each simulated sample from the posterior distribution after burn in and thinning we created an uncertainty plot for the ellipses for each simulation we plotted the corresponding normal distribution choosing the concentric ellipses at the first quartile a median b and upper quartile c the pixels between a and b were plotted in dark red the pixels between b and c in yellow and inside c in white that is at each simulated value a simple three level heatmap color palette with an alpha transparency level is used to plot the normal distribution when adding all the simulations on the same plot we obtain a sense of uncertainty in the inferred niche beyond the above explained point estimates thus representing the full posterior distribution in our inference see for example fig 4 3 results our method varies in its capacity to calculate the original hypothetical n f the median overlap between the theoretical and the 20 fitted ellipses ranged from slightly above 40 for species a to near 80 for species d fig 3 the high similarity values obtained for species d indicates that the theoretical fundamental niche and the estimated niche are very similar for most of the samples however we only recovered 78 of the theoretical fundamental niche in the best case the similarity values that we got for species b and c are similar in both cases we recover near to 50 of the theoretical niche the lowest overlap values are observed in species a meaning that in this case the theoretical fundamental niche is not well recovered another way of displaying the result is by comparing the simulations from the posterior distribution to the theoretical n f this is shown in fig 4 for one of the samples from species a left panel and one sample from species d right panel for species a where the overlap between the ellipses from the posterior distribution and the original n f is worse the points in the sample are biased towards the upper left part of the n f this bias is due to i the very non uniform structure of the space e t g and ii the fact that we selected a sub region m a where the samples were taken both the shape of the space e t g and the projection of m a into environmental space will bias sampling the niche in such case the estimated niche is then closer to the realized niche n r t g on the other hand for species d the overlap between the original n f and the ellipses from the posterior distribution is high this is due to i the fact that the fundamental niche of species d is located in a region of the environmental space with high density of points in e t g and ii the corresponding sub region m d allows for sampling all the niche thus in this case the estimation of the fundamental niche is better finally in the supplementary materials we show 1 results of maxent models with the same occurrence data but without prior information to compare them with our bayesian approach adding the priors clearly affects the results and 2 results of five real species for which prior information in two dimensions is available to illustrate some of the difficulties of applying the method to real species 4 discussion using ellipsoids as niche models is not a new thing green 1974 carnes and slade 1982 farber and kadmon 2003 jackson et al 2011 swanson et al 2015 qiao et al 2016 what is new in the approach we present is 1 we are explicitly using the ellipses as models for the fundamental niche n f fully aware that the realized niche probably has a complex shape that requires other approaches to be modelled austin et al 1990 elith and graham 2009 blonder et al 2014 2 we propose a bayesian argument to add a priori ideally experimental information about the fundamental niche 3 we present a likelihood function that represents the assumptions of the model and finally 4 we are explicit in our definitions of the fundamental the existing and the realized niches in terms of their relationships eq 1 our theoretical emphasis on distinguishing types of niches likely with very contrasting geometries is one of the major points of our contribution how approximate then are the calculations of our method to a true fundamental niche for real species the fundamental niche is a concept and thus there is no truth in its estimation however it is reasonable to ask how consistent the results of an estimation to the features of the concept are our method aims to estimate a convex object surrounding observations samples of the realized niche modified by the a priori information and subject to the ellipsoidal or approximately ellipsoidal shape appendix and therefore it makes sense to ask about the proportion of points inside the estimated shape and how congruent the shape is to the prior information a discussion of this is presented in the supplementary materials section in terms of how consistent are the observations and the priors we are fully aware of the preliminary nature of our results and discussion this is a complicated topic that will be explored further in the future now in the virtual species case we do have a true fundamental niche of some sort how well the software is capable of estimating it in the results section we showed the proportion of overlap between the calculated and the known true ellipsoid shape representing the fundamental niche fig 3 shows that for some species d the algorithm can recapture around 75 of the original n f why does species d get uniformly better results we attribute species d getting estimations closer to the fundamental niche to the fact that the sampling points of this species are inside of a cloud of points in e t g that can be well sampled inside the sub region m d whereas the other species sampling points are all in the periphery of the cloud of existing environmental points or are biased after limiting the sampling space to m this means that for some hypothetical species a and c for instance the sampling points may occupy biased regions inside the n f ellipsoids with priors being shifted away from the observations although this may appear to be a problem with the design of the virtual species we assert that it provides an important and probably unappreciated insight indeed n f is a quantity defined experimentally by the physiology of a species either the ellipsoids which are the theoretical models of the contour lines from the fitness function or the yellow rectangles that represent experimental information are independent of what conditions actually exist in a region at a time colwell and rangel 2009 on the other hand the sampling points come from populations in geographic space these populations are the result of a complex of processes that include physiological tolerance but also climate availability which changes in time the results of interactions with other species and the presence of barriers or dispersal disequilibrium peterson et al 2011 behavior and habitat heterogenity therefore geographic samples may or may not be good samples of the actual physiological requirements of a species although should be contained in them soberón and arroyo peña 2017 as we see in fig 2 the geographic points may provide an extremely biased sample of the space inside the ellipsoids in terms of eq 1 the only direct information about n f the object to estimate comes from the prior data the georeferenced occurrence points when projected into environmental space are distorted by the shape of e t g and in our case by modelling geographic barriers we do not model the effects of biotic interactions in this paper therefore samples taken from the shape n r t g the realized niche may include these severe biases that might even be considered as truncated samples if some environmental combinations do not exist this may not be a problem when the objective is to model the environment of occurrences realized niches but it is certainly a problem when modeling a fundamental niche one important practical lesson from this is that our method as presented here should not be applied in the case that observational points come from the periphery or from sparsely populated regions of the environmental space something that may be assessed visually including the form of e t g is a very important part of the problem of niche modeling this has been recognized since the beginnings of niche studies colwell and futuyma 1971 and it is part of some enm algorithms like maxent elith et al 2011 or enfa hirzel et al 2002 these two methods explicitly include the shape of e t g in their algorithms however it is also probably true that the shape of e t g is mostly ignored at the time of interpreting results and the far reaching consequences of the fact that first the shape of e t g is extremely irregular and second it changes in time and space is just beginning to be taken into account soberón and peterson 2011a 2011b broennimann et al 2012 petitpierre et al 2012 guisan et al 2014 saupe et al 2017 in our case including the effects of the shape of e t g on the bias that is induced into the sampling points is still work in progress brewer et al 2016 presented a plausible plateau method including a priori information to fit a parametric shape that can be regarded as a truncated cone this shape is biologically realistic when referring to the fundamental biological requirements although not necessarily for a realized niche see above the main argument to prefer the shape of a frustum to a multivariate bell shaped curve is a valid one symmetric response curves are less realistic that asymmetric ones 1992 araújo et al 2013 however as we show in appendix b it is easy to modify our method to include non symmetric normal niche functions and the basic likelihood equation remains valid brewer et al 2016 use presence absence data but in our approach we use presence only data peterson et al 2011 we suspect that in practice both methods presented with presence only data which brewer et al 2016 claim can be used with their plateau method and the same a priori information will yield similar estimates of a n f this is a test for the future however the problem as we see it is more than a mere statistical fitting exercise because in our approach we are specifically assuming a shape for the n f an interpretation in terms of fitness and in terms of the form of the environmental space and the existence of spatial limitations to the regions where points can be sampled these are issues of interpretation and the next steps in our research aim to test the method using data from real species and include explicitly the shape of e g t and of the spatial limitations in the definition of the likelihood function using real species add a number of decisions and complications see supplementary materials about whether physiological details matter and in what ways ectothermy endothermy body mass aquatic vs terrestrial habitat however it is only using real data that the validity and usefulness of the insights derived from virtual species will be assessed finally some words about why it is important to estimate n f rather than simply to characterize in environmental space some set of observations which is what most of enm do first n f is what evolves in the sense that their limits are subject to natural selection in populations holt and gomulkiewicz 1997 and thus it is also what is conserved or not after speciation events peterson et al 1999 peterson 2011 if a reliable hypothesis about the shape of n f could be proposed it would be possible to create a parametric evolutionary model for n f second interpreting results of enm analyses would be much more straightforward if a convex shape could be assumed in particular transfers of enms to other sets of conditions would be far more robust and straightforward peterson 2003 additionally transferring predictions of enms to climate conditions that are not represented in or near the species present day range depends on good estimates of n f and as such interpretation of enms is presently limited to conditions represented on the area across which the model was calibrated vanderwal et al 2009 owens et al 2013 estimating the n f is thus of theoretical and practical importance and what we present here is an attempt to a practical methodology to getting close to it with reasonably available data acknowledgements j s was supported by the nsf grant abi 1458640 j a c

blue points the gray points represent the existing climatic combinations in e t g and the blue ellipse is the representation of the fundamental niche for species c fig a1 appendix b skew multivariate normal distribution looking for further flexibility beyond what an ellipse niche distribution model can offer we propose to use a skew normal distribution that is taken as a generalization of the conventional gaussian distribution this skew normal distribution produces intensity level sets that are 1 connected 2 convex and 3 possibly asymmetric see left panel in fig b1 the bidimensional skew normal is defined as follows f x μ σ β 2 π 1 σ 1 2 e 1 2 x μ t σ 1 x μ φ x 1 μ 1 σ 1 β 1 x 2 μ 2 σ 2 β 2 where x x 1 x 2 t μ μ 1 μ 2 t β β 1 β 2 t and φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution one dimensional therefore we only need to multiply the φ term in the conventional normal model it is important that the skewness parameter be restricted a priori to the interval 2 2 otherwise we obtain undesired extreme skewness commonly we set β n 0 u 0 i 2 x 2 choosing u 0 such that β 1 β 2 2 2 with 0 99 probability an added difficulty is that μ is not equal to the center of mass of the skew normal as it is the case with the conventional gaussian additional care needs to be accounted for when coding the prior distribution and other technical details but inference is viable and not much more complex that with the above mentioned gaussian further technical details may be found in soto galindo 2016 the result is that niche estimation has richer forms as seen in the corresponding uncertainty plot in the right panel of fig b1 the biological adequacy and soundness of this generalization are still to be thoroughly discussed and is left for future

25103,following decades of absence the gray wolf canis lupus has recolonized much of the northern great lakes region from canada and remnant populations in northern minnesota the wolf population in michigan s upper peninsula may now be reaching saturation with evidence that some dispersing individuals have traversed the straits of mackinac during ice over winter conditions indicating potential recolonization of northern lower michigan while previous research suggests suitable habitat exists in northern lower michigan to support a small wolf population habitat availability at other hierarchical levels including den habitat and the ability of individuals to disperse successfully among suitable habitat patches has not been assessed we evaluated the den habitat availability and landscape connectivity using a multi scale modeling approach that integrates hierarchical habitat selection theory as well as spatial structure to assess whether corridors exist for wolves to successfully recolonize and raise pups in northern lower michigan we used expert opinion scientific literature and geographical information systems to develop models of landscape suitability resistance and least cost path analysis to identify dispersal corridors throughout the upper and northern lower peninsulas of michigan based on our models the upper peninsula was almost entirely amenable to wolves for both denning and dispersing particularly in the western portion of the peninsula our estimates indicate that over 1900 km2 of high quality den habitat exists in northern lower michigan but landscape permeability between these habitat patches appeared relatively low relative to upper michigan we delineated several corridors of high quality habitat in the upper peninsula that may facilitate dispersal in to lower michigan dispersal corridors were of moderate quality in northern lower michigan representing higher mortality risk but potentially capable of promoting recolonization of high quality habitat areas conservation efforts within these identified corridors may further increase the potential for successful recolonization and establishment of viable long term breeding populations of gray wolves in northern lower michigan keywords hierarchical habitat modeling gray wolf canis lupus gis landscape permeability least cost paths great lakes 1 introduction the selection of habitats by animals is a multilevel multi decision process that can be broken down into 3 general orders 1 first order selection is a coarse scale selection pertaining to selection of the physical or geographical range of a species 2 second order selection is found within the range of the first and determines the home range of an individual or social group 3 third order selection pertains to the use of various habitat components within the home range johnson 1980 as such analyzing habitat selection within a hierarchical framework can identify differences in habitat preferences among levels weaver et al 2012 zeller et al 2017 multi scale habitat modeling often produces stronger and more reliable inferences than using a single level alone johnson et al 2004 holland et al 2004 wasserman et al 2012 decesare et al 2012 zeller et al 2014 mcgarigal et al 2016 however many studies of gray wolf canis lupus habitat and or probability of occurrence in the great lakes region have focused solely on second order selection at the home range level e g mladenoff et al 1995 mladenoff and sickley 1998 mladenoff et al 1999 wydeven et al 2001 potvin et al 2005 gehring and potter 2005 much of this research has centered on the influence of road density on gray wolf occurrence and survivability whereby road density serves as a proxy for potential human contact while human presence is important in predicting wolf habitat and occupancy other landscape factors e g cover type terrain etc are clearly of significance to wolves to fulfill basic life history requirements furthermore models of wolf habitat solely focused at the home range level may be too simplistic neglecting to assess limiting factors or habitat preferences at other scales of selection within johnson s 1980 hierarchical habitat selection theory it is likely that wolves travel through and select a region on the landscape then select an area to establish a home range and lastly select the microscale location to birth and raise pups den and rendezvous sites unger et al 2009 therefore assessing landscape habitat suitability requires not only identifying suitable habitat for the establishment of a home range but also identifying potential barriers to dispersal first order and habitat suitable for the successful birthing and rearing of young third order arctic tundra wolves canis lupus albus for example have shown a strong association with eskers as den habitat therefore availability of suitable of den site habitat may be a limiting factor affecting habitat selection patterns at higher levels mcloughlin et al 2004 houle et al 2010 and lesmerises et al 2012 found similar patterns of habitat selection at the within home range level in canada where wolf occurrence and activity was influenced more by timber harvesting and other anthropogenic activity during denning rendezvous season than during other life events e g nomadic periods relatively less is known about the mechanisms behind long distance wolf dispersal linnell et al 2005 however advancements in landscape genetics techniques have provided some evidence that natural and anthropogenic landscape barriers do exist for these highly mobile habitat generalists carmichael et al 2001 showed that physical barriers in that case the mackenzie river in the northwest territories canada and prey specialization may govern large scale wolf movements geffen et al 2004 found patterns of genetic isolation at a continental scale in north american wolf populations that appeared to be related to habitat and climate anthropogenic barriers to wolf dispersal often include high volume and or high density road systems as wolves tend to avoid areas of high human activity and disturbance jensen et al 1986 mech 1989 whittington et al 2005 oakleaf et al 2006 in fact relatedness within packs has been found to be greater near major roads suggesting decreased dispersal from natal packs with proximity to roads cullingham et al 2016 given the complexities of habitat selection and movement for a highly mobile mammal we integrated expert opinion into a hierarchical modeling approach to better understand gray wolf habitat suitability and availability in michigan our model assessed habitat suitability at multiple levels in both michigan s upper peninsula up where wolves currently exist and michigan s northern lower peninsula nlp where wolves may potentially recolonize if adequate habitat corridors are maintained this approach allowed us to compare quality and quantity of habitat in known wolf range with habitat in potential wolf range the up wolf population is estimated at 600 individuals and is likely near carrying capacity michigan department of natural resources 2015 as the up population becomes saturated the likelihood for individuals to disperse into the nlp may increase gehring and potter 2005 estimated that enough suitable land area exists to support the home range level occupancy of 50 100 wolves in the nlp although other hierarchical levels of habitat in michigan has not been evaluated until now as saturated wolf populations expand and re inhabit greater portions of their former range it will be imperative to identify not just suitable home range habitat but also critical breeding patches and the landscape permeability between them this is particularly germane in human dominated areas of wolf recolonization such as the nlp where habitat is fragmented and the potential for wolf human conflict is high unger et al 2009 this study therefore assessed and integrated habitat suitability at multiple scales bridging first order landscape permeability to second order home range suitability based on past work by mladenoff et al 1995 and gehring and potter 2005 and finally third order selection den rendezvous site habitat to better understand habitat suitability and permeability at large scales to our knowledge hierarchical models of wolf habitat suitability are scarce and ours is the first of its kind in the great lakes region 2 methods 2 1 study area our study area included the entire upper peninsula of michigan as well as the northern lower peninsula which is considered to be all areas north of michigan highway m 55 the up is a 42 896 km2 area dominated by boreal forest and mesic conifer and deciduous stands with interspersed agricultural lands the nlp covers 27 656 km2 of land and is a mosaic of northern hardwood forests and boreal coniferous wetlands interspersed with intermittent agriculture and urban areas state owned public land dominates ownership of large tracts of land in the nlp including the pigeon river country state forest prcsf a 477 5 km2 multi use managed forest tract in addition a vast expanse approximately 583 km2 combined area of privately owned club properties lie approximately 60 km to the south east of the prcsf creating a contiguous tract of near roadless forest 2 2 modeling overview we used a modeling approach that combines expert opinion best available knowledge from literature and environmental spatial data peer reviewed literature and expert information can be used with computer technologies such as geographic information systems gis to develop predictive habitat models in a relatively short period of time store and kanagas 2001 clevenger et al 2002 yamada et al 2003 perera et al 2012 while empirical studies of den and dispersal habitat selection patterns in the great lakes exist e g thiel 1985 thiel et al 1998 wydeven et al 2001 norris et al 2002 treves et al 2009 it was necessary to use expert opinion to quantify the relative importance of habitat variables to wolves when dispersing through the landscape and selecting critical den habitat furthermore an important aspect of our study was to assess availability of critical habitat and the permeability of the nlp for dispersing wolves an area that has not had an established wolf population for nearly 100 years stebler 1944 therefore empirical data for this area does not currently exist expert opinion data and gis evaluations have been used to study large carnivores and habitat potential in the past including black bears ursus americanus clevenger et al 2002 florida panthers puma concolor coryi thatcher et al 2006 and cougars puma concolor larue and nielsen 2008 using these techniques we developed models of habitat suitability landscape permeability resistance and least cost paths a technique often used for determining dispersal corridors meegan and maehr 2002 schad et al 2002 larkin et al 2004 kautz et al 2006 penrod et al 2006 2 3 expert surveys we created a survey to obtain expert opinion on variable importance variables were chosen from published literature on the ecological and life history requirements of wolves focusing specifically in the lake states region we distributed the survey to 13 species experts working for university state and federal agencies in the u s great lakes region and ontario canada den rendezvous habitat variables that were ranked by experts included distance to water joslin 1967 unger 1999 norris et al 2002 trapp 2004 association with sandy soil pulliainen 1965 joslin 1967 ballard and dau 1983 fuller 1989 unger 1999 trapp 2004 land cover type fuller 1989 norris et al 2002 theuerkauf and jedrzejewski 2003 trapp 2004 and distance to roads unger 1999 wydeven et al 2001 theuerkauf and jedrzejewski 2003 distance to roads was chosen for the den model rather than road density because distance to a road may be more appropriate for sensitive and spatially static den sites where we predicted distance from human influence is highly critical variables related to travel corridors presented for expert ranking included road density mladenoff et al 1995 houts 2002 land cover type fritts and mech 1981 licht and fritts 1994 wydeven et al 2001 whittington et al 2004 prey density mech 1977 boyd and pletscher 1999 potvin et al 2005 and topographic position ream et al 1985 species experts were asked to quantify the relative importance of each habitat variable by assigning a weight i e percentage of 100 to each variable and rank the attribute classes within each variable e g within the land cover variable there are several land cover types such as upland deciduous lowland deciduous barren urban etc weights identified the importance of each variable in relation to the other landscape characteristics where 100 would identify a deterministic habitat variable in which no other landscape variables are required for suitability attribute class ranks identify suitabilities of a range of data or attribute specific to a given variable based on a biological suitability score ranging from 0 to 100 but do not need to equal 100 appendix a adapted from beier et al 2007 weights and ranks were averaged to obtain a final value see appendices b and c 2 4 geospatial data modeling processes were completed in arcgis 10 1 esri redlands ca using raster data with minimum mapping unit of 30 m michigan land cover data was obtained from the michigan center for geographic data online data library catalog www mcgi state mi us mgdl accessed may 2007 and reclassified from its original 32 classifications to 11 based on expert survey responses reclassification was conducted because the scientific literature for wolves and many other species often does not distinguish between the suitabilities of highly related land cover types beier et al 2007 additionally wolves have not been shown to actively select for specific types of habitat but rather exhibit avoidance of areas of high human disturbance thiel 1985 mladenoff et al 1995 areas with high human influence typically include cropland urban areas roads etc which are represented in the simplified classifications the open water landcover type was considered to be static i e conversion to ice in winter months was not considered soil data were obtained from the natural resource conservation service nrcs online soil data mart http soildatamart nrcs usda gov soil physical properties percent sand were extracted using the nrcs soil data viewer 5 1 road data were obtained from the michigan center for geographic data online data library catalog mgf version 7 may 2007 framework unimproved forest roads were removed as these roads are readily used by wolves and are often incorporated into their home ranges mladenoff et al 1995 gehring 1995 euclidean distance was used to estimate distance from a road road density was calculated using 10 km moving window neighborhood analysis following mladenoff et al 1995 gehring and potter 2005 road densities were categorized for ranking according to mladenoff et al s 1995 corresponding likelihood of wolf occurrence distance to water was calculated from michigan river stream and lake data obtained from mgf version 7 hydrography framework www mcgi state mi us mgdl may 2007 lake polygons originated from the michigan department of natural resources institute for fisheries research relatively small water features e g ephemeral narrow and or shallow streams and small lakes ponds are often more associated with den and rendezvous sites than large or rapidly moving waters joslin 1967 norris et al 2002 therefore major water bodies were excluded from analysis small rivers and streams data were considered features classified as h31 and h32 from miris level 7 l blastic michigan department of natural resources pers comm small lakes and ponds were considered to be 1 ha in size per largest documented lake size in joslin 1967 euclidean distance tools up to 10 000 m were run separately on lake and river shapefiles and the resulting raster outputs were combined using erdas imagine hexagon group inc sweden for a single distance to water dataset a topographic position raster was derived from the digital elevation model dem michigan center for geographic data online data library catalog topographic position for each cell was classified as valley ridgetop flat or slope in relation to neighborhood cells within 200 m valley was defined as an elevation of at least 12 m less than the average of the neighborhood cells ridgetop as an elevation of at least 12 m greater than the average of the neighborhood cells and flat as having a slope 6 and did not fit the valley or ridgetop classification slope was defined as 6 and did not fit valley or ridgetop classification topographic classifications followed beier et al 2007 2 5 habitat suitability modeling habitat suitability index hsi rasters were created for den habitat and landscape permeability using the arcgis extension tool corridordesigner beier et al 2007 we used weighted geometric mean to incorporate weighted factors and ranked classes as weighted geometric mean has the ability to incorporate deterministic factors beier et al 2007 a deterministic habitat factor is one that has to be present in high quality habitat while a non deterministic factor has a trade off with some other factor store and kanagas 2001 this concept can also be applied to a limiting deterministic factor where the presence of a particular landscape characteristic e g urban may render the pixel as absolute non habitat even if all other factors e g topography distance to water etc are ideal geometric mean accomplishes this because it is calculated using the product of the terms to the nth root thereby retaining an overall score of 0 if any of the terms are rated as such the algorithm used for combining weighted habitat factors was therefore suitability or permeability sn wn where sn is the score for each factor and wn is the weight for that factor and represents the geometric mean the resultant hsi rasters contained pixels that contained a single index value to represent the relative suitability of that area raster data of habitat suitability permeability was normalized on a scale of 0 100 to represent biological interpretations of habitat suitabilities appendix a 2 6 den rendezvous site habitat we identified den rendezvous site habitat patches from the den hsi raster using neighborhood analysis with a 250 m circular moving window on cells with a hsi score 60 basis for removal of habitat 60 hsi is to represent all den habitat patches that are suitable for denning on a consistent basis per hsi definitions appendix a we defined breeding patches as 1 ha assuming highest frequency of wolf use at den sites occurs within an approximate 50 m radius unger 1999 theuerkauf and jedrzejewski 2003 trapp 2004 habitat patches within the nlp were clipped to include only areas which lie within areas defined as suitable for general pack home range based on gehring and potter 2005 this more accurately identifies suitable den habitat in the nlp as third order selection typically occurs within the range of second order selection johnson 1980 euclidean distance nearest neighbor analyses were performed on up and nlp den habitat patches using arcgis 10 1 spatial statistics tools 2 7 dispersal corridors we used least cost path methods to develop likely dispersal corridors using the permeability raster as the resistance environment through which to move this technique models the relative cost or ability for an animal to permeate the landscape between two suitable habitat patches penrod et al 2006 based on how characteristics such as land cover roads or slope may affect the animal singleton et al 2002 penrod et al 2006 least cost path lcp analyses will create a path with the least resistance greatest permeability and fewest barriers to movement larkin et al 2004 and identify the best route for a dispersing animal larue and nielsen 2008 large areas of suitable critical den habitat developed from our den habitat patch model were used as source and destination locations for our corridors within the up blocks of suitable den habitat found within ottawa and hiawatha national forests were chosen as source and destination habitats these habitat patches were chosen somewhat subjectively while sufficiently large patches of suitable den habitat were identified within many ownership classifications federal state private etc we chose these patches both for their likely stability in ownership and natural status i e likely to remain in federal national forest ownership and thus likely to remain free from human development as well as geographic location for constructing potential dispersal corridors in other words because a goal of our study was to assess how wolves might move across the landscape in the up it was necessary to choose suitable start and end points for lcp corridor modeling that would facilitate the simulation of a corridor that traversed the up a final corridor was modeled to extend to the southeastern most block of suitable habitat in the up near the straits of mackinac to illustrate potential crossing locations into the nlp within the nlp a corridor was modeled using den habitat within wilderness state park in emmet county the den habitat block nearest to up populations as the source the destination for the corridor was the largest contiguous habitat block in the nlp consisting of mostly private hunt recreation club property in alcona oscoda and montmorency counties while this is private land much of it has remained unaltered for many years and is surrounded by a matrix of public land pigeon river country state forest to the north huron national forest to the south we used a neighborhood analysis to average neighboring pixels to determine a corridor with the least cost or greatest permeability a 500 m circular moving window neighborhood analysis of all pixels 60 hsi permeability index was used neighborhood effects are determined by species sensitivity to edge effects and perceptual range beier et al 2007 it is likely that wolves have a broad perceptual range gehring and swihart 2003 therefore the maximum window size was chosen 2 8 evaluation of dispersal corridors our dispersal corridors are displayed in terms of permeability with the various colored slices of least cost paths representing varying levels of permeability for example the 0 1 lcp represents the most permeable 0 1 of the landscape up to the most permeable 10 corridors were also assessed for spatial bottlenecks which were considered areas 200 m in width to prevent close contact with human inhabitance boyd and pletscher 1999 corridors were evaluated for maximum width so that no area of the corridor exceeded 10 km in width based on the radius of an average summer home range for wolves in the great lakes region rossler 2007 the latter was used to prevent establishing a corridor large enough for a wolf pack to become resident and prevent passage by other individuals i e displaying territorial behavior within a corridor maximum widths were also assessed for purposes of feasibility from a management standpoint average widths were calculated using the bottleneck statistics tool and least distance analysis was performed using the patch distance statistics tool within the corridordesigner extension 2 9 validation of den model we obtained ex post facto location data of field verified wolf dens n 18 detected using satellite and radio collared wolves in the up from 2009 to 2014 mississippi state university unpublished data and compared these locations to hsi values generated by our den model because much of the up landscape contains suitable den habitat we also compared the empirical data to the frequency at which random points would be within suitable den habitat patches from our model hsi 60 and area 1 ha to do this we used arcgis 10 1 to generate 10 datasets of 18 random sites across the up landscape we compared known den location successes den was located within a wolf den habitat patch from our model and failures point was not located within a wolf den habitat patch we conducted the same comparison with the 10 iterations of 18 random points we then performed chi squared goodness of fit tests on the success failure rate of the known wolf den locations compared with the 10 datasets of random sites to test if known den locations were within den patches developed by our model more than would be expected by random chance 3 results 3 1 den rendezvous site habitat model averaged results of species expert surveys n 8 rendered distance to water as the most important variable in den habitat quality followed by distance to roads land cover and sand composition in soil appendix b moderate to short distances 80 m from water were considered the most suitable and distances 200 m were considered least suitable yet suitable enough for occasional to moderate use with a score of 40 experts ranked distances from roads 2000 m as having a high likelihood for den and pup success and areas 500 m as least suitable mixed forest was identified as the most suitable cover type followed by upland coniferous the least suitable and only limiting factor with a score of 0 habitat type was open water followed by urban areas with a very low score of 1 a sand composition of 75 100 was considered as the most suitable class within the soil type factor the least suitable class was non sandy soil types although still ranking high enough to support occasional wolf den activity den habitat suitability modeling fig 1 suggested widespread availability of high quality den habitat hsi 80 throughout the up but lower availability throughout the nlp available den habitat in the up totaled 26 417 km2 and is approximately 90 of the area identified by mladenoff et al 1995 as suitable for general home range habitat euclidean distance analysis 4 nearest neighbors between up den habitat patches 60 hsi revealed a minimum inter patch distance of 67 m maximum of 54 9 km and an average distance of 3 1 km in the nlp available den habitat was 1906 km2 which is approximately 87 of the land area predicted as suitable for general home range set up by gehring and potter 2005 inter patch distances between nlp den habitat patches were 778 m 50 9 km and 6 2 km respectively in the up the highest quality den habitat was concentrated in the western portion of the peninsula within the nlp the majority of den habitat was distributed throughout private club country land to the southeast however quality habitat was also identified in areas of public ownership such as in wilderness state park in the northwest and within the pigeon river country state forest in the northeast proportional analysis of hsi scores identified den habitat in the up as being greater in both quality and quantity than within the nlp fig 2 most 35 den habitat identified in the up fell within the highest suitability index class of 80 100 and approximately 28 in the second highest suitability class hsi 60 80 the largest proportion 46 of den habitat in the nlp was identified as marginal quality 30 60 hsi and 32 of habitat within the 60 80 hsi range only approximately 11 of the land area in the nlp is of the best habitat suitability 80 hsi for denning 3 2 den model validation known den locations in the up aligned well with our den habitat patch model with 89 n 16 of the known points falling within modeled den habitat with a mean hsi value of 78 random point datasets had a mean success rate of 61 range 8 13 successes chi square goodness of fit tests table 1 indicated that the observed successes of the known den locations are statistically different than expected from random distributions χ2 10 9 p 0 0009 α 0 01 df 1 while all random iterations of locations indicate the number of successes do not differ from expected values 3 3 landscape connectivity model species experts ranked land cover as the most important dispersal corridor variable followed by road density and topographic position appendix c the prey density variable was dropped due to relatively low expert ranking and lack of reliable prey density data in michigan within the land cover variable lowland coniferous and lowland deciduous were ranked the most suitable land cover types for dispersal respectively experts ranked a road density range of 0 38 km km2 as most suitable for travel least suitable were road densities 0 53 km km2 however this was still given a relatively permeable score of 31 within the topographic position variable valleys were given the most suitable score for travel modeling efforts suggested high permeability of the landscape for wolves throughout the up and much less permeability throughout the nlp especially west of interstate 75 which traverses down the center of the peninsula approximately 40 of the landscape in the up was estimated to contain highly suitable habitat 80 hsi for successful wolf travel and another 8 6 of the landscape was estimated to contain habitat of moderate suitability 61 80 hsi fig 3 the nlp is of much lower quality proportionally with only approximately 15 of the land area being of optimal permeability and only another 4 6 being moderately suitable more than 50 of the nlp is of low or marginal quality 31 60 hsi and approximately 30 is completely unusable very high energy mortality for travel 30 hsi the route of greatest permeability connecting den habitat in the ottawa national forest in the west to habitat in the easternmost block of the hiawatha national forest measured 379 km in length fig 4 forested cover types represented 88 of this path 35 deciduous 42 coniferous mixed 11 and agricultural lands made up 1 additional cover types included small amounts of interspersed water wetland 9 paved barren and urban land all 1 each a large corridor was modeled in the nlp connecting den habitat in wilderness state park in the northwest to large blocks of den habitat in the largely privately owned club country in the southeastern nlp the corridor s main route along the northeastern shore of the peninsula henceforth referred to as the eastern branch is the route of highest suitability as it contains the most permeable 0 1 of the landscape this eastern branch contained 72 forested cover type 43 coniferous 23 deciduous 6 mixed 14 water wetlands 10 barren pasture 2 agriculture 1 paved and 1 urban the minimum width was 3 4 km and maximum width was 10 7 km while this route contained the highest landscape permeability it also had greater inter patch distance than the alternative western route the alternative branch western branch of the corridor identified contained less suitable habitat but was identified by the model as containing the least inter patch distance the western branch of the lcp was 125 km in length and contained 74 forested land cover type 44 deciduous 24 coniferous 6 mixed 14 water wetland 9 pasture barren and 1 urban agriculture and paved this branch had a minimum width of 293 m and a maximum width of 7 km 4 discussion recent studies have shown that resource selection differs significantly during various life events or behavioral states abrahms et al 2017 and as such resource selection during dispersal for wide ranging carnivores may vary markedly from daily use and selection within the home range e g elliot et al 2014 zeller et al 2015 it is therefore important to understand habitat selection and suitability at multiple spatial scales that coincide with various life events for a species such as the gray wolf our study is the first to have integrated a multi scale hierarchical approach to wolf habitat suitability in the great lakes previous research conducted at the home range level gehring and potter 2005 suggested that enough habitat remains in michigan s nlp to support 50 100 wolves but the ability to traverse the landscapes between habitat patches to fully use identified suitable habitat was unknown our models suggest high quality and quantity of dispersal range first order and den rendezvous third order johnson 1980 habitat for wolves in michigan s upper peninsula however quality and quantity of both are greatly reduced in the nlp despite our estimates indicating that over 1900 km2 of high quality den habitat exists in the nlp permeability between these habitat patches is relatively low which may reduce accessibility to many of these areas for recolonizing wolves furthermore much of the largest unfragmented den habitat identified in the nlp were largely within private hunt club land owned by individuals that may or may not be tolerant of wolves given that tolerance of wolves by humans is potentially the most important factor in wolf survival and persistence in human dominated landscapes ballard et al 1987 fuller 1989 mech 1989 wydeven et al 2001 treves and bruskotter 2014 land ownership may be a significant issue in the recolonization of breeding populations of wolves in the nlp nevertheless notably large patches of den rendezvous site habitat on public lands were also identified in the northernmost areas of the nlp such as in wilderness state park in the northwest and the pidgeon river state park in the northeast which may support small populations of breeding wolves without the need to traverse significant portions of the landscape of the lower peninsula additionally modeling efforts identified potential dispersal corridors that while in an overall less permeable landscape than the up still represented habitat fairly amenable to dispersing wolves with greater than 70 forest cover and little to no urban areas thus lower connectivity between den patches may impede but not necessarily totally prevent the successful return and endurance of established wolf populations to the nlp 4 1 dispersal from up source populations further confounding the potential for recolonization is the likelihood that the input of new individuals into nlp populations may be perpetually low although field documentation and public reports indicate occasional dispersers arriving from the up for example in 2004 a radio collared female wolf originally from the up was accidentally trapped and killed in presque isle county michigan department of natural resources 2008 and in 2015 a gray wolf was detected via trail camera on the little traverse bay band of odawa indians ltbboi reservation and confirmed by genetic testing of scat ltbboi unpublished data both of these confirmed detections were relatively near to the straits of mackinac or straits narrow channel of water connecting lakes michigan and huron where wolves have been documented dispersing across ice in winter during full ice over williams 2003 we theorize that the straits area would be the most likely area for wolf dispersal across ice as even in milder winters the straits tend to obtain 80 ice over noaa grerl 2018 https www glerl noaa gov data ice historicalanim moreover ice breaking regimes that keep the straits open for shipping channels typically pause from late january through mid to late march miller 2017 allowing up to 6 8 weeks annually of potential dispersal across the straits indeed wolves can and do disperse relatively long distances across ice peterson 1977 hutt 2003 linnell et al 2005 and as such successful dispersal across the straits would be bolstered by the persistence of on land refuge habitat near dispersal and arrival points therefore we saw an opportunity to use our model to identify potential dispersal routes across the straits using a combination of ice travel and patches of habitat suitable for dispersal as stepping stones through relatively unsuitable or high risk landscape theoretically a dispersing wolf would choose between traversing greater distances of ice or spend more time traversing through unsuitable habitat on land our model indicates that a suitable travel corridor in the up terminates in the hiawatha national forest northwest of point la barbe see fig 4 this particular area near the mackinac bridge represents the shortest water ice distance between the up and the nlp 6 km however there is a considerable distance of unsuitable habitat between the small patch of suitable habitat just north of point la barbe plb and the habitat that terminates in the hiawatha national forest fig 5 crossing near the mackinac bridge would therefore represent the least amount of time spent on ice but ultimately navigating through approximately 4 5 km of unsuitable habitat and high human activity due to cities near the bridge on land another speculative route would again involve dispersing from the hiawatha national forest to the large habitat patch northwest of point la barbe but traveling approximately 4 5 km on ice to st helena island then dispersing another 10 km on ice if it entered the nlp at the habitat patch at mcgulpin point or 12 km if it entered in the larger habitat patch within wilderness state park this potential route would reduce time spent traversing in unsuitable habitat on land 715 m but would increase the travel distances on ice to potentially 17 km a final speculative route would be a mix of ice and island travel beginning in the up at the habitat patch on the eastern edge of the minor peninsula crossing approximately 11 km of ice to mackinac island another 2 km combined ice travel to round island and bois blanc islands and finally 8 km ice travel to cheboygan state park on the mainland of the nlp our models did not include round and bois blanc islands due to lack of data however these islands are heavily forested with very few roads or developed areas making them likely to be suitable for wolf travel mackinac island has a high level of human activity during snow less seasons however is very sparsely populated during winter months and could likely be easily traversed by wolves at that time 4 2 conclusions while previous studies of wolf habitat suitability in the great lakes region have shown adequate habitat availability at the home range level our study used a multi scale modeling approach and revealed that other levels of critical habitat may be lacking in michigan s nlp individuals need to be capable of moving through the landscape beyond their natal areas to find resources and unoccupied habitat as well as maintain genetic flow between groups hanski and gilpin 1997 young and clarke 2000 for the wide ranging gray wolf landscape habitat suitability beyond home range needs to be assessed as well as micro scale habitat such as denning and birthing grounds a large portion of den habitat in the nlp was identified on private hunt club property potentially making conservation and management challenging the lower permeability of the nlp landscape combined with low input levels from founding wolf populations in the up may lead to isolated populations and thus genetic inbreeding issues shaffer 1978 gilpin and soule 1986 walker and craighead 1997 low population numbers and high human presence in the nlp may also confound establishment of resident wolf populations as conflict with humans and thus high mortality is probable inclusion of first and third order habitat suitability provided a more comprehensive assessment of wolf habitat suitability and recolonization potential in the nlp indicating that areal estimates of available second order habitat alone may potentially overestimate the number of wolves the nlp could support our results suggest that gray wolves may benefit from increased connectivity of habitat patches in michigan s nlp to fully use identified suitable habitat because road density plays an important role in landscape connectivity permeability model minimizing road effects within our identified dispersal corridors may be a conservation option saunders and hobbs 1991 in addition land managers can use our identified potential routes of dispersal between the nlp and up to target monitoring activities to key patches and if being used provide added protections to enhance recolonizing the nlp given our finding that nlp landscape has adequate but more disconnected suitable habitat to support dispersing individuals and breeding packs determining the effects of potentially increased mortality and energy expenditure while dispersing on recolonization potential is an important aspect requiring additional research and conservation measures hierarchical habitat modeling can provide a more complete picture of landscape habitat suitability and often have stronger inference abilities than a single level alone johnson et al 2004 decesare et al 2012 mcgarigal et al 2016 zeller et al 2017 our modeling technique using gis and expert opinion presents a unique opportunity for other locales and other highly mobile species to be modeled relatively quickly and inexpensively applying our hierarchical approach integrates habitat selection theory as well as an assessment of spatial structure that

25103,following decades of absence the gray wolf canis lupus has recolonized much of the northern great lakes region from canada and remnant populations in northern minnesota the wolf population in michigan s upper peninsula may now be reaching saturation with evidence that some dispersing individuals have traversed the straits of mackinac during ice over winter conditions indicating potential recolonization of northern lower michigan while previous research suggests suitable habitat exists in northern lower michigan to support a small wolf population habitat availability at other hierarchical levels including den habitat and the ability of individuals to disperse successfully among suitable habitat patches has not been assessed we evaluated the den habitat availability and landscape connectivity using a multi scale modeling approach that integrates hierarchical habitat selection theory as well as spatial structure to assess whether corridors exist for wolves to successfully recolonize and raise pups in northern lower michigan we used expert opinion scientific literature and geographical information systems to develop models of landscape suitability resistance and least cost path analysis to identify dispersal corridors throughout the upper and northern lower peninsulas of michigan based on our models the upper peninsula was almost entirely amenable to wolves for both denning and dispersing particularly in the western portion of the peninsula our estimates indicate that over 1900 km2 of high quality den habitat exists in northern lower michigan but landscape permeability between these habitat patches appeared relatively low relative to upper michigan we delineated several corridors of high quality habitat in the upper peninsula that may facilitate dispersal in to lower michigan dispersal corridors were of moderate quality in northern lower michigan representing higher mortality risk but potentially capable of promoting recolonization of high quality habitat areas conservation efforts within these identified corridors may further increase the potential for successful recolonization and establishment of viable long term breeding populations of gray wolves in northern lower michigan keywords hierarchical habitat modeling gray wolf canis lupus gis landscape permeability least cost paths great lakes 1 introduction the selection of habitats by animals is a multilevel multi decision process that can be broken down into 3 general orders 1 first order selection is a coarse scale selection pertaining to selection of the physical or geographical range of a species 2 second order selection is found within the range of the first and determines the home range of an individual or social group 3 third order selection pertains to the use of various habitat components within the home range johnson 1980 as such analyzing habitat selection within a hierarchical framework can identify differences in habitat preferences among levels weaver et al 2012 zeller et al 2017 multi scale habitat modeling often produces stronger and more reliable inferences than using a single level alone johnson et al 2004 holland et al 2004 wasserman et al 2012 decesare et al 2012 zeller et al 2014 mcgarigal et al 2016 however many studies of gray wolf canis lupus habitat and or probability of occurrence in the great lakes region have focused solely on second order selection at the home range level e g mladenoff et al 1995 mladenoff and sickley 1998 mladenoff et al 1999 wydeven et al 2001 potvin et al 2005 gehring and potter 2005 much of this research has centered on the influence of road density on gray wolf occurrence and survivability whereby road density serves as a proxy for potential human contact while human presence is important in predicting wolf habitat and occupancy other landscape factors e g cover type terrain etc are clearly of significance to wolves to fulfill basic life history requirements furthermore models of wolf habitat solely focused at the home range level may be too simplistic neglecting to assess limiting factors or habitat preferences at other scales of selection within johnson s 1980 hierarchical habitat selection theory it is likely that wolves travel through and select a region on the landscape then select an area to establish a home range and lastly select the microscale location to birth and raise pups den and rendezvous sites unger et al 2009 therefore assessing landscape habitat suitability requires not only identifying suitable habitat for the establishment of a home range but also identifying potential barriers to dispersal first order and habitat suitable for the successful birthing and rearing of young third order arctic tundra wolves canis lupus albus for example have shown a strong association with eskers as den habitat therefore availability of suitable of den site habitat may be a limiting factor affecting habitat selection patterns at higher levels mcloughlin et al 2004 houle et al 2010 and lesmerises et al 2012 found similar patterns of habitat selection at the within home range level in canada where wolf occurrence and activity was influenced more by timber harvesting and other anthropogenic activity during denning rendezvous season than during other life events e g nomadic periods relatively less is known about the mechanisms behind long distance wolf dispersal linnell et al 2005 however advancements in landscape genetics techniques have provided some evidence that natural and anthropogenic landscape barriers do exist for these highly mobile habitat generalists carmichael et al 2001 showed that physical barriers in that case the mackenzie river in the northwest territories canada and prey specialization may govern large scale wolf movements geffen et al 2004 found patterns of genetic isolation at a continental scale in north american wolf populations that appeared to be related to habitat and climate anthropogenic barriers to wolf dispersal often include high volume and or high density road systems as wolves tend to avoid areas of high human activity and disturbance jensen et al 1986 mech 1989 whittington et al 2005 oakleaf et al 2006 in fact relatedness within packs has been found to be greater near major roads suggesting decreased dispersal from natal packs with proximity to roads cullingham et al 2016 given the complexities of habitat selection and movement for a highly mobile mammal we integrated expert opinion into a hierarchical modeling approach to better understand gray wolf habitat suitability and availability in michigan our model assessed habitat suitability at multiple levels in both michigan s upper peninsula up where wolves currently exist and michigan s northern lower peninsula nlp where wolves may potentially recolonize if adequate habitat corridors are maintained this approach allowed us to compare quality and quantity of habitat in known wolf range with habitat in potential wolf range the up wolf population is estimated at 600 individuals and is likely near carrying capacity michigan department of natural resources 2015 as the up population becomes saturated the likelihood for individuals to disperse into the nlp may increase gehring and potter 2005 estimated that enough suitable land area exists to support the home range level occupancy of 50 100 wolves in the nlp although other hierarchical levels of habitat in michigan has not been evaluated until now as saturated wolf populations expand and re inhabit greater portions of their former range it will be imperative to identify not just suitable home range habitat but also critical breeding patches and the landscape permeability between them this is particularly germane in human dominated areas of wolf recolonization such as the nlp where habitat is fragmented and the potential for wolf human conflict is high unger et al 2009 this study therefore assessed and integrated habitat suitability at multiple scales bridging first order landscape permeability to second order home range suitability based on past work by mladenoff et al 1995 and gehring and potter 2005 and finally third order selection den rendezvous site habitat to better understand habitat suitability and permeability at large scales to our knowledge hierarchical models of wolf habitat suitability are scarce and ours is the first of its kind in the great lakes region 2 methods 2 1 study area our study area included the entire upper peninsula of michigan as well as the northern lower peninsula which is considered to be all areas north of michigan highway m 55 the up is a 42 896 km2 area dominated by boreal forest and mesic conifer and deciduous stands with interspersed agricultural lands the nlp covers 27 656 km2 of land and is a mosaic of northern hardwood forests and boreal coniferous wetlands interspersed with intermittent agriculture and urban areas state owned public land dominates ownership of large tracts of land in the nlp including the pigeon river country state forest prcsf a 477 5 km2 multi use managed forest tract in addition a vast expanse approximately 583 km2 combined area of privately owned club properties lie approximately 60 km to the south east of the prcsf creating a contiguous tract of near roadless forest 2 2 modeling overview we used a modeling approach that combines expert opinion best available knowledge from literature and environmental spatial data peer reviewed literature and expert information can be used with computer technologies such as geographic information systems gis to develop predictive habitat models in a relatively short period of time store and kanagas 2001 clevenger et al 2002 yamada et al 2003 perera et al 2012 while empirical studies of den and dispersal habitat selection patterns in the great lakes exist e g thiel 1985 thiel et al 1998 wydeven et al 2001 norris et al 2002 treves et al 2009 it was necessary to use expert opinion to quantify the relative importance of habitat variables to wolves when dispersing through the landscape and selecting critical den habitat furthermore an important aspect of our study was to assess availability of critical habitat and the permeability of the nlp for dispersing wolves an area that has not had an established wolf population for nearly 100 years stebler 1944 therefore empirical data for this area does not currently exist expert opinion data and gis evaluations have been used to study large carnivores and habitat potential in the past including black bears ursus americanus clevenger et al 2002 florida panthers puma concolor coryi thatcher et al 2006 and cougars puma concolor larue and nielsen 2008 using these techniques we developed models of habitat suitability landscape permeability resistance and least cost paths a technique often used for determining dispersal corridors meegan and maehr 2002 schad et al 2002 larkin et al 2004 kautz et al 2006 penrod et al 2006 2 3 expert surveys we created a survey to obtain expert opinion on variable importance variables were chosen from published literature on the ecological and life history requirements of wolves focusing specifically in the lake states region we distributed the survey to 13 species experts working for university state and federal agencies in the u s great lakes region and ontario canada den rendezvous habitat variables that were ranked by experts included distance to water joslin 1967 unger 1999 norris et al 2002 trapp 2004 association with sandy soil pulliainen 1965 joslin 1967 ballard and dau 1983 fuller 1989 unger 1999 trapp 2004 land cover type fuller 1989 norris et al 2002 theuerkauf and jedrzejewski 2003 trapp 2004 and distance to roads unger 1999 wydeven et al 2001 theuerkauf and jedrzejewski 2003 distance to roads was chosen for the den model rather than road density because distance to a road may be more appropriate for sensitive and spatially static den sites where we predicted distance from human influence is highly critical variables related to travel corridors presented for expert ranking included road density mladenoff et al 1995 houts 2002 land cover type fritts and mech 1981 licht and fritts 1994 wydeven et al 2001 whittington et al 2004 prey density mech 1977 boyd and pletscher 1999 potvin et al 2005 and topographic position ream et al 1985 species experts were asked to quantify the relative importance of each habitat variable by assigning a weight i e percentage of 100 to each variable and rank the attribute classes within each variable e g within the land cover variable there are several land cover types such as upland deciduous lowland deciduous barren urban etc weights identified the importance of each variable in relation to the other landscape characteristics where 100 would identify a deterministic habitat variable in which no other landscape variables are required for suitability attribute class ranks identify suitabilities of a range of data or attribute specific to a given variable based on a biological suitability score ranging from 0 to 100 but do not need to equal 100 appendix a adapted from beier et al 2007 weights and ranks were averaged to obtain a final value see appendices b and c 2 4 geospatial data modeling processes were completed in arcgis 10 1 esri redlands ca using raster data with minimum mapping unit of 30 m michigan land cover data was obtained from the michigan center for geographic data online data library catalog www mcgi state mi us mgdl accessed may 2007 and reclassified from its original 32 classifications to 11 based on expert survey responses reclassification was conducted because the scientific literature for wolves and many other species often does not distinguish between the suitabilities of highly related land cover types beier et al 2007 additionally wolves have not been shown to actively select for specific types of habitat but rather exhibit avoidance of areas of high human disturbance thiel 1985 mladenoff et al 1995 areas with high human influence typically include cropland urban areas roads etc which are represented in the simplified classifications the open water landcover type was considered to be static i e conversion to ice in winter months was not considered soil data were obtained from the natural resource conservation service nrcs online soil data mart http soildatamart nrcs usda gov soil physical properties percent sand were extracted using the nrcs soil data viewer 5 1 road data were obtained from the michigan center for geographic data online data library catalog mgf version 7 may 2007 framework unimproved forest roads were removed as these roads are readily used by wolves and are often incorporated into their home ranges mladenoff et al 1995 gehring 1995 euclidean distance was used to estimate distance from a road road density was calculated using 10 km moving window neighborhood analysis following mladenoff et al 1995 gehring and potter 2005 road densities were categorized for ranking according to mladenoff et al s 1995 corresponding likelihood of wolf occurrence distance to water was calculated from michigan river stream and lake data obtained from mgf version 7 hydrography framework www mcgi state mi us mgdl may 2007 lake polygons originated from the michigan department of natural resources institute for fisheries research relatively small water features e g ephemeral narrow and or shallow streams and small lakes ponds are often more associated with den and rendezvous sites than large or rapidly moving waters joslin 1967 norris et al 2002 therefore major water bodies were excluded from analysis small rivers and streams data were considered features classified as h31 and h32 from miris level 7 l blastic michigan department of natural resources pers comm small lakes and ponds were considered to be 1 ha in size per largest documented lake size in joslin 1967 euclidean distance tools up to 10 000 m were run separately on lake and river shapefiles and the resulting raster outputs were combined using erdas imagine hexagon group inc sweden for a single distance to water dataset a topographic position raster was derived from the digital elevation model dem michigan center for geographic data online data library catalog topographic position for each cell was classified as valley ridgetop flat or slope in relation to neighborhood cells within 200 m valley was defined as an elevation of at least 12 m less than the average of the neighborhood cells ridgetop as an elevation of at least 12 m greater than the average of the neighborhood cells and flat as having a slope 6 and did not fit the valley or ridgetop classification slope was defined as 6 and did not fit valley or ridgetop classification topographic classifications followed beier et al 2007 2 5 habitat suitability modeling habitat suitability index hsi rasters were created for den habitat and landscape permeability using the arcgis extension tool corridordesigner beier et al 2007 we used weighted geometric mean to incorporate weighted factors and ranked classes as weighted geometric mean has the ability to incorporate deterministic factors beier et al 2007 a deterministic habitat factor is one that has to be present in high quality habitat while a non deterministic factor has a trade off with some other factor store and kanagas 2001 this concept can also be applied to a limiting deterministic factor where the presence of a particular landscape characteristic e g urban may render the pixel as absolute non habitat even if all other factors e g topography distance to water etc are ideal geometric mean accomplishes this because it is calculated using the product of the terms to the nth root thereby retaining an overall score of 0 if any of the terms are rated as such the algorithm used for combining weighted habitat factors was therefore suitability or permeability sn wn where sn is the score for each factor and wn is the weight for that factor and represents the geometric mean the resultant hsi rasters contained pixels that contained a single index value to represent the relative suitability of that area raster data of habitat suitability permeability was normalized on a scale of 0 100 to represent biological interpretations of habitat suitabilities appendix a 2 6 den rendezvous site habitat we identified den rendezvous site habitat patches from the den hsi raster using neighborhood analysis with a 250 m circular moving window on cells with a hsi score 60 basis for removal of habitat 60 hsi is to represent all den habitat patches that are suitable for denning on a consistent basis per hsi definitions appendix a we defined breeding patches as 1 ha assuming highest frequency of wolf use at den sites occurs within an approximate 50 m radius unger 1999 theuerkauf and jedrzejewski 2003 trapp 2004 habitat patches within the nlp were clipped to include only areas which lie within areas defined as suitable for general pack home range based on gehring and potter 2005 this more accurately identifies suitable den habitat in the nlp as third order selection typically occurs within the range of second order selection johnson 1980 euclidean distance nearest neighbor analyses were performed on up and nlp den habitat patches using arcgis 10 1 spatial statistics tools 2 7 dispersal corridors we used least cost path methods to develop likely dispersal corridors using the permeability raster as the resistance environment through which to move this technique models the relative cost or ability for an animal to permeate the landscape between two suitable habitat patches penrod et al 2006 based on how characteristics such as land cover roads or slope may affect the animal singleton et al 2002 penrod et al 2006 least cost path lcp analyses will create a path with the least resistance greatest permeability and fewest barriers to movement larkin et al 2004 and identify the best route for a dispersing animal larue and nielsen 2008 large areas of suitable critical den habitat developed from our den habitat patch model were used as source and destination locations for our corridors within the up blocks of suitable den habitat found within ottawa and hiawatha national forests were chosen as source and destination habitats these habitat patches were chosen somewhat subjectively while sufficiently large patches of suitable den habitat were identified within many ownership classifications federal state private etc we chose these patches both for their likely stability in ownership and natural status i e likely to remain in federal national forest ownership and thus likely to remain free from human development as well as geographic location for constructing potential dispersal corridors in other words because a goal of our study was to assess how wolves might move across the landscape in the up it was necessary to choose suitable start and end points for lcp corridor modeling that would facilitate the simulation of a corridor that traversed the up a final corridor was modeled to extend to the southeastern most block of suitable habitat in the up near the straits of mackinac to illustrate potential crossing locations into the nlp within the nlp a corridor was modeled using den habitat within wilderness state park in emmet county the den habitat block nearest to up populations as the source the destination for the corridor was the largest contiguous habitat block in the nlp consisting of mostly private hunt recreation club property in alcona oscoda and montmorency counties while this is private land much of it has remained unaltered for many years and is surrounded by a matrix of public land pigeon river country state forest to the north huron national forest to the south we used a neighborhood analysis to average neighboring pixels to determine a corridor with the least cost or greatest permeability a 500 m circular moving window neighborhood analysis of all pixels 60 hsi permeability index was used neighborhood effects are determined by species sensitivity to edge effects and perceptual range beier et al 2007 it is likely that wolves have a broad perceptual range gehring and swihart 2003 therefore the maximum window size was chosen 2 8 evaluation of dispersal corridors our dispersal corridors are displayed in terms of permeability with the various colored slices of least cost paths representing varying levels of permeability for example the 0 1 lcp represents the most permeable 0 1 of the landscape up to the most permeable 10 corridors were also assessed for spatial bottlenecks which were considered areas 200 m in width to prevent close contact with human inhabitance boyd and pletscher 1999 corridors were evaluated for maximum width so that no area of the corridor exceeded 10 km in width based on the radius of an average summer home range for wolves in the great lakes region rossler 2007 the latter was used to prevent establishing a corridor large enough for a wolf pack to become resident and prevent passage by other individuals i e displaying territorial behavior within a corridor maximum widths were also assessed for purposes of feasibility from a management standpoint average widths were calculated using the bottleneck statistics tool and least distance analysis was performed using the patch distance statistics tool within the corridordesigner extension 2 9 validation of den model we obtained ex post facto location data of field verified wolf dens n 18 detected using satellite and radio collared wolves in the up from 2009 to 2014 mississippi state university unpublished data and compared these locations to hsi values generated by our den model because much of the up landscape contains suitable den habitat we also compared the empirical data to the frequency at which random points would be within suitable den habitat patches from our model hsi 60 and area 1 ha to do this we used arcgis 10 1 to generate 10 datasets of 18 random sites across the up landscape we compared known den location successes den was located within a wolf den habitat patch from our model and failures point was not located within a wolf den habitat patch we conducted the same comparison with the 10 iterations of 18 random points we then performed chi squared goodness of fit tests on the success failure rate of the known wolf den locations compared with the 10 datasets of random sites to test if known den locations were within den patches developed by our model more than would be expected by random chance 3 results 3 1 den rendezvous site habitat model averaged results of species expert surveys n 8 rendered distance to water as the most important variable in den habitat quality followed by distance to roads land cover and sand composition in soil appendix b moderate to short distances 80 m from water were considered the most suitable and distances 200 m were considered least suitable yet suitable enough for occasional to moderate use with a score of 40 experts ranked distances from roads 2000 m as having a high likelihood for den and pup success and areas 500 m as least suitable mixed forest was identified as the most suitable cover type followed by upland coniferous the least suitable and only limiting factor with a score of 0 habitat type was open water followed by urban areas with a very low score of 1 a sand composition of 75 100 was considered as the most suitable class within the soil type factor the least suitable class was non sandy soil types although still ranking high enough to support occasional wolf den activity den habitat suitability modeling fig 1 suggested widespread availability of high quality den habitat hsi 80 throughout the up but lower availability throughout the nlp available den habitat in the up totaled 26 417 km2 and is approximately 90 of the area identified by mladenoff et al 1995 as suitable for general home range habitat euclidean distance analysis 4 nearest neighbors between up den habitat patches 60 hsi revealed a minimum inter patch distance of 67 m maximum of 54 9 km and an average distance of 3 1 km in the nlp available den habitat was 1906 km2 which is approximately 87 of the land area predicted as suitable for general home range set up by gehring and potter 2005 inter patch distances between nlp den habitat patches were 778 m 50 9 km and 6 2 km respectively in the up the highest quality den habitat was concentrated in the western portion of the peninsula within the nlp the majority of den habitat was distributed throughout private club country land to the southeast however quality habitat was also identified in areas of public ownership such as in wilderness state park in the northwest and within the pigeon river country state forest in the northeast proportional analysis of hsi scores identified den habitat in the up as being greater in both quality and quantity than within the nlp fig 2 most 35 den habitat identified in the up fell within the highest suitability index class of 80 100 and approximately 28 in the second highest suitability class hsi 60 80 the largest proportion 46 of den habitat in the nlp was identified as marginal quality 30 60 hsi and 32 of habitat within the 60 80 hsi range only approximately 11 of the land area in the nlp is of the best habitat suitability 80 hsi for denning 3 2 den model validation known den locations in the up aligned well with our den habitat patch model with 89 n 16 of the known points falling within modeled den habitat with a mean hsi value of 78 random point datasets had a mean success rate of 61 range 8 13 successes chi square goodness of fit tests table 1 indicated that the observed successes of the known den locations are statistically different than expected from random distributions χ2 10 9 p 0 0009 α 0 01 df 1 while all random iterations of locations indicate the number of successes do not differ from expected values 3 3 landscape connectivity model species experts ranked land cover as the most important dispersal corridor variable followed by road density and topographic position appendix c the prey density variable was dropped due to relatively low expert ranking and lack of reliable prey density data in michigan within the land cover variable lowland coniferous and lowland deciduous were ranked the most suitable land cover types for dispersal respectively experts ranked a road density range of 0 38 km km2 as most suitable for travel least suitable were road densities 0 53 km km2 however this was still given a relatively permeable score of 31 within the topographic position variable valleys were given the most suitable score for travel modeling efforts suggested high permeability of the landscape for wolves throughout the up and much less permeability throughout the nlp especially west of interstate 75 which traverses down the center of the peninsula approximately 40 of the landscape in the up was estimated to contain highly suitable habitat 80 hsi for successful wolf travel and another 8 6 of the landscape was estimated to contain habitat of moderate suitability 61 80 hsi fig 3 the nlp is of much lower quality proportionally with only approximately 15 of the land area being of optimal permeability and only another 4 6 being moderately suitable more than 50 of the nlp is of low or marginal quality 31 60 hsi and approximately 30 is completely unusable very high energy mortality for travel 30 hsi the route of greatest permeability connecting den habitat in the ottawa national forest in the west to habitat in the easternmost block of the hiawatha national forest measured 379 km in length fig 4 forested cover types represented 88 of this path 35 deciduous 42 coniferous mixed 11 and agricultural lands made up 1 additional cover types included small amounts of interspersed water wetland 9 paved barren and urban land all 1 each a large corridor was modeled in the nlp connecting den habitat in wilderness state park in the northwest to large blocks of den habitat in the largely privately owned club country in the southeastern nlp the corridor s main route along the northeastern shore of the peninsula henceforth referred to as the eastern branch is the route of highest suitability as it contains the most permeable 0 1 of the landscape this eastern branch contained 72 forested cover type 43 coniferous 23 deciduous 6 mixed 14 water wetlands 10 barren pasture 2 agriculture 1 paved and 1 urban the minimum width was 3 4 km and maximum width was 10 7 km while this route contained the highest landscape permeability it also had greater inter patch distance than the alternative western route the alternative branch western branch of the corridor identified contained less suitable habitat but was identified by the model as containing the least inter patch distance the western branch of the lcp was 125 km in length and contained 74 forested land cover type 44 deciduous 24 coniferous 6 mixed 14 water wetland 9 pasture barren and 1 urban agriculture and paved this branch had a minimum width of 293 m and a maximum width of 7 km 4 discussion recent studies have shown that resource selection differs significantly during various life events or behavioral states abrahms et al 2017 and as such resource selection during dispersal for wide ranging carnivores may vary markedly from daily use and selection within the home range e g elliot et al 2014 zeller et al 2015 it is therefore important to understand habitat selection and suitability at multiple spatial scales that coincide with various life events for a species such as the gray wolf our study is the first to have integrated a multi scale hierarchical approach to wolf habitat suitability in the great lakes previous research conducted at the home range level gehring and potter 2005 suggested that enough habitat remains in michigan s nlp to support 50 100 wolves but the ability to traverse the landscapes between habitat patches to fully use identified suitable habitat was unknown our models suggest high quality and quantity of dispersal range first order and den rendezvous third order johnson 1980 habitat for wolves in michigan s upper peninsula however quality and quantity of both are greatly reduced in the nlp despite our estimates indicating that over 1900 km2 of high quality den habitat exists in the nlp permeability between these habitat patches is relatively low which may reduce accessibility to many of these areas for recolonizing wolves furthermore much of the largest unfragmented den habitat identified in the nlp were largely within private hunt club land owned by individuals that may or may not be tolerant of wolves given that tolerance of wolves by humans is potentially the most important factor in wolf survival and persistence in human dominated landscapes ballard et al 1987 fuller 1989 mech 1989 wydeven et al 2001 treves and bruskotter 2014 land ownership may be a significant issue in the recolonization of breeding populations of wolves in the nlp nevertheless notably large patches of den rendezvous site habitat on public lands were also identified in the northernmost areas of the nlp such as in wilderness state park in the northwest and the pidgeon river state park in the northeast which may support small populations of breeding wolves without the need to traverse significant portions of the landscape of the lower peninsula additionally modeling efforts identified potential dispersal corridors that while in an overall less permeable landscape than the up still represented habitat fairly amenable to dispersing wolves with greater than 70 forest cover and little to no urban areas thus lower connectivity between den patches may impede but not necessarily totally prevent the successful return and endurance of established wolf populations to the nlp 4 1 dispersal from up source populations further confounding the potential for recolonization is the likelihood that the input of new individuals into nlp populations may be perpetually low although field documentation and public reports indicate occasional dispersers arriving from the up for example in 2004 a radio collared female wolf originally from the up was accidentally trapped and killed in presque isle county michigan department of natural resources 2008 and in 2015 a gray wolf was detected via trail camera on the little traverse bay band of odawa indians ltbboi reservation and confirmed by genetic testing of scat ltbboi unpublished data both of these confirmed detections were relatively near to the straits of mackinac or straits narrow channel of water connecting lakes michigan and huron where wolves have been documented dispersing across ice in winter during full ice over williams 2003 we theorize that the straits area would be the most likely area for wolf dispersal across ice as even in milder winters the straits tend to obtain 80 ice over noaa grerl 2018 https www glerl noaa gov data ice historicalanim moreover ice breaking regimes that keep the straits open for shipping channels typically pause from late january through mid to late march miller 2017 allowing up to 6 8 weeks annually of potential dispersal across the straits indeed wolves can and do disperse relatively long distances across ice peterson 1977 hutt 2003 linnell et al 2005 and as such successful dispersal across the straits would be bolstered by the persistence of on land refuge habitat near dispersal and arrival points therefore we saw an opportunity to use our model to identify potential dispersal routes across the straits using a combination of ice travel and patches of habitat suitable for dispersal as stepping stones through relatively unsuitable or high risk landscape theoretically a dispersing wolf would choose between traversing greater distances of ice or spend more time traversing through unsuitable habitat on land our model indicates that a suitable travel corridor in the up terminates in the hiawatha national forest northwest of point la barbe see fig 4 this particular area near the mackinac bridge represents the shortest water ice distance between the up and the nlp 6 km however there is a considerable distance of unsuitable habitat between the small patch of suitable habitat just north of point la barbe plb and the habitat that terminates in the hiawatha national forest fig 5 crossing near the mackinac bridge would therefore represent the least amount of time spent on ice but ultimately navigating through approximately 4 5 km of unsuitable habitat and high human activity due to cities near the bridge on land another speculative route would again involve dispersing from the hiawatha national forest to the large habitat patch northwest of point la barbe but traveling approximately 4 5 km on ice to st helena island then dispersing another 10 km on ice if it entered the nlp at the habitat patch at mcgulpin point or 12 km if it entered in the larger habitat patch within wilderness state park this potential route would reduce time spent traversing in unsuitable habitat on land 715 m but would increase the travel distances on ice to potentially 17 km a final speculative route would be a mix of ice and island travel beginning in the up at the habitat patch on the eastern edge of the minor peninsula crossing approximately 11 km of ice to mackinac island another 2 km combined ice travel to round island and bois blanc islands and finally 8 km ice travel to cheboygan state park on the mainland of the nlp our models did not include round and bois blanc islands due to lack of data however these islands are heavily forested with very few roads or developed areas making them likely to be suitable for wolf travel mackinac island has a high level of human activity during snow less seasons however is very sparsely populated during winter months and could likely be easily traversed by wolves at that time 4 2 conclusions while previous studies of wolf habitat suitability in the great lakes region have shown adequate habitat availability at the home range level our study used a multi scale modeling approach and revealed that other levels of critical habitat may be lacking in michigan s nlp individuals need to be capable of moving through the landscape beyond their natal areas to find resources and unoccupied habitat as well as maintain genetic flow between groups hanski and gilpin 1997 young and clarke 2000 for the wide ranging gray wolf landscape habitat suitability beyond home range needs to be assessed as well as micro scale habitat such as denning and birthing grounds a large portion of den habitat in the nlp was identified on private hunt club property potentially making conservation and management challenging the lower permeability of the nlp landscape combined with low input levels from founding wolf populations in the up may lead to isolated populations and thus genetic inbreeding issues shaffer 1978 gilpin and soule 1986 walker and craighead 1997 low population numbers and high human presence in the nlp may also confound establishment of resident wolf populations as conflict with humans and thus high mortality is probable inclusion of first and third order habitat suitability provided a more comprehensive assessment of wolf habitat suitability and recolonization potential in the nlp indicating that areal estimates of available second order habitat alone may potentially overestimate the number of wolves the nlp could support our results suggest that gray wolves may benefit from increased connectivity of habitat patches in michigan s nlp to fully use identified suitable habitat because road density plays an important role in landscape connectivity permeability model minimizing road effects within our identified dispersal corridors may be a conservation option saunders and hobbs 1991 in addition land managers can use our identified potential routes of dispersal between the nlp and up to target monitoring activities to key patches and if being used provide added protections to enhance recolonizing the nlp given our finding that nlp landscape has adequate but more disconnected suitable habitat to support dispersing individuals and breeding packs determining the effects of potentially increased mortality and energy expenditure while dispersing on recolonization potential is an important aspect requiring additional research and conservation measures hierarchical habitat modeling can provide a more complete picture of landscape habitat suitability and often have stronger inference abilities than a single level alone johnson et al 2004 decesare et al 2012 mcgarigal et al 2016 zeller et al 2017 our modeling technique using gis and expert opinion presents a unique opportunity for other locales and

anadromous lifestyle that takes them from spawning grounds to the high seas and back again to complete their life cycle groot and margolis 1991 in the past several decades many salmon species and

van vliet et al 2013 wade et al 2013 in these studies if water temperature exceeds the predefined threshold in one location the local salmon population is assumed to be under threat this approach ignores the fact that salmon respond nonlinearly to stream temperature with an optimum temperature range for growth epa 2001 carter 2005 elliott and elliott 2010 an optimum temperature range enhances growth and performance of salmon stocks and survival chances are higher because of sufficient food availability lower vulnerability to diseases more optimal physiological performance and so forth

impacts based on upper tolerable temperature alone tends to overestimate the negative influences from temperature warming as it neglects the benefit of temperature rises from below to within the optimum range to growth particularly during periods such as early life stages where rapid growth is critical such discussions are particularly salient if there is hope that current actions to stem carbon emissions see ipcc 2007 buob and stephan 2011 could be successful such that water temperatures will not increase perpetually this study incorporates the nonlinear response of salmon to ambient

historical and projected water demand time series are provided at a monthly scale and applied uniformly within each month since mosart runs at an hourly time step the impacts of two rcp emissions and land use and land cover scenarios are compared rcp8 5 is a business as usual scenario that stabilizes the global radiative forcing at 8 5 w m2 by 2100 and rcp4 5 is a mitigation scenario capping the global radiative forcing at 4 5 w m2 by end of 21st century the mean temperature of crb projected by the regional earth system model driven by the community cesm4 falls well within the range and close to the average of 27 global climate models table 1 in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 fig 3 the regional climate simulations used in model evaluation were bias corrected to

mcnary dam to bonneville dam and upper columbia rock island dam to mcnary dam after data screening statistical model performance and bootstrap robustness subyearling chinook at snake river is used in this study fig 1 shows the main reaches and the locations of the observation sites within crb the observation period for smolt survival estimates is may 20 june 30 for subyearling chinook and april 17 may 28 for steelhead observed data of environmental parameters during the same period were obtained from columbia basin research columbia research center columbia river basin 2017 for 11 dam locations within the three reaches lower granite dam little goose dam lower monumental dam ice harbor dam mcnary dam john day dam the dalles dam bonneville dam rock island dam priest rapids dam wanapum dam and then averaged by the river reach the weekly bi weekly survival rate data and daily environmental parameters were aggregated over the observed period to represent inter year variations a log linear multiple regression analysis is performed to relate the observed annual smolt survival rate to water temperature and discharge as predictor variables a log transformation of the estimates of survival probabilities is used to stabilize the variance and model a multiplicative effect the relationship between survival rate and stream temperature has a clear nonlinear pattern in agreement with carter 2005 temperature related parameters are fit as a quadratic function an optimal range around 11 15 c for chinook and 9 13 c for steelhead is found with survival rate increasing and decreasing with water temperature below and above the optimal range fig 4 the optimal temperature ranges are determined based on three criteria 1 observed survival estimates are relatively high in this range with obvious increase with temperature before this range and decline after this range 2 regression from bootstrap resampling shows relative consistency which implies this range is stable and not significantly affected by sample size 3 a comparison across literature epa 2001 carter 2005 wade et al 2013 mantua 2015 confirms the selected ranges are reasonable representation for smolt survival in crb generally steelhead is more sensitive to stream temperature rise compared to chinook the steelhead survival rate decreases rapidly above 13 c and is less than 0 4 above 15 c smolt survival rate generally increases with discharge quadratic function is chosen to represent the nonlinearity inherent in the relationship between estimated survival rate ŝ and mean stream temperature tave as well as maximum stream temperature tmax without increasing the regression complexity significantly linear function is used for streamflow related parameters mean discharge qave and min discharge qmin in this case this combination of functions has been used in comprehensive passage model compass and shown reasonable explanatory power zabel et al 2008 the model equation used in the regression analysis was 1

squares the r square of regression of chinook survival rate with the four parameters is 0 87 the corresponding r square for steelhead is 0 51 the p value for the regression model is less than 0 001 table 2 the uncertainty in the regression model due to the limited historical sample is estimated by bootstrap resampling of the historical data 100 bootstrap samples dashed lines in fig 4 show 95 confidence intervals from bootstrap resampling the fitted patterns and trends remain consistent which suggests the statistical relationships between survival rate and the four environmental parameters for subyearling chinook and smolt steelhead hold solid model evaluation is performed by feeding the regression models with simulated reanalysis historical streamflow and stream temperature of 1998 2012 that has been bias corrected to reproduce the mean and variance of the observed surface temperature and precipitation experiment sim another experiment is designed by feeding observed climate data to the regression model experiment reg to delineate bias from the regression model and earth system model mean bias between survival rate from experiment sim and observed values is about 19 for smolt chinook and 22 for juvenile steelhead and that between experiment reg and observation is 0 3 for chinook and 12 for steelhead results suggest the regression models produce satisfactory smolt survival rate with accurate environmental parameters although the earth system framework mosart has been validated across the contiguous us and widely used in many studies it focuses on large scale studies and needs to be further calibrated for regional studies a comparison of the simulated streamflow and temperature fig 5 at five dam locations in crb shows that mosart tends to underestimate water temperature in the main channel during migration season of juvenile steelhead april may which would lead to an underestimate of survival rate for steelhead in historical period 3 results 3 1 climate warming induced temperature change stream temperature is projected to warm throughout crb in the 2040s and 2080s under both climate scenarios rcp4 5 and 8 5 fig 6 illustrates the spatial distribution of water temperature in crb for chinook left column and steelhead right column of historical and future periods with climate change effects alone colors represent the temperature zone for the two species respectively water temperature of lower than 11 c is below optimal for chinook blue colors 11 15 c is the optimum zone green colors and higher than 15 c yellow colors is stressful for chinook temperature lower than 9 c is sub optimal for steelhead the optimum range is 9 13 c and temperature rising above 13 c is stressful for steelhead the optimum temperatures for juvenile chinook and steelhead are derived based on the correlation between observed survival estimates and migration season mean stream temperature on mainstreams of columbia and snake river fig 4 the difference between the optimum temperature of chinook and steelhead results not only from the different sensitivity of each species to water temperature but also variations in the migration season juvenile chinook migrate around may 20 june 30 while juvenile steelhead migrate around april 17 may 28 based on the data from the fish passage center fish passage center fpc 2017 results show that water temperature in the main stream of lower columbia river which is downstream of crb is within the optimum range for juvenile chinook in the historical period but is shifted to be stressful by the 2080s stream temperature in lower columbia is currently below optimum for steelhead but rises to the optimal range for juvenile steelhead due to climate warming by the 2080s stream temperature of upper columbia river is below the optimum range in the historical period for smolt chinook and steelhead but it will shift to the optimal zone for both species by the 2080s current temperature in snake river is within the optimum range for juvenile chinook it shifts to stressful in the 2040s even with a mitigation climate scenario rcp4 5 and is likely to be lethal for smolt chinook by the 2080s in contrast steelhead may benefit from temperature increase in snake river with temperature shifting from below optimum to optimum by the 2080s 3 2 water management impacts river regulation has significant influences on stream flow arheimer et al 2017 here we compare water management including regulation and water withdrawal effects on daily discharge during the migration period of smolt chinook and steelhead fig 7 illustrates the historical and future cumulative distribution of discharge in upper columbia lower columbia and snake river climate change solid lines results in consistent flow decline in columbia and snake river during the migration season of chinook smolts 5 20 6 30 fig 7 d f in contrast it leads to more flow in upper columbia during the migration season of steelhead smolts fig 7 l the effects of water management on streamflow depend on whether upstream reservoirs release or store water and how much water is withdrawn from the channels water management dashed lines in general reduces flow in upper columbia fig 7 f and l and has a mixed effect on streamflow in snake river fig 7 e and k if water releases in june can offset water withdrawals channel flow in the snake river is predicted to increase lower columbia is downstream of upper columbia and snake so its flow is affected by the accumulated effects from upstream regulation as well as regulation and withdrawal within its own segment fig 7 also presents the probability distribution of stream temperature during the migration season and how it relates to the optimum temperature climate change solid lines leads to uniform shifts of temperature to higher values interestingly water management dashed lines also results in a noticeable shift to the right for upper and lower columbia river as flow is reduced by regulation the heat exchange between the warmer air and the reduced volume of water likely increases and elevates water temperature since stream temperature in the main channels is generally cooler than the overlying air during april june fig 8 water management has minor effects on stream temperature in snake river which can be attributed to the negligible changes in streamflow 3 3 changes of juvenile survival the stream temperature and discharge at the main stems of columbia and snake river simulated by the integrated human nature system model li et al 2015 are used as inputs to the regression model to quantify smolt survival at three main reaches upper columbia lower columbia and snake in crb results show that juvenile chinook and steelhead inhabiting the upper columbia may benefit with warmer climate fig 9 projected mean survival rates are likely to increase by more than 10 for both species largely because the water temperature shifts to the optimum range with climate change fig 7 in contrast survival rates of juvenile chinook and steelhead in lower columbia may decline by the 2080s and even by the 2040s under the more aggressive climate scenario rcp8 5 this results from the combined effects of temperature stress and decreased streamflow smolt chinook in snake river tends to decline by 12 23 till the 2040s and 15 43 by the end of this century caused by stressful temperature warming and less flow in the river channels juvenile steelhead on the contrary may expect more than 10 increase in survival rate by the 2040s due to the preferable water temperature there is no significant change in inter year variability of survival rates for most scenarios except in the 2080s under rcp8 5 this abrupt increase is mainly attributed to the larger variability in maximum temperature fig 10 extreme hot temperatures projected in this business as usual scenario are lethal for salmonid stocks and result in low survival rate 4 discussion and conclusions instead of using a tipping point to classify water temperature into suitable and lethal this study acknowledges the fact that the biological response of salmon to water temperature is continuous and nonlinear and incorporates the nonlinear response into climate change impact analysis our results suggest that whether climate warming brings detrimental or beneficial effects on juvenile salmon depends on its relation with the optimum temperature range if warming results in temperature closer to or within the optimum range then it enhances smolt growth if temperature rises beyond the preferred temperature range then it becomes stressful for salmonids and may reduce survival rate we recognize that there can be population specific thermal optima at scales more refined than what we used in this paper as such further efforts to characterize population specific thermal performance e g like eliason et al 2011 would be particularly important for future model refinement another key finding of this study was that water mangement including reserovir regulation and water withdrawl is seamlessly coupled within the earth system model to provide a realistic representation of streamflow water temperature and juvenile survival water management reduces flow in the channel and causes temperature rise in columbia river during smolt migration season this study provides survival projections of juvenile chinook and steelhead with spatial details as well as insight on how interactions between climate change and water management may affect smolts in crb similar modeling exercises extending through to the adult spawning migration would be particularly informative in the future previous literature found that climate change has negative impacts on juvenile survival rate mantua et al 2010 benjamin et al 2013 van vliet et al 2013 wade et al 2013 walters et al 2013 ward et al 2015 debano et al 2016 this study shows that the effects of climate change vary by location climate change scenario and specie there are two possible reasons for the differences first many studies examined the frequency or time of reaching lethal threshold based on one or multiple metrics mantua et al 2010 van vliet et al 2013 ward et al 2015 debano et al 2016 or utilized linear relationship between survival and temperature walters et al 2013 which do not capture the inherent nonlinearity of survival rate response to physical parameters in particular the effects of optimal stream temperature range are not considered second effects of regulation on streamflow and stream temperature are not considered in these studies a detailed comparison of this study and previous literature is described in table 3 it is worth noting that changing river conditions could alter the predator community e g more invasive species such as smallmouth bass and the relative performance of the predators e g increased food consumption improved feeding efficiency and this should be considered in future studies estimates in this study focus on main stream of columbia and snake rivers because of data availability and need of consistence in pursuit of accuracy extrapolation of the regression relationship to other areas in the basin or other basins should be adjusted based on local conditions survival results presented in this study do not consider factors such as climate variability including pacific decadal oscillation and el niños southern oscillation intra annual hydrological variability change in reservoir operation harvesting land use changes and restoration battin et al 2007 hilborn 2013 kilduff et al 2015 mantua 2015 which affect growth and survival of salmonid stocks and should be investigated in future research this study uses an integrated modeling framework consisting of a single model for each earth system and human component to predict changes in stream temperature and juvenile salmon survival although the models have been verified in previous studies particularly over the us to provide reasonable representation li et al 2013 2015 hejazi et al 2015 voisin et al 2013 liu et al 2017 wan et al 2017 a comparison across climate and earth system models is useful to quantify the uncertainty in simulation but beyond the scope of this study moreover effects of reservoir stratification on stream temperature are not considered in the stream temperature model and need to be incorporated in future research hence our results should be interpreted with caution because of the large spatial variance in the survival rate change and uncertainty in migration path on the other hand pacific salmon have evolved for thousands of years so neglecting the adaptation capacity both in terms of plasticity and genetic changes of salmon may result in an overestimate of the negative impacts from environmental change nevertheless climatic extremes may reduce the adaptive potential kovach et al 2015 and cause unprecendented losses in salmon populations many actions can be taken to tackle the hotspots with high risk such as restoring the connectivity of floodplains 18 or riparian restoration justice et al 2017 diverse and connected habitats through all life stages are particularly useful to buffer against changes such as warming crozier et al 2008 finer scale analysis with more details on all life stages of salmon is necessary

this study fig 1 shows the main reaches and the locations of the observation sites within crb the observation period for smolt survival estimates is may 20 june 30 for subyearling chinook and april 17 may 28 for steelhead observed data of environmental parameters during the same period were obtained from columbia basin research columbia research center columbia river basin 2017 for 11 dam locations within the three reaches lower granite dam little goose dam lower monumental dam ice harbor dam mcnary dam john day dam the dalles dam bonneville dam rock island dam priest rapids dam wanapum dam and then averaged by the river reach the weekly bi weekly survival rate data and daily environmental parameters were aggregated over the observed period to represent inter year variations a log linear multiple regression analysis is performed to relate the observed annual smolt survival rate to water temperature and discharge as predictor variables a log transformation of the estimates of survival probabilities is used to stabilize the variance and model a multiplicative effect the relationship between survival rate and stream temperature has a clear nonlinear pattern in agreement with carter 2005 temperature related parameters are fit as a quadratic function an optimal range around 11 15 c for chinook and 9 13 c for steelhead is found with survival rate increasing and decreasing with water temperature below and above the optimal range fig 4 the optimal temperature ranges are determined based on three criteria 1 observed survival estimates are relatively high in this range with obvious increase with temperature before this range and decline after this range 2 regression from bootstrap resampling shows relative consistency which implies this range is stable and not significantly affected by sample size 3 a comparison across literature epa 2001 carter 2005 wade et al 2013 mantua 2015 confirms the selected ranges are reasonable representation for smolt survival in crb generally steelhead is more sensitive to stream temperature rise compared to chinook the steelhead survival rate decreases rapidly above 13 c and is less than 0 4 above 15 c smolt survival rate generally increases with discharge quadratic function is chosen to represent the nonlinearity inherent in the relationship between estimated survival rate ŝ and mean stream temperature tave as well as maximum stream temperature tmax without increasing the regression complexity significantly linear function is used for streamflow related parameters mean discharge qave and min discharge qmin in this case this combination of functions has been used in comprehensive passage model compass and shown reasonable explanatory power zabel et al 2008 the model equation used in the regression analysis was 1

squares the r square of regression of chinook survival rate with the four parameters is 0 87 the corresponding r square for steelhead is 0 51 the p value for the regression model is less than 0 001 table 2 the uncertainty in the regression model due to the limited historical sample is estimated by bootstrap resampling of the historical data 100 bootstrap samples dashed lines in fig 4 show 95 confidence intervals from bootstrap resampling the fitted patterns and trends remain consistent which suggests the statistical relationships between survival rate and the four environmental parameters for subyearling chinook and smolt steelhead hold solid model evaluation is performed by feeding the regression models with simulated reanalysis historical streamflow and stream temperature of 1998 2012 that has been bias corrected to reproduce the mean and variance of the observed surface temperature and precipitation experiment sim another experiment is designed by feeding observed climate data to the regression model experiment reg to delineate bias from the regression model and earth system model mean bias between survival rate from experiment sim and observed values is about 19 for smolt chinook and 22 for juvenile steelhead and that between experiment reg and observation is 0 3 for chinook and 12 for steelhead results suggest the regression models produce satisfactory smolt survival rate with accurate environmental parameters although the earth system framework mosart has been validated across the contiguous us and widely used in many studies it focuses on large scale studies and needs to be further calibrated for regional studies a comparison of the simulated streamflow and temperature fig 5 at five dam locations in crb shows that mosart tends to underestimate water temperature in the main channel during migration season of juvenile steelhead april may which would lead to an underestimate of survival rate for steelhead in historical period 3 results 3 1 climate warming induced temperature change stream temperature is projected to warm throughout crb in the 2040s and 2080s under both climate scenarios rcp4 5 and 8 5 fig 6 illustrates the spatial distribution of water temperature in crb for chinook left column and steelhead right column of historical and future periods with climate change effects alone colors represent the temperature zone for the two species respectively water temperature of lower than 11 c is below optimal for chinook blue colors 11 15 c is the optimum zone green colors and higher than 15 c yellow colors is stressful for chinook temperature lower than 9 c is sub optimal for steelhead the optimum range is 9 13 c and temperature rising above 13 c is stressful for steelhead the optimum temperatures for juvenile chinook and steelhead are derived based on the correlation between observed survival estimates and migration season mean stream temperature on mainstreams of columbia and snake river fig 4 the difference between the optimum temperature of chinook and steelhead results not only from the different sensitivity of each species to water temperature but also variations in the migration season juvenile chinook migrate around may 20 june 30 while juvenile steelhead migrate around april 17 may 28 based on the data from the fish passage center fish passage center fpc 2017 results show that water temperature in the main stream of lower columbia river which is downstream of crb is within the optimum range for juvenile chinook in the historical period but is shifted to be stressful by the 2080s stream temperature in lower columbia is currently below optimum for steelhead but rises to the optimal range for juvenile steelhead due to climate warming by the 2080s stream temperature of upper columbia river is below the optimum range in the historical period for smolt chinook and steelhead but it will shift to the optimal zone for both species by the 2080s current temperature in snake river is within the optimum range for juvenile chinook it shifts to stressful in the 2040s even with a mitigation climate scenario rcp4 5 and is likely to be lethal for smolt chinook by the 2080s in contrast steelhead may benefit from temperature increase in snake river with temperature shifting from below optimum to optimum by the 2080s 3 2 water management impacts river regulation has significant influences on stream flow arheimer et al 2017 here we compare water management including regulation and water withdrawal effects on daily discharge during the migration period of smolt chinook and steelhead fig 7 illustrates the historical and future cumulative distribution of discharge in upper columbia lower columbia and snake river climate change solid lines results in consistent flow decline in columbia and snake river during the migration season of chinook smolts 5 20 6 30 fig 7 d f in contrast it leads to more flow in upper columbia during the migration season of steelhead smolts fig 7 l the effects of water management on streamflow depend on whether upstream reservoirs release or store water and how much water is withdrawn from the channels water management dashed lines in general reduces flow in upper columbia fig 7 f and l and has a mixed effect on streamflow in snake river fig 7 e and k if water releases in june can offset water withdrawals channel flow in the snake river is predicted to increase lower columbia is downstream of upper columbia and snake so its flow is affected by the accumulated effects from upstream regulation as well as regulation and withdrawal within its own segment fig 7 also presents the probability distribution of stream temperature during the migration season and how it relates to the optimum temperature climate change solid lines leads to uniform shifts of temperature to higher values interestingly water management dashed lines also results in a noticeable shift to the right for upper and lower columbia river as flow is reduced by regulation the heat exchange between the warmer air and the reduced volume of water likely increases and elevates water temperature since stream temperature in the main channels is generally cooler than the overlying air during april june fig 8 water management has minor effects on stream temperature in snake river which can be attributed to the negligible changes in streamflow 3 3 changes of juvenile survival the stream temperature and discharge at the main stems of columbia and snake river simulated by the integrated human nature system model li et al 2015 are used as inputs to the regression model to quantify smolt survival at three main reaches upper columbia lower columbia and snake in crb results show that juvenile chinook and steelhead inhabiting the upper columbia may benefit with warmer climate fig 9 projected mean survival rates are likely to increase by more than 10 for both species largely because the water temperature shifts to the optimum range with climate change fig 7 in contrast survival rates of juvenile chinook and steelhead in lower columbia may decline by the 2080s and even by the 2040s under the more aggressive climate scenario rcp8 5 this results from the combined effects of temperature stress and decreased streamflow smolt chinook in snake river tends to decline by 12 23 till the 2040s and 15 43 by the end of this century caused by stressful temperature warming and less flow in the river channels juvenile steelhead on the contrary may expect more than 10 increase in survival rate by the 2040s due to the preferable water temperature there is no significant change in inter year variability of survival rates for most scenarios except in the 2080s under rcp8 5 this abrupt increase is mainly attributed to the larger variability in maximum temperature fig 10 extreme hot temperatures projected in this business as usual scenario are lethal for salmonid stocks and result in low survival rate 4 discussion and conclusions instead of using a tipping point to classify water temperature into suitable and lethal this study acknowledges the fact that the biological response of salmon to water temperature is continuous and nonlinear and incorporates the nonlinear response into climate change impact analysis our results suggest that whether climate warming brings detrimental or beneficial effects on juvenile salmon depends on its relation with the optimum temperature range if warming results in temperature closer to or within the optimum range then it enhances smolt growth if temperature rises beyond the preferred temperature range then it becomes stressful for salmonids and may reduce survival rate we recognize that there can be population specific thermal optima at scales more refined than what we used in this paper as such further efforts to characterize population specific thermal performance e g like eliason et al 2011 would be particularly important for future model refinement another key finding of this study was that water mangement including reserovir regulation and water withdrawl is seamlessly coupled within the earth system model to provide a realistic representation of streamflow water temperature and juvenile survival water management reduces flow in the channel and causes temperature rise in columbia river during smolt migration season this study provides survival projections of juvenile chinook and steelhead with spatial details as well as insight on how interactions between climate change and water management may affect smolts in crb similar modeling exercises extending through to the adult spawning migration would be particularly informative in the future previous literature found that climate change has negative impacts on juvenile survival rate mantua et al 2010 benjamin et al 2013 van vliet et al 2013 wade et al 2013 walters et al 2013 ward et al 2015 debano et al 2016 this study shows that the effects of climate change vary by location climate change scenario and specie there are two possible reasons for the differences first many studies examined the frequency or time of reaching lethal threshold based on one or multiple metrics mantua et al 2010 van vliet et al 2013 ward et al 2015 debano et al 2016 or utilized linear relationship between survival and temperature walters et al 2013 which do not capture the inherent nonlinearity of survival rate response to physical parameters in particular the effects of optimal stream temperature range are not considered second effects of regulation on streamflow and stream temperature are not considered in these studies a detailed comparison of this study and previous literature is described in table 3 it is worth noting that changing river conditions could alter the predator community e g more invasive species such as smallmouth bass and the relative performance of the predators e g increased food consumption improved feeding efficiency and this should be considered in future studies estimates in this study focus on main stream of columbia and snake rivers because of data availability and need of consistence in pursuit of accuracy extrapolation of the regression relationship to other areas in the basin or other basins should be adjusted based on local conditions survival results presented in this study do not consider factors such as climate variability including pacific decadal oscillation and el niños southern oscillation intra annual hydrological variability change in reservoir operation harvesting land use changes and restoration battin et al 2007 hilborn 2013 kilduff et al 2015 mantua 2015 which affect growth and survival of salmonid stocks and should be investigated in future research this study uses an integrated modeling framework consisting of a single model for each earth system and human component to predict changes in stream temperature and juvenile salmon survival although the models have been verified in previous studies particularly over the us to provide reasonable representation li et al 2013 2015 hejazi et al 2015 voisin et al 2013 liu et al 2017 wan et al 2017 a comparison across climate and earth system models is useful to quantify the uncertainty in simulation but beyond the scope of this study moreover effects of reservoir stratification on stream temperature are not considered in the stream temperature model and need to be incorporated in future research hence our results should be interpreted with caution because of the large spatial variance in the survival rate change and uncertainty in migration path on the other hand pacific salmon have evolved for thousands of years so neglecting the adaptation capacity both in terms of plasticity and genetic changes of salmon may result in an overestimate of the negative impacts from environmental change nevertheless climatic extremes may reduce the adaptive potential kovach et al 2015 and cause unprecendented losses in salmon populations many actions can be taken to tackle the hotspots with high risk such as restoring the connectivity of floodplains 18 or riparian restoration justice et al 2017 diverse and connected habitats through all life stages are particularly useful to buffer against changes such as warming crozier et al 2008 finer scale analysis with more details on all life stages of salmon is necessary before it will be possible to determine which conservation actions are optimal for different species populations and locations within the habitats transited during their entire lives acknowledgements
