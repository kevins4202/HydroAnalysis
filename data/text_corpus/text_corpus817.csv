4085,techniques of determining soil water retention curve swrc have been developed for several decades but very few have considered the heterogeneity of swrc at different depths caused by texture structure and other constituents in this study we designed a novel dielectric tube sensor dts moving in a pair of tubes installed in situ to measure soil water content swc and soil matric potential smp in heterogeneous soil profiles for determining wetting path swrcs a series of experiments were conducted to test the optimal size of dts calibrate the dts for swc measurement and smp measurement test the water proof function of the impermeable sheet and equilibrium rate of smp tube and determine swrcs in a layered and stony soil tank with a relatively slow drip irrigation commercial sensors were also employed in comparison with the dts during the drip irrigation experiment the results showed that when the distance of the two electrodes of the dts was 5 mm the measurement range volume of sensitivity and coefficient of variation were optimal the calibration results verified that the dts was suitable to measure volumetric swc r2 0 9914 and smp r2 0 9992 the smp tube exhibits good water proof property among different layers and the average equilibrium rate was 2 1 kpa s 1 in loamy soil and 7 3 kpa s 1 in pure sand the dynamics of swc and smp measured by the dts approximately agreed well with the data measured by the commercial sensors the relatively reduced agreement between the dts and teros21 for smp measurements may attribute to their different volume of sensitivity and installed position based on these the wetting path swrcs were determined in situ in a soil tank containing four kinds of soil samples furthermore the determined swrcs in four soil samples verified that stones decreased soil water holding capacity keywords soil water retention curve heterogeneous soil profiles in situ determination dielectric tube sensor soil water content soil matric potential 1 introduction a soil water retention curve swrc is an important hydraulic property presenting relationship between soil water content swc and soil matric potential smp which plays a critical role in soil water management and in prediction of solute and contaminant transport in the agriculture and environment it is related to size and connectedness of pore spaces hence strongly affected by soil texture structure as well as other constituents such as organic matter swrc can be determined either in laboratories or under field conditions however field determination of swrc could be different with about 10 of volumetric swc for a particular smp in comparison with the laboratory data bittelli et al 2012 sorbino and nicotera 2013 rianna et al 2014 iiyama 2016 bordoni et al 2017 thus diverse sensor techniques have been developed for in situ determination of swrc to achieve a higher accuracy rassam and williams 2000 quantified the drying swrc using a tensiometer and a soil moisture probe and the measurement scale should be larger than 80 kpa wraith and or 2001 developed a sensor that combined a tdr probe with porous materials to effectively measure continuous smp in the entire wetting path as reported by wraith and or 2001 the smp sensors developed by xin et al 2007 chen et al 2019a chen et al 2019b and commercialized sensor teros 21 meter group inc usa have the similar measurement principle and scale vaz et al 2002 developed a novel probe that coiled two copper wires along a 5 cm long porous cup of a standard tensiometer to detect swrc in laboratory and field moret fernández et al 2008 developed a new type of pressure cell associated with a zigzag shaped tdr probe to determine the swrc in a short time with a measurement scale from 500 kpa to 0 kpa in laboratory sun et al 2010 developed a combined tensiometer frequency domain fd probe to in situ determine the swrc they embedded a metal electrode into a commercial tensiometer to detect volumetric swc and smp respectively but the measurement scale of the combined tensiometer fd was same as rassam and williams 2000 reported although these methods can determine the swrc at point scale with simultaneously measurements of swc and smp point scale measurement method is difficult in natural soil conditions being highly heterogeneous within the profile with extremely variable hydraulic properties parajuli et al 2019 when it is required for the swrc determination in heterogeneous soils for instance stony soils in montane ecosystems humus soils in forest ecosystems reclaimed soils in mining ecosystem etc researchers have to pay more for purchasing numerous swc and smp sensors and higher labor cost during sensor installation moreover the installation involved excavating a large pit to insert a series of probes at different depths which inevitably disturbed the soil structure surrounding the sensors whalley et al 2004 recently yu et al 2018 developed a novel dielectric system for in situ tracking volumetric swc dynamics in three dimension as a continuous study here we try to in situ determine swrcs in heterogeneous soil profiles using a self developed system which controls a novel dielectric tube sensor dts moving in a pair of pvc tubes installed in situ to measure volumetric swc and smp automatically and simultaneously the dts probe will be designed to be a smaller size for achieving a fast response during the smp measurements the whole system was tested under a drip irrigation experiment in a soil tank which contained four kinds of soil samples to obtain the dynamics of swc and smp commercial sensors were also employed during the drip irrigation to evaluate the dynamics of swc and smp of the dts the wetting path swrcs will be determined based on above experiment results 2 material and method 2 1 description of the self developed system and design of the novel dielectric tube sensor the self developed system consists of a dielectric tube sensor dts a microcontroller a running framework and a series of pvc tubes installed in situ detailed description of this system can be found in yu et al 2018 in this study we planned to design a new downsized dts and a new tube smp tube in which the new dts could move for measuring smp in a soil profile more efficiently 2 1 1 designs of downsized dts probe and smp tube in order to achieve short time equilibrium between the gypsum of smp tube and the surrounded soil during the smp measurement maximum radius of volume of sensitivity vos of the dts determined by the distance of the two electrodes should be as small as possible for this purpose a downsized dts probe was optimally designed experiment for determining the maximum radius of vos at different distances of the two electrodes was shown in fig 1 the pvc tube was placed horizontally at the bottom of a square container the dts was put in the pvc tube while its probe was designed to allow the distance of the two electrodes to change from 5 mm to 50 mm at an increment of 5 mm the width of each electrode was 25 mm at each distance of the two electrodes gypsum powder was added in the square container layer by layer and recorded the output of the dts until the sensor output did not change over a critical distance i e from the wall of pvc tube to the surface of gypsum powder then we defined the critical distance as the maximum radius of vos here we introduce two parameters range and coefficient of variation to help evaluating the performance of the new dts for smp measurement range is the difference between the maximum and minimum of the dts output representing the sensitivity of the dts coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation of the dts output to the average value in a repeatability test the smp tube is a pvc tube inner diameter 23 mm outer diameter 25 mm wrapped with porous material i e gypsum the shape of the gypsum is a hollow cylinder as shown in fig 2 there are several impermeable sheet materials equidistantly embedded in the gypsum distance 10 cm to prevent the water flowing to adjacent soil layers through gypsum rather than the soil the gypsum ring thickness of smp tube was designed the same as the maximum radius of vos of dts probe 2 1 2 measurement principle of the dts for swc and smp determinations the measurement principle of swc and smp determination is based on dielectric frequency domain fd impedance method because the relative permittivity of water ε water ε 0 81 20 c sun et al 2014 is much greater than those of soil minerals ε soil ε 0 3 5 air ε air ε 0 1 topp et al 1980 and gypsum ε gypsum ε 0 2 chen et al 2019a chen et al 2019b the water content of the porous medium soil or gypsum surrounded the pvc tube can be obtained using the dts that measures the dielectric permittivity of the porous medium the measurement circuit was shown in fig 3 there is a parallel pair of ring electrodes which is installed on the sensor shell to generate a fringe filed that extends in soil or gypsum to measure the water content the impedance of the fringe field z p is determined as 1 z p ε u b u a u b z 0 where ε is the relative dielectric permittivity of the soil or gypsum z 0 is the balance impedance and u a and u b are the voltage outputs of each wave detector we can finally use the amplifier to amplify the difference between u a and u b to get the sensor output u 0 which can be calculated as 2 u 0 a f u a u b where a f is the gain of the amplifier substitute formula 1 into formula 2 u 0 can be expressed as 3 u 0 a f z 0 z p u b many previous studies suggest that the frequency of the oscillator should be high enough f 80 mhz to minimize the effect of soil electric conductivity dean et al 1987 gaskin and miller 1996 in this study the frequency would be set at 100 mhz the dts determines gypsum matric potential of smp tube by measuring gypsum water content and through a pre determined water retention curve of gypsum the smp can be determined by the dts when the gypsum matric potential of smp tube comes into equilibrium with the smp surrounding the smp tube 2 2 calibrations of the downsized dts for smp and swc measurements to calibrate the downsized dts for smp and swc measurements respectively a pair of pvc tubes smp tube in fig 2 height 15 cm swc tube height 15 cm and a cylindrical container diameter 30 cm height 15 cm fig 4 were used four types of soil samples pure sand pure sand mixed with 10 stone in volume average particle size 0 15 0 05 cm in radius loam sand 42 1 silt 44 2 clay 13 7 and loam mixed with 10 stone in volume were used for swc calibrations all soil samples were oven dried at 105 c for 48 h and then wetted with different water contents the mixture soil sample was filled in the cylindrical pvc container under laboratory conditions with room temperature 25 1 c the swc tube surrounded by the soil sample was put in the center of the pvc container a commercial swc sensor fds100 accuracy 3 beijing lianchuang siyuan measurement and control technology co ltd was recalibrated as well by recording the sensor output under different kinds of soil samples with different water contents fig 4 the calibration curves of the dts and fds100 in four kinds of soil samples could be obtained for smp calibration only one loamy soil sample was used because the sensor actually detects the matric potential of the gypsum of the smp tube regardless of the soil texture surrounding the smp tube similar to that for the swc calibrations the smp tube was put in the center of the pvc container and was surrounded by the loamy soil sample a dew point water potential system and a dew point soil psychrometer pst 55 psyprotm wescor inc were used to determine the real smp values from 0 05 to 8 mpa another teros 21 meter group inc usa which measurement range is from 9 kpa to 2000 kpa was used to determine the real smp values under 0 05 mpa the soil sample was wetted to saturation first and then evaporated at 25 1 in the laboratory the output values of the two commercial sensors and the dts were recorded at an interval of three days the relation between the dts output and the real smp would be obtained after the soil sample was completely dry 2 3 test of the water proof function for the impermeable sheet materials embedded in the gypsum of smp tube the schematic diagram of the experiment is shown in fig 5 the smp tube was placed in the center of a cylindrical container height 50 cm diameter 20 cm we added water into the cylindrical container for four times to soak the gypsum segments from the bottom layer 4 to the top layer layer 1 and kept the water surface below the impermeable sheet material black color after each water addition the system controlled the downsized dts to automatically and periodically record the matric potential of four gypsum segments every 20 s if the water proof function for the impermeable sheet material is feasible the dts output in layer n would not increase before being soaked into the water 2 4 test of the equilibrium rate for the smp measurement a smp tube with only one gypsum segment height 10 cm was air dried and placed in the center of a cylindrical container diameter 30 cm height 15 cm the dts was put into the smp tube to record the sensor output and the rest space of the cylindrical container was immediately filled with saturated soil sample the whole procedure was recorded by the dts to determine the average equilibrium rate for the smp measurement we defined the equilibrium procedure as the period from the start of the output rise to 90 of final equilibrium output the textures of soil samples here we used were the loamy soil and pure sand 2 5 experiment for simultaneous measurements of swc and smp at four different soil textural compositions under drip irrigation in order to test feasibility of the new dts for simultaneous measurements of swc and smp to determine wetting path swrcs in heterogeneous soil profiles four soil samples with different textural compositions were used as shown in table 1 these soil samples were filled into in a tank height 42 cm length 60 cm width 48 cm and divided into two equivalent zones each zone has two soil layers along the depth with the top layer being the loamy soil or pure sand and the bottom layer being the loamy soil or pure sand mixed with 10 stone the thickness of each layer was controlled to be about 10 cm just the same size as the length of each gypsum segment there was a pair of pvc tubes swc tube and smp tube installed in each zone to be an experimental group as shown in fig 6 commercial sensors for swc fds100 accuracy 3 beijing lianchuang siyuan measurement and control technology co ltd and smp teros 21 meter group inc usa pst 55 psyprotm wescor inc were also buried in each layer to be a control group a drip emitter was located at the center of the experimental group and control group in each zone when the drip irrigation started the system controlled the new dts to automatically measure volumetric swc and smp in each tube every 10 min until the volumetric swcs at the bottom layers were saturated in two zones the volume of the loam or sand in zone 1 or zone 2 was set as 28800 cm3 the irrigation rate of the zone 1 was set 250 ml h 1 whereas that of the zone 2 was set 125 ml h 1 considering the lower water holding capacity of sand 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal design of the downsized dts probe for smp measurement as shown in fig 7 a and fig 7b the maximum radius of vos increases as the distance of two electrodes increases in fig 7a the range of dts is negatively related to the distance of two electrodes with a maximum of 258 mv when the distance is 5 mm in contrast the coefficient of variation in fig 7b has a positive correlation with the distance of two electrodes when the distance is 5 mm the output of dts is most stable with the coefficient of variation being 0 012 therefore the optimal distance of the dts electrodes was 5 mm to achieve higher sensitivity better stability and smaller maximum radius of vos 3 2 calibration results of the downsized dts for smp and swc measurements fig 8 shows the calibration results of the dts for volumetric swc measurements at four different soil samples and smp measurement in the loamy soil respectively the relationship between the dts output and volumetric swc fitted a quadratic equation with high r2 from 0 9914 to 0 9989 for different soil textural compositions as shown in table 2 the stone in soils would make the dts underestimate volumetric swc if the stone content was not considered during sensor calibration fig 8a the outputs of dts in the loamy soils were larger than those of the pure sand under the same water content in comparison the relationship between the dts output and smp yielded a power function with high r2 0 9992 fig 8b 3 3 results of the water proof test for the impermeable sheet materials fig 9 shows the dts measurements in the smp tube at four gypsum segments divided by the impermeable sheet materials all the four curves have the similar trend that started at about 2800 kpa initial water content of the air dried gypsum and experienced a quick increase to around 500 kpa and gradually rose to 0 kpa when the gypsum segments were saturated by the water it takes about 80 s for the dts output in each gypsum segment to increase from 2800 kpa to 0 kpa when one gypsum segment in layer n was fully saturated the output in layer n 1 was stable proving that the impermeable sheet materials can prevent the water from flowing to the adjacent soil layers through gypsum rather than the soil 3 4 the maximum equilibrium rate for the smp measurement the responses of the dts for the smp measurement in both loamy soil and pure sand were shown in fig 10 in the loamy soil measurement it takes 1373 s from the start value 3550 kpa red circle point to 90 667 kpa red circle point of final equilibrium value 380 kpa red circle point and the average equilibrium rate is 2 1 kpa s 1 on the other hand it takes 424 s for the pure sand samples from the start value 3492 kpa red circle point to 90 404 kpa red circle point of the final equilibrium value 68 kpa red circle point which means the average equilibrium rate is 7 3 kpa s 1 moreover the equilibrium procedure presented three stages in both loamy soil and pure sand in the first stage the measured smp dramatically increased from 3550 kpa red circle point to 1566 kpa black point in the loamy soil and from 3492 kpa red circle point to 1112 kpa black point in the pure sand whereas in the second stage the measured smp increased moderately from c a 1566 kpa black point to c a 560 kpa black point in the loamy soil and from 1112 kpa black point to 177 kpa black point in the pure sand in the final stage the measurements increased slowly to near saturated swc in both soil samples 3 5 soil water retention curves determined in situ in heterogeneous soil profiles 3 5 1 comparison between the dts and commercial sensors results in heterogeneous soil profiles figs 11 and 12 show the dynamics of swc and smp measured by the dts in comparison with those by the commercial sensors in the zone 1 and zone 2 respectively due to the slow rate of irrigation and the large volume of soil tank the experiment in both zones took about three days the electrical power was shut down during the night in laboratory which lead to the discontinuity of the dts results however the dynamics of swc and smp in those periods still could be obtained in commercial sensors results with batteries for power supply the whole irrigation continued about 48 h including two non irrigation period according to its results in fig 11a and 11b the volumetric swc of the top layer loam started to increase at 110th min and finally reached the saturated volumetric swc of about 0 35 cm3cm 3 the value of smp at the top layer increased from 1180 kpa to 40 kpa at almost the same time as swc that helped to confirm whether the soil was saturated the volumetric swc of bottom layer loam with sc 0 1 started to increase at 320th min almost 4 h later than that of the top layer and finally reached the saturated volumetric swc of about 0 23 cm3cm 3 meanwhile the smp also started to increase from 1020 kpa and reached saturated at about 2800th min it can be found from the entire procedure that the dts results agreed well with the control group in general which proves the reliability of the system however according to fig 11b the smp measured by dts in bottom layer showed a reduced agreement with teros21 results which may be attributed to two reasons i the dts and teros21 have different voss due to the different sizes of gypsum resulting in the different increasing rate ii the teros21 probes were buried theoretically in the middle of each layer but the deviation of actual location may also cause the reduced agreement besides during the non irrigation period the swc of top layer showed an obvious decrease of 0 1 cm3cm 3 this phenomenon was also existed in the bottom layer but the decrease range was smaller than the top layer the smp in both layers seem keeping constant during the non irrigation period the volumetric swc of the top layer in the pure sand fig 12a started to increase at 160th min and finally reached the saturated volumetric swc of about 0 25 cm3cm 3 the volumetric swc of bottom layer pure sand with sc 0 1 fig 12b started to increase at 560th min 400 min later than that of the top layer and finally reached the saturated volumetric swc of about 0 20 cm3cm 3 under a lower irrigation rate the smp measurement of pure sand showed almost the same increasing rate with soil because of their higher soil hydraulic conductivity the different saturated volumetric swcs for loamy soil and pure sand with and without stone prove that the stone has reduced the water holding capacity of the two soil textures tested in this study this is in accordance with the results reported by baetens et al 2009 parajuli et al 2015 3 5 2 in situ determination of the wetting path soil water retention curves fig 13 shows the wetting path soil water retention curves determined in situ with the dts in the heterogeneous soil tank during the drip irrigation procedure these four curves were fitted based on vg model van genuchten 1980 and agreed well with the measurement results r2 0 93 the volumetric swc of the stony soil sc 0 1 is lower than that of the pure soil under the same smp value from 200 kpa to 0 kpa fig 13a indicating that the stone reduces the water holding capacity of the pure soil sample in the sand samples it has a similar condition when the smp was higher than 700 kpa fig 13b however when the smp was lower than 200 kpa in soil samples or 700 kpa in sand samples the influence of stone content on water holding capacity became less these results were in accordance with that reported by parajuli et al 2017 according to the analysis of soil water dynamics in figs 11 and 12 the soil water retention curves of whole wetting path were determined in situ in the pure sand the loamy soil the pure sand with stone and the loamy soil with stone using the self developed sensor 4 conclusion this study determined the wetting path swrcs using a self developed dielectric tube sensor which was controlled to move in the swc and smp tubes installed in situ to automatically measure volumetric swc and smp in heterogeneous soil profiles the distance of two electrodes of dts probe was designed to be 5 mm to yield best performance for the smp measurements the equilibrium time of the smp tube showed three stages and has an average rate with 2 1 kpa s 1 in the loam or 7 3 kpa s 1 in the pure sand besides the different saturated volumetric swcs for loamy soil and pure sand with and without stone prove that the stone has reduced the water holding capacity of the two soil textures tested the wetting path swrcs were determined in situ in tested soils using the self developed sensor

the sensor output did not change over a critical distance i e from the wall of pvc tube to the surface of gypsum powder then we defined the critical distance as the maximum radius of vos here we introduce two parameters range and coefficient of variation to help evaluating the performance of the new dts for smp measurement range is the difference between the maximum and minimum of the dts

equidistantly embedded in the gypsum distance 10 cm to prevent the water flowing to adjacent soil layers through gypsum rather than the soil the gypsum ring thickness of smp tube was designed the same as the maximum radius of vos of dts probe 2 1 2 measurement principle of the dts for swc and smp determinations the measurement principle of swc and smp determination is based on dielectric frequency

gypsum matric potential of smp tube comes into equilibrium with the smp surrounding the smp tube 2 2 calibrations of the downsized dts for smp and swc measurements to calibrate the downsized dts for

measurement and control technology co ltd was recalibrated as well by recording the sensor output under different kinds of soil samples with different water contents fig 4 the calibration curves of the dts and fds100 in four kinds of soil samples could be obtained for smp calibration only one loamy soil sample was used because the sensor actually detects the matric potential of the gypsum of the smp tube regardless of the soil texture surrounding the smp tube similar to that for the swc calibrations the smp tube was put in the center of the pvc container and was surrounded by the loamy soil sample a dew point water potential system and a dew point soil psychrometer pst 55 psyprotm wescor inc were used to determine the real smp values from 0 05 to 8 mpa another teros 21 meter group inc usa which measurement range is from 9 kpa to 2000 kpa was used to determine the real smp values under 0 05 mpa the soil sample was wetted to saturation first and then evaporated at 25 1 in the laboratory the output values of the two commercial sensors and the dts were recorded at an interval of three days the relation between the dts output and the real smp would be obtained after the soil sample was completely dry 2 3 test of the water proof function for the impermeable sheet materials embedded in the gypsum of smp tube the schematic diagram of the experiment is shown in fig 5 the smp tube was placed in the center of a cylindrical container height 50 cm diameter 20 cm we added water into the cylindrical container for four times to soak the gypsum segments from the bottom layer 4 to the top layer layer 1 and kept the water surface below the impermeable sheet material black color after each water addition the system controlled the downsized dts to automatically and periodically record the matric potential of four gypsum segments every 20 s if the water proof function for the impermeable sheet material is feasible the dts output in layer n would not increase before being soaked into the water 2 4 test of the equilibrium rate for the smp measurement a smp tube with only one gypsum segment height 10 cm was air dried and placed in the center of a cylindrical container diameter 30 cm height 15 cm the dts was put into the smp tube to record the sensor output and the rest space of the cylindrical container was immediately filled with saturated soil sample the whole procedure was recorded by the dts to determine the average equilibrium rate for the smp measurement we defined the equilibrium procedure as the period from the start of the output rise to 90 of final equilibrium output the textures of soil samples here we used were the loamy soil and pure sand 2 5 experiment for simultaneous measurements of swc and smp at four different soil textural compositions under drip irrigation in order to test feasibility of the new dts for simultaneous measurements of swc and smp to determine wetting path swrcs in heterogeneous soil profiles four soil samples with different textural compositions were used as shown in table 1 these soil samples were filled into in a tank height 42 cm length 60 cm width 48 cm and divided into two equivalent zones each zone has two soil layers along the depth with the top layer being the loamy soil or pure sand and the bottom layer being the loamy soil or pure sand mixed with 10 stone the thickness of each layer was controlled to be about 10 cm just the same size as the length of each gypsum segment there was a pair of pvc tubes swc tube and smp tube installed in each zone to be an experimental group as shown in fig 6 commercial sensors for swc fds100 accuracy 3 beijing lianchuang siyuan measurement and control technology co ltd and smp teros 21 meter group inc usa pst 55 psyprotm wescor inc were also buried in each layer to be a control group a drip emitter was located at the center of the experimental group and control group in each zone when the drip irrigation started the system controlled the new dts to automatically measure volumetric swc and smp in each tube every 10 min until the volumetric swcs at the bottom layers were saturated in two zones the volume of the loam or sand in zone 1 or zone 2 was set as 28800 cm3 the irrigation rate of the zone 1 was set 250 ml h 1 whereas that of the zone 2 was set 125 ml h 1 considering the lower water holding capacity of sand 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal design of the downsized dts probe for smp measurement as shown in fig 7 a and fig 7b the maximum radius of vos increases as the distance of two electrodes increases in fig 7a the range of dts is negatively related to the distance of two electrodes with a maximum of 258 mv when the distance is 5 mm in contrast the coefficient of variation in fig 7b has a positive correlation with the distance of two electrodes when the distance is 5 mm the output of dts is most stable with the coefficient of variation being 0 012 therefore the optimal distance of the dts electrodes was 5 mm to achieve higher sensitivity better stability and smaller maximum radius of vos 3 2 calibration results of the downsized dts for smp and swc measurements fig 8 shows the calibration results of the dts for volumetric swc measurements at four different soil samples and smp measurement in the loamy soil respectively the relationship between the dts output and volumetric swc fitted a quadratic equation with high r2 from 0 9914 to 0 9989 for different soil textural compositions as shown in table 2 the stone in soils would make the dts underestimate volumetric swc if the stone content was not considered during sensor calibration fig 8a the outputs of dts in the loamy soils were larger than those of the pure sand under the same water content in comparison the relationship between the dts output and smp yielded a power function with high r2 0 9992 fig 8b 3 3 results of the water proof test for the impermeable sheet materials fig 9 shows the dts measurements in the smp tube at four gypsum segments divided by the impermeable sheet materials all the four curves have the similar trend that started at about 2800 kpa initial water content of the air dried gypsum and experienced a quick increase to around 500 kpa and gradually rose to 0 kpa when the gypsum segments were saturated by the water it takes about 80 s for the dts output in each gypsum segment to increase from 2800 kpa to 0 kpa when one gypsum segment in layer n was fully saturated the output in layer n 1 was stable proving that the impermeable sheet materials can prevent the water from flowing to the adjacent soil layers through gypsum rather than the soil 3 4 the maximum equilibrium rate for the smp measurement the responses of the dts for the smp measurement in both loamy soil and pure sand were shown in fig 10 in the loamy soil measurement it takes 1373 s from the start value 3550 kpa red circle point to 90 667 kpa red circle point of final equilibrium value 380 kpa red circle point and the average equilibrium rate is 2 1 kpa s 1 on the other hand it takes 424 s for the pure sand samples from the start value 3492 kpa red circle point to 90 404 kpa red circle point of the final equilibrium value 68 kpa red circle point which means the average equilibrium rate is 7 3 kpa s 1 moreover the equilibrium procedure presented three stages in both loamy soil and pure sand in the first stage the measured smp dramatically increased from 3550 kpa red circle point to 1566 kpa black point in the loamy soil and from 3492 kpa red circle point to 1112 kpa black point in the pure sand whereas in the second stage the measured smp increased moderately from c a 1566 kpa black point to c a 560 kpa black point in the loamy soil and from 1112 kpa black point to 177 kpa black point in the pure sand in the final stage the measurements increased slowly to near saturated swc in both soil samples 3 5 soil water retention curves determined in situ in heterogeneous soil profiles 3 5 1 comparison between the dts and commercial sensors results in heterogeneous soil profiles figs 11 and 12 show the dynamics of swc and smp measured by the dts in comparison with those by the commercial sensors in the zone 1 and zone 2 respectively due to the slow rate of irrigation and the large volume of soil tank the experiment in both zones took about three days the electrical power was shut down during the night in laboratory which lead to the discontinuity of the dts results however the dynamics of swc and smp in those periods still could be obtained in commercial sensors results with batteries for power supply the whole irrigation continued about 48 h including two non irrigation period according to its results in fig 11a and 11b the volumetric swc of the top layer loam started to increase at 110th min and finally reached the saturated volumetric swc of about 0 35 cm3cm 3 the value of smp at the top layer increased from 1180 kpa to 40 kpa at almost the same time as swc that helped to confirm whether the soil was saturated the volumetric swc of bottom layer loam with sc 0 1 started to increase at 320th min almost 4 h later than that of the top layer and finally reached the saturated volumetric swc of about 0 23 cm3cm 3 meanwhile the smp also started to increase from 1020 kpa and reached saturated at about 2800th min it can be found from the entire procedure that the dts results agreed well with the control group in general which proves the reliability of the system however according to fig 11b the smp measured by dts in bottom layer showed a reduced agreement with teros21 results which may be attributed to two reasons i the dts and teros21 have different voss due to the different sizes of gypsum resulting in the different increasing rate ii the teros21 probes were buried theoretically in the middle of each layer but the deviation of actual location may also cause the reduced agreement besides during the non irrigation period the swc of top layer showed an obvious decrease of 0 1 cm3cm 3 this phenomenon was also existed in the bottom layer but the decrease range was smaller than the top layer the smp in both layers seem keeping constant during the non irrigation period the volumetric swc of the top layer in the pure sand fig 12a started to increase at 160th min and finally reached the saturated volumetric swc of about 0 25 cm3cm 3 the volumetric swc of bottom layer pure sand with sc 0 1 fig 12b started to increase at 560th min 400 min later than that of the top layer and finally reached the saturated volumetric swc of about 0 20 cm3cm 3 under a lower irrigation rate the smp measurement of pure sand showed almost the same increasing rate with soil because of their higher soil hydraulic conductivity the different saturated volumetric swcs for loamy soil and pure sand with and without stone prove that the stone has reduced the water holding capacity of the two soil textures tested in this study this is in accordance with the results reported by baetens et al 2009 parajuli et al 2015 3 5 2 in situ determination of the wetting path soil water retention curves fig 13 shows the wetting path soil water retention curves determined in situ with the dts in the heterogeneous soil tank during the drip irrigation procedure these four curves were fitted based on vg model van genuchten 1980 and agreed well with the measurement results r2 0 93 the volumetric swc of the stony soil sc 0 1 is lower than that of the pure soil under the same smp value from 200 kpa to 0 kpa fig 13a indicating that the stone reduces the water holding capacity of the pure soil sample in the sand samples it has a similar condition when the smp was higher than 700 kpa fig 13b however when the smp was lower than 200 kpa in soil samples or 700 kpa in sand samples the influence of stone content on water holding capacity became less these results were in accordance with that reported by parajuli et al 2017 according to the analysis of soil water dynamics in figs 11 and 12 the soil water retention curves of whole wetting path were determined in situ in the pure sand the loamy soil the pure sand with stone and the loamy soil with stone using the self developed sensor 4 conclusion this study determined the wetting path swrcs using a self developed dielectric tube sensor which was controlled to move in the swc and smp tubes installed in situ to automatically measure volumetric swc and smp in heterogeneous soil profiles the distance of two electrodes of dts probe was designed to be 5 mm to yield best performance for the smp measurements the equilibrium time of the smp tube showed three stages and has an average rate with 2 1 kpa s 1 in the loam or 7 3 kpa s 1 in the pure sand besides the different saturated volumetric swcs for loamy soil and pure sand with and without stone prove that the stone has reduced the water holding capacity of the two soil textures tested the wetting path swrcs were determined in situ in tested soils using the self developed sensor

4086,soil s hydrological and ecological functions depend largely on soil water retention which is affected by both structural and compositional soil properties studies have shown that alpine soils derived from sediments with different origins in the northeast qinghai tibetan plateau differ significantly in terms of particle size distribution bulk density and soil organic carbon content however the variation pattern and its drivers of soil water retention in this region remain unclear in this study soil water retention characteristics saturated soil water capacity field capacity wilting point and plant available water capacity from different geomorphic settings i e hillslopes alluvial fans and floodplains of an alpine catchment in the western part of the qilian mountains were analyzed in relation to sediment types and soil properties results show that soil water retention varies significantly with sediment types soils with an aeolian origin have a higher capacity to retain water compared with soils developed on fluvial sediments variations in soil water retention are mainly controlled by particle size distribution for fluvial sediments and by soil organic carbon content for aeolian sediments the accumulation of soil organic carbon enhances plant available water capacity for sandy fluvial sediments but not for silty fluvial and aeolian sediments the critical eco hydrological functions of the mattic surface soil horizon in relation to water retention runoff regulation and erosion control were highlighted for the alpine ecosystems by deciphering sedimentological and pedological controls of soil water retention this study improves the understanding of the evolution and functioning of alpine soils which has further implications for other sedimentary ecosystems keywords alpine ecosystem sediment type soil development soil water retention soil organic matter particle size distribution 1 introduction soil water retention swr is a critical soil hydraulic property which governs multiple soil eco hydrological processes and functions huang and shao 2019 lin et al 2006 yang et al 2014 it is also an important input parameter for many hydrological and ecological models e g saxton and rawls 2006 sawada et al 2014 šimůnek et al 2008 a number of structural and compositional soil properties have an influence on swr pachepsky and rawls 2003 pachepsky et al 2006 tóth et al 2015 of all soil properties particle size distribution psd soil organic carbon soc content and bulk density are most widely used to build pedotransfer functions ptfs to predict swr at different matric potentials vereecken et al 1989 wösten et al 2001 saxton and rawls 2006 zhang et al 2020 however the effects of these soil properties on swr are complicated due to their inter dependency which determines that ptfs developed from one certain region or dataset can hardly be transferred to another region or dataset schaap and leij 1998 pachepsky et al 2006 this causes inadequacy of most hydrological models for watershed hydrological modeling especially in regions with high spatial heterogeneity of soil properties vereecken et al 2007 lin et al 2006 while swr has been investigated extensively in various soils under diverse climates topography and vegetation a catchment wide characterization of swr has rarely been reported it is thus crucial to analyze the spatial variability of swr and its controlling factors at a catchment scale to reach a better understanding on watershed hydrology and ecosystem functioning alpine mountainous regions are usually the headwaters of great rivers and are of great hydrological and ecological significance pajares et al 2011 qiu 2008 the establishment and functioning of alpine ecosystems largely depend on alpine soils particularly on soil s ability to supply water and nutrients körner 2003 it was generally believed that soils on high mountains are lack of fine particles such as clay and silt due to the highly dynamic land surface processes and weak chemical weathering körner 2003 egli and poulenard 2016 this points to shallow and clastic soils with low functionality in alpine regions which however does not reflect the real situation in many cases accumulating studies from different alpine mountains of the world evidenced that alpine soils often contain a substantial amount of silt in the top layer as a result of long term aeolian dust inputs e g küfmann 2003 mileti et al 2013 munroe et al 2015 2020 yang et al 2016a another characteristic of alpine soils is that they tend to accumulate soc heavily because the long freezing season and low temperature slow the decomposition of soil organic matter körner 2003 the complex environments and dynamic land surface processes in high mountains determine that alpine soils are highly diverse in both mineral and organic components and correspondingly in swr studies from other ecosystems suggested that the partitioning of geomorphic units and sediment types facilitates the ecological function regionalization and the evaluation of ecological carrying capacity bedford and small 2008 caldwell et al 2008 2012 ebel et al 2019 hamerlynck et al 2002 however few studies have looked into the spatial variations of swr in relation to basic soil properties by linking both sedimentological and pedological processes at an alpine setting with diverse geomorphic units baldwin et al 2017 yang et al 2014 soils are highly heterogeneous on the northeast qinghai tibetan plateau ne qtp partly because of the dynamic sedimentologic processes stauch et al 2012 stauch et al 2014 nottebaum et al 2014 and partly because of the changing pedogenic intensities baumann et al 2009 yang et al 2017 yang et al 2020 various sediments including glacial deposits fluvial deposits and aeolian deposits spread across the ne qtp nottebaum et al 2014 yang et al 2020 the spatial distribution of these sediments are mainly controlled by geomorphic settings nottebaum et al 2014 yang et al 2020 these different types of sediments have contrasting psd as a result of varying sources and sorting effect during transportation nottebaum et al 2014 yang et al 2020 on the other hand soc accumulates to varying extents on the ne qtp yang et al 2016b yang et al 2017 it has been documented that soil water content is the key factor in determining the spatial variations of soc on the ne qtp yang et al 2008 liu et al 2012 moreover researches along the qilian mountains revealed that soc content plays a key role in shaping the spatial variation of several soil water characteristics including soil water content at saturation sat field capacity fc and wilting point wp for soils developed on loess yang et al 2014 yang et al 2017 the effect of soc on plant available water capacity pawc however has not been elucidated bouma 2018 minasny and mcbratney 2018a this hampers our understanding on the soil moisture vegetation interaction in such water limited ecosystems also it remains unclear how swr varies among different sediment types widespread in the alpine regions of ne qtp this study aims to identify the influencing factors of swr for soils with different sedimentary origins and pedogenic intensities from different geomorphic settings in an alpine catchment of ne qtp this study will promote our understanding on the buildup of swr and its eco hydrological feedbacks by integrating sedimentological pedological and ecological processes 2 regional setting the study area is in an alpine ridge valley basin tuole basin in western part of the qilian mountains on the ne qtp the tuole basin has a northwest southeast extent of around 80 km and a width of 30 km fig 1 with an area of around 1800 km2 the basin is bordered by the south tuole mountains in the south and the tuole mountains in the north with elevations of up to 5100 m asl and 5000 m asl respectively mean elevation of the basin is about 4150 m asl it is drained by the tuole river according to the monitoring data from 1961 to 2010 of the tuole weather station 98 24 e 38 48 n at 3367 m asl within the basin mean annual temperature is 2 6 mean annual precipitation is 290 8 mm more than 90 of the precipitation occurs from may to september reference evapotranspiration for the study area is 752 mm based on the calculation of fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 wang et al 2013 in this study we focused on three major geomorphic units i e hillslopes alluvial fans and floodplains alpine meadow dominates hillslopes except for some lower positions and the moraine zone subalpine steppe is prevalent on alluvial fans and in floodplains that are unaffected by groundwater while swamp meadow occupies floodplain positions with a shallow groundwater table the meadow ecosystems are primarily composed of kobresia plants which are typically only a few centimeters tall the dominating species is kobresia pygmaea for the alpine meadow and kobresia schoenoides for the swamp meadow both meadow types are characterized by a mat like surface soil horizon yang et al 2020 3 methods and materials 3 1 site selection and sampling eleven soil profiles were described and sampled from three geomorphic units including three profiles on floodplains f1 f3 four profiles on alluvial fans a1 a4 and four profiles on hillslopes h1 h2 h4 h5 fig 2 the id numbers of the samples are consistent with those in a previous paper by yang et al 2020 where detailed descriptions of each soil profile were provided bulk soils were sampled according to pedogenic horizons for the analysis of basic soil properties twenty seven undisturbed soil samples from different pedogenic horizons were sampled in triplicate with ring cores for the determination of swr and bulk density soil horizons enriched in fragmental debris were excluded from sampling because the ring cores 5 cm in height 100 cm3 in volume are not applicable in such a situation 3 2 laboratory analysis the bulk soil samples were air dried sieved through 2 mm sieve handpicked to remove fine roots and then ground with agate mortar to determine psd the fraction smaller than 2 mm was analyzed using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer ls230 beckman coulter before measuring samples were treated with hcl and h2o2 to remove carbonate and organic material for dispersion sodium hydroxide was used before ultrasonic treatment soc was determined by means of the walkley black wet oxidation method nelson and sommers 1982 several physically meaningful swr characteristics including sat fc and wp were selected to represent swr to calculate sat undisturbed soil samples in ring cores were saturated with water for 48 h during the process water level was gradually raised by adding water to 1 mm below the core s upper edge to exclude air entrapped in soils after weighing saturated soil samples were transferred to a pressure plate apparatus to measure water contents at 33 and 1500 kpa to represent fc and wp respectively pawc was calculated as the difference between fc and wp after the 1500 kpa measurements the cores were oven dried for 48 h and then weighed to calculate the bulk density 3 3 classification of sediment types three sediment types i e aeolian sediments fluvial sediments and periglacial slope deposits were identified according to geomorphic settings and detailed psd features recurring modal sizes at 16 μm 35 μm and 80 μm were recognized as characteristics of aeolian sediments from different sources vandenberghe 2013 nottebaum et al 2014 nottebaum et al 2015 yang et al 2016a yang et al 2020 fluvial sediments were recognized with unimodal or polymodal psd patterns with characteristic modes according to the classification approach proposed by nottebaum et al 2014 in a study along the qilian mountains periglacial slope deposits were recognized by their richness in fragmental debris yang et al 2020 3 4 statistical analyses relationships between basic soil properties and swr characteristics were analyzed by linear regression analysis simple pearson correlation coefficients and two tailed p values were calculated to evaluate the effects of fine particles clay silt and soc on swr characteristics the correlations were subdivided into two groups based on diagnosed sediment types for the cores the three replicates were used to estimate the mean value for further statistical analysis all analyses were performed with the spss software for windows version 18 0 spss inc chicago usa with p 0 05 as the criterion for statistical significance 4 results 4 1 sediment types and their spatial patterns fourteen soil horizons with characteristic modes at 16 μm 35 μm and 80 μm were interpreted as aeolian sediments fig 3 a thirteen soil horizons were identified to be originated from fluvial sediments fluvial sediments were diverse in psd and were further subdivided into silty fluvial sediments n 3 sandy fluvial sediments n 7 and gravelly fluvial sediments n 3 fig 3b detailed psd of each soil horizon and their sedimentological interpretation have been given in a previous study by yang et al 2020 the spatial distribution of different sediment types was mainly regulated by geomorphology on the floodplain aeolian sediments mantled gravelly fluvial sediments on the alluvial fans sandy fluvial sediment is the most common sediment type while silty fluvial sediments and aeolian sediments occur also in some landscape positions on hillslopes aeolian silts mantle on land surface and is admixed with glacial debris mainly in subsurface layers fig 4 4 2 variations of basic soil properties in aeolian and fluvial sediments three basic soil properties i e psd soc and bulk density were analyzed and categorized into two groups based on sediment types soil texture shows a large variation between aeolian and fluvial sediments almost all aeolian sediments are silty loam in texture with silt 2 50 μm content varying from 40 to 70 sand 50 2000 μm content is 50 for all aeolian sediments for fluvial sediments sand fraction varies from 15 to 90 clay 2 μm content is 20 for all soils fig 5 aeolian sediments and silty fluvial sediments are classified as fine textured soils sand fraction 50 while gravely and sandy fluvial sediments are classified as coarse textured soils according to the unified soil classification system astm 2011 content of soc shows a large variation for aeolian sediments varying from 5 1 to 118 6 g kg 1 with an average of 43 5 g kg 1 while soc in fluvial sediments ranges from 1 0 to 20 8 g kg 1 averaged 7 5 g kg 1 fig 6 bulk density is generally higher for fluvial sediments averaged 1 3 g cm 3 compared with aeolian sediments averaged 0 9 g cm 3 bulk density is mainly controlled by sand content r2 0 86 p 0 001 n 10 for coarse textured soils sand 50 fig 7 a and by soc content r2 0 70 p 0 001 n 17 for fine textured soils fig 7b 4 3 soil water retention and its controlling factors in aeolian and fluvial sediments swr characteristics including sat fc wp and pawc were examined in relation to contents of the clay silt fraction and soc fig 8 variations of swr characteristics including sat fc and wp showed binary patterns mainly according to sediment types for aeolian sediments sat is strongly conditioned by soc content r2 0 75 p 0 001 while content of clay silt fraction plays an insignificant role fig 8a b for fluvial sediments sat is significantly affected by both the clay silt content r2 0 55 p 0 003 and soc content r2 0 54 p 0 004 fig 8a b sat shows a strong negative correlation with bulk density r2 0 92 p 0 001 for aeolian and fluvial sediments as a whole fc and wp behave similarly in relation to the contents of clay silt and soc for fluvial sediments clay silt content has a primary control over both fc r2 0 94 p 0 001 fig 8c and wp r2 0 97 p 0 001 fig 8e while soc content is also significantly correlated with fc r2 0 74 p 0 001 fig 8d and wp r2 0 67 p 0 001 fig 8f for aeolian sediments however fc and wp are mainly conditioned by soc content fig 8d f while psd has little effect fig 8c e pawc increases with the content of clay silt fraction for coarse textured soils i e sandy and gravelly fluvial sediments r2 0 85 p 0 001 n 10 fig 9 a however the content of fine particles has no effect on pawc for fine textured soils fig 9a the increase of soc enhances pawc at a significant level for fluvial sediments r2 0 32 p 0 044 yet shows no significant correlation for aeolian sediments r2 0 21 p 0 101 fig 9b 5 discussion 5 1 sedimentological controls of soil water retention different sediment types show contrasting psd due to varying sources and changing momentum during transportation nottebaum et al 2014 yang et al 2020 fluvial sediments vary from gravels to silt loam in texture depending on geomorphic positions and local fluvial energy conditions nottebaum et al 2014 yang et al 2020 fluvial gravels form the basis of the floodplain e g f1 and f3 in fig 2 obviously such gravels have an extremely low capacity to hold water this is also true for glacial debris in the moraine zone yang et al 2020 on alluvial fans sandy or silty fluvial sediments prevail as a product of episodic fluvial transport stauch et al 2014 sandy materials are transported by running water in upper and middle alluvial fan positions while slow moving water allows fine silts to settle along the fringe of alluvial fan nottebaum et al 2014 in fluvial sediments fc and wp increase proportionally with the increase of fine particles indicating the lack of fine particles limits swr for the alluvial fan ecosystem pawc is also controlled by the content of clay silt fraction for gravelly and sandy fluvial sediments fig 9a this can be extrapolated to other ecosystems limited by fine particles zhou et al 2005 hong et al 2013 turek et al 2020 by contrast sat fc wp and pawc are kept at relatively high levels for aeolian sediments due to their abundant fine particles it is remarkable that psd makes no difference on swr for aeolian sediments fig 8a c e this is apparently contradictory to most studies addressing the influences of swr which normally consider psd as the most important soil property affecting swr e g saxton and rawls 2006 wösten et al 2001 vereecken et al 1989 nasta et al 2009 this can be explained by the fact that aeolian silts which are also known as loess are relatively uniform in texture pye 1995 yang et al 2017 and consequently the effect of psd on the spatial variations of swr is very much limited whereas the wide range of soc content becomes the primary driver for the large variation of swr as it has been pointed out by many studies e g aciego et al 2017 litaor 1987 lawrence et al 2011 this study emphasizes the eco hydrological significance of aeolian dust deposition in the evolution and functioning of alpine ecosystems the addition of fine particles greatly enhances swr for otherwise coarse texture soils 5 2 pedological controls of soil water retention the primary pedogenic alteration of fluvial and aeolian sediments in such an alpine setting is the accumulation of soc yang et al 2017 yang et al 2020 which is fundamental to the development of soil structure the increase of soil porosity and the decease of bulk density musso et al 2019 hu et al 2020 zeng et al 2013 yang et al 2017 previous studies revealed that the accumulation of soc is the primary driver for the enhancement of sat fc and wp for loess derived soils along the qilian mountains yang et al 2014 yang et al 2017 this study further corroborates these results it is remarkable that soc content makes no significant influence on pawc for aeolian sediments fig 9b actually there is a no consensus on the effects of soc on pawc many researches reported that soc make a positive impact on pawc e g ankenbauer and loheide 2017 hudson 1994 olness and archer 2005 werner et al 2020 while others evidenced that there is no clear influence of soc on pawc e g bauer and black 1992 minasny and mcbratney 2018a zhou et al 2020 considering that the influence of psd on pawc has been well constrained for aeolian sediments due to their homogeneity it is reasonable to draw the conclusion that soc has little effect on pawc for fine textured soil yet it should be noticed that the effect of grass roots on pawc was not taken into consideration since they were hand picked before sieving besides the increase of organic matter weather in forms of soc or of grassroots could reduce evaporation and runoff by improving soil aggregation increasing porosity and water infiltration and thus has beneficial effects on retaining moisture bouma 2018 lu et al 2020 minasny and mcbratney 2018a b soils developed on fluvial sediments have a relatively low soc content this is partly because of the low capacity of fluvial sediments to retain water and to provide water for plant growth especially in this semi arid region where evapotranspiration is far higher than precipitation the relatively faster decomposition rate of organic matter and episodic fluvial erosion during torrent seasons are other possible causes for the low soc content for soils on alluvial fans yang et al 2020 stauch et al 2014 the relatively low level of soc and large variation of psd give more statistical leverage to the latter factor in influencing

4086,soil s hydrological and ecological functions depend largely on soil water retention which is affected by both structural and compositional soil properties studies have shown that alpine soils derived from sediments with different origins in the northeast qinghai tibetan plateau differ significantly in terms of particle size distribution bulk density and soil organic carbon content however the variation pattern and its drivers of soil water retention in this region remain unclear in this study soil water retention characteristics saturated soil water capacity field capacity wilting point and plant available water capacity from different geomorphic settings i e hillslopes alluvial fans and floodplains of an alpine catchment in the western part of the qilian mountains were analyzed in relation to sediment types and soil properties results show that soil water retention varies significantly with sediment types soils with an aeolian origin have a higher capacity to retain water compared with soils developed on fluvial sediments variations in soil water retention are mainly controlled by particle size distribution for fluvial sediments and by soil organic carbon content for aeolian sediments the accumulation of soil organic carbon enhances plant available water capacity for sandy fluvial sediments but not for silty fluvial and aeolian sediments the critical eco hydrological functions of the mattic surface soil horizon in relation to water retention runoff regulation and erosion control were highlighted for the alpine ecosystems by deciphering sedimentological and pedological controls of soil water retention this study improves the understanding of the evolution and functioning of alpine soils which has further implications for other sedimentary ecosystems keywords alpine ecosystem sediment type soil development soil water retention soil organic matter particle size distribution 1 introduction soil water retention swr is a critical soil hydraulic property which governs multiple soil eco hydrological processes and functions huang and shao 2019 lin et al 2006 yang et al 2014 it is also an important input parameter for many hydrological and ecological models e g saxton and rawls 2006 sawada et al 2014 šimůnek et al 2008 a number of structural and compositional soil properties have an influence on swr pachepsky and rawls 2003 pachepsky et al 2006 tóth et al 2015 of all soil properties particle size distribution psd soil organic carbon soc content and bulk density are most widely used to build pedotransfer functions ptfs to predict swr at different matric potentials vereecken et al 1989 wösten et al 2001 saxton and rawls 2006 zhang et al 2020 however the effects of these soil properties on swr are complicated due to their inter dependency which determines that ptfs developed from one certain region or dataset can hardly be transferred to another region or dataset schaap and leij 1998 pachepsky et al 2006 this causes inadequacy of most hydrological models for watershed hydrological modeling especially in regions with high spatial heterogeneity of soil properties vereecken et al 2007 lin et al 2006 while swr has been investigated extensively in various soils under diverse climates topography and vegetation a catchment wide characterization of swr has rarely been reported it is thus crucial to analyze the spatial variability of swr and its controlling factors at a catchment scale to reach a better understanding on watershed hydrology and ecosystem functioning alpine mountainous regions are usually the headwaters of great rivers and are of great hydrological and ecological significance pajares et al 2011 qiu 2008 the establishment and functioning of alpine ecosystems largely depend on alpine soils particularly on soil s ability to supply water and nutrients körner 2003 it was generally believed that soils on high mountains are lack of fine particles such as clay and silt due to the highly dynamic land surface processes and weak chemical weathering körner 2003 egli and poulenard 2016 this points to shallow and clastic soils with low functionality in alpine regions which however does not reflect the real situation in many cases accumulating studies from different alpine mountains of the world evidenced that alpine soils often contain a substantial amount of silt in the top layer as a result of long term aeolian dust inputs e g küfmann 2003 mileti et al 2013 munroe et al 2015 2020 yang et al 2016a another characteristic of alpine soils is that they tend to accumulate soc heavily because the long freezing season and low temperature slow the decomposition of soil organic matter körner 2003 the complex environments and dynamic land surface processes in high mountains determine that alpine soils are highly diverse in both mineral and organic components and correspondingly in swr studies from other ecosystems suggested that the partitioning of geomorphic units and sediment types facilitates the ecological function regionalization and the evaluation of ecological carrying capacity bedford and small 2008 caldwell et al 2008 2012 ebel et al 2019 hamerlynck et al 2002 however few studies have looked into the spatial variations of swr in relation to basic soil properties by linking both sedimentological and pedological processes at an alpine setting with diverse geomorphic units baldwin et al 2017 yang et al 2014 soils are highly heterogeneous on the northeast qinghai tibetan plateau ne qtp partly because of the dynamic sedimentologic processes stauch et al 2012 stauch et al 2014 nottebaum et al 2014 and partly because of the changing pedogenic intensities baumann et al 2009 yang et al 2017 yang et al 2020 various sediments including glacial deposits fluvial deposits and aeolian deposits spread across the ne qtp nottebaum et al 2014 yang et al 2020 the spatial distribution of these sediments are mainly controlled by geomorphic settings nottebaum et al 2014 yang et al 2020 these different types of sediments have contrasting psd as a result of varying sources and sorting effect during transportation nottebaum et al 2014 yang et al 2020 on the other hand soc accumulates to varying extents on the ne qtp yang et al 2016b yang et al 2017 it has been documented that soil water content is the key factor in determining the spatial variations of soc on the ne qtp yang et al 2008 liu et al 2012 moreover researches along the qilian mountains revealed that soc content plays a key role in shaping the spatial variation of several soil water characteristics including soil water content at saturation sat field capacity fc and wilting point wp for soils developed on loess yang et al 2014 yang et al 2017 the effect of soc on plant available water capacity pawc however has not been elucidated bouma 2018 minasny and mcbratney 2018a this hampers our understanding on the soil moisture vegetation interaction in such water limited ecosystems also it remains unclear how swr varies among different sediment types widespread in the alpine regions of ne qtp this study aims to identify the influencing factors of swr for soils with different sedimentary origins and pedogenic intensities from different geomorphic settings in an alpine catchment of ne qtp this study will promote our understanding on the buildup of swr and its eco hydrological feedbacks by integrating sedimentological pedological and ecological processes 2 regional setting the study area is in an alpine ridge valley basin tuole basin in western part of the qilian mountains on the ne qtp the tuole basin has a northwest southeast extent of around 80 km and a width of 30 km fig 1 with an area of around 1800 km2 the basin is bordered by the south tuole mountains in the south and the tuole mountains in the north with elevations of up to 5100 m asl and 5000 m asl respectively mean elevation of the basin is about 4150 m asl it is drained by the tuole river according to the monitoring data from 1961 to 2010 of the tuole weather station 98 24 e 38 48 n at 3367 m asl within the basin mean annual temperature is 2 6 mean annual precipitation is 290 8 mm more than 90 of the precipitation occurs from may to september reference evapotranspiration for the study area is 752 mm based on the calculation of fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 wang et al 2013 in this study we focused on three major geomorphic units i e hillslopes alluvial fans and floodplains alpine meadow dominates hillslopes except for some lower positions and the moraine zone subalpine steppe is prevalent on alluvial fans and in floodplains that are unaffected by groundwater while swamp meadow occupies floodplain positions with a shallow groundwater table the meadow ecosystems are primarily composed of kobresia plants which are typically only a few centimeters tall the dominating species is kobresia pygmaea for the alpine meadow and kobresia schoenoides for the swamp meadow both meadow types are characterized by a mat like surface soil horizon yang et al 2020 3 methods and materials 3 1 site selection and sampling eleven soil profiles were described and sampled from three geomorphic units including three profiles on floodplains f1 f3 four profiles on alluvial fans a1 a4 and four profiles on hillslopes h1 h2 h4 h5 fig 2 the id numbers of the samples are consistent with those in a previous paper by yang et al 2020 where detailed descriptions of each soil profile were provided bulk soils were sampled according to pedogenic horizons for the analysis of basic soil properties twenty seven undisturbed soil samples from different pedogenic horizons were sampled in triplicate with ring cores for the determination of swr and bulk density soil horizons enriched in fragmental debris were excluded from sampling because the ring cores 5 cm in height 100 cm3 in volume are not applicable in such a situation 3 2 laboratory analysis the bulk soil samples were air dried sieved through 2 mm sieve handpicked to remove fine roots and then ground with agate mortar to determine psd the fraction smaller than 2 mm was analyzed using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer ls230 beckman coulter before measuring samples were treated with hcl and h2o2 to remove carbonate and organic material for dispersion sodium hydroxide was used before ultrasonic treatment soc was determined by means of the walkley black wet oxidation method nelson and sommers 1982 several physically meaningful swr characteristics including sat fc and wp were selected to represent swr to calculate sat undisturbed soil samples in ring cores were saturated with water for 48 h during the process water level was gradually raised by adding water to 1 mm below the core s upper edge to exclude air entrapped in soils after weighing saturated soil samples were transferred to a pressure plate apparatus to measure water contents at 33 and 1500 kpa to represent fc and wp respectively pawc was calculated as the difference between fc and wp after the 1500 kpa measurements the cores were oven dried for 48 h and then weighed to calculate the bulk density 3 3 classification of sediment types three sediment types i e aeolian sediments fluvial sediments and periglacial slope deposits were identified according to geomorphic settings and detailed psd features recurring modal sizes at 16 μm 35 μm and 80 μm were recognized as characteristics of aeolian sediments from different sources vandenberghe 2013 nottebaum et al 2014 nottebaum et al 2015 yang et al 2016a yang et al 2020 fluvial sediments were recognized with unimodal or polymodal psd patterns with characteristic modes according to the classification approach proposed by nottebaum et al 2014 in a study along the qilian mountains periglacial slope deposits were recognized by their richness in fragmental debris yang et al 2020 3 4 statistical analyses relationships between basic soil properties and swr characteristics were analyzed by linear regression analysis simple pearson correlation coefficients and two tailed p values were calculated to evaluate the effects of fine particles clay silt and soc on swr characteristics the correlations were subdivided into two groups based on diagnosed sediment types for the cores the three replicates were used to estimate the mean value for further statistical analysis all analyses were performed with the spss software for windows version 18 0 spss inc chicago usa with p 0 05 as the criterion for statistical significance 4 results 4 1 sediment types and their spatial patterns fourteen soil horizons with characteristic modes at 16 μm 35 μm and 80 μm were interpreted as aeolian sediments fig 3 a thirteen soil horizons were identified to be originated from fluvial sediments fluvial sediments were diverse in psd and were further subdivided into silty fluvial sediments n 3 sandy fluvial sediments n 7 and gravelly fluvial sediments n 3 fig 3b detailed psd of each soil horizon and their sedimentological interpretation have been given in a previous study by yang et al 2020 the spatial distribution of different sediment types was mainly regulated by geomorphology on the floodplain aeolian sediments mantled gravelly fluvial sediments on the alluvial fans sandy fluvial sediment is the most common sediment type while silty fluvial sediments and aeolian sediments occur also in some landscape positions on hillslopes aeolian silts mantle on land surface and is admixed with glacial debris mainly in subsurface layers fig 4 4 2 variations of basic soil properties in aeolian and fluvial sediments three basic soil properties i e psd soc and bulk density were analyzed and categorized into two groups based on sediment types soil texture shows a large variation between aeolian and fluvial sediments almost all aeolian sediments are silty loam in texture with silt 2 50 μm content varying from 40 to 70 sand 50 2000 μm content is 50 for all aeolian sediments for fluvial sediments sand fraction varies from 15 to 90 clay 2 μm content is 20 for all soils fig 5 aeolian sediments and silty fluvial sediments are classified as fine textured soils sand fraction 50 while gravely and sandy fluvial sediments are classified as coarse textured soils according to the unified soil classification system astm 2011 content of soc shows a large variation for aeolian sediments varying from 5 1 to 118 6 g kg 1 with an average of 43 5 g kg 1 while soc in fluvial sediments ranges from 1 0 to 20 8 g kg 1 averaged 7 5 g kg 1 fig 6 bulk density is generally higher for fluvial sediments averaged 1 3 g cm 3 compared with aeolian sediments averaged 0 9 g cm 3 bulk density is mainly controlled by sand content r2 0 86 p 0 001 n 10 for coarse textured soils sand 50 fig 7 a and by soc content r2 0 70 p 0 001 n 17 for fine textured soils fig 7b 4 3 soil water retention and its controlling factors in aeolian and fluvial sediments swr characteristics including sat fc wp and pawc were examined in relation to contents of the clay silt fraction and soc fig 8 variations of swr characteristics including sat fc and wp showed binary patterns mainly according to sediment types for aeolian sediments sat is strongly conditioned by soc content r2 0 75 p 0 001 while content of clay silt fraction plays an insignificant role fig 8a b for fluvial sediments sat is significantly affected by both the clay silt content r2 0 55 p 0 003 and soc content r2 0 54 p 0 004 fig 8a b sat shows a strong negative correlation with bulk density r2 0 92 p 0 001 for aeolian and fluvial sediments as a whole fc and wp behave similarly in relation to the contents of clay silt and soc for fluvial sediments clay silt content has a primary control over both fc r2 0 94 p 0 001 fig 8c and wp r2 0 97 p 0 001 fig 8e while soc content is also significantly correlated with fc r2 0 74 p 0 001 fig 8d and wp r2 0 67 p 0 001 fig 8f for aeolian sediments however fc and wp are mainly conditioned by soc content fig 8d f while psd has little effect fig 8c e pawc increases with the content of clay silt fraction for coarse textured soils i e sandy and gravelly fluvial sediments r2 0 85 p 0 001 n 10 fig 9 a however the content of fine particles has no effect on pawc for fine textured soils fig 9a the increase of soc enhances pawc at a significant level for fluvial sediments r2 0 32 p 0 044 yet shows no significant correlation for aeolian sediments r2 0 21 p 0 101 fig 9b 5 discussion 5 1 sedimentological controls of soil water retention different sediment types show contrasting psd due to varying sources and changing momentum during transportation nottebaum et al 2014 yang et al 2020 fluvial sediments vary from gravels to silt loam in texture depending on geomorphic positions and local fluvial energy conditions nottebaum et al 2014 yang et al 2020 fluvial gravels form the basis of the floodplain e g f1 and f3 in fig 2 obviously such gravels have an extremely low capacity to hold water this is also true for glacial debris in the moraine zone yang et al 2020 on alluvial fans sandy or silty fluvial sediments prevail as a product of episodic fluvial transport stauch et al 2014 sandy materials are transported by running water in upper and middle alluvial fan positions while slow moving water allows fine silts to settle along the fringe of alluvial fan nottebaum et al 2014 in fluvial sediments fc and wp increase proportionally with the increase of fine particles indicating the lack of fine particles limits swr for the alluvial fan ecosystem pawc is also controlled by the content of clay silt fraction for gravelly and sandy fluvial sediments fig 9a this can be extrapolated to other ecosystems limited by fine particles zhou et al 2005 hong et al 2013 turek et al 2020 by contrast sat fc wp and pawc are kept at relatively high levels for aeolian sediments due to their abundant fine particles it is remarkable that psd makes no difference on swr for aeolian sediments fig 8a c e this is apparently contradictory to most studies addressing the influences of swr which normally consider psd as the most important soil property affecting swr e g saxton and rawls 2006 wösten et al 2001 vereecken et al 1989 nasta et al 2009 this can be explained by the fact that aeolian silts which are also known as loess are relatively uniform in texture pye 1995 yang et al 2017 and consequently the effect of psd on the spatial variations of swr is very much limited whereas the wide range of soc content becomes the primary driver for the large variation of swr as it has been pointed out by many studies e g aciego et al 2017 litaor 1987 lawrence et al 2011 this study emphasizes the eco hydrological significance of aeolian dust deposition in the evolution and functioning of alpine ecosystems the addition of fine particles greatly enhances swr for otherwise coarse texture soils 5 2 pedological controls of soil water retention the primary pedogenic alteration of fluvial and aeolian sediments in such an alpine setting is the accumulation of soc yang et al 2017 yang et al 2020 which is fundamental to the development of soil structure the increase of soil porosity and the decease of bulk density musso et al 2019 hu et al 2020 zeng et al 2013 yang et al 2017 previous studies revealed that the accumulation of soc is the primary driver for the enhancement of sat fc and wp for loess derived soils along the qilian mountains yang et al 2014 yang et al 2017 this study further corroborates these results it is remarkable that soc content makes no significant influence on pawc for aeolian sediments fig 9b actually there is a no consensus on the effects of soc on pawc many researches reported that soc make a positive impact on pawc e g ankenbauer and loheide 2017 hudson 1994 olness and archer 2005 werner et al 2020 while others evidenced that there is no clear influence of soc on pawc e g bauer and black 1992 minasny and mcbratney 2018a zhou et al 2020 considering that the influence of psd on pawc has been well constrained for aeolian sediments due to their homogeneity it is reasonable to draw the conclusion that soc has little effect on pawc for fine textured soil yet it should be noticed that the effect of grass roots on pawc was not taken into consideration since they were hand picked before sieving besides the increase of organic matter weather in forms of soc or of grassroots could reduce evaporation and runoff by improving soil aggregation increasing porosity and water infiltration and thus has beneficial effects on retaining moisture bouma 2018 lu et al 2020 minasny and mcbratney 2018a b soils developed on fluvial sediments have a relatively low soc content this is partly because of the low capacity of fluvial sediments to retain water and to provide water for plant growth especially in this semi arid region where evapotranspiration is far higher than precipitation the relatively faster decomposition rate of organic matter and episodic fluvial erosion during torrent seasons are other possible causes for the low soc content for soils on alluvial fans yang et al 2020 stauch et al 2014 the relatively low level of soc and large variation of psd give more statistical leverage to the latter factor in influencing swr still the accretion of soc significantly enhances swr fig 8 indicating the importance of the enhancing effect of soc on swr in ecosystems limited by fine particles specially in alpine meadow of the qtp soils usually form an extremely resilient surface layer i e the mattic epipedon according to the chinese soil taxonomy gong 1999 kaiser et al 2008 miehe et al 2019 zhi et al 2017 this particular pedogenic soil horizon is typically composed of abundant grassroots organic matter and fine particles kaiser et al 2008 miehe et al 2019 both living and dead grassroots interweave intensively with organic and mineral materials creating a large volume of both macropores and micropores within the mattic epipedon yang et al 2014 hu et al 2020 consequently the mattic epipedon shows both high swr yang et al 2014 2017 gao et al 2018 and high hydraulic conductivity zeng et al 2013 in this study the mattic epipedon occurrs on hillslopes h1 h2 h4 and h5 and floodplain positions with a shallow groundwater table f2 and f3 are all of aeolian origin and have a silt loam texture this determines a high capacity of the soils to retain water and soc which in turn points to a higher

4087,rainfall monitoring is fundamental in many hydrological applications such as flood and landslide forecasting and water resources management in situ measurements are the traditional data source of rainfall but the worldwide declining number of stations their low spatial representativeness and the data access problem limit their use satellite products are being widely used as an alternative data source among them sm2rain based products which exploit the inversion of the water balance equation to derive rainfall from soil moisture observations have shown relatively good skills for hydrological applications however the need of calibrating the sm2rain parameter values against a reference represents one important limitation particularly over data scarce regions in this study we explore the possibility to self calibrate sm2rain and thus to obtain rainfall estimates from the advanced scatterometer ascat soil moisture independently from any reference rainfall dataset four parametric relationships relating sm2rain parameter values to static descriptors average rainfall topography soil moisture noise are developed to develop such relationships a sample of 1009 points uniformly distributed over the areas covered by rain gauges in australia india italy and the united states is selected a global validation of the methodology is conducted by comparing the performances of the parameterized product with the classical product in which the parameter values are estimated by calibration against a reference rainfall dataset the final run of the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg precipitation dataset is used for performance assessment together with the triple collocation techniques by using the gauge based global precipitation climatology center gpcc product and the late run of imerg the aim of the analysis is to obtain an uncalibrated sm2rain methodology to retrieve rainfall whose performance are similar to those obtained with calibration the results at 1009 points show that the performances of the parameterized sm2rain product are in line with those of the calibrated one with an increased capability in the detection of intense rainfall events and an acceptable reduction of the performance according to both pearson correlation and root mean square error indexes the application of triple collocation confirms these findings on a global scale showing that the sm2rain product outperforms both gpcc and imerg late run estimations in areas characterized by low density of rain gauges and good quality of ascat soil moisture retrievals i e africa and south america keywords rainfall soil moisture remote sensing sm2rain 1 introduction floods drought and landslides are the water related natural hazards that cause the most serious damage to the environment people and properties the occurrence of those events is related to climate wet soil moisture sm conditions and intense rainfall are often the drivers of flood and landslide events ciabatta et al 2016 according to international panel on climate change ipcc 5th report climate change is expected to aggravate the occurrence of those phenomena since extreme weather and climate events will step up ipcc 2013 the knowledge of the triggering conditions of hydroclimatic hazards can be used in prediction models in order to help the authorities to prevent or mitigate them hannah et al 2011 ponziani et al 2012 the presence of an adequate monitoring network capable of providing accurate precipitation estimation is therefore fundamental not only for water resources management or agricultural planning but also to reduce the loss of lives and economic damages however the rain gauge coverage is declining worldwide and unequally distributed being concentrated in developed countries kidd et al 2017 vörösmarty et al 2001 moreover despite being highly accurate rain gauge stations are not free from errors peterson et al 1998 villarini et al 2008 remote sensing techniques are currently the only valuable alternative to ground based networks as they have demonstrated their potential in the estimation of rainfall at relevant spatial and temporal scales globally kidd and levizzani 2011 the classical remote sensing based technique to estimate rainfall is the top down approach brocca et al 2014a where the upwelling radiation or backscatter from clouds measured by satellite sensors are used to estimate the surface instantaneous precipitation rate one distinguished example of this type of product is the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg product of the global precipitation measurement gpm mission hou et al 2014 characterized by relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions compared to its predecessors 0 1 and 30 min respectively and global coverage this was achieved using a new dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and an accurate radiometer both fundamental to calibrate infrared and microwave data from multiple polar and geostationary satellites despite the good level of accuracy achieved the difficulties in obtaining and inter calibrating near real time observations from multiple agencies and the overall high cost for operation and maintenance of the whole satellite constellation are obstacles still to be overcome in order to guarantee the data continuity moreover additional rainfall datasets are still needed to understand residual uncertainties and errors massari et al 2017 chen et al 2020 like e g seasonal and local bias maggioni and massari 2018 the integration of imerg with alternative rainfall products can be also carried out to reduce uncertainties as in massari et al 2020 the recently introduced bottom up approach points toward addressing these problems by inferring or correcting rainfall estimation over land using sm observations from satellite or gauges this method provides accumulated rainfall estimates crow et al 2009 brocca et al 2013 pellarin et al 2013 instead than the instantaneous rate as for the top down products many methods based on this approach share the same limitations linked to the limits of measuring sm from space rainfall estimated only over land low accuracy in presence of dense vegetation or complex topography and difficulties in estimating rainfall in case of soil saturation among the bottom up approaches sm2rain brocca et al 2014a was applied to different satellite sm products over different regions worldwide with satisfying results through the inversion of the soil water balance equation it is capable to obtain the accumulated rainfall occurred between two sm measurements the method has already been applied to different sm products for local brocca et al 2015 tarpanelli et al 2017 and global brocca et al 2019 massari et al 2020 analysis three global rainfall products based on sm2rain were developed two of them were derived from the use of sm2rain alone sm2rain cci ciabatta et al 2018 sm2rain ascat brocca et al 2019 while the third one was derived from the integration with a top down product i e imerg late run gpm sm2rain massari et al 2020 different studies have shown the usefulness of these products for hydrological application such as flood and landslide prediction brunetti et al 2018 camici et al 2018 brocca et al 2020 in order to obtain accurate rainfall estimates sm2rain parameter values need to be calibrated against a reference rainfall dataset e g gauge based with spatial and temporal resolution comparable with those of the sm dataset in this paper we propose a methodology to estimate the sm2rain parameter values independently from a reference i e a self calibrated sm2rain product four parametric relationships are obtained starting from climatic and land descriptors e g observed mean annual rainfall topography soil moisture error to obtain the four sm2rain parameter values understanding the relationships of the parameters with these descriptors is a step forward for a better physical understanding of sm2rain and the possibility 1 to obtain an independent rainfall product i e without the need of calibration against a reference dataset and 2 to apply the method at high resolution e g 1 km as obtained from sentinel 1 mission bauer marschallinger et al 2018 bauer marschallinger et al 2019 the methodology is tested firstly at 1009 points uniformly distributed regular grid with a space resolution of 0 25 over the areas covered by rain gauges in australia india italy and united states us several datasets globally available including soil texture evapotranspiration soil temperature satellite sm and observed rainfall climatology are collected to be used as predictors a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data collected is carried out to identify the descriptors better related to each parameter of sm2rain algorithm and to obtain parametric relationships linking sm2rain parameter values to the selected predictors secondly the parametric relationships are applied on a global scale for the period 2013 2019 and the performances of the parameterized sm2rain product are compared with those resulting from the calibration of sm2rain in the same period different global rainfall products gpm imerg final run gpm imerg late run and gpcc are considered for performance evaluation through classical performance metrics computation and triple collocation analysis massari et al 2017 we finally aim to assess whether the self calibrated sm2rain product performances are in line with those of the calibrated product 2 data multiple descriptors are considered for the estimation of sm2rain algorithm parameter values through a regression based regionalization approach jakeman et al 1992 post et al 1998

parametric relationships are developed for each region of the study area the data are collected for the period 2013 2017 in particular the australian water availability project awap rainfall product

combines daily rainfall data from 6955 gauges using the shepard method pai et al 2014 to interpolate them and it is characterized by a spatial resolution of about 25 km 0 25 degree the mentioned datasets were all temporally interpolated from their local time to 00 00 utc accepting the resulting uncertainty to obtain regular time spacing in order to simplify the intercomparison with satellite derived products available at 00 00 utc 2 1 2 global rainfall datasets different global rainfall datasets were downloaded to obtain and validate the new sm2rain ascat parameterized rainfall product

resolution is 1 with a daily temporal resolution since it is based on ground observation the accuracy of the dataset is greater over region with high gauge density i e europe and us the imerg algorithm estimates precipitation over the majority of earth s surface by inter calibrating the available passive microwave pmw satellite precipitation estimates to the combined radar radiometer precipitation estimates from the gpm mission core observatory gpm co and then by merging and interpolating together these estimates with other precipitation estimates from infrared geostationary sensors huffman et al 2020 morphing and kalman filtering interpolation are used to provide the precipitation estimate if no valid microwave data are available the resulting product spatial resolution

min rainfall data were accumulated to obtain daily precipitation estimates european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis 5th generation era5 provide hourly data of various global atmosphere land surface and sea state variables combining models with observations it was developed within the copernicus climate change service c3s and it replaces the previous era interim reanalysis product its spatial resolution is around 36 km resampled on a regular 0 25 degree grid and the temporal resolution is 1 hour hersbach et al 2020 the hourly rainfall was calculated by subtracting the snowfall fraction to the total precipitation and accumulated to daily scale in this study 2 1 3 evapotranspiration hourly evapotranspiration data from era5 were obtained for each point of the study area the hourly data were accumulated on windows of 12 h centred at 00 00 utc and 12 00 utc to obtain a temporal resolution aligned with the sm datasets 12 h spacing 2 2 land data 2 2 1 satellite soil moisture and soil moisture noise advanced scatterometer ascat is an active microwave sensor onboard of metop a launched 19 10 2006 metop b launched 17 09 2012 and metop c launched 07 11 2018 satellites it uses two sets of three vertically polarized antennae one on each side of the satellite ground track and it senses backscatter radiation at 5 255 ghz c band the sensor was originally developed to sense wind speed over oceans but it turned out to be also sensitive to the amount of water in the soil leading to the development of one of the longest satellite sm product available nowadays from 2007 onward ascat retrievals have a spatial resolution of 25 km sampled at 12 5 km 0 125 relative sm estimates and their related noise were downloaded from european organisation for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat satellite application facility on support to operational hydrology and water management h saf h115 and h116 products for the period 2013 2019 in these years the contemporary availability of the satellites metop a and b permitted a sub daily temporal resolution over most of the earth wagner et al 2013 when the surface state was indicated as frozen sm estimates were discarded ascat measurements were linearly interpolated every 12 h to obtain regular time spacing if no data were found within 5 days each datum in the interval was set to not a number nan 2 2 2 modelled soil moisture hourly sm in the first soil layer 0 7 cm of the ecmwf integrated forecasting system data from era5 land were downloaded for the analysis period era5 land was produced by regridding the land component of the ecmwf era5 climate reanalysis with a finer spatial resolution 0 1 degree sm was subsampled every 12 h to obtain the same temporal resolution of ascat data 2 2 3 topographic data elevation data from earth topography 5 arc minute etopo5 were downloaded although the product is available on a regular grid of 5 minutes 0 08 the resolution of the source data base varies from 5 minute for the ocean floors usa europe japan and australia to 1 in data deficient parts of asia south america northern canada and africa 2 2 4 soil temperature soil temperature data in the first soil layer 0 7 cm of the ecmwf integrated forecasting system data from era5 land were downloaded for the analysis period the hourly data were subsampled every 12 h to match the temporal resolution of ascat data 2 2 5 soil composition data the harmonized world soil database v1 2 wieder et al 2014 contains worldwide soil composition information derived from regional and national data several soil parameters were downloaded for this analysis for the nominal year of 2000 including soil depth sand silt clay fraction reference soil depth carbon content and bulk density at a spatial resolution of 5 min 0 08 2 2 6 vegetation continuous field global fractional vegetation cover data vcf5kyrv001 was downloaded from nasa making earth system data records for use in research environments measures the dataset relative to the nominal year of 2015 was downloaded containing information of tree cover vegetation bare ground and non tree cover vegetation area percentage with a spatial resolution of 0 05 3 methods 3 1 sm2rain sm2rain is an algorithm developed by brocca et al 2013 and brocca et al 2014a to estimate the accumulated rainfall between two sm measurements this result can be achieved by inverting the soil water balance equation it was successfully applied to different satellite and in situ sm dataset ciabatta et al 2018 brocca et al 2019 filippucci et al 2020 offering good results especially in poorly gauged regions massari et al 2020 considering a layer characterized by a soil depth z mm and a soil porosity n m3 m3 the soil water balance equation can be written as 1 z n d s m t d t p t r t e t g t where sm t is the relative sm i e the soil moisture saturation fraction p t is the rainfall rate mm d r t is the surface runoff rate mm d e t the evaporation rate mm d and g t the drainage rate mm d during rainfall events and unsaturated conditions evaporation and surface runoff rates can be considered negligible brocca et al 2015 eq 1 can therefore be rewritten by using famiglietti and wood 1994 relationship to express the drainage rate as 2 p t z d s m t d t a sm t b with z z n a mm d is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and b is the exponent of famiglietti and wood equation remotely sensed sm tends to be noisy and it is sensitive to a thin topsoil layer few centimetres therefore the exponential filter approach wagner et al 1999 albergel et al 2008 is applied to satellite sm observations before their use in eq 2 the estimation of rainfall is therefore obtained by the knowledge of two consecutive sm measurements together with 4 parameters z a b and t the time constant of the exponential filter in its standard application the parameter values are estimated by calibrating sm2rain against reference rainfall data with similar spatial and temporal resolution with the objective of minimizing the root mean square error rmse 3 2 procedure for the parametric relationship the methodology used to obtain the four parametric relationships is described here as a first step 1009 points uniformly distributed over the areas covered by rain gauges in australia india italy and us were selected see fig 1 and brocca et al 2019 each point is representative of an area of 25 25 km2 and the spacing between the points is around 1 secondly the climatic and land descriptors were spatially interpolated to the 1009 points the chosen interpolation methods consists in the nearest neighbour technique for evapotranspiration data weighted average of the overlapping areas for datasets with a spatial resolution finer than 25 km and weighted average of the four nearest pixels for the remaining datasets for the time varying quantities e g rainfall and soil moisture different statistics were computed for each point to obtain the descriptors specifically the daily annual average and the average number of rainy days per year was calculated for rainfall therefore obtaining information about the climatology of each point to obtain them first the percentage of rainy days precipitation 0 and the average precipitation were calculated for each day of the year doy using the available years then the average values were calculated to obtain the annual average values for sm sm noise soil temperature and evapotranspiration the mean median maximum minimum standard deviation and coefficient of variation were computed in each point of the selected area the temporal difference of consecutive sm and sm noise measurements was also considered since the variation of sm is exploited in sm2rain to obtain rainfall the mean median maximum minimum standard deviation and coefficient of variation were therefore calculated also over these differences considering both the actual and the absolute values and just the positive and negative variations since these should be related to different mechanisms of wetting and drying of the soil e g the average value of the positive variation of sm or the maximum of the absolute variation of sm noise for the elevation the mean and the standard deviation within each pixel was computed particularly the standard deviation of elevation is an indicator of topographic complexity the latter decreases the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals due to shadowing effects and layover a distortion that occurs in radar imaging when the signal reflected from the top of a tall feature is received by the emitter before the one of the base ulaby et al 1981 thirdly the potential relationship between the descriptors and sm2rain parameter values was analysed through the spearman correlation index spearman correlation index was calculated between each parameter and each descriptor in order to obtain the parametric relationships only the descriptors who showed a high absolute value of spearman correlation greater than 0 6 with the related parameter were considered sm2rain parametric relationships were finally obtained through a stepwise non linear backward approach all the possible additive and multiplicative combinations between the selected descriptors were initially used in a multilinear regression algorithm to obtain a first estimation of the relationship an exemplary formula for the combination of n descriptors is here reported 3 par α 0 i 1 n β i d i i 1 n j 1 n i γ i d i d j ω i 1 n d i where α i β i γ i and ω are the coefficients to be estimated and d i is a descriptor the procedure was repeated iteratively by eliminating at each step the less significant factor until an optimal combination of limited number of coefficients minor or equal to 3 and good performance drops in spearman correlation in comparison with the previous step 0 015 was reached it was also verified that the spearman correlations between each factor used in the relationship were below 0 2 in order to avoid the cross correlation between the factors used in the parametric relationships 3 3 validation in order to assess the goodness of the parametric relationships the parameterized sm2rain rainfall product was compared with the sm2rain ascat rainfall product obtained by calibrating sm2rain with the standard approach using era5 rainfall as reference sm2rain ascat was calibrated in the full available period 2013 2019 in order to compare the parameterized product with the best possible sm2rain version it has to be noted that the standard calibration results presented in this paper are different from those obtained in brocca et al 2019 who applied a different filtering approach and the climatology correction based on era5 not considered here both the sm2rain derived rainfall products were compared with a benchmark dataset section 3 3 1 and by using triple collocation section 3 3 2 all the products involved in the validation were re gridded to ascat grid 12 5 km spacing using the same weighted average procedure applied before paragraph 3 2 sm2rain method is applicable everywhere but the reliability of the estimated rainfall depends on the reliability of the estimated sm this excludes all the areas with high vegetation regime where c band microwave measurements cannot reach the soil coastal areas wetlands topographically complex areas region characterized by subsurface scattering morrison and wagner 2020 and frozen or snow cover terrains hahn et al 2018 it was therefore defined a committed area with high confidence in the successful retrieval of surface soil moisture from metop ascat by excluding the aforementioned categories the committed area is obtained from the eumetsat h saf product validation report hahn et al 2018 two different methodologies were then used to assess rainfall products accuracy classical performance scores and triple collocation 3 3 1 classical performance scores continuous metrics were applied to compare the daily rainfall estimates with the dataset taken as the standard gpm fr in particular linear pearson correlation r pearson correlation is the most common way to characterize statistical dependency between two datasets it can be obtained from the ratio between the covariance of two dataset and the product of their standard deviation it varies between 1 and 1 where 1 means negative linear relationship 1 means positive linear relationship and 0 means no statistical dependency relative bias biasr relative bias index can be calculated as the mean difference between two datasets divided by the mean value of the reference dataset it describes whether there is a systematic over or under estimation with respect to the reference data in this paper the difference is performed between the estimated and the observed rainfall therefore negative bias values mean that the product underestimates the rainfall while positive bias values indicate overestimation relative root mean square error rmser root mean square error rmse can be calculated as the average deviation between single measurements of two dataset it comprehends three sources of error decorrelation bias and random error it should be noted that since there is no true measure of a quantity rmse reliability strongly depends from the reference dataset accuracy relative rmse rmser is obtained dividing rmse by the mean value of the reference dataset categorical indices were also computed to measure the performances in detecting rainfall for different precipitation classes five classes were selected dividing the rainfall events in those greater than the 10th the 30th the 50th the 70th and the 90th percentile for each point of the grid the categorical indices were calculated for each of those classes naming h the number of successfully predicted events f the number of falsely detected events and m the number of missed events we can define false alarm ratio far refers to the fraction of erroneously detected events for each class the optimum value is 0 4 far f h f probability of detection pod refers to the fraction of correctly predicted events for each class the optimum value is 1 5 pod h h m threat score ts is an integrated measure of the overall performances giving the fraction of successfully detected events over the total missed and detected events for each class the optimum value is 1 6 ts h h f m 3 3 2 triple collocation the classical methods described above permit to assess the similarities between the analysed dataset and a reference one therefore the performances reliability is dependent on the accuracy of the reference but since no dataset has zero error measurement villarini et al 2008 not even gauges peterson et al 1998 kidd et al 2017 the obtained performances are subjected to error triple collocation tc method instead permits the assessment of uncertainties of three different products against an unknown true reference here a brief explanation of the theory behind the method is presented for further information the reader is referred to massari et al 2017 and stoffelen 1998 each measure related to a quantity is characterized by both a random and a systematic error 7 x α x β x θ ε x where x is the measure θ is the unknown truth ε x the random error and α x and β x are respectively the additive and multiplicative component of the systematic error taking into consideration three different datasets whose errors are uncorrelated the random error of each dataset can be considered gaussian distributed with zero mean the error variance of each dataset can therefore be written as mccoll et al 2014 8 σ ε q 11 q 12 q 13 q 23 q 22 q 12 q 23 q 13 q 33 q 13 q 23 q 12 where q ij is the covariance between the dataset i and j mccoll underlined that although gaussianity ensures that the rmse is well descripted and assists in the interpretation gaussian data are not required for the tc as it is often applied to non gaussian data such as sm by using the definitions of correlation and covariance it can be derived 9 r tc q 12 q 13 q 11 q 23 q 12 q 23 q 22 q 13 q 13 q 23 q 33 q 12 r tc is the tc correlation against the unknown truth this measure should not be taken as an absolute measure but as a relative measure between the three datasets in this study tc was used for the global analysis validation of sm2rain the three products selected were therefore sm2rain itself first the parameterized and then the calibrated product and two other global rainfall datasets gpcc and gpm lr chosen over gpm fr because the latter is corrected using gpcc monthly rainfall and therefore it does not satisfy the condition of uncorrelated error 4 results and discussion 4 1 local analysis the objective of this paper is to find and validate four parametric relationships to estimate the sm2rain algorithm parameter values from climatic and land descriptors readily available worldwide through these relationships sm2rain can be easily applied without the need of a reference rainfall dataset by using the 1009 points a local analysis was performed to find the parametric relationships 4 1 1 descriptors selection the number of potential descriptors obtained from soil data vegetation continuous field topography data and the statistic of time varying quantities exceed 50 spearman correlation values between each of them and sm2rain parameters were therefore calculated in order to reduce the number of descriptors by selecting for each parameter the quantities that are better related to it an example of the procedure can be found in fig 2 where three scatter density plots between the parameter z and three representative descriptors are shown in the example it can be seen how the soil water storage capacity values obtained from the harmonized world soil database does not show significant correlation with the z parameter fig 2c contrary to the expectation greater absolute values of spearman correlation were obtained from the annual average daily rainfall fig 2a and the standard deviation of the soil temperature fig 2b with the latter showing an inverse relationship with the analysed parameter these two descriptors were therefore selected to be used in the multilinear regression algorithm while the soil water storage capacity was discarded note that the standard deviation of soil temperature was discarded in the successive step for the sake of brevity neither the details of the descriptors selection nor every iteration of the stepwise non linear backward regression is described here but the final relationships are directly shown at the end of the procedure most of the analysed descriptors were discarded the descriptors who resulted more significant for sm2rain parameters estimation were only those related to sm sm noise precipitation and topography 4 1 2 t parameter the first obtained relationship was the one relative to the exponential filter parameter t this parameter was the first to be calculated in order to obtain reduced noise sm from satellite sm estimates the reduced noise sm estimates are used in eq 2 and in the calculation of the sm descriptors for the successive sm2rain parameters relationships the reference values for t parameter were obtained by applying the exponential filter to ascat sm data maximizing r between the filtered sm and the modelled sm from era5 first soil layer 0 7 cm afterward the points with r values greater than a fixed threshold of 0 6 were retained and used as reference t values to be compared with the climatic and land descriptors see paragraph 3 2 the selection of points with correlation greater than 0 6 was done to avoid fitting the parametric relationship to not representative data visual inspection and spearman correlation were used to identify which descriptors were better correlated with the reference t values a non linear regression model was then iteratively applied to the selected descriptors in order to find the best parametric relationship the optimal relationship can be written as 10 t 0 8788 1 7020 s m n o i s e s t d sm d 0 3555 s t d sm d p t o p c where smnoise is the temporal mean value of the sm noise relative to ascat estimates std sm d is the temporal standard deviation of the absolute values of ascat sm temporal variations p is the annual average of daily rainfall and topc is the topographic complexity spatial standard deviation of elevation values within each pixel 4 1 3 b parameter according to famiglietti and wood 1994 b can be considered equal to 11 b 3 2 λ where λ is the pore size distribution index a parametric relationship to estimate λ as a function of a parameter was proposed by brocca et al 2014b 12 λ 0 085 log a 0 1574 the same relationship was adopted in this study but the two coefficients were recalibrated using the following procedure t values from eq 10 were used to obtain filtered ascat sm series to which apply sm2rain the three parameters of the balance equation were then calibrated against reference regional rainfall observations 1009 points the points with r between the observed and estimated rainfall greater than the fixed threshold of 0 6 and with t value less than a threshold fixed to 6 were then selected as before to avoid fitting the parametric relationship to not representative data and the two coefficients of eq 12 were calculated by fitting the relationship between the calibrated a and b parameter values thus obtaining 13 b 3 2 0 5928 log a 0 3022 4 1 4 z and a parameter by using eqs 10 and 13 the sm2rain algorithm was re applied to ascat sm estimates at 1009 points by only calibrating z and a parameters again the points with r between estimated and observed rainfall greater than the fixed threshold of 0 6 and with t value 6 were selected to be compared with the climatic and land descriptors visual inspection and spearman correlation were used to identify which quantities were better related with z parameter then a linear regression model was applied to them in order to find the z parametric relationship 14 z 10 3124 0 5186 p sm d the same procedure was adopted to find a parametric relationship after recalibrating the sm2rain algorithm for only the a parameter and fixing the others through eqs 10 13 and 14 the obtained equations for a was 15 a 1 5748 13 0324 z sm d where p is the annual average of daily rainfall and sm d is the temporal mean of the absolute values of ascat sm temporal variations 4 1 5 test of parametric relationships by using eqs 10 13 14 and 15 the four sm2rain parameters can be obtained from knowing the ascat sm timeseries and its noise the topographic complexity and the mean annual rainfall to avoid non physical values for the parameters the boundaries reported in table 2 were applied fixing all the parameters that exceed limits to the boundary itself we note that the parametric relationships obtained through a statistical regression based approach show physical reasoning in the expected correlation between sm2rain algorithm parameters and climatic and land descriptors indeed eq 10 indicates that the exponential filter t parameter is directly proportional to the mean value of sm noise to standard deviation of absolute sm variation to the ratio between the latter and the annual average daily rainfall and to the topographic complexity all these descriptors increase with either sm measurement error i e sm noise and topographic complexity or temporal sm variability i e s t d sm d and 1 p in both cases higher t values are expected since a higher value of t increases the filtering capacities eqs 14 and 15 link the estimation of z and a to the value of sm d and p indeed z increases with the ratio between p and sm d because it is a measure of the amount of water stored in the soil while a is directly correlated with p as mentioned above to obtain the parametric relationships sm2rain was applied to ascat sm for the 1009 points for 5 times after and before the definition of each parameter relationship by using the available equations and by calibrating the remaining parameters with the standard approach i e minimization of rmse the performances of the obtained rainfall in terms of r and rmse are shown in table 3 a few insights can be deduced from these results the overall drop in performances is limited thus demonstrating that the obtained parametric relationships are well suited to estimate the sm2rain parameter values the major drop in correlation can be ascribed to the parameter t this can be easily explained as the parameter t is the only one related to rainfall occurrence to which the correlation is highly sensitive while the others parameters are more related to rainfall amount and hence to rmse a possible reason for the correlation deterioration could be due to error in modelled sm from era5 however different tests with the other soil layers of era5 and other modelling approaches were carried out and worse results were obtained not shown for the sake of brevity the parametric relationship for a is the one that caused the greatest increase in rmse see table 3 finally we underline that soil and vegetation descriptors were found not fundamental for obtaining the parametric relationships likely due to the limited accuracy of these datasets at the considered spatial resolution particularly for soil information and the limited influence of vegetation on the analysed parameters confirming the findings of sehgal et al 2020 4 2 global analysis the good results obtained at 1009 points led to the application of the parametric relationships on a global scale the parameters maps obtained using the parametric relationships on a quasi global scale 60 s 60 n are shown in fig 3 as expected exponential filter t parameter is greater over desert forest and mountain areas fig 3d where sm quality is lower while the distributions of z and a fig 3a and b reflect the known areas where the average rainfall rate is high equatorial region era5 rainfall was used to obtain the annual average daily rainfall for the parametric relationships and also to calibrate sm2rain ascat with the standard methodology to verify that the uncalibrated product performances are in line with those of the calibrated sm2rain the performance of the two rainfall datasets were then assessed against the gpm fr precipitation product in terms of the categorical indices false alarm ratio far probability of detection pod and threat score ts and the continuous indices r biasr and rmser it should be noticed that the gpm product contains both the solid and liquid fraction of the precipitation while sm2rain is able to estimate only the liquid fraction the masking of frozen condition for sm ascat product should be able to remove the days of solid precipitation from the comparison but in case of failure of frozen condition detection this issue could be a source of error in particular over high elevation and high latitude regions from imerg v05b full coverage is provided for the latitudes of 60 n 60 s while the remaining upper and lower latitudes extending to 90 are considered partial coverage the current analysis was restrained to the full coverage area 60 n 60 s to increase the accuracy of the results from now on the product obtained from the use of the parametric relationships will be labelled as parameterized while the one obtained using the standard calibration method will be named as calibrated the distribution of the categorical indices is shown in fig 4 as boxplots the indices were calculated for five rainfall classes respectively the 10th the 30th the 50th the 70th and the 90th percentile of the precipitation for every point regarding the far the two products show similar performances for the first two classes while the parameterized product has a higher percentage of false alarms for the last three classes different observations can be done for the pod index the calibrated product performs slightly better than the parameterized for the first three classes while it is true the opposite for the others two from this information it can be inferred that the parameterized product has greater capability in estimating the major rainfall events however the performances of the parameterized product are slightly worse than those of the calibration product for lower percentiles 50th due to a greater number of false alarms and to a lower detection ability these results are confirmed by the ts scores which indicates a slightly better performance of the calibrated product for the first four classes while for the fifth class the parameterized product performs better the differences in the performance are due to the different parameter values adopted by the two products fig 5 a shows the t parameter distribution for the whole area there are clear differences between the calibrated and parameterized values in both the median and the range of values this is probably a consequence of the strategy used to estimate t comparing the satellite sm with a modelled sm instead of calibrating the t values with respect to reference rainfall the parameterized product tends therefore to filter the sm data less than the calibrated product i e lower t values thus increasing the average sm variation that in turn increase the overall estimated rainfall this is the cause of the increase of both the far and pod indices z and a fig 5b and c show instead similar behaviour between the two products the values for the parameterized product are slightly greater than the calibrated product that is the reason of the overestimation tendency noted above finally fig 5d shows the distributions of b parameter which has similar median value but a very different variability range due to the relationship eq 13 used for relating a and b parameters r biasr and rmser were also calculated for the global analysis the distribution boxplots of these performance indices are shown in fig 6 the obtained results confirm the outcomes of the categorical indices analysis in terms of r the calibrated product is slightly better than the parameterized 0 4866 vs 0 4777 in the committed area the range of r values is also comparable fig 6a biasr for the parameterized product is around 0 2 confirming the tendency to overestimate rainfall whereas the calibrated product has a tendency to underestimation rmser values fig 6c are very similar between the parameterized and the calibrated product with differences lower than 5 the global map of r and rmser difference between parameterized and calibrated products are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively in the figures red colour indicates that the parameterized product is better than the calibrated one while the blue colour indicates the opposite an overall increase in pearson correlation is noticeable in the tropical area while many mountainous areas show a decrement in r values the relative error increase in forest desert and mountainous areas likely due to the lower filtering of sm values in the parameterized product one possible cause of the performance deterioration in topographically complex zones could be related to the low spatial resolution of the selected dem etopo5 a different product with higher resolution will be tested in future studies the mean pearson correlation values shown in fig 6a are around 0 5 for the committed area and 0 4 globally these correlation values are likely due to the differences between the dataset used to calibrate sm2rain and to obtain the climatology for the parametric relationships i e era5 and the product considered as benchmark i e gpm fr era5 and gpm fr are indeed not highly correlated by each other the mean value of r between them equals to 0 5604 in the committed area 0 5412 globally due to the difficulty to have a reliable rainfall benchmark on a global scale a tc analysis was performed to assess the capability of sm2rain products in rainfall estimation against an unknown true reference since tc requires three different products whose errors are uncorrelated two other global rainfall datasets were selected to be compared with the parameterized and the calibrated products separately gpcc and gpm lr chosen over gpm fr as the latter is corrected using gpcc monthly rainfall and therefore it does not satisfy the condition of uncorrelated error with gpcc since gpcc has a low spatial resolution 1 degree it was interpolated over ascat grid using a weighted average where the weights are the relative inverse of the distance between each ascat pixel and the four nearest gpcc points fig 9 shows the boxplot of the obtained r tc sm2rain rainfall products have mean values comparable with those of the other products for the committed area with a slight deterioration when the parametric relationships are used instead of the standard calibration moreover the areas where the parameterized product performs better than the other two is large red areas in fig 10 gpcc is the best performing product over most of europe and asia half of north america and half of australia where there is a high density of gauge stations gpm lr performs better over forest and desert areas where ascat sm has large errors green areas in fig 10 in most of the remaining zones red areas in fig 10 sm2rain ascat derived from the parametric relationships performs better than the other products confirming the capacity of sm2rain in estimating rainfall over africa and south america brocca et al 2020 massari et al 2020 also when the parameterized product is considered for further information about the mutual correlation between the products the individual maps of tc correlation have been added in the appendix as mentioned above the tc correlation values should not be taken as absolute measures of accuracy but rather as relative measures between the three datasets 5 conclusions in this paper four parametric relationships were developed to estimate sm2rain parameter values from climatic and land descriptors a local analysis was performed over a regular grid of 1009 points uniformly distributed over the areas covered by rain gauges in australia india italy and us for which high quality observed rainfall data were available several climatic and land descriptor datasets were analysed to obtain an inclusive description of each point and to find the descriptors related to the four sm2rain parameters the four parametric relationships were finally developed obtaining the parameter values estimation from the knowledge of the sm timeseries and its noise the topographic complexity and the mean annual rainfall the major drops in correlation due the use of the parametric relationships instead of the calibration against a reference is caused by the t parameter while the major increase in rmse is caused by the a parameter possible causes of these behaviours could be attributed to the accuracy of the selected datasets for obtaining the descriptors and these problems will be investigated in future studies to validate the obtained results a global application of sm2rain on ascat sm was performed using the parametric relationships parameterized sm2rain ascat and the standard calibration methodology calibrated sm2rain ascat era5 rainfall was used to assess mean annual rainfall and as calibration dataset while gpm fr rainfall was used as benchmark to calculate performance indices from the analysis of the categorical and continuous scores an overall similar capacity in rainfall estimation between the calibrated and parameterized product is found in particular even if the calibrated product has slightly better performances both in terms of correlation and bias the parameterized product resulted more capable in the detection of larger rainfall events finally a triple collocation analysis was performed by using gpm lr gpcc and the two sm2rain ascat products the analysis revealed that even if the parameterized version of sm2rain ascat has slightly lower correlations than the others in the committed area there are several regions e g in africa and south america in which its performance is better than both gpm lr and gpcc suggesting the utility of this product for rainfall estimation in future studies the addition of new descriptors to estimate sm2rain parameters will be investigated e g radio frequency interference indicators land cover high resolution topography these relationships could be very important for estimating rainfall from high resolution sm since calibration data with high spatial and temporal resolution are often unavailable therefore the methodology will be applied to sm timeseries from sentinel 1 in order to assess their validity and to provide a self calibrated high resolution 1 km rainfall product from remote sensing 6 financial support this research has been supported by eumetsat global sm2rain project grant no eum co 17 4600001981 bbo and satellite

4087,rainfall monitoring is fundamental in many hydrological applications such as flood and landslide forecasting and water resources management in situ measurements are the traditional data source of rainfall but the worldwide declining number of stations their low spatial representativeness and the data access problem limit their use satellite products are being widely used as an alternative data source among them sm2rain based products which exploit the inversion of the water balance equation to derive rainfall from soil moisture observations have shown relatively good skills for hydrological applications however the need of calibrating the sm2rain parameter values against a reference represents one important limitation particularly over data scarce regions in this study we explore the possibility to self calibrate sm2rain and thus to obtain rainfall estimates from the advanced scatterometer ascat soil moisture independently from any reference rainfall dataset four parametric relationships relating sm2rain parameter values to static descriptors average rainfall topography soil moisture noise are developed to develop such relationships a sample of 1009 points uniformly distributed over the areas covered by rain gauges in australia india italy and the united states is selected a global validation of the methodology is conducted by comparing the performances of the parameterized product with the classical product in which the parameter values are estimated by calibration against a reference rainfall dataset the final run of the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg precipitation dataset is used for performance assessment together with the triple collocation techniques by using the gauge based global precipitation climatology center gpcc product and the late run of imerg the aim of the analysis is to obtain an uncalibrated sm2rain methodology to retrieve rainfall whose performance are similar to those obtained with calibration the results at 1009 points show that the performances of the parameterized sm2rain product are in line with those of the calibrated one with an increased capability in the detection of intense rainfall events and an acceptable reduction of the performance according to both pearson correlation and root mean square error indexes the application of triple collocation confirms these findings on a global scale showing that the sm2rain product outperforms both gpcc and imerg late run estimations in areas characterized by low density of rain gauges and good quality of ascat soil moisture retrievals i e africa and south america keywords rainfall soil moisture remote sensing sm2rain 1 introduction floods drought and landslides are the water related natural hazards that cause the most serious damage to the environment people and properties the occurrence of those events is related to climate wet soil moisture sm conditions and intense rainfall are often the drivers of flood and landslide events ciabatta et al 2016 according to international panel on climate change ipcc 5th report climate change is expected to aggravate the occurrence of those phenomena since extreme weather and climate events will step up ipcc 2013 the knowledge of the triggering conditions of hydroclimatic hazards can be used in prediction models in order to help the authorities to prevent or mitigate them hannah et al 2011 ponziani et al 2012 the presence of an adequate monitoring network capable of providing accurate precipitation estimation is therefore fundamental not only for water resources management or agricultural planning but also to reduce the loss of lives and economic damages however the rain gauge coverage is declining worldwide and unequally distributed being concentrated in developed countries kidd et al 2017 vörösmarty et al 2001 moreover despite being highly accurate rain gauge stations are not free from errors peterson et al 1998 villarini et al 2008 remote sensing techniques are currently the only valuable alternative to ground based networks as they have demonstrated their potential in the estimation of rainfall at relevant spatial and temporal scales globally kidd and levizzani 2011 the classical remote sensing based technique to estimate rainfall is the top down approach brocca et al 2014a where the upwelling radiation or backscatter from clouds measured by satellite sensors are used to estimate the surface instantaneous precipitation rate one distinguished example of this type of product is the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg product of the global precipitation measurement gpm mission hou et al 2014 characterized by relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions compared to its predecessors 0 1 and 30 min respectively and global coverage this was achieved using a new dual frequency precipitation radar dpr and an accurate radiometer both fundamental to calibrate infrared and microwave data from multiple polar and geostationary satellites despite the good level of accuracy achieved the difficulties in obtaining and inter calibrating near real time observations from multiple agencies and the overall high cost for operation and maintenance of the whole satellite constellation are obstacles still to be overcome in order to guarantee the data continuity moreover additional rainfall datasets are still needed to understand residual uncertainties and errors massari et al 2017 chen et al 2020 like e g seasonal and local bias maggioni and massari 2018 the integration of imerg with alternative rainfall products can be also carried out to reduce uncertainties as in massari et al 2020 the recently introduced bottom up approach points toward addressing these problems by inferring or correcting rainfall estimation over land using sm observations from satellite or gauges this method provides accumulated rainfall estimates crow et al 2009 brocca et al 2013 pellarin et al 2013 instead than the instantaneous rate as for the top down products many methods based on this approach share the same limitations linked to the limits of measuring sm from space rainfall estimated only over land low accuracy in presence of dense vegetation or complex topography and difficulties in estimating rainfall in case of soil saturation among the bottom up approaches sm2rain brocca et al 2014a was applied to different satellite sm products over different regions worldwide with satisfying results through the inversion of the soil water balance equation it is capable to obtain the accumulated rainfall occurred between two sm measurements the method has already been applied to different sm products for local brocca et al 2015 tarpanelli et al 2017 and global brocca et al 2019 massari et al 2020 analysis three global rainfall products based on sm2rain were developed two of them were derived from the use of sm2rain alone sm2rain cci ciabatta et al 2018 sm2rain ascat brocca et al 2019 while the third one was derived from the integration with a top down product i e imerg late run gpm sm2rain massari et al 2020 different studies have shown the usefulness of these products for hydrological application such as flood and landslide prediction brunetti et al 2018 camici et al 2018 brocca et al 2020 in order to obtain accurate rainfall estimates sm2rain parameter values need to be calibrated against a reference rainfall dataset e g gauge based with spatial and temporal resolution comparable with those of the sm dataset in this paper we propose a methodology to estimate the sm2rain parameter values independently from a reference i e a self calibrated sm2rain product four parametric relationships are obtained starting from climatic and land descriptors e g observed mean annual rainfall topography soil moisture error to obtain the four sm2rain parameter values understanding the relationships of the parameters with these descriptors is a step forward for a better physical understanding of sm2rain and the possibility 1 to obtain an independent rainfall product i e without the need of calibration against a reference dataset and 2 to apply the method at high resolution e g 1 km as obtained from sentinel 1 mission bauer marschallinger et al 2018 bauer marschallinger et al 2019 the methodology is tested firstly at 1009 points uniformly distributed regular grid with a space resolution of 0 25 over the areas covered by rain gauges in australia india italy and united states us several datasets globally available including soil texture evapotranspiration soil temperature satellite sm and observed rainfall climatology are collected to be used as predictors a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data collected is carried out to identify the descriptors better related to each parameter of sm2rain algorithm and to obtain parametric relationships linking sm2rain parameter values to the selected predictors secondly the parametric relationships are applied on a global scale for the period 2013 2019 and the performances of the parameterized sm2rain product are compared with those resulting from the calibration of sm2rain in the same period different global rainfall products gpm imerg final run gpm imerg late run and gpcc are considered for performance evaluation through classical performance metrics computation and triple collocation analysis massari et al 2017 we finally aim to assess whether the self calibrated sm2rain product performances are in line with those of the calibrated product 2 data multiple descriptors are considered for the estimation of sm2rain algorithm parameter values through a regression based regionalization approach jakeman et al 1992 post et al 1998 sefton and howarth 1998 seibert 1999 wagener et al 2004 several datasets are selected describing climatic rainfall and evapotranspiration and land soil texture and soil type sm soil temperature topography and vegetation cover characteristics the datasets have been selected for different reasons including their relation with soil state and their availability worldwide in the following the datasets description is provided see table 1 2 1 climatic data 2 1 1 regional rainfall datasets regional gauge derived rainfall datasets were collected for the 1009 points uniformly distributed 0 25 degree resolution over the areas covered by rain gauges in australia italy us and india the regional rainfall datasets are used as reference for sm2rain calibration at the points for which the parametric relationships are developed for each region of the study area the data are collected for the period 2013 2017 in particular the australian water availability project awap rainfall product was downloaded for the australia region this gridded dataset is obtained from the interpolation of daily measurements of the australian bureau of meteorology raingauge network performed by using an optimized barnes successive correction technique its spatial resolution is about 5 km 0 05 degree with a daily temporal resolution the rainfall dataset of the italian civil protection department ita dpc is an interpolation of more than 3000 rain gauges distributed over the italian territory the interpolation is carried out using the random generator of space interpolations from uncertain observations griso pignone et al 2010 algorithm to spatially interpolate the measurements on a grid with about 10 km 0 1 degree spatial resolution and aggregating the hourly data to the daily time step for the us region the national oceanic and atmospheric administration climate prediction center noaa cpc daily us unified precipitation was downloaded this rainfall product is characterized by an improved quality obtained by combining all information sources available at cpc and by taking advantage of the optimal interpolation oi objective analysis technique xie et al 2007 its spatial resolution is about 25 km 0 25 degree with a daily temporal resolution india region daily rainfall was obtained by downloading the india meteorological department imd gridded dataset this product combines daily rainfall data from 6955 gauges using the shepard method pai et al 2014 to interpolate them and it is characterized by a spatial resolution of about 25 km 0 25 degree the mentioned datasets were all temporally interpolated from their local time to 00 00 utc accepting the resulting uncertainty to obtain regular time spacing in order to simplify the intercomparison with satellite derived products available at 00 00 utc 2 1 2 global rainfall datasets different global rainfall datasets were downloaded to obtain and validate the new sm2rain ascat parameterized rainfall product for the period 2013 2019 global precipitation climatology centre gpcc rainfall product first guess is obtained from 7000 quality controlled stations all over the world schamm et al 2014 its spatial resolution is 1 with a daily temporal resolution since it is based on ground observation the accuracy of the dataset is greater over region with high gauge density i e europe and us the imerg algorithm estimates precipitation over the majority of earth s surface by inter calibrating the available passive microwave pmw satellite precipitation estimates to the combined radar radiometer precipitation estimates from the gpm mission core observatory gpm co and then by merging and interpolating together these estimates with other precipitation estimates from infrared geostationary sensors huffman et al 2020 morphing and kalman filtering interpolation are used to provide the precipitation estimate if no valid microwave data are available the resulting product spatial resolution is 0 1 degrees and the temporal resolution is 30 min three runs of imerg are available to the users based on increasing latency and accuracy early run imerg er latency of 4 6 h after observation late run imerg lr latency 12 18 h and final run imerg fr latency of about 3 months final run v06 product with a monthly adjustment based on gpcc and late run v06 product are used here in this study the 30 min rainfall data were accumulated to obtain daily precipitation estimates european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis 5th generation era5 provide hourly data of various global atmosphere land surface and sea state variables combining models with observations it was developed within the copernicus climate change service c3s and it replaces the previous era interim reanalysis product its spatial resolution is around 36 km resampled on a regular 0 25 degree grid and the temporal resolution is 1 hour hersbach et al 2020 the hourly rainfall was calculated by subtracting the snowfall fraction to the total precipitation and accumulated to daily scale in this study 2 1 3 evapotranspiration hourly evapotranspiration data from era5 were obtained for each point of the study area the hourly data were accumulated on windows of 12 h centred at 00 00 utc and 12 00 utc to obtain a temporal resolution aligned with the sm datasets 12 h spacing 2 2 land data 2 2 1 satellite soil moisture and soil moisture noise advanced scatterometer ascat is an active microwave sensor onboard of metop a launched 19 10 2006 metop b launched 17 09 2012 and metop c launched 07 11 2018 satellites it uses two sets of three vertically polarized antennae one on each side of the satellite ground track and it senses backscatter radiation at 5 255 ghz c band the sensor was originally developed to sense wind speed over oceans but it turned out to be also sensitive to the amount of water in the soil leading to the development of one of the longest satellite sm product available nowadays from 2007 onward ascat retrievals have a spatial resolution of 25 km sampled at 12 5 km 0 125 relative sm estimates and their related noise were downloaded from european organisation for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat satellite application facility on support to operational hydrology and water management h saf h115 and h116 products for the period 2013 2019 in these years the contemporary availability of the satellites metop a and b permitted a sub daily temporal resolution over most of the earth wagner et al 2013 when the surface state was indicated as frozen sm estimates were discarded ascat measurements were linearly interpolated every 12 h to obtain regular time spacing if no data were found within 5 days each datum in the interval was set to not a number nan 2 2 2 modelled soil moisture hourly sm in the first soil layer 0 7 cm of the ecmwf integrated forecasting system data from era5 land were downloaded for the analysis period era5 land was produced by regridding the land component of the ecmwf era5 climate reanalysis with a finer spatial resolution 0 1 degree sm was subsampled every 12 h to obtain the same temporal resolution of ascat data 2 2 3 topographic data elevation data from earth topography 5 arc minute etopo5 were downloaded although the product is available on a regular grid of 5 minutes 0 08 the resolution of the source data base varies from 5 minute for the ocean floors usa europe japan and australia to 1 in data deficient parts of asia south america northern canada and africa 2 2 4 soil temperature soil temperature data in the first soil layer 0 7 cm of the ecmwf integrated forecasting system data from era5 land were downloaded for the analysis period the hourly data were subsampled every 12 h to match the temporal resolution of ascat data 2 2 5 soil composition data the harmonized world soil database v1 2 wieder et al 2014 contains worldwide soil composition information derived from regional and national data several soil parameters were downloaded for this analysis for the nominal year of 2000 including soil depth sand silt clay fraction reference soil depth carbon content and bulk density at a spatial resolution of 5 min 0 08 2 2 6 vegetation continuous field global fractional vegetation cover data vcf5kyrv001 was downloaded from nasa making earth system data records for use in research environments measures the dataset relative to the nominal year of 2015 was downloaded containing information of tree cover vegetation bare ground and non tree cover vegetation area percentage with a spatial resolution of 0 05 3 methods 3 1 sm2rain sm2rain is an algorithm developed by brocca et al 2013 and brocca et al 2014a to estimate the accumulated rainfall between two sm measurements this result can be achieved by inverting the soil water balance equation it was successfully applied to different satellite and in situ sm dataset ciabatta et al 2018 brocca et al 2019 filippucci et al 2020 offering good results especially in poorly gauged regions massari et al 2020 considering a layer characterized by a soil depth z mm and a soil porosity n m3 m3 the soil water balance equation can be written as 1 z n d s m t d t p t r t e t g t where sm t is the relative sm i e the soil moisture saturation fraction p t is the rainfall rate mm d r t is the surface runoff rate mm d e t the evaporation rate mm d and g t the drainage rate mm d during rainfall events and unsaturated conditions evaporation and surface runoff rates can be considered negligible brocca et al 2015 eq 1 can therefore be rewritten by using famiglietti and wood 1994 relationship to express the drainage rate as 2 p t z d s m t d t a sm t b with z z n a mm d is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and b is the exponent of famiglietti and wood equation remotely sensed sm tends to be noisy and it is sensitive to a thin topsoil layer few centimetres therefore the exponential filter approach wagner et al 1999 albergel et al 2008 is applied to satellite sm observations before their use in eq 2 the estimation of rainfall is therefore obtained by the knowledge of two consecutive sm measurements together with 4 parameters z a b and t the time constant of the exponential filter in its standard application the parameter values are estimated by calibrating sm2rain against reference rainfall data with similar spatial and temporal resolution with the objective of minimizing the root mean square error rmse 3 2 procedure for the parametric relationship the methodology used to obtain the four parametric relationships is described here as a first step 1009 points uniformly distributed over the areas covered by rain gauges in australia india italy and us were selected see fig 1 and brocca et al 2019 each point is representative of an area of 25 25 km2 and the spacing between the points is around 1 secondly the climatic and land descriptors were spatially interpolated to the 1009 points the chosen interpolation methods consists in the nearest neighbour technique for evapotranspiration data weighted average of the overlapping areas for datasets with a spatial resolution finer than 25 km and weighted average of the four nearest pixels for the remaining datasets for the time varying quantities e g rainfall and soil moisture different statistics were computed for each point to obtain the descriptors specifically the daily annual average and the average number of rainy days per year was calculated for rainfall therefore obtaining information about the climatology of each point to obtain them first the percentage of rainy days precipitation 0 and the average precipitation were calculated for each day of the year doy using the available years then the average values were calculated to obtain the annual average values for sm sm noise soil temperature and evapotranspiration the mean median maximum minimum standard deviation and coefficient of variation were computed in each point of the selected area the temporal difference of consecutive sm and sm noise measurements was also considered since the variation of sm is exploited in sm2rain to obtain rainfall the mean median maximum minimum standard deviation and coefficient of variation were therefore calculated also over these differences considering both the actual and the absolute values and just the positive and negative variations since these should be related to different mechanisms of wetting and drying of the soil e g the average value of the positive variation of sm or the maximum of the absolute variation of sm noise for the elevation the mean and the standard deviation within each pixel was computed particularly the standard deviation of elevation is an indicator of topographic complexity the latter decreases the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals due to shadowing effects and layover a distortion that occurs in radar imaging when the signal reflected from the top of a tall feature is received by the emitter before the one of the base ulaby et al 1981 thirdly the potential relationship between the descriptors and sm2rain parameter values was analysed through the spearman correlation index spearman correlation index was calculated between each parameter and each descriptor in order to obtain the parametric relationships only the descriptors who showed a high absolute value of spearman correlation greater than 0 6 with the related parameter were considered sm2rain parametric relationships were finally obtained through a stepwise non linear backward approach all the possible additive and multiplicative combinations between the selected descriptors were initially used in a multilinear regression algorithm to obtain a first estimation of the relationship an exemplary formula for the combination of n descriptors is here reported 3 par α 0 i 1 n β i d i i 1 n j 1 n i γ i d i d j ω i 1 n d i where α i β i γ i and ω are the coefficients to be estimated and d i is a descriptor the procedure was repeated iteratively by eliminating at each step the less significant factor until an optimal combination of limited number of coefficients minor or equal to 3 and good performance drops in spearman correlation in comparison with the previous step 0 015 was reached it was also verified that the spearman correlations between each factor used in the relationship were below 0 2 in order to avoid the cross correlation between the factors used in the parametric relationships 3 3 validation in order to assess the goodness of the parametric relationships the parameterized sm2rain rainfall product was compared with the sm2rain ascat rainfall product obtained by calibrating sm2rain with the standard approach using era5 rainfall as reference sm2rain ascat was calibrated in the full available period 2013 2019 in order to compare the parameterized product with the best possible sm2rain version it has to be noted that the standard calibration results presented in this paper are different from those obtained in brocca et al 2019 who applied a different filtering approach and the climatology correction based on era5 not considered here both the sm2rain derived rainfall products were compared with a benchmark dataset section 3 3 1 and by using triple collocation section 3 3 2 all the products involved in the validation were re gridded to ascat grid 12 5 km spacing using the same weighted average procedure applied before paragraph 3 2 sm2rain method is applicable everywhere but the reliability of the estimated rainfall depends on the reliability of the estimated sm this excludes all the areas with high vegetation regime where c band microwave measurements cannot reach the soil coastal areas wetlands topographically complex areas region characterized by subsurface scattering morrison and wagner 2020 and frozen or snow cover terrains hahn et al 2018 it was therefore defined a committed area with high confidence in the successful retrieval of surface soil moisture from metop ascat by excluding the aforementioned categories the committed area is obtained from the eumetsat h saf product validation report hahn et al 2018 two different methodologies were then used to assess rainfall products accuracy classical performance scores and triple collocation 3 3 1 classical performance scores continuous metrics were applied to compare the daily rainfall estimates with the dataset taken as the standard gpm fr in particular linear pearson correlation r pearson correlation is the most common way to characterize statistical dependency between two datasets it can be obtained from the ratio between the covariance of two dataset and the product of their standard deviation it varies between 1 and 1 where 1 means negative linear relationship 1 means positive linear relationship and 0 means no statistical dependency relative bias biasr relative bias index can be calculated as the mean difference between two datasets divided by the mean value of the reference dataset it describes whether there is a systematic over or under estimation with respect to the reference data in this paper the difference is performed between the estimated and the observed rainfall therefore negative bias values mean that the product underestimates the rainfall while positive bias values indicate overestimation relative root mean square error rmser root mean square error rmse can be calculated as the average deviation between single measurements of two dataset it comprehends three sources of error decorrelation bias and random error it should be noted that since there is no true measure of a quantity rmse reliability strongly depends from the reference dataset accuracy relative rmse rmser is obtained dividing rmse by the mean value of the reference dataset categorical indices were also computed to measure the performances in detecting rainfall for different precipitation classes five classes were selected dividing the rainfall events in those greater than the 10th the 30th the 50th the 70th and the 90th percentile for each point of the grid the categorical indices were calculated for each of those classes naming h the number of successfully predicted events f the number of falsely detected events and m the number of missed events we can define false alarm ratio far refers to the fraction of erroneously detected events for each class the optimum value is 0 4 far f h f probability of detection pod refers to the fraction of correctly predicted events for each class the optimum value is 1 5 pod h h m threat score ts is an integrated measure of the overall performances giving the fraction of successfully detected events over the total missed and detected events for each class the optimum value is 1 6 ts h h f m 3 3 2 triple collocation the classical methods described above permit to assess the similarities between the analysed dataset and a reference one therefore the performances reliability is dependent on the accuracy of the reference but since no dataset has zero error measurement villarini et al 2008 not even gauges peterson et al 1998 kidd et al 2017 the obtained performances are subjected to error triple collocation tc method instead permits the assessment of uncertainties of three different products against an unknown true reference here a brief explanation of the theory behind the method is presented for further information the reader is referred to massari et al 2017 and stoffelen 1998 each measure related to a quantity is characterized by both a random and a systematic error 7 x α x β x θ ε x where x is the measure θ is the unknown truth ε x the random error and α x and β x are respectively the additive and multiplicative component of the systematic error taking into consideration three different datasets whose errors are uncorrelated the random error of each dataset can be considered gaussian distributed with zero mean the error variance of each dataset can therefore be written as mccoll et al 2014 8 σ ε q 11 q 12 q 13 q 23 q 22 q 12 q 23 q 13 q 33 q 13 q 23 q 12 where q ij is the covariance between the dataset i and j mccoll underlined that although gaussianity ensures that the rmse is well descripted and assists in the interpretation gaussian data are not required for the tc as it is often applied to non gaussian data such as sm by using the definitions of correlation and covariance it can be derived 9 r tc q 12 q 13 q 11 q 23 q 12 q 23 q 22 q 13 q 13 q 23 q 33 q 12 r tc is the tc correlation against the unknown truth this measure should not be taken as an absolute measure but as a relative measure between the three datasets in this study tc was used for the global analysis validation of sm2rain the three products selected were therefore sm2rain itself first the parameterized and then the calibrated product and two other global rainfall datasets gpcc and gpm lr chosen over gpm fr because the latter is corrected using gpcc monthly rainfall and therefore it does not satisfy the condition of uncorrelated error 4 results and discussion 4 1 local analysis the objective of this paper is to find and validate four parametric relationships to estimate the sm2rain algorithm parameter values from climatic and land descriptors readily available worldwide through these relationships sm2rain can be easily applied without the need of a reference rainfall dataset by using the 1009 points a local analysis was performed to find the parametric relationships 4 1 1 descriptors selection the number of potential descriptors obtained from soil data vegetation continuous field topography data and the statistic of time varying quantities exceed 50 spearman correlation values between each of them and sm2rain parameters were therefore calculated in order to reduce the number of descriptors by selecting for each parameter the quantities that are better related to it an example of the procedure can be found in fig 2 where three scatter density plots between the parameter z and three representative descriptors are shown in the example it can be seen how the soil water storage capacity values obtained from the harmonized world soil database does not show significant correlation with the z parameter fig 2c contrary to the expectation greater absolute values of spearman correlation were obtained from the annual average daily rainfall fig 2a and the standard deviation of the soil temperature fig 2b with the latter showing an inverse relationship with the analysed parameter these two descriptors were therefore selected to be used in the multilinear regression algorithm while the soil water storage capacity was discarded note that the standard deviation of soil temperature was discarded in the successive step for the sake of brevity neither the details of the descriptors selection nor every iteration of the stepwise non linear backward regression is described here but the final relationships are directly shown at the end of the procedure most of the analysed descriptors were discarded the descriptors who resulted more significant for sm2rain parameters estimation were only those related to sm sm noise precipitation and topography 4 1 2 t parameter the first obtained relationship was the one relative to the exponential filter parameter t this parameter was the first to be calculated in order to obtain reduced noise sm from satellite sm estimates the reduced noise sm estimates are used in eq 2 and in the calculation of the sm descriptors for the successive sm2rain parameters relationships the reference values for t parameter were obtained by applying the exponential filter to ascat sm data maximizing r between the filtered sm and the modelled sm from era5 first soil layer 0 7 cm afterward the points with r values greater than a fixed threshold of 0 6 were retained and used as reference t values to be compared with the climatic and land descriptors see paragraph 3 2 the selection of points with correlation greater than 0 6 was done to avoid fitting the parametric relationship to not representative data visual inspection and spearman correlation were used to identify which descriptors were better correlated with the reference t values a non linear regression model was then iteratively applied to the selected descriptors in order to find the best parametric relationship the optimal relationship can be written as 10 t 0 8788 1 7020 s m n o i s e s t d sm d 0 3555 s t d sm d p t o p c where smnoise is the temporal mean value of the sm noise relative to ascat estimates std sm d is the temporal standard deviation of the absolute values of ascat sm temporal variations p is the annual average of daily rainfall and topc is the topographic complexity spatial standard deviation of elevation values within each pixel 4 1 3 b parameter according to famiglietti and wood 1994 b can be considered equal to 11 b 3 2 λ where λ is the pore size distribution index a parametric relationship to estimate λ as a function of a parameter was proposed by brocca et al 2014b 12 λ 0 085 log a 0 1574 the same relationship was adopted in this study but the two coefficients were recalibrated using the following procedure t values from eq 10 were used to obtain filtered ascat sm series to which apply sm2rain the three parameters of the balance equation were then calibrated against reference regional rainfall observations 1009 points the points with r between the observed and estimated rainfall greater than the fixed threshold of 0 6 and with t value less than a threshold fixed to 6 were then selected as before to avoid fitting the parametric relationship to not representative data and the two coefficients of eq 12 were calculated by fitting the relationship between the calibrated a and b parameter values thus obtaining 13 b 3 2 0 5928 log a 0 3022 4 1 4 z and a parameter by using eqs 10 and 13 the sm2rain algorithm was re applied to ascat sm estimates at 1009 points by only calibrating z and a parameters again the points with r between estimated and observed rainfall greater than the fixed threshold of 0 6 and with t value 6 were selected to be compared with the climatic and land descriptors visual inspection and spearman correlation were used to identify which quantities were better related with z parameter then a linear regression model was applied to them in order to find the z parametric relationship 14 z 10 3124 0 5186 p sm d the same procedure was adopted to find a parametric relationship after recalibrating the sm2rain algorithm for only the a parameter and fixing the others through eqs 10 13 and 14 the obtained equations for a was 15 a 1 5748 13 0324 z sm d where p is the annual average of daily rainfall and sm d is the temporal mean of the absolute values of ascat sm temporal variations 4 1 5 test of parametric relationships by using eqs 10 13 14 and 15 the four sm2rain parameters can be obtained from knowing the ascat sm timeseries and its noise the topographic complexity and the mean annual rainfall to avoid non physical values for the parameters the boundaries reported in table 2 were applied fixing all the parameters that exceed limits to the boundary itself we note that the parametric relationships obtained through a statistical regression based approach show physical reasoning in the expected correlation between sm2rain algorithm parameters and climatic and land descriptors indeed eq 10 indicates that the exponential filter t parameter is directly proportional to the mean value of sm noise to standard deviation of absolute sm variation to the ratio between the latter and the annual average daily rainfall and to the topographic complexity all these descriptors increase with either sm measurement error i e sm noise and topographic complexity or temporal sm variability i e s t d sm d and 1 p in both cases higher t values are expected since a higher value of t increases the filtering capacities eqs 14 and 15 link the estimation of z and a to the value of sm d and p indeed z increases with the ratio between p and sm d because it is a measure of the amount of water stored in the soil while a is directly correlated with p as mentioned above to obtain the parametric relationships sm2rain was applied to ascat sm for the 1009 points for 5 times after and before the definition of each parameter relationship by using the available equations and by calibrating the remaining parameters with the standard approach i e minimization of rmse the performances of the obtained rainfall in terms of r and rmse are shown in table 3 a few insights can be deduced from these results the overall drop in performances is limited thus demonstrating that the obtained parametric relationships are well suited to estimate the sm2rain parameter values the major drop in correlation can be ascribed to the parameter t this can be easily explained as the parameter t is the only one related to rainfall occurrence to which the correlation is highly sensitive while the others parameters are more related to rainfall amount and hence to rmse a possible reason for the correlation deterioration could be due to error in modelled sm from era5 however different tests with the other soil layers of era5 and other modelling approaches were carried out and worse results were obtained not shown for the sake of brevity the parametric relationship for a is the one that caused the greatest increase in rmse see table 3 finally we underline that soil and vegetation descriptors were found not fundamental for obtaining the parametric relationships likely due to the limited accuracy of these datasets at the considered spatial resolution particularly for soil information and the limited influence of vegetation on the analysed parameters confirming the findings of sehgal et al 2020 4 2 global analysis the good results obtained at 1009 points led to the application of the parametric relationships on a global scale the parameters maps obtained using the parametric relationships on a quasi global scale 60 s 60 n are shown in fig 3 as expected exponential filter t parameter is greater over desert forest and mountain areas fig 3d where sm quality is lower while the distributions of z and a fig 3a and b reflect the known areas where the average rainfall rate is high equatorial region era5 rainfall was used to obtain the annual average daily rainfall for the parametric relationships and also to calibrate sm2rain ascat with the standard methodology to verify that the uncalibrated product performances are in line with those of the calibrated sm2rain the performance of the two rainfall datasets were then assessed against the gpm fr precipitation product in terms of the categorical indices false alarm ratio far probability of detection pod and threat score ts and the continuous indices r biasr and rmser it should be noticed that the gpm product contains both the solid and liquid fraction of the precipitation while sm2rain is able to estimate only the liquid fraction the masking of frozen condition for sm ascat product should be able to remove the days of solid precipitation from the comparison but in case of failure of frozen condition detection this issue could be a source of error in particular over high elevation and high latitude regions from imerg v05b full coverage is provided for the latitudes of 60 n 60 s while the remaining upper and lower latitudes extending to 90 are considered partial coverage the current analysis was restrained to the full coverage area 60 n 60 s to increase the accuracy of the results from now on the product obtained from the use of the parametric relationships will be labelled as parameterized while the one obtained using the standard calibration method will be named as calibrated the distribution of the categorical indices is shown in fig 4 as boxplots the indices were calculated for five rainfall classes respectively the 10th the 30th the 50th the 70th and the 90th percentile of the precipitation for every point regarding the far the two products show similar performances for the first two classes while the parameterized product has a higher percentage of false alarms for the last three classes different observations can be done for the pod index the calibrated product performs slightly better than the parameterized for the first three classes while it is true the opposite for the others two from this information it can be inferred that the parameterized product has greater capability in estimating the major rainfall events however the performances of the parameterized product are slightly worse than those of the calibration product for lower percentiles 50th due to a greater number of false alarms and to a lower detection ability these results are confirmed by the ts scores which indicates a slightly better performance of the calibrated product for the first four classes while for the fifth class the parameterized product performs better the differences in the performance are due to the different parameter values adopted by the two products fig 5 a shows the t parameter distribution for the whole area there are clear differences between the calibrated and parameterized values in both the median and the range of values this is probably a consequence of the strategy used to estimate t comparing the satellite sm with a modelled sm instead of calibrating the t values with respect to reference rainfall the parameterized product tends therefore to filter the sm data less than the calibrated product i e lower t values thus increasing the average sm variation that in turn increase the overall estimated rainfall this is the cause of the increase of both the far and pod indices z and a fig 5b and c show instead similar behaviour between the two products the values for the parameterized product are slightly greater than the calibrated product that is the reason of the overestimation tendency noted above finally fig 5d shows the distributions of b parameter which has similar median value but a very different variability range due to the relationship eq 13 used for relating a and b parameters r biasr and rmser were also calculated for the global analysis the distribution boxplots of these performance indices are shown in fig 6 the obtained results confirm the outcomes of the categorical indices analysis in terms of r the calibrated product is slightly better than the parameterized 0 4866 vs 0 4777 in the committed area the range of r values is also comparable fig 6a biasr for the parameterized product is around 0 2 confirming the tendency to overestimate rainfall whereas the calibrated product has a tendency to underestimation rmser values fig 6c are very similar between the parameterized and the calibrated product with differences lower than 5 the global map of r and rmser difference between parameterized and calibrated products are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively in the figures red colour indicates that the parameterized product is better than the calibrated one while the blue colour indicates the opposite an overall increase in pearson correlation is noticeable in the tropical area while many mountainous areas show a decrement in r values the relative error increase in forest desert and mountainous areas likely due to the lower filtering of sm values in the parameterized product one possible cause of the performance deterioration in topographically complex zones could be related to the low spatial resolution of the selected dem etopo5 a different product with higher resolution will be tested in future studies the mean pearson correlation values shown in fig 6a are around 0 5 for the committed area and 0 4 globally these correlation values are likely due to the differences between the dataset used to calibrate sm2rain and to obtain the climatology for the parametric relationships i e era5 and the product considered as benchmark i e gpm fr era5 and gpm fr are indeed not highly correlated by each other the mean value of r between them equals to 0 5604 in the committed area 0 5412 globally due to the difficulty to have a reliable rainfall benchmark on a global scale a tc analysis was performed to assess the capability of sm2rain products in rainfall estimation against an unknown true reference since tc requires three different products whose errors are uncorrelated two other global rainfall datasets were selected to be compared with the parameterized and the calibrated products separately gpcc and gpm lr chosen over gpm fr as the latter is corrected using gpcc monthly rainfall and therefore it does not satisfy the condition of uncorrelated error with gpcc since gpcc has a low spatial resolution 1 degree it was interpolated over ascat grid using a weighted average where the weights are the relative inverse of the distance between each ascat pixel and the four nearest gpcc points fig 9 shows the boxplot of the obtained r tc sm2rain rainfall products have mean values comparable with those of the other products for the committed area with a slight deterioration when the parametric relationships are used instead of the standard calibration moreover the areas where the parameterized product performs better than the other two is large red areas in fig 10 gpcc is the best performing product over most of europe and asia half of north america and half of australia where there is a high density of gauge stations gpm lr performs better over forest and desert areas where ascat sm has large errors green areas in fig 10 in most of the remaining zones red areas in fig 10 sm2rain ascat derived from the parametric relationships performs better than the other products confirming the capacity of sm2rain in estimating rainfall over africa and south america brocca et al 2020 massari et al 2020 also when the parameterized product is considered for further information about the mutual correlation between the products the individual maps of tc correlation have been added in the appendix as mentioned above the tc correlation values should not be taken as absolute measures of accuracy but rather as relative measures between the three datasets 5 conclusions in this paper four parametric relationships were developed to estimate sm2rain parameter values from climatic and land descriptors a local analysis was performed over a regular grid of 1009 points uniformly distributed over the areas covered by rain gauges in australia india italy and us for which high quality observed rainfall data were available several climatic and land descriptor datasets were analysed to obtain an inclusive description of each point and to find the descriptors related to the four sm2rain parameters the four parametric relationships were finally developed obtaining the parameter values estimation from the knowledge of the sm timeseries and its noise the topographic complexity and the mean annual rainfall the major drops in correlation due the use of the parametric relationships instead of the calibration against a reference is caused by the t parameter while the major increase in rmse is caused by the a parameter possible causes of these behaviours could be attributed to the accuracy of the selected datasets for obtaining the descriptors and these problems will be investigated in future studies to validate the obtained results a global application of sm2rain on ascat sm was performed using the parametric relationships parameterized sm2rain ascat and the standard calibration methodology calibrated sm2rain ascat era5 rainfall was used to assess mean annual rainfall and as calibration dataset while gpm fr rainfall was used as benchmark to calculate performance indices from the analysis of the categorical and continuous scores an overall similar capacity in rainfall estimation between the calibrated and parameterized product is found in particular even if the calibrated product has slightly better performances both in terms of correlation and bias the parameterized product resulted more capable in the detection of larger rainfall events finally a triple collocation analysis was performed by using gpm lr gpcc and the two sm2rain ascat products the analysis revealed that even if the parameterized version of sm2rain ascat has slightly lower correlations than the others in the committed area there are several regions e g in africa and south america in which its performance is better than both gpm lr and gpcc suggesting the utility of this product for rainfall estimation in future studies the addition of new descriptors to estimate sm2rain parameters will be investigated e g radio frequency interference indicators land cover high resolution topography these relationships could be very important for estimating rainfall from high resolution sm since calibration data with high spatial and temporal resolution are often unavailable therefore the methodology will be applied to sm timeseries from sentinel 1 in order to assess their validity and to provide a self calibrated high resolution 1 km rainfall product from remote sensing 6 financial support this research has been supported by eumetsat global sm2rain project grant no eum co 17 4600001981 bbo and satellite

applicability for the other time series forecasting tasks keywords streamflow time series iceemdan seq2seq encode decode lstm deep learning rnn hybrid model 1 introduction reliable and accurate streamflow forecasting is vital for effective and optimal use of hydrological resources and provision of ancillary services by the hydrological assets apaydin et al 2020 however the stochastic and non stationary characteristics of the streamflow pose a challenge for its accurate forecasting meng et al 2019 therefore many studies in recent years focused on accurate streamflow forecasting ni et al 2020b there are three types of streamflow forecasting models physical statistical and hybrid the physical models consider the physical process of the hydrological cycle peng et al 2017 statistical models rely on the past time series prospective associations chen et al 2020 and are also called data driven models ddms or empirical models hybrid models are partly physical and partly statistical the machine learning models mlms comprising artificial neural network ann sattari et al 2012a taormina and chau 2015 wen et al 2019 yamac 2021 and support vector regression svr liang et al 2018 wang et al 2013 are extensively applied to study the nonlinear dynamics of the hydrological time series recently deep learning models dlms have been proposed as a superior form of mlms to handle nonlinear data because of their ability to learn sequential dependence liu et al 2020 the long short term memory lstm variant of recurrent neural network rnn is the most common dlm that is implemented successfully for streamflow forecasting applications apaydin et al 2020 hu et al 2018 le et al 2018 ni et al 2020a sattari et al 2012b lstm can be further developed into an encoder decoder architecture created from the sequence to sequence seq2seq network to improve the performance of dlms the lstm based seq2seq models however have been rarely applied for streamflow forecasting studies han et al 2021 lstm based seq2seq models have revealed better outcomes compared to the lstm model for streamflow and rainfall streamflow forecasting tasks kao et al 2021 kao et al 2020 yin et al 2021 the inputs series are encoded by the encoder to apprehend the association of factors influencing locally the local and global associations are modeled jointly by the decoder to extricate encoded vectors for predicting the streamflow data consequently the time series successive symmetries are learned in an inclusive and better way than the single network configurations bian et al 2020 despite the enhanced performance of ddms these models are sometimes unable to predict seamlessly the intricate streamflow data when applied as standalone models hybrid models were proposed to deal with the hydrological data more efficiently and enhance forecasting accuracy hybrid ddms can be constructed by integrating artificial intelligence ai based machine learning approaches with decomposition techniques xiang et al 2018 the decomposition of time series data into subcomponents can be employed to enhance the performance of the forecasting models tan et al 2018 wavelet transform wt is an improved version of fourier transform ft that can efficiently preserve the signal while minimizing noise plenty of wavelet based machine learning models have been developed for streamflow forecasting sahay and sehgal 2013 sehgal et al 2014a sehgal et al 2014b tiwari and chatterjee 2011 however the selection of parameters including threshold function wavelet basis and decomposition scale limits the self adaptive nature of wt pasti et al 1999 consequently the wavelet based models can be time consuming and computationally intensive owing to their lengthy parameter selection criteria the type of data considered generally decides the selection of the mother wavelet roushangar and alizadeh 2018 furthermore the choice of a near optimal global wavelet comprises a trial and error process through iteration without involving any definite rule prasad et al 2017 therefore the accurate and careful execution of wt is crucial to enhance the performance of hybrid models utilizing wt sachindra et al 2019 the decomposition of streamflow time series was carried out by applying empirical mode decomposition emd the results revealed that emd successfully decomposed the time series data into subcomponents emd has the ability to decompose a signal self adaptively into the intrinsic mode functions imfs and a residual component without necessitating any a priori constraints emd utilizes temporal space directly in contrast to wt that requires a conforming frequency space furthermore the local scale separation principle is considered by emd without needing any preset basis functions or mother wavelet huang et al 1998 lee and ouarda 2010 hence emd is an adaptive intuitive direct and empirical signal technique compared to wt zhu et al 2016 in other words the decomposition process is totally data driven in emd roushangar and alizadeh 2018 emd does not assume the stationarity of signal or its components as the imfs can change over time this fact implies better aptness of emd for nonlinear signals than ft or wt moreover wt exhibit suboptimal behavior in determining sudden changes in frequency from a wavelet convolution since it considers frequency stationarity and frequency smoothing through the period of wavelet on the contrary emd possesses superior characteristics in estimating the instantaneous changes in frequency roushangar and alizadeh 2018 ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd was proposed to alleviate the mode mixing and the orthogonality effect by adding white noise wu and huang 2009 zhao and chen 2015 applied eemd to decompose the non stationary streamflow data and convert it into stationary data for forecasting purposes eemd was deployed to enhance the streamflow time series forecasting accuracy for efficient management of the hydrological stations ma and li 2016 eemd was compared with discrete wavelet transform dwt and results revealed superior outcomes by eemd over the dwt based models for streamflow forecasting tayyab et al 2018 and denoising of signals gaci 2016 eemd resolved some mode mixing issues of emd however it was unable to eradicate the mode mixing issue of emd which led to the development of complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with additive noise ceemdan ceemdan can result in close to zero restoration error each step of ceemdan obtains the white noise addition along with the lesser time for integration torres et al 2011 the ceemdan technique has a proven track for its feasibility in different streamflow forecasting applications rezaie balf et al 2019 sibtain et al 2020a however ceemdan still suffers from the downsides of modal residual noise delay in signal information compared to eemd and the occurrence of doubtful modes improved ceemdan iceemdan is the latest of emd based versions and resolves the concerns about by its precursors colominas et al 2014 similar to the emd eemd and ceemdan techniques iceemdan also directly utilizes temporal space without involving mother wavelets whereas wt techniques exploit frequency space and mother wavelets should be pre decided considering the advantages and strengths of iceemdan over wt and emd based decomposition techniques several studies have recently applied iceemdan for time series forecasting including streamflow forecasting sibtain et al 2021a sibtain et al 2020b load forecasting li et al 2020b wind speed forecasting wang et al 2018 and solar irradiance forecasting sibtain et al 2021b the above literature review highlights the superiority of the seq2seq network and iceemdan technique over other similar models moreover entropy is widely used to determine the chaotic process in a system in terms of system state as a revision of approximate entropy sample entropy se is employed to gauge the intricacy of time series signals richman and moorman 2000 hence different time series are efficaciously examined using se bhavsar et al 2018 furthermore the gini index gi feature selection technique is widely employed in signal processing to determine the sparsity of signals rickard and fallon 2004 zonoobi et al 2011 gi is also an applicable measure for extracting suitable features janssens et al 2015 maragoudakis et al 2008 therefore a hybrid model iceemdan se gi seq2seq isgs is developed in this study to predict the daily streamflow data the proposed model is applied observed tested at the kirkgoze kosk and karagobek

three locations in the erzurum province turkey as illustrated in fig 1 the fourth largest city of turkey erzurum has an area of 25 355 km2 with a population of more than 750 000 erzurum s economy is based on agriculture animal husbandry mining and forestry it is an important center of animal husbandry and trade the annual surface water potential of erzurum province is 5225 106 m3 year an important part of which is constituted by the firat aras and coruh rivers the groundwater potential is 250 106 m3 year erzurum is one of turkey s highest and coldest regions dominated by the hard continental climate with a short and dry summer with long cold winters the region is covered with snow for about 70 days of the year average temperature in the erzurum region varies between 5 6 and 6 6 c while the temperature is 35 in summer the temperature drops down to 30 in winter the amount of precipitation is between 399 5 and 592 6 mm with an average of 558 4 mm fig 2 depicts the monthly averages of streamflow from 1978 to 2017 whereas fig 3 displays the monthly averages of temperature and precipitation anonymous 2020 sezen 1987 although there is diversity in agricultural production the majority is in meadows pastures and cereals among the agricultural products potato and sugar beet is increasingly common irrigated agriculture is carried out on an area of 136 670 000 m2 in erzurum the main products of irrigated agriculture are grains sugar beets corn sunflowers legumes orchards and forage crops artificial lands are 158 030 000 m2 agricultural lands 7 771 380 000 m2 forest 16 954 680 000 m2 wetlands 59 780 000 m2 and water structures 67 070 000 m2 the average altitude of the province is 1859 m above sea level with 12 14 of the soils are flat or slightly inclined at 60 43 steep and steep slope anonymous 2020 sezen 1987 table 1 summarizes the geographical locations coordinates and elevations of the measurement stations for streamflow and meteorological data moreover the statistical characteristics of daily streamflow data and meteorological parameters considered in this study are presented in tables 2 and 3 the pairwise relation of the streamflow variable with the daily mean streamflow dmq precipitation one day lagged pt 1 temperature tt 1 and relative humidity rht 1 variables for kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations is illustrated in fig 4 the distribution subplots of dmq temperature and relative humidity variables are left skewed with the streamflow data however the correlation subplot of the precipitation variable with the streamflow variable shows a right skewed distribution 2 2 models development fig 5 summarizes the architectures of the developed models and the hydro meteorological data utilized as inputs in the development of models the main steps highlighting the orderly development of all the models are presented below step 1 a multivariate data consisting both the hydrological and meteorological variables are considered for streamflow forecasting the hydrological data variables include the lagged streamflow values qt 1 to qt 7 and daily mean streamflow the precipitation temperature and relative humidity variables constitute the meteorological data step 2 the decomposition of the streamflow data into different subcomponents is performed through iceemdan for iceemdan based hybrid models and dwt for dwt based hybrid models step 3 se is employed to calculate the entropy values of the subcomponents produced in step 1 and the modes are reconstructed based on their se values since dwt based hybrid models generate five decomposed subseries therefore subseries reconstruction to reduce models complexity is not performed for dwt based hybrid models step 4 as a feature selection method the gi is utilized to select suitable features from the iceemdan generated reconstructed subcomponents of step 3 for iceemdan based hybrid models the decomposed subseries of step 2 through dwt for dwt based hybrid models and the hydro meteorological data of step 1 step 5 the features obtained through step 4 are used further as an input for the seq2seq models resulting in the establishment of hybrid iceemdan se gi seq2seq and dwt gi seq2seq models based on scenario ds iii step 6 three other models comprising the iceemdan se seq2seq model the dwt seq2seq model and the individual seq2seq model based on scenarios ds ii and ds i respectively are also established for comparison purposes the iceemdan se seq2seq model considers step 1 and step 3 data as an input the dwt seq2seq model is based on step 1 and step 2 whereas the seq2seq model is built by taking data of step 1 as an input step 7 in addition to the counterpart models the conclusion is drawn based on the results of the statistical metrics including the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ns willmott s index d correlation coefficient and several comparison plots 2 3 iceemdan iceemdan is the recent type of emd built decompositions methods that rectify the frequency aliasing and erroneous modes shortcoming as encountered by its antecedent techniques the white noise addition comprehends the steadiness of frequency amid adjacent scales through a subsequent decline of the consequent mixing in frequency the iceemdan technique core phases colominas et al 2014 are as follows i define the realizations by using the emd technique of local means as stated under 1 s g s β 0 e 1 w g where the added numeral for noise is g s is included to represent the signal as original sg specifies the signal that is used for decomposition the white noise is represented by wg and the white noise first constituent is depicted by e 1 w g ii next the determination of first residue r1 is expressed as 2 r 1 m s g where m indicates the mean of local to complete the imf sifting point iii the first mode is determined subsequent to the disintegration of n signals at the first phase as 3 im f 1 s r 1 iv the consequent phases conclude the second residue as well as the second mode as 4 r 2 m r 1 β 1 e 2 w g 5 im f 2 r 1 r 2 v the calculation of the kth residue and mode can be performed as 6 r k m r k 1 β k 1 e k w g 7 im f k r k 1 r k vi the successive k phases are obtained after repeating 4 2 4 discrete wavelet transform dwt is the most widely used type of wavelet transform methods for forecasting hydrological data due to the discrete nature of hydro meteorological data li et al 2020a the general form of dwt can be represented as follows abd rahim et al 2020 8 dwt d k 1 x t 0 n 1 s t m k y x where d is the index of decomposition the paretmeter of scaling and translation are x and y respectively x x o d y t x o d n represents samples number s t signifies the original time series signal mother wavelet is denoted by m dwt separates the frequency bands present in the signal by employing a high pass and a low pass filter the detail coefficients are obtained through the high pass filter whereas the approximation coefficients are generated through low pass filter wang et al 2020 the original signal is s t undergoes decomposition into a detail component d1 and an approximation compement a1 the a1 component is additionally decomposed into second detail component d2 and approximation componet a2 sachindra et al 2019 the expression for a three level dwt decomposition can be given as 9 s t d 1 a 1 d 1 d 2 a 2 d1 d2 d3 a3 the mother wavelets comprising haar daubechies and symlet are the normally utilized mother wavelets wang et al 2020 furthermore the exploitation of haar mother wavelet is easy and straightforward tang et al 2018 the optimum level of time series decomposition for dwt can be given by the following expression nourani et al 2009 10 l i n t l o g n where level decomposition is denoted by l while n signifies the numeral of data series under consideration nourani et al 2009 2 5 sample entropy sample entropy se is employed in the present study to determine the complexity of the iceemdan produced modal time series components and the subsequent reconstruction of subcomponents based on their se values the succeeding steps explain the se method li et al 2020c i the n points time series indicating the measured values is specified by 11 t 1 t 2 t 3 t n ii the reconstruction into d dimension for the aforementioned expression is 12 u 1 u 2 u 3 u n d 1 where 13 s d i t i t i 1 t i 2 t i d 1 iii the span amid s i i and s d j d s d i s d j is 14 d u d i u d j max k 0 d 1 u i k u j k iv the equation expressed below is employed to obtain the mean value of vectors as 15 b d r 1 n d 1 i 1 n d 1 b i d r v bd 1 r is found by iterating ii iv through the dimension d augmentation by 1 to represent the se process as 16 s e d r lim n ln b d 1 r b d r vi the value of n is usually limited thus equation 17 obtain the form 17 s e d r n lim n ln b d 1 r b d r where dimensions are shown by d and r characterize the conditional threshold 2 6 feature selection via gini index gini index gi can be utilized as a feature assortment technique from the original feature space and subsequent selection of subcomponents with the best features the gi for a set t consisting of data subsamples ti ti i 1 2 3 s can be given by zhu et al 2014 18 gi t 1 i 1 s p i 2 where sample probability is depicted by pi and s represents the sample subsets the maximum suitable facts are achieved when the same group exists for all data and the gi t reduces to zero the uniform distribution in all samples of the group for specific types results in the highest value of gi t and the lowest possible information is got zhu et al 2014 in this way gi is employed as an effective tool for feature selection in the present study 2 7 deep learning modelling in this study an lstm based seq2seq is employed for streamflow forecasting the architecture consists of an lstm network used as an encoder and another lstm served as a decoder as illustrated in fig 6 the encoder receives the input sequence comprised of the hydro meteorological data and encodes it into a vector of fixed length the decoder utilizes this vector of fixed length for decoding and output the predicted sequence of streamflow 2 8 evaluation metrics streamflow modeling success is expressed usually in metrics like rmse mae ns and d apaydin et al 2020 beyaz and gerdan 2021 han et al 2021 sattari et al 2013 sibtain et al 2020b therefore this study employed evaluation metrics including rmse mae ns and d these evaluation metrics are explained below 19 rmse 1 n t 1 n m e t si t 20 mae 1 n t 1 n m e t s i t 21 ns 1 t 1 n m e t si t 2 t 1 n m e t s i t 2 22 d 1 t 1 n si t m e t 2 t 1 n si t m e t m e t m e t 2 in equations 19 22 m e t si t m e t and s i t represent the measured simulated measured mean and simulated mean respectively 3 results 3 1 decomposition analysis fig 7 a 9 a depict the decomposition results of the streamflow time series into subcomponents for kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations by the iceemdan technique it is evident that thirteen modes imf1 imf12 res fourteen modes imf1 imf13 res and fourteen modes imf1 imf13 res are generated by the decomposition of streamflow time series of kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations respectively through iceemdan since the decomposition process in iceemdan occurs self adaptively without necessitating any pre established basis functions hence the modes are generated directly and automatically from the streamflow time series the imf1 component is the highest frequency component with the lowest wavelength amongst all the decomposed components for each time series conversely the highest wavelength with the lowest frequency is revealed by the residual component res in other words a sequence of decreasing frequency trends with an increase in wavelength is illustrated by the decomposed components fig 7 b 9 b displays the decomposition results of the streamflow time series into subcomponents for kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations by the dwt technique the dwt decomposition produces five subcomponents d1 d2 d3 d4 a4 for each of individual streamflow time series of kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations by considering haar mother wavelet function since number of time series data l 14245 for each of kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations therefore the value of n 4 is considered in this study as mentioned in equation 9 contrary to the self adaptive iceemdan technique the number of optimum level of decomposition need to pre determined similar to the iceemdan decomposed components the components obtained through dwt show a sequential pattern of decreasing frequency with an increase in wavelength this means that the d1 component has the highest frequency while the a4 component has the highest wavelength and vice versa 3 2 modes reconstruction based on sample entropy a large number of modes are produced during the decomposition process of iceemdan as portrayed in figs 7 9 these plenties of modes can result in the complexity of mlms if fed directly into the forecasting model a feasible way to reduce the number of modes is the combination of modes based on their se values therefore the se values are calculated as shown in fig 10 for the modes generated in the decomposition process compared to a large number of automatically generated subcomponents through the iceemdan technique the dwt decomposition produces only five subcomponents for each of the individual time series of streamflow therefore the modes reconstruction based on the se values is not performed for the dwt based models in fig 10 blue dots yellow dots and green dots are displaying the se values of the streamflow time series decomposed components for kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations respectively table 4 enumerates the reconstructed modes obtained based on se value by combining iceemdan produced modes consequently the se has effectively reduced the streamflow modal components for kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations into six modes imf1 imf5 res seven modes imf1 imf6 res and seven modes imf1 imf6 res respectively 3 3 gini index for feature selection table 5 a presents the selected features based on gi selection criteria for the reconstructed modes of iceemdan and the hydro meteorological variables for the kirkgoze station fifteen features satisfied the gi selection criteria out of the total seventeen available features similarly from the eighteen features for each of the individual kosk and karagobek stations eleven and nine features are selected respectively table 5 b enumerates the selected features based on gi selection criteria for the dwt produced modes and the hydro meteorological variables similar to the features selected for kirkgoze as mentioned in table 5 a fifteen features are obtained for this station based on dwt technique for kosk station sixteen features satisfied the gi criteria whereas gi criteria reduced the significant features count to nine that are again similar selected features count in table 5 a table 6 lists the modeling scenarios comprising scenario i seq2seq scenario ii iceemdan se seq2seq scenario iii iceemdan se gi seq2seq scenario iv dwt seq2seq and scenario v iceemdan gi seq2seq with corresponding datasets of ds i ds ii ds iii ds iv and ds v respectively for the three stations considered the inputs utilization for all stations in scenario i are eleven whereas scenario ii inputs based on the decomposition analysis are seventeen for the kirkgoze station and eighteen for both kosk and karagobek stations moreover scenario iii is built with fifteen inputs for kirkgoze seventeen inputs for kosk and nine inputs for karagobek based on the implementation of decomposition analysis and gi features selection furthermore 16 inputs constitute ds iv for all stations finally ds v is developed by utilizing 15 inputs for kirkgoze 16 inputs for kosk and 9 inputs for karagobek the details of the activation functions and learning rates are also mentioned in table 6 table 7 enumerates the partitioning of data for the development of forecasting models since the present study is performed based on the seven days lag for the streamflow data therefore out of the total data of 14245 days from october 1978 to september 2017 the division of the remaining 14238 days of data is considered moreover the data is segregated for training validation and testing periods in the ratio of 70 15 15 that corresponds to the absolute values of 9990 2124 and 2124 respectively 3 4 comparative analysis of forecasting outcomes table 8 summarizes the best results of modeling for kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations considering ds i ds ii ds iii ds iv and ds v scenarios different activation functions and learning rates in general the best results are achieved by a learning rate of 1x10 3 and tanh activation function for all the developed models for kirkgoze ds ii involving iceemdan technique results are better with cctt 0 9742 nstt 0 9480 compared to ds iv involving dwt decomposition with cctt 0 9738 nstt 0 9421 during testing ds iii further improved the results of ds ii signifying the importance of feature selection methods for the kirkgoze station the isgs model with 15 inputs outperforms the other models by displaying cc ns and d values of 0 9744 0 9487 0 9867 respectively moreover the isgs model also showed the lowest rmse and mae values of 1 2005 and 0 7538 respectively during the testing period in contrast to the standalone seq2seq model however the model utilizing ds v scenario show a further enhancement of the results with cctt 0 9793 nstt 0 9564 dtt 0 9893 the ds iv and ds v scenarios for kosk station with cctt 0 9493 nstt 0 9010 dtt 0 9731 are relatively better than ds ii which has cctt nstt and dtt values of 0 9419 0 8583 0 9579 respectively furthermore the ds i scenario showed the best results for kosk compared to all the comparison scenarios highlighting that the hybrid models involving time series decomposition and feature selection is not feasible for kosk station the standalone model surpassed the hybrid models for the kosk station by presenting a comparatively higher performance with lower values of error the values include 0 9608 0 9091 0 9777 0 2272 which corresponds to the cc ns d rmse measures during the testing period however the standalone model depicted a 1 7324 value of mae that was higher than the hybrid models for karagobek ds ii involving iceemdan with cctt 0 9455 nstt 0 9020 dtt 0 9610 reveals better results than ds iv utilizing dwt decomposition having cctt 0 9423 nstt 0 9015 dtt 0 9533 overall the ds ii scenario acted as the best performing model compared to all the counterpart scenarios furthermore the ds iii and ds v scenario show better results than ds i scenario the inferior results for of ds iii and ds v scenarios than ds ii and ds iv show that the feature selection was not feasible for karagobek station and acted to reduce the outcomes of decomposition techniques the results imply that iceemdan based ds ii is relatively better than dwt based ds iv scenario for kirkgoze and karagobek stations whereas dwt performs better only in ds iv for kosk compared to the ds ii scenario as a result decomposition improved results in 2 out of 3 stations feature selection on the other hand increased the success with less data only in kirkgoze station moreover feature selection has not improved the result in kosk in karagobek ds ii is slightly 1 better than ds iv kirkgoze ds v with dwt leading is slightly 1 better than ds iii at kosk station ds i is ahead of the others with 1 5 furthermore all the models have yielded correlation coefficient cc ns and d values greater than 0 8 during most of simulations considered which support the feasibility of these models for streamflow forecasting overall either the ds ii and ds iii scenarios utilizing iceeemdan se and iceemdan se gi hybridization with seq2seq surpassed the counterpart models or their results are nearly equal to the best performing model therefore the forecasting outcomes substantiate the feasibility of the iceemdan se gi and seq2seq model integration for streamflow forecasting fig 11 portrays time series plots to illustrate the comparison of models performance during validation and testing periods the daily streamflow was estimated using the daily input data but monthly average streamflow values were calculated and graphed to make the figure smaller for the kirkgoze station the ds v and ds iii based on the isgs model outperformed the ds ii ds iv and ds i scenarios in capturing the measured value of streamflow similarly ds ii also revealed better outcomes in contrast to the ds iv and ds i for the kirkgoze station for the kosk station the orange color line representing the ds i scenario resembles the blue color measured streamflow series line comparatively more than the dark blue green gray and gold color lines for ds iv ds v ds ii and ds iii scenarios respectively lastly the gray color curve in karagobek for scenario ds ii is in close agreement with the blue color line plot of the measured streamflow data in contrast to the comparison models curves the overall superior results of the hybrid models than the standalone model in predicting the measured data authenticate the feasibility of the integration of decomposition and feature selection methodology for streamflow forecasting fig 12 presents the constructed models comparison in predicting the measured streamflow through scatter plots in validation and testing phases overall the models established considering ds ii ds iii ds iv and ds v scenarios exhibit the most condensed scatter points around the 1 1 line then ds i based scenarios on the contrary except for the kosk station the ds i scenario portrayed much expanded scatter points around the line of regression similarly the higher r2 values for the models based on the ds ii ds iii ds iv and ds v scenarios vindicate the applicability of the signal decomposition technique and feature selection methodologies the streamflow time series is decomposed into subcomponents with reduced nonlinearities that are easy to predict by the forecasting models furthermore the modes reconstruction based on the se and the feature selection based on the gi reduces the forecasting model inputs thereby decrease the complexity with the resultant enhancement in the performance fig 12 d can be elaborated as an example to support our decomposition and feature selection based hybrid models in which the r2 shown by ds iii and ds v models is 0 949 and 0 959 respectively the ds ii and ds iv hybrid models built by the decomposition techniques also reveals better results by yielding r2 values of 0 949 and 0 948 respectively compared to scenario i with r2 value of 0 861 therefore the r2 value presented by the ds i is smaller compared to its counterparts during the testing period likewise the validation period also shows the higher r2 values of 0 952 0 957 0 951 and 0 971 for ds ii ds iii ds iv and ds v scenarios respectively in contrast to the 0 854 r2 value indicated by the scenario ds i considering fig 12 a as further verification of the isgs model superiority over the counterparts taylor diagrams are drawn fig 13 for kirkgoze station the ds iii and ds v models express lower error by showing lower values of standard deviation with a higher degree of agreement in predicting the measured streamflow by displaying higher correlation values the taylor plot for karagobek also reveals outperformed results for the proposed isgs model compared to its standalone counterpart however the kosk station shows a higher performance for ds i based model compared to all the other models since the ds i considers the standalone lstm encoder decoder model the higher performance for kosk shows the viability of the lstm seq2seq for streamflow however the standalone model poorly behaves for the kirkgoze and karagobek stations whereas the hybrid models disclosed good outcomes therefore the fact support that the lstm seq2seq model can be applied for forecasting tasks but its hybrid combination with decomposition and decomposition feature selection approach is appropriate to ameliorate its performance in most circumstances in summary table 8 and figs 11 13 attests to the applicability of the developed models based on iceemdan dwt se gi and lstm based seq2seq for the streamflow forecasting tasks in other words all the developed models including the standalone seq2seq model ds i the iceemdan se seq2seq model ds ii iceemdan se gi seq2seq model ds iii the dwt seq2seq model ds iv and the dwt gi seq2seq model ds v based on multivariate hydro meteorological data can be successfully employed for streamflow forecasting moreover none of the developed models outperformed their counterparts in all scenarios however considering the self adaptive decomposition process efficient signal decomposition merger of different techniques and forecasting outcomes near to the best performing model isgs is proposed as the most feasible model that can also offer different prospects of signal handling in addition to the forecasting task by utilizing isgs the streamflow time series is effectively decomposed by iceemdan to reduce their nonstationary and non linear dynamics it is evident from fig 7 b 9 b that the subcomponents generated by the self adaptive iceemdan technique can be easily distinguished into high frequency intermediate frequency and low frequency components in other words the original signal is decomposed meticulously into random periodic and trend parts the se is employed to determine the complexity of the modal components produced by iceemdan and combine them based on their se values in this way a large number of iceemdan generated modes have been added together to reduce the inputs for the iceemdan se seq2seq and iceemdan se gi seq2seq models therefore the iceemdan technique and se boosted the performance of the standalone seq2seq model additionally gi is utilized to select the most appropriate features with the aim to further decrease the model input count and complexity for the iceemdan se gi seq2seq model which further improved its forecasting results than the other developed models furthermore the hybrid models enhance the performance of standalone models which is evident from the superior results and lower error values of hybrid models in contrast to the standalone seq2seq model ds i in most of the scenarios this fact also endorses the feasibility of these models over the standalone counterpart the existence of lesser error values upholds the decomposition se and gi merger for streamflow forecasting despite the viable outcomes produced by the proposed model this study presents some limitations first it involves many steps including decomposition entropy calculation feature selection and forecasting which add to the complexity of the forecasting model second streamflow forecasting is an intricate process due to the influence of many parameters which restricts the forecasting accuracy of the forecasting models lastly the consideration of monthly hydro meteorological data on a daily weekly and annual basis can be applied in future studies to make the comparison more meaningful consequently our upcoming study will explore alternatives by considering the limitations for this study for a more accurate streamflow forecasting task 4 conclusion artificial intelligence methods and algorithms are frequently used in modeling processes but the success rate may decrease in natural events such as streamflow that depends on many factors researchers may choose approaches such as multivariate modeling instead of univariate and decomposition to improve the performance of ai models in addition to different data pre processing techniques alternative architectures such as encoder decoder can be tried in the last few decades nearly limitless alternatives have emerged in ai studies since the standalone streamflow forecasting models have limitations in forecasting the intricate streamflow therefore hybrid models have been developed to enhance the performance of forecasting models some of these alternatives may be complex time consuming require more labor and cost with our proposed hybrid approach it is aimed to increase the success of ai by using different data processing and selection methods of the available data and architectures therefore the present work developed several models based on multivariable hydrological data and different scenarios for streamflow forecasting the proposed hybrid model isgs integrating iceemdan se gi and seq2seq network is a useable model than the hybrid iceemdan se seq2seq dwt gi seq2seq dwt seq2seq and standalone seq2seq models the forecasted results of the iceemdan se gi seq2seq model corroborated the integration of the hybrid combination and the involved approaches for streamflow forecasting iceemdan is a feasible measure for the decomposition of the complex time series of streamflow into subcomponents to manage effectively the trends and noises the modes reconstruction by se and the feature selection by gi are efficaciously employed to reduce the computational burden of the seq2seq network furthermore the outstanding streamflow forecasting results are obtained by the lstm based seq2seq network the superior outcomes of the constructed models especially the proposed iceemdan se gi seq2seq models also establish the implementation of this study to explore other forecasting tasks involving the time series the possible options include predicting solar energy wind energy electrical load environment monitoring and

4088,accurate and reliable streamflow forecasting is indispensable to deal with the dynamics of streamflow parameters and for optimal use of water resources flood and drought control in this study a hybrid forecasting model integrating improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with additive noise iceemdan sample entropy se gini index gi sequence to sequence seq2seq for streamflow

afterward gi is used to select the most appropriate features to decrease the computational burden and ameliorate the model s performance finally seq2seq architecture based on the long short term memory lstm algorithm is utilized for predicting the multivariate hydro meteorological data at three stations located in turkey besides isgs the iceemdan se seq2seq dwt gi seq2seq dwt seq2seq and standalone seq2seq models are also constructed as counterpart comparison models the simulation under different scenarios several statistical metrics and judicious plots substantiate isgs validity for streamflow forecasting the correlation coefficient nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency and willmott s index values presented by the isgs model are 0 974 0 949 and 0 987 for kirkgoze station 0 928 0 839 and 0 947 kosk station 0 888 0 769 and 0 931 for karagobek station the performance revealed by the proposed isgs model proves its viability for streamflow forecasting along with equal applicability for the other time series forecasting tasks keywords streamflow time series iceemdan seq2seq encode decode lstm deep learning rnn hybrid model 1 introduction reliable and accurate streamflow forecasting is vital for effective and optimal use of hydrological resources and provision of ancillary services by the hydrological assets apaydin et al 2020 however the stochastic and non stationary characteristics of the streamflow pose a challenge for its accurate forecasting meng et al 2019 therefore many studies in recent years focused on accurate streamflow forecasting ni et al 2020b there are three types of streamflow forecasting models physical statistical and hybrid the physical models consider the physical process of the hydrological cycle peng et al 2017 statistical models rely on the past time series prospective associations chen et al 2020 and are also called data driven models ddms or empirical models hybrid models are partly physical and partly statistical the machine learning models mlms comprising artificial neural network ann sattari et al 2012a taormina and chau 2015 wen et al 2019 yamac 2021 and support vector regression svr liang et al 2018 wang et al 2013 are extensively applied to study the nonlinear dynamics of the hydrological time series recently deep learning models dlms have been proposed as a superior form of mlms to handle nonlinear data because of their ability to learn sequential dependence liu et al 2020 the long short term memory lstm variant of recurrent neural network rnn is the most common dlm that is implemented successfully for streamflow forecasting applications apaydin et al 2020 hu et al 2018 le et al 2018 ni et al 2020a sattari et al 2012b lstm can be further developed into an encoder decoder architecture created from the sequence to sequence seq2seq network to improve the performance of dlms the lstm based seq2seq models however have been rarely applied for streamflow forecasting studies han et al 2021 lstm based seq2seq models have revealed better outcomes compared to the lstm model for streamflow and rainfall streamflow forecasting tasks kao et al 2021 kao et al 2020 yin et al 2021 the inputs series are encoded by the encoder to apprehend the association of factors influencing locally the local and global associations are modeled jointly by the decoder to extricate encoded vectors for predicting the streamflow data consequently the time series successive symmetries are learned in an inclusive and better way than the single network configurations bian et al 2020 despite the enhanced performance of ddms these models are sometimes unable to predict seamlessly the intricate streamflow data when applied as standalone models hybrid models were proposed to deal with the hydrological data more efficiently and enhance forecasting accuracy hybrid ddms can be constructed by integrating artificial intelligence ai based machine learning approaches with decomposition techniques xiang et al 2018 the decomposition of time series data into subcomponents can be employed to enhance the performance of the forecasting models tan et al 2018 wavelet transform wt is an improved version of fourier transform ft that can efficiently preserve the signal while minimizing noise plenty of wavelet based machine learning models have been developed for streamflow forecasting sahay and sehgal 2013 sehgal et al 2014a sehgal et al 2014b tiwari and chatterjee 2011 however the selection of parameters including threshold function wavelet basis and decomposition scale limits the self adaptive nature of wt pasti et al 1999 consequently the wavelet based models can be time consuming and computationally intensive owing to their lengthy parameter selection criteria the type of data considered generally decides the selection of the mother wavelet roushangar and alizadeh 2018 furthermore the choice of a near optimal global wavelet comprises a trial and error process through iteration without involving any definite rule prasad et al 2017 therefore the accurate and careful execution of wt is crucial to enhance the performance of hybrid models utilizing wt sachindra et al 2019 the decomposition of streamflow time series was carried out by applying empirical mode decomposition emd the results revealed that emd successfully decomposed the time series data into subcomponents emd has the ability to decompose a signal self adaptively into the intrinsic mode functions imfs and a residual component without necessitating any a priori constraints emd utilizes temporal space directly in contrast to wt that requires a conforming frequency space furthermore the local scale separation principle is considered by emd without needing any preset basis functions or mother wavelet huang et al 1998 lee and ouarda 2010 hence emd is an adaptive intuitive direct and empirical signal technique compared to wt zhu et al 2016 in other words the decomposition process is totally data driven in emd roushangar and alizadeh 2018 emd does not assume the stationarity of signal or its components as the imfs can change over time this fact implies better aptness of emd for nonlinear signals than ft or wt moreover wt exhibit suboptimal behavior in determining sudden changes in frequency from a wavelet convolution since it considers frequency stationarity and frequency smoothing through the period of wavelet on the contrary emd possesses superior characteristics in estimating the instantaneous changes in frequency roushangar and alizadeh 2018 ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd was proposed to alleviate the mode mixing and the orthogonality effect by adding white noise wu and huang 2009 zhao and chen 2015 applied eemd to decompose the non stationary streamflow data and convert it into stationary data for forecasting purposes eemd was deployed to enhance the streamflow time series forecasting accuracy for efficient management of the hydrological stations ma and li 2016 eemd was compared with discrete wavelet transform dwt and results revealed superior outcomes by eemd over the dwt based models for streamflow forecasting tayyab et al 2018 and denoising of signals gaci 2016 eemd resolved some mode mixing issues of emd however it was unable to eradicate the mode mixing issue of emd which led to the development of complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with additive noise ceemdan ceemdan can result in close to zero restoration error each step of ceemdan obtains the white noise addition along with the lesser time for integration torres et al 2011 the ceemdan technique has a proven track for its feasibility in different streamflow forecasting applications rezaie balf et al 2019 sibtain et al 2020a however ceemdan still suffers from the downsides of modal residual noise delay in signal information compared to eemd and the occurrence of doubtful modes improved ceemdan iceemdan is the latest of emd based versions and resolves the concerns about by its precursors colominas et al 2014 similar to the emd eemd and ceemdan techniques iceemdan also directly utilizes temporal space without involving mother wavelets whereas wt techniques exploit frequency space and mother wavelets should be pre decided considering the advantages and strengths of iceemdan over wt and emd based decomposition techniques several studies have recently applied iceemdan for time series forecasting including streamflow forecasting sibtain et al 2021a sibtain et al 2020b load forecasting li et al 2020b wind speed forecasting wang et al 2018 and solar irradiance forecasting sibtain et al 2021b the above literature review highlights the superiority of the seq2seq network and iceemdan technique over other similar models moreover entropy is widely used to determine the chaotic process in a system in terms of system state as a revision of approximate entropy sample entropy se is employed to gauge the intricacy of time series signals richman and moorman 2000 hence different time series are efficaciously examined using se bhavsar et al 2018 furthermore the gini index gi feature selection technique is widely employed in signal processing to determine the sparsity of signals rickard and fallon 2004 zonoobi et al 2011 gi is also an applicable measure for extracting suitable features janssens et al 2015 maragoudakis et al 2008 therefore a hybrid model iceemdan se gi seq2seq isgs is developed in this study to predict the daily streamflow data the proposed model is applied observed tested at the kirkgoze kosk and karagobek hydrological stations in turkey by considering multivariate hydro meteorological data as an input furthermore the forecasting results of the isgs model are compared by elaborating counterpart models considering different scenarios and applying statistical performance measures the main aims of this study are i exploring the potentials of the iceemdan pre processing technique se gi feature selection method and lstm based seq2seq network for time series forecasting ii integrating iceemdan dwt se gi and seq2seq to construct the hybrid and standalone models for streamflow forecasting and iii corroborating the performance of the developed models with different performance measures this paper is organized as follows section 1 introduces the background of the problem forecasting

important part of which is constituted by the firat aras and coruh rivers the groundwater potential is 250 106 m3 year erzurum is one of turkey s highest and coldest regions dominated by the hard continental climate with a short and dry summer with long cold winters the region is covered with snow for about 70 days of the year average temperature in the erzurum region varies between 5 6 and 6

averages of streamflow from 1978 to 2017 whereas fig 3 displays the monthly averages of temperature and precipitation anonymous 2020 sezen 1987 although there is diversity in agricultural production the majority is in meadows pastures and cereals among the agricultural products potato and sugar beet is increasingly common irrigated agriculture is carried out on an area of 136 670 000 m2 in

the distribution subplots of dmq temperature and relative humidity variables are left skewed with the streamflow data however the correlation subplot of the precipitation variable with the streamflow variable shows a right skewed distribution 2 2 models development fig 5 summarizes the architectures of the developed models and the hydro meteorological data utilized as inputs in the development of models the main steps highlighting the orderly development of all the models are presented below step 1 a multivariate data consisting both the hydrological and meteorological variables are considered

constitute the meteorological data step 2 the decomposition of the streamflow data into different subcomponents is performed through iceemdan for iceemdan based hybrid models and dwt for dwt based hybrid models step 3 se is employed to calculate the entropy values of the subcomponents produced in step 1 and the modes are reconstructed based on their se values since dwt based hybrid models generate five decomposed subseries therefore subseries reconstruction to reduce models complexity is not performed for dwt based hybrid models step 4 as a feature selection method the gi is utilized to select suitable features from the iceemdan generated reconstructed subcomponents of step 3 for iceemdan based hybrid models the decomposed subseries of step 2 through dwt for dwt based hybrid models and the hydro meteorological data of step 1 step 5 the features obtained through step 4 are used further as an input for the seq2seq models resulting in the establishment of hybrid iceemdan se gi seq2seq and dwt gi seq2seq models based on scenario ds iii step 6 three other models comprising the iceemdan se seq2seq model the dwt seq2seq model and the individual seq2seq model based on scenarios ds ii and ds i respectively are also established for comparison purposes the iceemdan se seq2seq model considers step 1 and step 3 data as an input the dwt seq2seq model is based on step 1 and step 2 whereas the seq2seq model is built by taking data of step 1 as an input step 7 in addition to the counterpart models the conclusion is drawn based on the results of the statistical metrics including the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency ns willmott s index d correlation coefficient and several comparison plots 2 3 iceemdan iceemdan is the recent type of emd built decompositions methods that rectify the frequency aliasing and erroneous modes shortcoming as encountered by its antecedent techniques the white noise addition comprehends the steadiness of frequency amid adjacent scales through a subsequent decline of the consequent mixing in frequency the iceemdan technique core phases colominas et al 2014 are as follows i define the realizations by using the emd technique of local means as stated under 1 s g s β 0 e 1 w g where the added numeral for noise is g s is included to represent the signal as original sg specifies the signal that is used for decomposition the white noise is represented by wg and the white noise first constituent is depicted by e 1 w g ii next the determination of first residue r1 is expressed as 2 r 1 m s g where m indicates the mean of local to complete the imf sifting point iii the first mode is determined subsequent to the disintegration of n signals at the first phase as 3 im

6 r k m r k 1 β k 1 e k w g 7 im f k r k 1 r k vi the successive k phases are obtained after repeating 4 2 4 discrete wavelet transform dwt is the most widely used type of wavelet transform methods for forecasting hydrological data due to the discrete nature of hydro meteorological data li et al 2020a the general form of dwt can be represented as follows abd rahim et al 2020 8 dwt d k 1 x t 0 n 1 s t m k y x where d is the index of decomposition the paretmeter of scaling and translation are x and y respectively x x o d y t x o d n represents samples number s t signifies the original time series signal mother wavelet is denoted by m dwt separates the frequency bands present in the signal by employing a high pass and a low pass filter the detail coefficients are obtained through the high pass filter whereas the approximation coefficients are generated through low pass filter wang et al 2020 the original signal is s t undergoes decomposition into a detail component d1 and an approximation compement a1 the a1 component is additionally decomposed into second detail component d2 and approximation componet a2 sachindra et al 2019 the expression for a three level dwt decomposition can be given as 9 s t d 1 a 1 d 1 d 2 a 2 d1 d2 d3 a3 the mother wavelets comprising haar daubechies and symlet are the normally utilized mother wavelets wang et al 2020 furthermore the exploitation of haar mother wavelet is easy and straightforward tang et al 2018 the optimum level of time series decomposition for dwt can be given by the following expression nourani et al 2009 10 l i n t l o g n where level decomposition is denoted by l while n signifies the numeral of data series under consideration nourani et al 2009 2 5 sample entropy sample entropy se is employed in the present study to determine the complexity of the iceemdan produced modal time series components and the subsequent reconstruction of subcomponents based on their se values the succeeding steps explain the se method li et al 2020c i the n points time series indicating the measured values is specified by 11 t 1 t 2 t 3 t n ii the reconstruction into d dimension for the aforementioned expression is 12 u 1 u 2 u 3 u n d 1 where 13 s d i t i t i 1 t i 2 t i d 1 iii the span amid s i i and s d j d s d i s d j is 14 d u d i u d j max k 0 d 1 u i k u j k iv the equation expressed below is employed to obtain the mean value of vectors as 15 b d r 1 n d 1 i 1 n d 1 b i d r v bd 1 r is found by iterating ii iv through the dimension d augmentation by 1 to represent the se process as 16 s e d r lim n ln b d 1 r b d r vi the value of n is usually limited thus equation 17 obtain the form 17 s e d r n lim n ln b d 1 r b d r where dimensions are shown by d and r characterize the conditional threshold 2 6 feature selection via gini index gini index gi can be utilized as a feature assortment technique from the original feature space and subsequent selection of subcomponents with the best features the gi for a set t consisting of data subsamples ti ti i 1 2 3 s can be given by zhu et al 2014 18 gi t 1 i 1 s p i 2 where sample probability is depicted by pi and s represents the sample subsets the maximum suitable facts are achieved when the same group exists for all data and the gi t reduces to zero the uniform distribution in all samples of the group for specific types results in the highest value of gi t and the lowest possible information is got zhu et al 2014 in this way gi is employed as an effective tool for feature selection in the present study 2 7 deep learning modelling in this study an lstm based seq2seq is employed for streamflow forecasting the architecture consists of an lstm network used as an encoder and another lstm served as a decoder as illustrated in fig 6 the encoder receives the input sequence comprised of the hydro meteorological data and encodes it into a vector of fixed length the decoder utilizes this vector of fixed length for decoding and output the predicted sequence of streamflow 2 8 evaluation metrics streamflow modeling success is expressed usually in metrics like rmse mae ns and d apaydin et al 2020 beyaz and gerdan 2021 han et al 2021 sattari et al 2013 sibtain et al 2020b therefore this study employed evaluation metrics including rmse mae ns and d these evaluation metrics are explained below 19 rmse 1 n t 1 n m e t si t 20 mae 1 n t 1 n m e t s i t 21 ns 1 t 1 n m e t si t 2 t 1 n m e t s i t 2 22 d 1 t 1 n si t m e t 2 t 1 n si t m e t m e t m e t 2 in equations 19 22 m e t si t m e t and s i t represent the measured simulated measured mean and simulated mean respectively 3 results 3 1 decomposition analysis fig 7 a 9 a depict the decomposition results of the streamflow time series into subcomponents for kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations by the iceemdan technique it is evident that thirteen modes imf1 imf12 res fourteen modes imf1 imf13 res and fourteen modes imf1 imf13 res are generated by the decomposition of streamflow time series of kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations respectively through iceemdan since the decomposition process in iceemdan occurs self adaptively without necessitating any pre established basis functions hence the modes are generated directly and automatically from the streamflow time series the imf1 component is the highest frequency component with the lowest wavelength amongst all the decomposed components for each time series conversely the highest wavelength with the lowest frequency is revealed by the residual component res in other words a sequence of decreasing frequency trends with an increase in wavelength is illustrated by the decomposed components fig 7 b 9 b displays the decomposition results of the streamflow time series into subcomponents for kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations by the dwt technique the dwt decomposition produces five subcomponents d1 d2 d3 d4 a4 for each of individual streamflow time series of kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations by considering haar mother wavelet function since number of time series data l 14245 for each of kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations therefore the value of n 4 is considered in this study as mentioned in equation 9 contrary to the self adaptive iceemdan technique the number of optimum level of decomposition need to pre determined similar to the iceemdan decomposed components the components obtained through dwt show a sequential pattern of decreasing frequency with an increase in wavelength this means that the d1 component has the highest frequency while the a4 component has the highest wavelength and vice versa 3 2 modes reconstruction based on sample entropy a large number of modes are produced during the decomposition process of iceemdan as portrayed in figs 7 9 these plenties of modes can result in the complexity of mlms if fed directly into the forecasting model a feasible way to reduce the number of modes is the combination of modes based on their se values therefore the se values are calculated as shown in fig 10 for the modes generated in the decomposition process compared to a large number of automatically generated subcomponents through the iceemdan technique the dwt decomposition produces only five subcomponents for each of the individual time series of streamflow therefore the modes reconstruction based on the se values is not performed for the dwt based models in fig 10 blue dots yellow dots and green dots are displaying the se values of the streamflow time series decomposed components for kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations respectively table 4 enumerates the reconstructed modes obtained based on se value by combining iceemdan produced modes consequently the se has effectively reduced the streamflow modal components for kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations into six modes imf1 imf5 res seven modes imf1 imf6 res and seven modes imf1 imf6 res respectively 3 3 gini index for feature selection table 5 a presents the selected features based on gi selection criteria for the reconstructed modes of iceemdan and the hydro meteorological variables for the kirkgoze station fifteen features satisfied the gi selection criteria out of the total seventeen available features similarly from the eighteen features for each of the individual kosk and karagobek stations eleven and nine features are selected respectively table 5 b enumerates the selected features based on gi selection criteria for the dwt produced modes and the hydro meteorological variables similar to the features selected for kirkgoze as mentioned in table 5 a fifteen features are obtained for this station based on dwt technique for kosk station sixteen features satisfied the gi criteria whereas gi criteria reduced the significant features count to nine that are again similar selected features count in table 5 a table 6 lists the modeling scenarios comprising scenario i seq2seq scenario ii iceemdan se seq2seq scenario iii iceemdan se gi seq2seq scenario iv dwt seq2seq and scenario v iceemdan gi seq2seq with corresponding datasets of ds i ds ii ds iii ds iv and ds v respectively for the three stations considered the inputs utilization for all stations in scenario i are eleven whereas scenario ii inputs based on the decomposition analysis are seventeen for the kirkgoze station and eighteen for both kosk and karagobek stations moreover scenario iii is built with fifteen inputs for kirkgoze seventeen inputs for kosk and nine inputs for karagobek based on the implementation of decomposition analysis and gi features selection furthermore 16 inputs constitute ds iv for all stations finally ds v is developed by utilizing 15 inputs for kirkgoze 16 inputs for kosk and 9 inputs for karagobek the details of the activation functions and learning rates are also mentioned in table 6 table 7 enumerates the partitioning of data for the development of forecasting models since the present study is performed based on the seven days lag for the streamflow data therefore out of the total data of 14245 days from october 1978 to september 2017 the division of the remaining 14238 days of data is considered moreover the data is segregated for training validation and testing periods in the ratio of 70 15 15 that corresponds to the absolute values of 9990 2124 and 2124 respectively 3 4 comparative analysis of forecasting outcomes table 8 summarizes the best results of modeling for kirkgoze kosk and karagobek stations considering ds i ds ii ds iii ds iv and ds v scenarios different activation functions and learning rates in general the best results are achieved by a learning rate of 1x10 3 and tanh activation function for all the developed models for kirkgoze ds ii involving iceemdan technique results are better with cctt 0 9742 nstt 0 9480 compared to ds iv involving dwt decomposition with cctt 0 9738 nstt 0 9421 during testing ds iii further improved the results of ds ii signifying the importance of feature selection methods for the kirkgoze station the isgs model with 15 inputs outperforms the other models by displaying cc ns and d values of 0 9744 0 9487 0 9867 respectively moreover the isgs model also showed the lowest rmse and mae values of 1 2005 and 0 7538 respectively during the testing period in contrast to the standalone seq2seq model however the model utilizing ds v scenario show a further enhancement of the results with cctt 0 9793 nstt 0 9564 dtt 0 9893 the ds iv and ds v scenarios for kosk station with cctt 0 9493 nstt 0 9010 dtt 0 9731 are relatively better than ds ii which has cctt nstt and dtt values of 0 9419 0 8583 0 9579 respectively furthermore the ds i scenario showed the best results for kosk compared to all the comparison scenarios highlighting that the hybrid models involving time series decomposition and feature selection is not feasible for kosk station the standalone model surpassed the hybrid models for the kosk station by presenting a comparatively higher performance with lower values of error the values include 0 9608 0 9091 0 9777 0 2272 which corresponds to the cc ns d rmse measures during the testing period however the standalone model depicted a 1 7324 value of mae that was higher than the hybrid models for karagobek ds ii involving iceemdan with cctt 0 9455 nstt 0 9020 dtt 0 9610 reveals better results than ds iv utilizing dwt decomposition having cctt 0 9423 nstt 0 9015 dtt 0 9533 overall the ds ii scenario acted as the best performing model compared to all the counterpart scenarios furthermore the ds iii and ds v scenario show better results than ds i scenario the inferior results for of ds iii and ds v scenarios than ds ii and ds iv show that the feature selection was not feasible for karagobek station and acted to reduce the outcomes of decomposition techniques the results imply that iceemdan based ds ii is relatively better than dwt based ds iv scenario for kirkgoze and karagobek stations whereas dwt performs better only in ds iv for kosk compared to the ds ii scenario as a result decomposition improved results in 2 out of 3 stations feature selection on the other hand increased the success with less data only in kirkgoze station moreover feature selection has not improved the result in kosk in karagobek ds ii is slightly 1 better than ds iv kirkgoze ds v with dwt leading is slightly 1 better than ds iii at kosk station ds i is ahead of the others with 1 5 furthermore all the models have yielded correlation coefficient cc ns and d values greater than 0 8 during most of simulations considered which support the feasibility of these models for streamflow forecasting overall either the ds ii and ds iii scenarios utilizing iceeemdan se and iceemdan se gi hybridization with seq2seq surpassed the counterpart models or their results are nearly equal to the best performing model therefore the forecasting outcomes substantiate the feasibility of the iceemdan se gi and seq2seq model integration for streamflow forecasting fig 11 portrays time series plots to illustrate the comparison of models performance during validation and testing periods the daily streamflow was estimated using the daily input data but monthly average streamflow values were calculated and graphed to make the figure smaller for the kirkgoze station the ds v and ds iii based on the isgs model outperformed the ds ii ds iv and ds i scenarios in capturing the measured value of streamflow similarly ds ii also revealed better outcomes in contrast to the ds iv and ds i for the kirkgoze station for the kosk station the orange color line representing the ds i scenario resembles the blue color measured streamflow series line comparatively more than the dark blue green gray and gold color lines for ds iv ds v ds ii and ds iii scenarios respectively lastly the gray color curve in karagobek for scenario ds ii is in close agreement with the blue color line plot of the measured streamflow data in contrast to the comparison models curves the overall superior results of the hybrid models than the standalone model in predicting the measured data authenticate the feasibility of the integration of decomposition and feature selection methodology for streamflow forecasting fig 12 presents the constructed models comparison in predicting the measured streamflow through scatter plots in validation and testing phases overall the models established considering ds ii ds iii ds iv and ds v scenarios exhibit the most condensed scatter points around the 1 1 line then ds i based scenarios on the contrary except for the kosk station the ds i scenario portrayed much expanded scatter points around the line of regression similarly the higher r2 values for the models based on the ds ii ds iii ds iv and ds v scenarios vindicate the applicability of the signal decomposition technique and feature selection methodologies the streamflow time series is decomposed into subcomponents with reduced nonlinearities that are easy to predict by the forecasting models furthermore the modes reconstruction based on the se and the feature selection based on the gi reduces the forecasting model inputs thereby decrease the complexity with the resultant enhancement in the performance fig 12 d can be elaborated as an example to support our decomposition and feature selection based hybrid models in which the r2 shown by ds iii and ds v models is 0 949 and 0 959 respectively the ds ii and ds iv hybrid models built by the decomposition techniques also reveals better results by yielding r2 values of 0 949 and 0 948 respectively compared to scenario i with r2 value of 0 861 therefore the r2 value presented by the ds i is smaller compared to its counterparts during the testing period likewise the validation period also shows the higher r2 values of 0 952 0 957 0 951 and 0 971 for ds ii ds iii ds iv and ds v scenarios respectively in contrast to the 0 854 r2 value indicated by the scenario ds i considering fig 12 a as further verification of the isgs model superiority over the counterparts taylor diagrams are drawn fig 13 for kirkgoze station the ds iii and ds v models express lower error by showing lower values of standard deviation with a higher degree of agreement in predicting the measured streamflow by displaying higher correlation values the taylor plot for karagobek also reveals outperformed results for the proposed isgs model compared to its standalone counterpart however the kosk station shows a higher performance for ds i based model compared to all the other models since the ds i considers the standalone lstm encoder decoder model the higher performance for kosk shows the viability of the lstm seq2seq for streamflow however the standalone model poorly behaves for the kirkgoze and karagobek stations whereas the hybrid models disclosed good outcomes therefore the fact support that the lstm seq2seq model can be applied for forecasting tasks but its hybrid combination with decomposition and decomposition feature selection approach is appropriate to ameliorate its performance in most circumstances in summary table 8 and figs 11 13 attests to the applicability of the developed models based on iceemdan dwt se gi and lstm based seq2seq for the streamflow forecasting tasks in other words all the developed models including the standalone seq2seq model ds i the iceemdan se seq2seq model ds ii iceemdan se gi seq2seq model ds iii the dwt seq2seq model ds iv and the dwt gi seq2seq model ds v based on multivariate hydro meteorological data can be successfully employed for streamflow forecasting moreover none of the developed models outperformed their counterparts in all scenarios however considering the self adaptive decomposition process efficient signal decomposition merger of different techniques and forecasting outcomes near to the best performing model isgs is proposed as the most feasible model that can also offer different prospects of signal handling in addition to the forecasting task by utilizing isgs the streamflow time series is effectively decomposed by iceemdan to reduce their nonstationary and non linear dynamics it is evident from fig 7 b 9 b that the subcomponents generated by the self adaptive iceemdan technique can be easily distinguished into high frequency intermediate frequency and low frequency components in other words the original signal is decomposed meticulously into random periodic and trend parts the se is employed to determine the complexity of the modal components produced by iceemdan and combine them based on their se values in this way a large number of iceemdan generated modes have been added together to reduce the inputs for the iceemdan se seq2seq and iceemdan se gi seq2seq models therefore the iceemdan technique and se boosted the performance of the standalone seq2seq model additionally gi is utilized to select the most appropriate features with the aim to further decrease the model input count and complexity for the iceemdan se gi seq2seq model which further improved its forecasting results than the other developed models furthermore the hybrid models enhance the performance of standalone models which is evident from the superior results and lower error values of hybrid models in contrast to the standalone seq2seq model ds i in most of the scenarios this fact also endorses the feasibility of these models over the standalone counterpart the existence of lesser error values upholds the decomposition se and gi merger for streamflow forecasting despite the viable outcomes produced by the proposed model this study presents some limitations first it involves many steps including decomposition entropy calculation feature selection and forecasting which add to the complexity of the forecasting model second streamflow forecasting is an intricate process due to the influence of many parameters which restricts the forecasting accuracy of the forecasting models lastly the consideration of monthly hydro meteorological data on a daily weekly and annual basis can be applied in future studies to make the comparison more meaningful consequently our upcoming study will explore alternatives by considering the limitations for this study for a more accurate streamflow forecasting task 4 conclusion artificial intelligence methods and algorithms are frequently used in modeling processes but the success rate may decrease in natural events such as streamflow that depends on many factors researchers may choose approaches such as multivariate modeling instead of univariate and decomposition to improve the performance of ai models in addition to different data pre processing techniques alternative architectures such as encoder decoder can be tried in the last few decades nearly limitless alternatives have emerged in ai studies since the standalone streamflow forecasting models have limitations in forecasting the intricate streamflow therefore hybrid models have been developed to enhance the performance of forecasting models some of these alternatives may be complex time consuming require more labor and cost with our proposed hybrid approach it is aimed to increase the success of ai by using different data processing and selection methods of the available data and architectures therefore the present work developed several models based on multivariable hydrological data and different scenarios for streamflow forecasting the proposed hybrid model isgs integrating iceemdan se gi and seq2seq network is a useable model than the hybrid iceemdan se seq2seq dwt gi seq2seq dwt seq2seq and standalone seq2seq models the forecasted results of the iceemdan se gi seq2seq model corroborated the integration of the hybrid combination and the involved approaches for streamflow forecasting iceemdan is a feasible measure for the decomposition of the complex time series of streamflow into subcomponents to manage effectively the trends and noises the modes reconstruction by se and the feature selection by gi are efficaciously employed to reduce the computational burden of the seq2seq network furthermore the outstanding streamflow forecasting results are obtained by the lstm based seq2seq network the superior outcomes of the constructed models especially the proposed iceemdan se gi seq2seq models also establish the implementation of this study to explore other forecasting tasks involving the time series the possible options include predicting solar energy wind energy electrical load environment monitoring and

4089,texas experienced an extreme drought on record in 2011 model simulations or satellite observations have been used to assess and analyze the drought in this study a method based on multi source remote sensing data assimilation is proposed to evaluate the drought in texas which combines the advantages of model simulations and satellite observations brightness temperature from the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr e amsr2 and terrestrial water storage anomalies from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace are assimilated into the noah multiparameterization model noah mp to improve the soil moisture and drought estimation the ensemble kalman filter enkf was used as a data assimilation method with observation aggregation dealing with the multi resolution observations and observation bias correction dealing with the systematic bias between observations and simulations data from ground stations and satellites are used for the validation of soil moisture terrestrial water storage anomalies and evapotranspiration with assimilation slight improvement can be found for surface soil moisture over the open loop configuration but some notable degradations are also observed more obvious improvement can be found at deep layers which is mainly due to the assimilation of terrestrial water storage anomalies in addition the improvement for terrestrial water storage anomalies and evapotranspiration is more statistically significant in most regions of texas overall the assimilation experiment plays a positive role in the estimation of essential variables relate to drought the drought is estimated using the soil moisture percentile and classified into five categories the results from the assimilation experiment tend to predict a more severe drought in texas for both magnitude and spatial patterns which indicates not only the well known drought in 2011 but also the continuous severe drought in 2012 and 2013 moreover the spatial distribution of drought reveals that drought occurred more frequently in the north west and southwest keywords drought soil moisture data assimilation passive microwave grace noah mp 1 introduction texas experienced extreme drought in 2011 with below normal rainfall and a 2 f higher summer s average temperature in the record nielsen gammon 2012 according to the data from u s drought monitor usdm the most intense period of drought occurred the week of october 4 2011 where d4 exceptional drought affected 87 99 of texas land and 75 06 of texas population in fact the dry conditions were becoming increasingly clear by the end of october 2010 while the fall and winter were relatively dry in the majority of texas moreover most of the state has been under drought conditions for over three years the statewide drought in 2011 caused an estimated 7 62 billion in crop and livestock losses fannin 2012 the serious impact from the drought also included numerous wildfires stressed electrical power supplies and shortage of water storage in reservoirs combs 2012 as an extreme meteorological event drought is possibly the most slowly developing the longest lasting and the least predictable one mishra and singh 2010 the water deficit condition has serious impacts on the environment communities and the economy therefore monitoring and assessing drought are of great significance for water resources management usdm produces a weekly assessment of the magnitude and spatial extent of drought across the united states which associates six key objective drought indicators svoboda et al 2002 soil moisture plays an important role in the characterization of agricultural drought because available soil moisture especially that in the root zone determines plant water supply and affects crop growth and agricultural production panu and sharma 2002 sepulcre canto et al 2012 the drought indicator related to soil moisture from usdm is computed based on the climate prediction center s cpc s soil moisture percentiles which are estimated by a one layer hydrological model however the accuracy of model simulations is influenced by the uncertainties from forcing data model parameters and model parameterizations ground stations and satellites are effective ways to acquire the measurements of soil moisture but the data may be discontinuous in time or space particularly remote sensing has advantages in obtaining the measurements of a variety of land variables in the continental and global scale these satellite observations have been utilized to improve the performance of the model in several ways such as parameters calibration cao et al 2006 sutanudjaja et al 2014 parameterizations development hopp and mcdonnell 2009 mcmillan et al 2011 data assimilation is an alternative way to merge the observations into the model by using observations to modify the forecast trajectory of the dynamic model which is expected to combine the strengths of both model and observations with appropriately quantifying the uncertainty of the two and obtain an optimal estimate of states liu et al 2012 reichle 2008 assimilation of microwave remote sensing data for soil moisture estimation has made significant progress over the past years the widespread use of microwave is based on its high relationship with the dielectric properties of soil which are strongly influenced by the water quantity in soil low frequencies such as c band and l band are more suitable for soil moisture retrieving because of the high sensitivity to surface soil moisture since the successful launch of scanning multi frequency microwave radiometer smmr in 1978 assimilation of soil moisture retrievals from c band passive microwave has been demonstrated to improve the accuracy of model simulated soil moisture reichle et al 2007 draper et al 2012 crow and van den berg 2010 hain et al 2012 further l band passive microwave is applied for soil moisture monitoring and data assimilation lievens et al 2015 azimi et al 2020 ridler et al 2014 which is more sensitive to both soil moisture and vegetation water content calvet et al 2010 moreover assimilation of surface soil moisture retrievals has also been demonstrated to benefit the model simulated evapotranspiration and runoff chen et al 2014 lu et al 2020 some studies have focused on the direct assimilation of brightness temperature tb rather than soil moisture retrievals from passive microwave zhao et al 2016 de lannoy and reichle 2016a koster et al 2018 because the inversion process can be affected by the uncertainty of the auxiliary information de lannoy and reichle 2016b it is worth noting that the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals are challenging in some regions when validated with in situ measurements according to previous studies chen et al 2013 al bitar et al 2012 for drought monitoring xu et al 2020 demonstrated more reliable topsoil layer moisture 0 5 cm by assimilating soil moisture active passive smap soil moisture and developed a multivariate drought index the blended microwave soil moisture assimilation and multivariate assimilation such as soil moisture and evapotranspiration have also been shown to improve drought monitoring skills gavahi et al 2020 yan et al 2018 confined by the penetration depth microwave observations can only provide soil moisture information at the land surface top few centimeters this limits the feasibility of microwave data assimilation in the improvement of root zone soil moisture estimation as well as the agricultural drought assessment therefore satellite observations containing soil moisture profile information can be introduced into the data assimilation framework to further improve the performance of the model simulation the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace measures the variations of the terrestrial water storage tws which is the integration of the snow surface water canopy water soil moisture and groundwater long et al 2013 suggested the grace derived tws anomalies provide a reliable tool for monitoring statewide water storage changes in response to drought using the data from the 2011 drought in texas and the soil moisture changes contribute to 70 80 of tws depletion during the drought several studies have employed the grace derived tws anomalies for quantitative analysis of drought characteristics over different regions scanlon et al 2015 thomas et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 zaitchik et al 2008 conducted an assimilation experiment of monthly grace data in the mississippi river basin and concluded an improvement of the simulated groundwater and runoff after assimilation when comparing with the independent measurements the applications of grace data for soil moisture estimation have been carried out via single sensor or multi sensor assimilation experiments in several studies which demonstrated the benefit of grace data in deep storage components estimation tangdamrongsub et al 2020 zhao and yang 2018 girotto et al 2019 therefore we constructed a multi sensor data assimilation framework to estimate the agricultural drought in texas from 2010 to 2013 in this study remotely sensed brightness temperature and terrestrial water storage anomalies were assimilated into a land surface model noah mp which was expected to improve the model estimation of soil moisture as well as the drought condition independent measurements from ground stations and satellites were employed to evaluate the performance of the assimilation experiment the objective of this study is to examine 1 how does the assimilation of both brightness temperature and terrestrial water storage anomalies affect the noah mp simulation of surface soil moisture and root zone soil moisture 2 identification and analysis of the characteristics of the area coverage and duration of the drought in texas according to the soil moisture simulations from the assimilation experiment 3 to distinguish the influence of separate assimilation of brightness temperature and terrestrial water storage on soil moisture estimation section 2 contains a brief description of the data and models used in this study section 3 describes the data assimilation method and experimental design section 4 and 5

the comparison with smap data this product is provided in an equal area ease2 grid with a sampling resolution of 25 km for daily temporal scales specifically vertically polarized brightness temperatures at the nominal 42 5 incidence angle of smos were used in this study b c band brightness temperature the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos amsr e sensor was launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa on 4 may 2002 onboard the aqua satellite and ceased operation in october 2011 kawanishi et al 2003 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 is a successor to amsr e and onboard the first generation of the gcom w satellite which was launched on 18 may 2012 imaoka et al 2010 amsr e is a multi frequency instrument that can observe brightness temperature at six bands 6 925 ghz 10 65 ghz 18 7 ghz 23 8 ghz 36 5 ghz and 89 ghz with both horizontal and vertical polarizations a new dual polarization channel at 7 3 ghz is introduced to amsr2 to mitigate radio frequency interference rfi effects the amsr e and amsr2 scan the earth s surface with a constant earth incidence angle of 55 at approximately 1 30 a m local time descending orbit 1 30 p m local time ascending orbit the amsr e brightness temperature product distributed by national snow and ice data center nsdic and the amsr2 l3 brightness temperature product distributed by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa were employed as observations in this study both datasets are provided in one global cylindrical equidistant latitude longitude projection with a resolution of 0 25 and daily interval specifically vertically polarized brightness temperatures at 6 925 ghz of amsr e amsr2 were used in this study c terrestrial water storage the grace consisting of two identical satellites was launched on 17 march 2002 the grace mission is accurately mapping the variations in earth s gravity field by inter satellite range change measurements gps and a microwave ranging system grace observes the monthly changes in earth s gravity field caused by mass redistribution which is primarily controlled by the variations of surface and deep currents in the ocean the variations of surface and subsurface hydrologic reservoirs in the land exchanges between ice sheets or glaciers and the oceans tapley et al 2004 the grace l3 gridded data product monthly tws anomalies datasets which are expressed in centimeters of equivalent water thickness over land after removing the atmospheric contributions were released by three different processing centers however the coarse temporal resolution of these products limits scientific analysis of the sub seasonal variations in hydrological processes the daily grace tws anomalies data with a 0 5 global grid was adopted in this study this dataset is generated by sakumura et al 2016 through the regularized sliding window mascon rswm solution 2 2 land surface model noah mp is an augmented version of noah with multi physics options niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 it contains a separate vegetation canopy with a two stream radiation transfer scheme four layers of soil structure and up to three layers of snow model noah mp was developed to facilitate climate predictions with physically based ensembles it provides multiple options of parameterization schemes for several key physical processes including leaf dynamics radiation transfer stomatal resistance β factor aerodynamic resistance runoff etc noah mp is now integrated directly with wrf and can be used for hydrological prediction and land atmosphere coupling studies lin et al 2018 the offline noah mp version 4 0 1 was used in this study a near surface meteorological dataset from north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 xia et al 2009 was used to drive the model this dataset is provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa with 0 125 grid spacing and hourly temporal frequency the combination of the alternative parameterization schemes used in this study is described in table 1 more descriptions of the schemes in noah mp can refer to niu et al 2011 and yang et al 2011 two vegetation parameters need to be prescribed as input according to the selected dynamic vegetation scheme therefore leaf area index from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis distributed by nasa and vegetation fraction distributed by the copernicus global land service cgls verger et al 2014 were used as the input of noah mp the two datasets are aggregated from high spatial resolution to the model resolution by arithmetical average before used 2 3 radiative transfer model to simulate the brightness temperature a radiative transfer model rtm was coupled with noah mp the vertically and horizontally polarized brightness temperature at the top of the vegetation layer are computed using the zero order τ ω model which includes the contribution of soil and vegetation on microwave signal in the soil module of the τ ω model the reflectivity of a smooth surface was calculated using the fresnel reflection equations in combination with the dielectric mixing model proposed by dobson et al 1985 to compute the soil dielectric constant moreover a semiempirical q h model wang and choudhury 1981 was used in this study to account for soil roughness effects in the vegetation module of the τ ω model the computation of the vegetation attenuation on soil emission followed the optical depth model from wigneron et al 2007 given that the atmospheric and sky contribution should be considered at l band the brightness temperature at the top of the atmosphere was computed following the atmospheric emission model developed by pellarin et al 2003 the equations of the key parameterizations implemented in the τ ω model were described in table 2 a more comprehensive introduction for the radiative transfer model can be found in wigneron et al 2017 specifically the dynamic input for the radiative transfer model such as soil moisture and soil temperature was derived from the output of noah mp the auxiliary data including the leaf area index soil parameters and land cover used in the radiative transfer model was consistent with noah mp 3 data assimilation experiment 3 1 experiment design in this study the experiments focused on the period of the 2010 2013 texas drought firstly the noah mp land surface model was spun up using total of 30 years forcing data 1980 2009 to reach a state of statistical equilibrium secondly we re ran the model from 1980 to 2009 using the restart file output from the spin up phase where the model simulations are used for the calculation of soil moisture percentile climatology see section 3 3 then the model simulations generated using an ensemble of perturbed forcing data without assimilation were regarded as the reference open loop ol run the assimilation experiment shared the same initial conditions and forcing data as ol and was denoted as da the perturbed forcing data accounts for the uncertainties from forcing data which can be introduced into noah mp the multivariable random fields were chosen to perturb forcing data in this study which can involve the implied physical relationships between meteorological variables reichle et al 2007 kwon et al 2019 for the ensemble based open loop run and assimilation experiment thirty ensemble members were chosen in this study specifically the selected prognostic variable soil moisture is perturbed to account for errors in model structure and model parameters in the assimilation experiment no perturbation was explicitly applied to other prognostic variables but the perturbations for forcing data can contribute to the forecast errors of noah mp the perturbation settings for forcing data and state variables are summarized in table 3 brightness temperature observations impacted by radio frequency interference rfi should be eliminated before assimilated the difference between the 6 9 and 10 7 ghz channels was used to identify the magnitude of rfi of 6 9 ghz brightness temperature from amsr e amsr2 brightness temperature satisfying the criterion tb 6 9 tb 10 7 5 k was screened out because strong and moderate rfi can be easily detected by this threshold li et al 2004 de nijs et al 2015 rfi contamination has been considered during the generation of the catds smos l3 production according to al bitar et al 2017 so no more filtering should be done here since the study area is texas there is no need to take special considerations into the snow and frozen soil during the brightness temperature assimilation in addition all the brightness temperatures of the grids with the landcover labeling as urban wetland land ice land water bodies were excluded which means no assimilation experiment in these grids the observation errors are needed to be prescribed in the assimilation experiment to account for the uncertainties of satellite observations time invariant observations errors were set to 5 k for smos and 5 k for amsr e amsr2 which were the same magnitude as other studies de lannoy et al 2016b zhao et al 2016 the global error estimate for grace observations was provided by sakumura et al 2016 and adopted as observation errors in this study moreover the covariance matrix of the observations was assumed to be diagonal which implies that there is no correlation between different kinds of observations 3 2 methodology a ensemble kalman filter ensemble kalman filter enkf was used in this study to assimilated smos amsr e amsr2 and grace observations into noah mp to update soil moisture this approach was proposed by burgers et al 1998 and widely used for land data assimilation due to its high efficiency enkf uses an ensemble to represent the distribution of the state of the model system making it suitable for nonlinear problems the model system runs forward and incorporates new observations when available and the state is updated for each member of the ensemble the increments δ x t i in enkf when updating soil moisture were computed as the following equation 1 δ x t i k t y t i hx t i where k t is the kalman gain matrix y t i and hx t i are observations from satellite and the corresponding observations predictions from the model respectively the subscript t refers to the time and i refers to the ensemble member each grid in the model runs independently so the assimilation process enkf is also independent of each other the coarse scale observation pixel was used to update each fine scale model grid it contains therefore when each model grid is assimilated it is necessary to use observation aggregation see section 3 2 b to calculate the coarse scale observation prediction hx t i in this study the state vector was composed of the four layers of soil moisture from noah mp the main steps of assimilation are as follows 1 the forward model ran and observations availability were checked in hourly step 2 brightness temperature from smos and amsr e amsr2 were assimilated at the hour of transit time and the increments were applied to the soil moisture 3 terrestrial water storage anomalies from grace were assimilated at the end hour of the day and the increments were applied to the soil moisture b observation aggregation for the calculation of brightness temperature predictions the spatial resolution of satellite observations 0 25 is coarser than the model simulations 0 125 thus spatial aggregation should be considered when calculating hx t i corresponding to y t i 2 hx t i 1 n 1 s 1 n 1 tb t i s where n 1 is the number of the model grids within a satellite observed grid tb t i s is brightness temperature predictions derived from the rtm a simple arithmetic average is used which means that each model grid has the same weight for the calculation of terrestrial water storage predictions both the temporal and spatial resolution of satellite observation daily 0 5 is coarser than the model simulations hourly 0 125 moreover tws as a vertically integrated measure of water over land is not directly modeled in noah mp thus both temporal and spatial aggregation should be considered when calculating hx t i corresponding to y t i 3 hx t i 1 n 1 1 n 2 s 1 n 1 t 1 n 2 swe t i s cans t i s sms t i s gws t i s where n 2 is the number of the hours within a day t refers to a given hour in the day t swe is the snow water equivalent cans is the canopy water storage sms is the total soil water storage in all four soil layers gws is the groundwater storage c observation bias correction one assumption of enkf is the unbiased observations and forecasts nevertheless there are obvious systematic deviations between the satellite observations and model simulations which are caused by the spatial representative limitations of the model etc it is difficult to quantify and distinguish the observations bias and model simulations bias but a bias correction prior to data assimilation can be achieved by rescaling the observations to the model climatology kumar et al 2012 the following equation was used to correct the first order climatological mean differences between observations and forecasts and then the rescaled observations y t i rescaled were used in equation 1 4 y t i rescaled y t i y h x given the brightness temperature bias varies with seasons a 90 day moving average window was first used to separately compute the smooth time series of brightness temperature from satellite and model over the experiment period then multi years averages were calculated for each day of the year and represented the climatological mean of satellite observations y and model simulations h x moreover the climatological mean was calculated separately for ascending orbit and descending orbit as grace provides tws anomalies their bias correction was conducted together with converting grace tws anomalies to equivalent tws values i e the observations are equivalent to the model predictions in equation 3 first remove the average of grace tws anomalies over the experiment period y and then add the average of noah mp simulated tws from the open loop h x zhang 2015 zhao and yang 2018 specifically the prior bias correction for all kinds of observations was done for each grid cell separately 3 3 validation in situ soil moisture measurements from soil climate analysis network scan u s climate reference network uscrn and west texas mesonet wtm were used to evaluate the results in this study fig 1 all these data were collected from the website of the national soil moisture network for scan and uscrn soil moisture measures at depth of 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm 50 cm and 100 cm for wtm soil moisture measures at depth of 5 cm 20 cm 60 cm and 75 cm sites with 100 missing data in any of the measured layers were excluded sites with more than 50 missing data in total measured layers were excluded thus 52 sites are selected in this study the raw in situ soil moisture measurements were provided as daily values and then aggregated by arithmetically averaging at 0 125 to match the model resolution several skill metrics were used to assess the performance of the assimilation experiment and these skill metrics were described in the supplementary evapotranspiration is the sum of soil evaporation from the land surface plus transpiration from plants which reflects the water lost to the atmosphere and is highly related to the soil moisture thus the evapotranspiration dataset released by fluxcom was also used for validation in this study according to tramontana et al 2016 this dataset was produced by merging energy flux measurements from the fluxnet sites with remote sensing data from modis by machine learning methods the 8 daily evapotranspiration data were rescaled from 0 0833 to 0 125 model resolution with bilinear interpolation the drought condition was estimated by a percentile based drought index which is related to 0 100 cm soil moisture the volumetric water content of the first three layers of the model is multiplied by the soil thickness as the soil water storage and used to calculate the drought index the weekly drought intensity was calculated as follows 1 the percentile climatology was generated for each calendar day using the daily output from a total 30 year model simulation 1980 2009 a moving window of 5 days is employed to generate the percentile climatology which amounted up to 5 30 150 values for a particular calendar day across all year xia et al 2014 kumar et al 2014 2 the daily percentile value was computed by ranking each day s soil moisture against the percentile climatology of the corresponding day and then the weekly percentile value was computed based on the daily ones of the week by arithmetic mean 3 drought intensity can be classified into five categories according to usdm svoboda et al 2002 d0 abnormally dry 20 percentile 30 d1 moderate drought 10 percentile 20 d2 severe drought 5 percentile 10 d3 extreme drought 2 percentile 5 and d4 exceptional drought percentile 2 4 results 4 1 evaluation over grid cells fig 2 shows the 0 100 cm soil moisture from ol and da compared with in situ measurements at the grid cell of 98 w 98 125 w and 26 5 n 26 625 n smos soil moisture from catds and amsr e amsr2 soil moisture from nasa are also depicted in fig 2 a smos obviously underestimate the surface soil moisture while amsr2 retrieval shows an inconsistent deviation from the measurements at different times the two retrievals have comparable rmse values to ol and both are higher than 0 04 cm3cm 3 moreover both retrievals have poor correlation values with the measurements which are about 0 5 ol shows overestimation of soil moisture over the experiment period the slight improvement can be found at 0 10 cm after assimilation with the bias decreased from 0 056 cm3cm 3 to 0 053 cm3cm 3 and the rmse decreased from 0 065 cm3cm 3 to 0 059 cm3cm 3 soil moisture at deeper layers shows a more obvious correction of the overestimation and higher skill with assimilation da reduces the bias and rmse of soil moisture at 10 40 cm 40 100 cm from 0 076 cm3cm 3 and 0 078 cm3cm 3 0 056 cm3cm 3 and 0 058 cm3cm 3 to 0 038 cm3cm 3 and 0 043 cm3cm 3 0 025 cm3cm 3 and 0 036 cm3cm 3 respectively the simulation of soil moisture is mainly affected by precipitation in noah mp as seen in fig 2 a the precipitation can capture the peaks of both the measurements and ol curves which indicates the high quality precipitation used to drive the model it is likely due to the several enhancements for nldas 2 based on nldas 1 especially the daily gauge based precipitation analysis xia et al 2012 in addition the curves of both measurements and ol at deeper layers can reflect the high amount of precipitation which indicates the water flow in soil calculating by the model parameterization is close to the reality according to the r soil moisture derived from ol are highly related to the measurements at all three layers with values above 0 84 thus da leads to degradation in the correlation of soil moisture between model simulations and measurements in addition the soil moisture curves tend to be fluctuant after the step by step update in enkf which is contrary to the smooth measurement curves the tws anomalies derived from ol are consistent with the overestimation of soil moisture as shown by fig 3 the bias and rmse for ol 13 540 mm and 54 288 mm respectively greatly decrease with assimilation to 2 200 mm and 6 161 mm respectively da further introduces improvement in the r for tws anomalies increasing from 0 668 to 0 991 the da curve is extremely close to the grace curve which proves the feasibility of tws anomalies assimilation the correction of the tws anomalies overestimation is partly achieved by reducing the soil moisture especially the soil moisture at deeper layers see fig 2 the evapotranspiration from ol shows underestimation compared with that from fluxcom fig 4 and the skill metrics are 0 462 mm day for the bias 0 826 mm day for the rmse and 0 745 for the r the lower precipitation anomalies and higher air temperature anomalies contribute to the lower evapotranspiration simulations over most of the experiment period especially in 2011 and the latter half of 2012 fig s1 obviously it is because there is not enough water to be evaporated or for plants to transpire with assimilation the underestimation tends to be slightly aggravated by the decrease of soil moisture indicated by the bias of 0 502 mm day but improvements can be found in the rmse decreasing to 0 673 mm day and the r increasing to 0 823 although the above results prove that the assimilation experiment plays a positive role in the simulation of several variables degradation of assimilation can also be found at some grid cells fig 5 shows the comparison of soil moisture is the same as fig 2 but at the grid cell of 99 25 w 99 375 w and 33 625 n 33 75 n ol explicitly underestimates the soil moisture with the bias of 0 038 cm3cm 3 at 0 10 cm 0 052 cm3cm 3 at 10 40 cm and 0 105 cm3cm 3 at 40 100 cm but the r for soil moisture is relatively high above 0 70 at all layers the degradation of assimilation performance is confirmed by all three skill metrics 0 043 cm3cm 3 for the bias 0 062 cm3cm 3 for the rmse and 0 65 for the r at 0 10 cm and the underestimation of soil moisture tends to be more serious with assimilation especially at deeper layers smos shows an underestimation of soil moisture indicating by the bias of 0 071 cm3cm 3 while amsr has better accuracy in terms of bias although the two retrievals have comparable r values to da they have larger rmse values than da it should be noted that the decrease of soil moisture is accompanied by the overestimation of tws anomalies fig 6 the bias for tws anomalies is 6 947 mm and decreases to 1 902 mm with assimilation the assimilation also decreases the rmse from 32 952 mm to 5 086 mm and increases the r from 0 868 to 0 998 which verifies the effect of tws anomalies assimilation the correction of the overestimation of tws anomalies with assimilation results in the more severe underestimation of soil moisture the inconsistent trends the overestimation of tws anomalies and the underestimation of soil moisture lead to the degradation of da in the estimation of soil moisture however it is difficult to determine whether it is caused by the uncertainty in model or observation in addition it is worth noting that the spatial resolution of the satellite observations tb and tws anomalies is relatively coarser than that of model simulation thus an observation grid contains information of multiple adjacent model grids the complexity of the surface may affect the representativeness of the information contained in the observation to a single model grid ol overestimates evapotranspiration with the bias of 0 389 mm day and da yields very limited improvement with the bias decreasing to 0 384 mm day fig 7 but the improvements for evapotranspiration in the rmse and r are obvious varying from 0 810 mm day and 0 724 to 0 638 mm day and 0 795 respectively as mentioned above the limited evapotranspiration during the experiment period is due to the combined impact of the low precipitation anomalies and high air temperature anomalies fig s2 moreover the extremely high air temperature anomalies cause the increase of evapotranspiration from noah mp in the middle of 2012 under the deficient precipitation which is not detected by the data derived from fluxcom 4 2 evaluation over texas fig 8 shows the normalized error reduction ner of bias rmse and r for soil moisture with assimilation across the study area ol overestimates the surface soil moisture at 53 of all sites and the percentages for soil moisture at deep layers are 66 and 78 fig s3 with assimilation 59 of all sites show an improvement in surface soil moisture with the percentage of 53 and 72 for soil moisture at deep layers indicated by the ner bias in terms of ner rsme the surface soil moisture from da is improved at 29 of all sites with minor magnitude for both the improvement and degradation more obvious improvement can be found at deep layers with the positive value found at 55 and 68 of all sites as the results presented in section 4 1 the improvement of correlation between soil moisture and measurements across the study area is disappointing with degradation at most sites particularly for the surface soil moisture it is partly due to the high correlation between the soil moisture from ol and measurements where the domain average value of r for the three layers are 0 76 0 67 and 0 65 respectively fig s3 different from soil moisture tws anomalies are overestimated by ol in about 97 of texas with relatively high rmse r in the east north and low rmse r in the west south fig s4 fig 9 shows similar content to fig 8 but for tws anomalies tws anomalies are improved with assimilation in 89 of texas indicated by the ner bias it is worth noting that there is obvious degradation of assimilation for tws anomalies estimation in the area near dallas and fort worth according to the ner rmse and ner r the improvement for tws anomalies estimation in texas is particularly obvious without negative value with assimilation the ner rmse and ner r over texas range from 0 063 and 0 518 up to 0 933 and 0 997 respectively it should be pointed out that all the grids with positive values of ner bias meaning an improvement after assimilation for soil moisture at deep layers 10 100 cm show an overestimation of both soil moisture and tws anomalies by ol this same trend from model simulation enables assimilation to successfully improve the estimation of soil moisture at 10 100 cm which also confirms that the assimilation of tws anomalies has a great influence on the deep storage components estimation ol overestimates evapotranspiration in 40 of texas which is mainly located in the north west and central texas fig s5 meanwhile the rmse is relatively low in the north and west with r relatively high fig 10 shows similar content to fig 8 but for evapotranspiration improvement for evapotranspiration estimation is found in 43 of texas indicated by ner bais and most degradation occurs in the north and west of texas with landcover of grassland and open shrubland the domain averaged value of ner rmse for evapotranspiration is 0 261 with 97 of texas showing positive values similarly about 97 of texas shows improvement in evapotranspiration according to ner r and the domain averaged value of ner r is 0 404 given that evapotranspiration is implicitly related to soil moisture further studies are needed to understand how changes in soil moisture with assimilation affect evapotranspiration in particular the root depths of different vegetation types are different in noah mp which affects the ability of vegetation to absorb water from the soil as well as evapotranspiration wang et al 2018 overall the assimilation experiment for soil moisture plays a role in improving evapotranspiration in this study 4 3 drought estimation in texas the impact of the assimilation experiment on drought estimation is investigated in this section and the agricultural drought is characterized by the method in section 3 3 fig 11 shows the weekly time series of area percentages for the five drought categories in texas including data from usdm and results calculated by soil moisture from ol and da according to usdm texas experienced statewide drought from 2011 to 2013 most of the areas in 2011 were classified as d4 drought while from 2012 to 2013 five drought categories were almost evenly distributed it is worth noting that usdm provides very useful drought monitoring but data from usdm should not be used as true values in this study because they are based on multiple indicators considering the impact of drought in different aspects and some additional information compared with usdm ol indicated a more severe drought in 2010 but a less widespread drought from 2011 to 2013 from ol the largest areal coverage for the most severe drought category d4 occurs in the week of april 19 2011 with a value of 39 7 and the median coverage is about 6 2 the frequency of other drought categories is also very high and the percentage area for drought d0 d4 ranges from 0 7 to 91 0 happened in the week of december 12 2012 with a median value of 50 5 compared to ol da shows that the drought texas experiencing from 2010 to 2013 is more severe which likely attributes to the decrease of soil moisture after assimilation caused by the overestimation of tws anomalies most of the drought is classified as d4 based on da with a noticeable increase in the d4 drought category and a decrease in the d0 and d1 drought categories although da and usdm provide a similar estimate of drought areas from 2011 to 2013 da suggests more intense drought in addition more drought events are detected by da in 2010 compared with both ol and usdm the largest areal coverage for d4 occurs in the week of april 5 2011 with the value reaching 95 1 and the median coverage increases to 60 1 with assimilation moreover the percentage area for drought d0 d4 ranges from 28 9 to 99 4 happening in the week of march 19 2013 with a median value up to 95 4 fig 12 shows the comparison of the spatial distribution of drought intensities derived from ol da and usdm as seen from the drought map of the week of may 3 2011 ol shows the most intense drought d4 in the north and east and less intense drought d0 d3 in the south da increases the spatial extent and severity of drought which leads to the majority regions of texas experiencing the drought of d4 category except for the northeast usdm indicates a statewide drought which is similar as da but most areas exhibit d3 drought category while the drought pattern leans toward d4 category in da for the drought map in 2012 there are insignificant drought events occurring in the border area of texas indicated by ol while da shows the north west and southwest in the drought of d4 category and the coastal areas in less intense drought d0 d3 the drought detected by da and usdm is in good agreement in the spatial extent but da suggests more severe drought in the western and southwestern regions than usdm in the case of 2013 only the north is in drought most in d4 indicated by ol however da increases the spatial extent to almost all of texas with d4 category founding in the north west and southwest and d0 d3 categories founding in other regions usdm indicated the occurrence of drought in most areas with the drought coverage between ol and da and drought severity weaker than da similar to the conclusion from fig 11 da predicts more intense drought over texas than ol comparing the differences in the drought estimates from ol and da the more severe drought is found in the north west and southwest with assimilation as confirmed by fig s6 the time percentage of drought characterized as d4 is relatively low and spatially similar across texas based on ol and increased by da especially in the regions mentioned above moreover drought happens more frequently during 2010 2013 in the north as shown by the time percentage of drought characterized as d0 d4 based on ol fig s6 with assimilation this percentage is very high which indicates persistent drought existing in almost all over texas during 2010 2013 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties in the assimilation experiment it can be seen from the above results that the assimilation experiment failed to improve the soil moisture at all sites as well as degradation founding in other variables this is not surprising because the assimilation experiment is based on some assumptions and there are uncertainties in the model and observation the underestimation of soil moisture and overestimation of tws anomalies may be due to the uncertainties in the estimation of other water storage components in tws such as groundwater surface water storage and canopy water storage groundwater accounts for a large proportion of tws simulation wu et al 2021 which is not selected as a state variable updating with assimilation but influenced by the update of soil moisture since it is difficult to quantify the contribution of soil moisture and groundwater to the changes in tws separately we presume that groundwater is relatively stable in texas and only focus on the soil moisture variability this is also because the human intervention irrigation in texas has not caused a lot of groundwater depletion other than central valley high plains and mississippi embayment rateb et al 2020 in addition the changes of grace tws anomalies have been attributed to rivers lakes and reservoirs which are not considered in noah mp scanlon et al 2018 particularly most of these water storage features have been severely affected by the drought with water levels hitting the record low larry 2011 although the canopy water storage is negligible as a component of tws whether and how to parameterize the dynamic root depth and plant hydraulics in the model which is not considered in this study will have an important impact on the water absorption capacity of vegetation thus affecting soil moisture especially under dry conditions niu et al 2020 li et al 2021 in terms of the observations the complex surface will affect the representativeness of observation data for sub region since the spatial resolution of both tb and tws anomalies is coarser than that of the model 5 2 comparison of separate assimilation of tb and tws anomalies two additional experiments were conducted to assess the performance of the separate assimilation of tb and tws anomalies with the other experimental settings remaining the same the results for tb assimilation hereinafter as datb are displayed by figs s7 s9 and s11 while the results for tws anomalies assimilation hereinafter as datws are displayed by figs s8 s10 and s12 all the skill metrics from datb for soil moisture at 0 10 cm are similar to those from da in general datb shows better performance than datws indicated by the ner bias but these two assimilation experiments have their advantages and disadvantages at different sites according to the ner rmse and ner r the ner bias for soil moisture at 10 40 cm from datb is more similar to da and indicated more improvements than datws in contrast the ner rmse and ner r from datws show a slightly better performance than datb and is in better agreement with da datws has advantages over datb in the soil moisture estimation at 40 100 cm as indicated by all the skill metrics which shares similar trends to da it is worth noting that the accuracy for a specific variable from da can be worse than one of the separate assimilations in some grids but da combines the strengths of the two kinds of observations coupling the impact of tb on soil moisture at 0 40 cm and the impact of tws anomalies on soil moisture at 10 100 cm for the estimation of tws anomalies there is a considerable degradation in datb with slightly better performance in the east it is expected that great improvement can be found in datws because the observations used for assimilation are also used for evaluation in terms of the ner rmse and ner r da is a closer approximation of datws the ner bias from da is slightly worse than that from datws but much better than that from datb for the estimation of evapotranspiration da shows a better performance than separate assimilations the results from datb are similar to da but the ner bais and ner rmse indicate a worse performance than da in north and central texas datws shows evident improvements in the north and west but degradations in other regions by the ner bais and ner rmse the influence of tb assimilation tws anomalies assimilation on different soil depths mainly depends on the covariance matrix of tb tws anomalies simulations and soil moisture simulations which directly determines the kalman gain in equation 1 it can be seen from the fig s13 a c that the kalman gain of tb assimilation shows a significant decrease with the increase of soil depth the kalman gain of tws anomalies assimilation is comparable in different soil depths fig s13 d f this is not surprising because the penetration depth of microwave determines that the brightness temperature cannot reflect the information of deep soil but tws contains the information of the soil moisture profile for this reason the combined assimilation of the two observations to acquire more accurate soil moisture profile information can be feasible the estimation of evapotranspiration and tws anomalies are affected by changes in soil moisture because they are not used as the state variable in assimilation as mentioned above datb shows a similar performance to da in the estimation of evapotranspiration which indicates that evapotranspiration estimate by noah mp is greatly affected by the shallow soil datb affects the shallow soil this is consistent to the expression of root water uptake of vegetation in the model it is not surprising that datws shows a greater impact improvement in the estimation of tws anomalies the degradation of tws anomalies estimated by datb indicate that the brightness temperature cannot reflect the information of the deep water component 6 conclusions the purposes of this study are to examine the impact of the assimilation of remote sensed brightness temperature and terrestrial water storage anomalies on soil moisture estimation and explore the situation of agricultural drought based on data assimilation over texas during 2010 2013 soil moisture from three ground networks tws anomalies from grace and evapotranspiration from fluxcom are used to evaluate the results from assimilation experiments moreover the temporal spatial characteristics of the agricultural drought are assessed and analyzed using the drought indicator related to root zone soil moisture percentile improvement for soil moisture with assimilation can be found at most of the sites by decreasing the bias and rmse especially for soil moisture at deeper layers but the degradation in r is evident and partly due to the already high correlation between ol and measurements tws anomalies are greatly improved by da over the study area and only minor degradation in the north and central texas is indicated by the bias similarly da shows obvious improvements for evapotranspiration in terms of rmse and r but some degradation in the north and west is indicated by the bias compared with ol da tends to predict more severe droughts in texas for both the well known drought in 2011 and the continuing severe drought in 2012 and 2013 in terms of spatial distribution drought occurred more frequently in the north west and southwest according to da in addition the estimation of total drought area by da is consistent with usdm but da identifies more exceptional drought d4 than usdm there are still some uncertainties in the model and satellite observations that cause the degradation of the performance of data assimilation in some regions however data assimilation is proved to effectively improve the accuracy of the model simulations in this study when validated with in situ measurements and satellite datasets in addition when compared to the separate assimilation of tb and tws anomalies the multi sensor data assimilation successfully combined the strengths of different kinds of observations in particular the improvement of simulation accuracy of root zone soil moisture with assimilation in this study is of great significance to the accurate estimation of agricultural drought to enhance the assimilation performance future studies could focus more on the representation of human intervention in the water cycle groundwater and vegetation water in land surface model as well as the synergy of different observations in multi source data assimilation credit authorship contribution statement weijing chen conceptualization methodology

4089,texas experienced an extreme drought on record in 2011 model simulations or satellite observations have been used to assess and analyze the drought in this study a method based on multi source remote sensing data assimilation is proposed to evaluate the drought in texas which combines the advantages of model simulations and satellite observations brightness temperature from the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr e amsr2 and terrestrial water storage anomalies from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace are assimilated into the noah multiparameterization model noah mp to improve the soil moisture and drought estimation the ensemble kalman filter enkf was used as a data assimilation method with observation aggregation dealing with the multi resolution observations and observation bias correction dealing with the systematic bias between observations and simulations data from ground stations and satellites are used for the validation of soil moisture terrestrial water storage anomalies and evapotranspiration with assimilation slight improvement can be found for surface soil moisture over the open loop configuration but some notable degradations are also observed more obvious improvement can be found at deep layers which is mainly due to the assimilation of terrestrial water storage anomalies in addition the improvement for terrestrial water storage anomalies and evapotranspiration is more statistically significant in most regions of texas overall the assimilation experiment plays a positive role in the estimation of essential variables relate to drought the drought is estimated using the soil moisture percentile and classified into five categories the results from the assimilation experiment tend to predict a more severe drought in texas for both magnitude and spatial patterns which indicates not only the well known drought in 2011 but also the continuous severe drought in 2012 and 2013 moreover the spatial distribution of drought reveals that drought occurred more frequently in the north west and southwest keywords drought soil moisture data assimilation passive microwave grace noah mp 1 introduction texas experienced extreme drought in 2011 with below normal rainfall and a 2 f higher summer s average temperature in the record nielsen gammon 2012 according to the data from u s drought monitor usdm the most intense period of drought occurred the week of october 4 2011 where d4 exceptional drought affected 87 99 of texas land and 75 06 of texas population in fact the dry conditions were becoming increasingly clear by the end of october 2010 while the fall and winter were relatively dry in the majority of texas moreover most of the state has been under drought conditions for over three years the statewide drought in 2011 caused an estimated 7 62 billion in crop and livestock losses fannin 2012 the serious impact from the drought also included numerous wildfires stressed electrical power supplies and shortage of water storage in reservoirs combs 2012 as an extreme meteorological event drought is possibly the most slowly developing the longest lasting and the least predictable one mishra and singh 2010 the water deficit condition has serious impacts on the environment communities and the economy therefore monitoring and assessing drought are of great significance for water resources management usdm produces a weekly assessment of the magnitude and spatial extent of drought across the united states which associates six key objective drought indicators svoboda et al 2002 soil moisture plays an important role in the characterization of agricultural drought because available soil moisture especially that in the root zone determines plant water supply and affects crop growth and agricultural production panu and sharma 2002 sepulcre canto et al 2012 the drought indicator related to soil moisture from usdm is computed based on the climate prediction center s cpc s soil moisture percentiles which are estimated by a one layer hydrological model however the accuracy of model simulations is influenced by the uncertainties from forcing data model parameters and model parameterizations ground stations and satellites are effective ways to acquire the measurements of soil moisture but the data may be discontinuous in time or space particularly remote sensing has advantages in obtaining the measurements of a variety of land variables in the continental and global scale these satellite observations have been utilized to improve the performance of the model in several ways such as parameters calibration cao et al 2006 sutanudjaja et al 2014 parameterizations development hopp and mcdonnell 2009 mcmillan et al 2011 data assimilation is an alternative way to merge the observations into the model by using observations to modify the forecast trajectory of the dynamic model which is expected to combine the strengths of both model and observations with appropriately quantifying the uncertainty of the two and obtain an optimal estimate of states liu et al 2012 reichle 2008 assimilation of microwave remote sensing data for soil moisture estimation has made significant progress over the past years the widespread use of microwave is based on its high relationship with the dielectric properties of soil which are strongly influenced by the water quantity in soil low frequencies such as c band and l band are more suitable for soil moisture retrieving because of the high sensitivity to surface soil moisture since the successful launch of scanning multi frequency microwave radiometer smmr in 1978 assimilation of soil moisture retrievals from c band passive microwave has been demonstrated to improve the accuracy of model simulated soil moisture reichle et al 2007 draper et al 2012 crow and van den berg 2010 hain et al 2012 further l band passive microwave is applied for soil moisture monitoring and data assimilation lievens et al 2015 azimi et al 2020 ridler et al 2014 which is more sensitive to both soil moisture and vegetation water content calvet et al 2010 moreover assimilation of surface soil moisture retrievals has also been demonstrated to benefit the model simulated evapotranspiration and runoff chen et al 2014 lu et al 2020 some studies have focused on the direct assimilation of brightness temperature tb rather than soil moisture retrievals from passive microwave zhao et al 2016 de lannoy and reichle 2016a koster et al 2018 because the inversion process can be affected by the uncertainty of the auxiliary information de lannoy and reichle 2016b it is worth noting that the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals are challenging in some regions when validated with in situ measurements according to previous studies chen et al 2013 al bitar et al 2012 for drought monitoring xu et al 2020 demonstrated more reliable topsoil layer moisture 0 5 cm by assimilating soil moisture active passive smap soil moisture and developed a multivariate drought index the blended microwave soil moisture assimilation and multivariate assimilation such as soil moisture and evapotranspiration have also been shown to improve drought monitoring skills gavahi et al 2020 yan et al 2018 confined by the penetration depth microwave observations can only provide soil moisture information at the land surface top few centimeters this limits the feasibility of microwave data assimilation in the improvement of root zone soil moisture estimation as well as the agricultural drought assessment therefore satellite observations containing soil moisture profile information can be introduced into the data assimilation framework to further improve the performance of the model simulation the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace measures the variations of the terrestrial water storage tws which is the integration of the snow surface water canopy water soil moisture and groundwater long et al 2013 suggested the grace derived tws anomalies provide a reliable tool for monitoring statewide water storage changes in response to drought using the data from the 2011 drought in texas and the soil moisture changes contribute to 70 80 of tws depletion during the drought several studies have employed the grace derived tws anomalies for quantitative analysis of drought characteristics over different regions scanlon et al 2015 thomas et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 zaitchik et al 2008 conducted an assimilation experiment of monthly grace data in the mississippi river basin and concluded an improvement of the simulated groundwater and runoff after assimilation when comparing with the independent measurements the applications of grace data for soil moisture estimation have been carried out via single sensor or multi sensor assimilation experiments in several studies which demonstrated the benefit of grace data in deep storage components estimation tangdamrongsub et al 2020 zhao and yang 2018 girotto et al 2019 therefore we constructed a multi sensor data assimilation framework to estimate the agricultural drought in texas from 2010 to 2013 in this study remotely sensed brightness temperature and terrestrial water storage anomalies were assimilated into a land surface model noah mp which was expected to improve the model estimation of soil moisture as well as the drought condition independent measurements from ground stations and satellites were employed to evaluate the performance of the assimilation experiment the objective of this study is to examine 1 how does the assimilation of both brightness temperature and terrestrial water storage anomalies affect the noah mp simulation of surface soil moisture and root zone soil moisture 2 identification and analysis of the characteristics of the area coverage and duration of the drought in texas according to the soil moisture simulations from the assimilation experiment 3 to distinguish the influence of separate assimilation of brightness temperature and terrestrial water storage on soil moisture estimation section 2 contains a brief description of the data and models used in this study section 3 describes the data assimilation method and experimental design section 4 and 5 provide the results and discussions of the experiment section 6 presents the summary and main conclusion of this study 2 data and models 2 1 data a l band brightness temperature the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos was successfully launched by the european space agency esa on 2 november 2009 with an l band passive microwave radiometer 1 4 ghz instrument onboard microwave imaging radiometer using aperture synthesis miras the key objectives of this mission are to provide global observations of soil moisture over land and sea surface salinity over oceans kerr et al 2010 the brightness temperatures obtained by miras are over a range of incidence angles from 0 to 55 with full polarization mode smos has a sun synchronous orbit crossing the equator at 6 am and 6 pm local solar time for ascending and descending orbit respectively the brightness temperature dataset used in this study is from the smos l3 product which is produced by the centre aval de traitements des données smos catds al bitar et al 2017 this product includes all brightness temperatures computed natively from l1 data and binned and averaged into fixed incidence angle classes including a 40 incidence angle to ease the comparison with smap data this product is provided in an equal area ease2 grid with a sampling resolution of 25 km for daily temporal scales specifically vertically polarized brightness temperatures at the nominal 42 5 incidence angle of smos were used in this study b c band brightness temperature the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos amsr e sensor was launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa on 4 may 2002 onboard the aqua satellite and ceased operation in october 2011 kawanishi et al 2003 the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 is a successor to amsr e and onboard the first generation of the gcom w satellite which was launched on 18 may 2012 imaoka et al 2010 amsr e is a multi frequency instrument that can observe brightness temperature at six bands 6 925 ghz 10 65 ghz 18 7 ghz 23 8 ghz 36 5 ghz and 89 ghz with both horizontal and vertical polarizations a new dual polarization channel at 7 3 ghz is introduced to amsr2 to mitigate radio frequency interference rfi effects the amsr e and amsr2 scan the earth s surface with a constant earth incidence angle of 55 at approximately 1 30 a m local time descending orbit 1 30 p m local time ascending orbit the amsr e brightness temperature product distributed by national snow and ice data center nsdic and the amsr2 l3 brightness temperature product distributed by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa were employed as observations in this study both datasets are provided in one global cylindrical equidistant latitude longitude projection with a resolution of 0 25 and daily interval specifically vertically polarized brightness temperatures at 6 925 ghz of amsr e amsr2 were used in this study c terrestrial water storage the grace consisting of two identical satellites was launched on 17 march 2002 the grace mission is accurately mapping the variations in earth s gravity field by inter satellite range change measurements gps and a microwave ranging system grace observes the monthly changes in earth s gravity field caused by mass redistribution which is primarily controlled by the variations of surface and deep currents in the ocean the variations of surface and subsurface hydrologic reservoirs in the land exchanges between ice sheets or glaciers and the oceans tapley et al 2004 the grace l3 gridded data product monthly tws anomalies datasets which are expressed in centimeters of equivalent water thickness over land after removing the atmospheric contributions were released by three different processing centers however the coarse temporal resolution of these products limits scientific analysis of the sub seasonal variations in hydrological processes the daily grace tws anomalies data with a 0 5 global grid was adopted in this study this dataset is generated by sakumura et al 2016 through the regularized sliding window mascon rswm solution 2 2 land surface model noah mp is an augmented version of noah with multi physics options niu et al 2011 yang et al 2011 it contains a separate vegetation canopy with a two stream radiation transfer scheme four layers of soil structure and up to three layers of snow model noah mp was developed to facilitate climate predictions with physically based ensembles it provides multiple options of parameterization schemes for several key physical processes including leaf dynamics radiation transfer stomatal resistance β factor aerodynamic resistance runoff etc noah mp is now integrated directly with wrf and can be used for hydrological prediction and land atmosphere coupling studies lin et al 2018 the offline noah mp version 4 0 1 was used in this study a near surface meteorological dataset from north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 xia et al 2009 was used to drive the model this dataset is provided by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa with 0 125 grid spacing and hourly temporal frequency the combination of the alternative parameterization schemes used in this study is described in table 1 more descriptions of the schemes in noah mp can refer to niu et al 2011 and yang et al 2011 two vegetation parameters need to be prescribed as input according to the selected dynamic vegetation scheme therefore leaf area index from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis distributed by nasa and vegetation fraction distributed by the copernicus global land service cgls verger et al 2014 were used as the input of noah mp the two datasets are aggregated from high spatial resolution to the model resolution by arithmetical average before used 2 3 radiative transfer model to simulate the brightness temperature a radiative transfer model rtm was coupled with noah mp the vertically and horizontally polarized brightness temperature at the top of the vegetation layer are computed using the zero order τ ω model which includes the contribution of soil and vegetation on microwave signal in the soil module of the τ ω model the reflectivity of a smooth surface was calculated using the fresnel reflection equations in combination with the dielectric mixing model proposed by dobson et al 1985 to compute the soil dielectric constant moreover a semiempirical q h model wang and choudhury 1981 was used in this study to account for soil roughness effects in the vegetation module of the τ ω model the computation of the vegetation attenuation on soil emission followed the optical depth model from wigneron et al 2007 given that the atmospheric and sky contribution should be considered at l band the brightness temperature at the top of the atmosphere was computed following the atmospheric emission model developed by pellarin et al 2003 the equations of the key parameterizations implemented in the τ ω model were described in table 2 a more comprehensive introduction for the radiative transfer model can be found in wigneron et al 2017 specifically the dynamic input for the radiative transfer model such as soil moisture and soil temperature was derived from the output of noah mp the auxiliary data including the leaf area index soil parameters and land cover used in the radiative transfer model was consistent with noah mp 3 data assimilation experiment 3 1 experiment design in this study the experiments focused on the period of the 2010 2013 texas drought firstly the noah mp land surface model was spun up using total of 30 years forcing data 1980 2009 to reach a state of statistical equilibrium secondly we re ran the model from 1980 to 2009 using the restart file output from the spin up phase where the model simulations are used for the calculation of soil moisture percentile climatology see section 3 3 then the model simulations generated using an ensemble of perturbed forcing data without assimilation were regarded as the reference open loop ol run the assimilation experiment shared the same initial conditions and forcing data as ol and was denoted as da the perturbed forcing data accounts for the uncertainties from forcing data which can be introduced into noah mp the multivariable random fields were chosen to perturb forcing data in this study which can involve the implied physical relationships between meteorological variables reichle et al 2007 kwon et al 2019 for the ensemble based open loop run and assimilation experiment thirty ensemble members were chosen in this study specifically the selected prognostic variable soil moisture is perturbed to account for errors in model structure and model parameters in the assimilation experiment no perturbation was explicitly applied to other prognostic variables but the perturbations for forcing data can contribute to the forecast errors of noah mp the perturbation settings for forcing data and state variables are summarized in table 3 brightness temperature observations impacted by radio frequency interference rfi should be eliminated before assimilated the difference between the 6 9 and 10 7 ghz channels was used to identify the magnitude of rfi of 6 9 ghz brightness temperature from amsr e amsr2 brightness temperature satisfying the criterion tb 6 9 tb 10 7 5 k was screened out because strong and moderate rfi can be easily detected by this threshold li et al 2004 de nijs et al 2015 rfi contamination has been considered during the generation of the catds smos l3 production according to al bitar et al 2017 so no more filtering should be done here since the study area is texas there is no need to take special considerations into the snow and frozen soil during the brightness temperature assimilation in addition all the brightness temperatures of the grids with the landcover labeling as urban wetland land ice land water bodies were excluded which means no assimilation experiment in these grids the observation errors are needed to be prescribed in the assimilation experiment to account for the uncertainties of satellite observations time invariant observations errors were set to 5 k for smos and 5 k for amsr e amsr2 which were the same magnitude as other studies de lannoy et al 2016b zhao et al 2016 the global error estimate for grace observations was provided by sakumura et al 2016 and adopted as observation errors in this study moreover the covariance matrix of the observations was assumed to be diagonal which implies that there is no correlation between different kinds of observations 3 2 methodology a ensemble kalman filter ensemble kalman filter enkf was used in this study to assimilated smos amsr e amsr2 and grace observations into noah mp to update soil moisture this approach was proposed by burgers et al 1998 and widely used for land data assimilation due to its high efficiency enkf uses an ensemble to represent the distribution of the state of the model system making it suitable for nonlinear problems the model system runs forward and incorporates new observations when available and the state is updated for each member of the ensemble the increments δ x t i in enkf when updating soil moisture were computed as the following equation 1 δ x t i k t y t i hx t i where k t is the kalman gain matrix y t i and hx t i are observations from satellite and the corresponding observations predictions from the model respectively the subscript t refers to the time and i refers to the ensemble member each grid in the model runs independently so the assimilation process enkf is also independent of each other the coarse scale observation pixel was used to update each fine scale model grid it contains therefore when each model grid is assimilated it is necessary to use observation aggregation see section 3 2 b to calculate the coarse scale observation prediction hx t i in this study the state vector was composed of the four layers of soil moisture from noah mp the main steps of assimilation are as follows 1 the forward model ran and observations availability were checked in hourly step 2 brightness temperature from smos and amsr e amsr2 were assimilated at the hour of transit time and the increments were applied to the soil moisture 3 terrestrial water storage anomalies from grace were assimilated at the end hour of the day and the increments were applied to the soil moisture b observation aggregation for the calculation of brightness temperature predictions the spatial resolution of satellite observations 0 25 is coarser than the model simulations 0 125 thus spatial aggregation should be considered when calculating hx t i corresponding to y t i 2 hx t i 1 n 1 s 1 n 1 tb t i s where n 1 is the number of the model grids within a satellite observed grid tb t i s is brightness temperature predictions derived from the rtm a simple arithmetic average is used which means that each model grid has the same weight for the calculation of terrestrial water storage predictions both the temporal and spatial resolution of satellite observation daily 0 5 is coarser than the model simulations hourly 0 125 moreover tws as a vertically integrated measure of water over land is not directly modeled in noah mp thus both temporal and spatial aggregation should be considered when calculating hx t i corresponding to y t i 3 hx t i 1 n 1 1 n 2 s 1 n 1 t 1 n 2 swe t i s cans t i s sms t i s gws t i s where n 2 is the number of the hours within a day t refers to a given hour in the day t swe is the snow water equivalent cans is the canopy water storage sms is the total soil water storage in all four soil layers gws is the groundwater storage c observation bias correction one assumption of enkf is the unbiased observations and forecasts nevertheless there are obvious systematic deviations between the satellite observations and model simulations which are caused by the spatial representative limitations of the model etc it is difficult to quantify and distinguish the observations bias and model simulations bias but a bias correction prior to data assimilation can be achieved by rescaling the observations to the model climatology kumar et al 2012 the following equation was used to correct the first order climatological mean differences between observations and forecasts and then the rescaled observations y t i rescaled were used in equation 1 4 y t i rescaled y t i y h x given the brightness temperature bias varies with seasons a 90 day moving average window was first used to separately compute the smooth time series of brightness temperature from satellite and model over the experiment period then multi years averages were calculated for each day of the year and represented the climatological mean of satellite observations y and model simulations h x moreover the climatological mean was calculated separately for ascending orbit and descending orbit as grace provides tws anomalies their bias correction was conducted together with converting grace tws anomalies to equivalent tws values i e the observations are equivalent to the model predictions in equation 3 first remove the average of grace tws anomalies over the experiment period y and then add the average of noah mp simulated tws from the open loop h x zhang 2015 zhao and yang 2018 specifically the prior bias correction for all kinds of observations was done for each grid cell separately 3 3 validation in situ soil moisture measurements from soil climate analysis network scan u s climate reference network uscrn and west texas mesonet wtm were used to evaluate the results in this study fig 1 all these data were collected from the website of the national soil moisture network for scan and uscrn soil moisture measures at depth of 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm 50 cm and 100 cm for wtm soil moisture measures at depth of 5 cm 20 cm 60 cm and 75 cm sites with 100 missing data in any of the measured layers were excluded sites with more than 50 missing data in total measured layers were excluded thus 52 sites are selected in this study the raw in situ soil moisture measurements were provided as daily values and then aggregated by arithmetically averaging at 0 125 to match the model resolution several skill metrics were used to assess the performance of the assimilation experiment and these skill metrics were described in the supplementary evapotranspiration is the sum of soil evaporation from the land surface plus transpiration from plants which reflects the water lost to the atmosphere and is highly related to the soil moisture thus the evapotranspiration dataset released by fluxcom was also used for validation in this study according to tramontana et al 2016 this dataset was produced by merging energy flux measurements from the fluxnet sites with remote sensing data from modis by machine learning methods the 8 daily evapotranspiration data were rescaled from 0 0833 to 0 125 model resolution with bilinear interpolation the drought condition was estimated by a percentile based drought index which is related to 0 100 cm soil moisture the volumetric water content of the first three layers of the model is multiplied by the soil thickness as the soil water storage and used to calculate the drought index the weekly drought intensity was calculated as follows 1 the percentile climatology was generated for each calendar day using the daily output from a total 30 year model simulation 1980 2009 a moving window of 5 days is employed to generate the percentile climatology which amounted up to 5 30 150 values for a particular calendar day across all year xia et al 2014 kumar et al 2014 2 the daily percentile value was computed by ranking each day s soil moisture against the percentile climatology of the corresponding day and then the weekly percentile value was computed based on the daily ones of the week by arithmetic mean 3 drought intensity can be classified into five categories according to usdm svoboda et al 2002 d0 abnormally dry 20 percentile 30 d1 moderate drought 10 percentile 20 d2 severe drought 5 percentile 10 d3 extreme drought 2 percentile 5 and d4 exceptional drought percentile 2 4 results 4 1 evaluation over grid cells fig 2 shows the 0 100 cm soil moisture from ol and da compared with in situ measurements at the grid cell of 98 w 98 125 w and 26 5 n 26 625 n smos soil moisture from catds and amsr e amsr2 soil moisture from nasa are also depicted in fig 2 a smos obviously underestimate the surface soil moisture while amsr2 retrieval shows an inconsistent deviation from the measurements at different times the two retrievals have comparable rmse values to ol and both are higher than 0 04 cm3cm 3 moreover both retrievals have poor correlation values with the measurements which are about 0 5 ol shows overestimation of soil moisture over the experiment period the slight improvement can be found at 0 10 cm after assimilation with the bias decreased from 0 056 cm3cm 3 to 0 053 cm3cm 3 and the rmse decreased from 0 065 cm3cm 3 to 0 059 cm3cm 3 soil moisture at deeper layers shows a more obvious correction of the overestimation and higher skill with assimilation da reduces the bias and rmse of soil moisture at 10 40 cm 40 100 cm from 0 076 cm3cm 3 and 0 078 cm3cm 3 0 056 cm3cm 3 and 0 058 cm3cm 3 to 0 038 cm3cm 3 and 0 043 cm3cm 3 0 025 cm3cm 3 and 0 036 cm3cm 3 respectively the simulation of soil moisture is mainly affected by precipitation in noah mp as seen in fig 2 a the precipitation can capture the peaks of both the measurements and ol curves which indicates the high quality precipitation used to drive the model it is likely due to the several enhancements for nldas 2 based on nldas 1 especially the daily gauge based precipitation analysis xia et al 2012 in addition the curves of both measurements and ol at deeper layers can reflect the high amount of precipitation which indicates the water flow in soil calculating by the model parameterization is close to the reality according to the r soil moisture derived from ol are highly related to the measurements at all three layers with values above 0 84 thus da leads to degradation in the correlation of soil moisture between model simulations and measurements in addition the soil moisture curves tend to be fluctuant after the step by step update in enkf which is contrary to the smooth measurement curves the tws anomalies derived from ol are consistent with the overestimation of soil moisture as shown by fig 3 the bias and rmse for ol 13 540 mm and 54 288 mm respectively greatly decrease with assimilation to 2 200 mm and 6 161 mm respectively da further introduces improvement in the r for tws anomalies increasing from 0 668 to 0 991 the da curve is extremely close to the grace curve which proves the feasibility of tws anomalies assimilation the correction of the tws anomalies overestimation is partly achieved by reducing the soil moisture especially the soil moisture at deeper layers see fig 2 the evapotranspiration from ol shows underestimation compared with that from fluxcom fig 4 and the skill metrics are 0 462 mm day for the bias 0 826 mm day for the rmse and 0 745 for the r the lower precipitation anomalies and higher air temperature anomalies contribute to the lower evapotranspiration simulations over most of the experiment period especially in 2011 and the latter half of 2012 fig s1 obviously it is because there is not enough water to be evaporated or for plants to transpire with assimilation the underestimation tends to be slightly aggravated by the decrease of soil moisture indicated by the bias of 0 502 mm day but improvements can be found in the rmse decreasing to 0 673 mm day and the r increasing to 0 823 although the above results prove that the assimilation experiment plays a positive role in the simulation of several variables degradation of assimilation can also be found at some grid cells fig 5 shows the comparison of soil moisture is the same as fig 2 but at the grid cell of 99 25 w 99 375 w and 33 625 n 33 75 n ol explicitly underestimates the soil moisture with the bias of 0 038 cm3cm 3 at 0 10 cm 0 052 cm3cm 3 at 10 40 cm and 0 105 cm3cm 3 at 40 100 cm but the r for soil moisture is relatively high above 0 70 at all layers the degradation of assimilation performance is confirmed by all three skill metrics 0 043 cm3cm 3 for the bias 0 062 cm3cm 3 for the rmse and 0 65 for the r at 0 10 cm and the underestimation of soil moisture tends to be more serious with assimilation especially at deeper layers smos shows an underestimation of soil moisture indicating by the bias of 0 071 cm3cm 3 while amsr has better accuracy in terms of bias although the two retrievals have comparable r values to da they have larger rmse values than da it should be noted that the decrease of soil moisture is accompanied by the overestimation of tws anomalies fig 6 the bias for tws anomalies is 6 947 mm and decreases to 1 902 mm with assimilation the assimilation also decreases the rmse from 32 952 mm to 5 086 mm and increases the r from 0 868 to 0 998 which verifies the effect of tws anomalies assimilation the correction of the overestimation of tws anomalies with assimilation results in the more severe underestimation of soil moisture the inconsistent trends the overestimation of tws anomalies and the underestimation of soil moisture lead to the degradation of da in the estimation of soil moisture however it is difficult to determine whether it is caused by the uncertainty in model or observation in addition it is worth noting that the spatial resolution of the satellite observations tb and tws anomalies is relatively coarser than that of model simulation thus an observation grid contains information of multiple adjacent model grids the complexity of the surface may affect the representativeness of the information contained in the observation to a single model grid ol overestimates evapotranspiration with the bias of 0 389 mm day and da yields very limited improvement with the bias decreasing to 0 384 mm day fig 7 but the improvements for evapotranspiration in the rmse and r are obvious varying from 0 810 mm day and 0 724 to 0 638 mm day and 0 795 respectively as mentioned above the limited evapotranspiration during the experiment period is due to the combined impact of the low precipitation anomalies and high air temperature anomalies fig s2 moreover the extremely high air temperature anomalies cause the increase of evapotranspiration from noah mp in the middle of 2012 under the deficient precipitation which is not detected by the data derived from fluxcom 4 2 evaluation over texas fig 8 shows the normalized error reduction ner of bias rmse and r for soil moisture with assimilation across the study area ol overestimates the surface soil moisture at 53 of all sites and the percentages for soil moisture at deep layers are 66 and 78 fig s3 with assimilation 59 of all sites show an improvement in surface soil moisture with the percentage of 53 and 72 for soil moisture at deep layers indicated by the ner bias in terms of ner rsme the surface soil moisture from da is improved at 29 of all sites with minor magnitude for both the improvement and degradation more obvious improvement can be found at deep layers with the positive value found at 55 and 68 of all sites as the results presented in section 4 1 the improvement of correlation between soil moisture and measurements across the study area is disappointing with degradation at most sites particularly for the surface soil moisture it is partly due to the high correlation between the soil moisture from ol and measurements where the domain average value of r for the three layers are 0 76 0 67 and 0 65 respectively fig s3 different from soil moisture tws anomalies are overestimated by ol in about 97 of texas with relatively high rmse r in the east north and low rmse r in the west south fig s4 fig 9 shows similar content to fig 8 but for tws anomalies tws anomalies are improved with assimilation in 89 of texas indicated by the ner bias it is worth noting that there is obvious degradation of assimilation for tws anomalies estimation in the area near dallas and fort worth according to the ner rmse and ner r the improvement for tws anomalies estimation in texas is particularly obvious without negative value with assimilation the ner rmse and ner r over texas range from 0 063 and 0 518 up to 0 933 and 0 997 respectively it should be pointed out that all the grids with positive values of ner bias meaning an improvement after assimilation for soil moisture at deep layers 10 100 cm show an overestimation of both soil moisture and tws anomalies by ol this same trend from model simulation enables assimilation to successfully improve the estimation of soil moisture at 10 100 cm which also confirms that the assimilation of tws anomalies has a great influence on the deep storage components estimation ol overestimates evapotranspiration in 40 of texas which is mainly located in the north west and central texas fig s5 meanwhile the rmse is relatively low in the north and west with r relatively high fig 10 shows similar content to fig 8 but for evapotranspiration improvement for evapotranspiration estimation is found in 43 of texas indicated by ner bais and most degradation occurs in the north and west of texas with landcover of grassland and open shrubland the domain averaged value of ner rmse for evapotranspiration is 0 261 with 97 of texas showing positive values similarly about 97 of texas shows improvement in evapotranspiration according to ner r and the domain averaged value of ner r is 0 404 given that evapotranspiration is implicitly related to soil moisture further studies are needed to understand how changes in soil moisture with assimilation affect evapotranspiration in particular the root depths of different vegetation types are different in noah mp which affects the ability of vegetation to absorb water from the soil as well as evapotranspiration wang et al 2018 overall the assimilation experiment for soil moisture plays a role in improving evapotranspiration in this study 4 3 drought estimation in texas the impact of the assimilation experiment on drought estimation is investigated in this section and the agricultural drought is characterized by the method in section 3 3 fig 11 shows the weekly time series of area percentages for the five drought categories in texas including data from usdm and results calculated by soil moisture from ol and da according to usdm texas experienced statewide drought from 2011 to 2013 most of the areas in 2011 were classified as d4 drought while from 2012 to 2013 five drought categories were almost evenly distributed it is worth noting that usdm provides very useful drought monitoring but data from usdm should not be used as true values in this study because they are based on multiple indicators considering the impact of drought in different aspects and some additional information compared with usdm ol indicated a more severe drought in 2010 but a less widespread drought from 2011 to 2013 from ol the largest areal coverage for the most severe drought category d4 occurs in the week of april 19 2011 with a value of 39 7 and the median coverage is about 6 2 the frequency of other drought categories is also very high and the percentage area for drought d0 d4 ranges from 0 7 to 91 0 happened in the week of december 12 2012 with a median value of 50 5 compared to ol da shows that the drought texas experiencing from 2010 to 2013 is more severe which likely attributes to the decrease of soil moisture after assimilation caused by the overestimation of tws anomalies most of the drought is classified as d4 based on da with a noticeable increase in the d4 drought category and a decrease in the d0 and d1 drought categories although da and usdm provide a similar estimate of drought areas from 2011 to 2013 da suggests more intense drought in addition more drought events are detected by da in 2010 compared with both ol and usdm the largest areal coverage for d4 occurs in the week of april 5 2011 with the value reaching 95 1 and the median coverage increases to 60 1 with assimilation moreover the percentage area for drought d0 d4 ranges from 28 9 to 99 4 happening in the week of march 19 2013 with a median value up to 95 4 fig 12 shows the comparison of the spatial distribution of drought intensities derived from ol da and usdm as seen from the drought map of the week of may 3 2011 ol shows the most intense drought d4 in the north and east and less intense drought d0 d3 in the south da increases the spatial extent and severity of drought which leads to the majority regions of texas experiencing the drought of d4 category except for the northeast usdm indicates a statewide drought which is similar as da but most areas exhibit d3 drought category while the drought pattern leans toward d4 category in da for the drought map in 2012 there are insignificant drought events occurring in the border area of texas indicated by ol while da shows the north west and southwest in the drought of d4 category and the coastal areas in less intense drought d0 d3 the drought detected by da and usdm is in good agreement in the spatial extent but da suggests more severe drought in the western and southwestern regions than usdm in the case of 2013 only the north is in drought most in d4 indicated by ol however da increases the spatial extent to almost all of texas with d4 category founding in the north west and southwest and d0 d3 categories founding in other regions usdm indicated the occurrence of drought in most areas with the drought coverage between ol and da and drought severity weaker than da similar to the conclusion from fig 11 da predicts more intense drought over texas than ol comparing the differences in the drought estimates from ol and da the more severe drought is found in the north west and southwest with assimilation as confirmed by fig s6 the time percentage of drought characterized as d4 is relatively low and spatially similar across texas based on ol and increased by da especially in the regions mentioned above moreover drought happens more frequently during 2010 2013 in the north as shown by the time percentage of drought characterized as d0 d4 based on ol fig s6 with assimilation this percentage is very high which indicates persistent drought existing in almost all over texas during 2010 2013 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties in the assimilation experiment it can be seen from the above results that the assimilation experiment failed to improve the soil moisture at all sites as well as degradation founding in other variables this is not surprising because the assimilation experiment is based on some assumptions and there are uncertainties in the model and observation the underestimation of soil moisture and overestimation of tws anomalies may be due to the uncertainties in the estimation of other water storage components in tws such as groundwater surface water storage and canopy water storage groundwater accounts for a large proportion of tws simulation wu et al 2021 which is not selected as a state variable updating with assimilation but influenced by the update of soil moisture since it is difficult to quantify the contribution of soil moisture and groundwater to the changes in tws separately we presume that groundwater is relatively stable in texas and only focus on the soil moisture variability this is also because the human intervention irrigation in texas has not caused a lot of groundwater depletion other than central valley high plains and mississippi embayment rateb et al 2020 in addition the changes of grace tws anomalies have been attributed to rivers lakes and reservoirs which are not considered in noah mp scanlon et al 2018 particularly most of these water storage features have been severely affected by the drought with water levels hitting the record low larry 2011 although the canopy water storage is negligible as a component of tws whether and how to parameterize the dynamic root depth and plant hydraulics in the model which is not considered in this study will have an important impact on the water absorption capacity of vegetation thus affecting soil moisture especially under dry conditions niu et al 2020 li et al 2021 in terms of the observations the complex surface will affect the representativeness of observation data for sub region since the spatial resolution of both tb and tws anomalies is coarser than that of the model 5 2 comparison of separate assimilation of tb and tws anomalies two additional experiments were conducted to assess the performance of the separate assimilation of tb and tws anomalies with the other experimental settings remaining the same the results for tb assimilation hereinafter as datb are displayed by figs s7 s9 and s11 while the results for tws anomalies assimilation hereinafter as datws are displayed by figs s8 s10 and s12 all the skill metrics from datb for soil moisture at 0 10 cm are similar to those from da in general datb shows better performance than datws indicated by the ner bias but these two assimilation experiments have their advantages and disadvantages at different sites according to the ner rmse and ner r the ner bias for soil moisture at 10 40 cm from datb is more similar to da and indicated more improvements than datws in contrast the ner rmse and ner r from datws show a slightly better performance than datb and is in better agreement with da datws has advantages over datb in the soil moisture estimation at 40 100 cm as indicated by all the skill metrics which shares similar trends to da it is worth noting that the accuracy for a specific variable from da can be worse than one of the separate assimilations in some grids but da combines the strengths of the two kinds of observations coupling the impact of tb on soil moisture at 0 40 cm and the impact of tws anomalies on soil moisture at 10 100 cm for the estimation of tws anomalies there is a considerable degradation in datb with slightly better performance in the east it is expected that great improvement can be found in datws because the observations used for assimilation are also used for evaluation in terms of the ner rmse and ner r da is a closer approximation of datws the ner bias from da is slightly worse than that from datws but much better than that from datb for the estimation of evapotranspiration da shows a better performance than separate assimilations the results from datb are similar to da but the ner bais and ner rmse indicate a worse performance than da in north and central texas datws shows evident improvements in the north and west but degradations in other regions by the ner bais and ner rmse the influence of tb assimilation tws anomalies assimilation on different soil depths mainly depends on the covariance matrix of tb tws anomalies simulations and soil moisture simulations which directly determines the kalman gain in equation 1 it can be seen from the fig s13 a c that the kalman gain of tb assimilation shows a significant decrease with the increase of soil depth the kalman gain of tws anomalies assimilation is comparable in different soil depths fig s13 d f this is not surprising because the penetration depth of microwave determines that the brightness temperature cannot reflect the information of deep soil but tws contains the information of the soil moisture profile for this reason the combined assimilation of the two observations to acquire more accurate soil moisture profile information can be feasible the estimation of evapotranspiration and tws anomalies are affected by changes in soil moisture because they are not used as the state variable in assimilation as mentioned above datb shows a similar performance to da in the estimation of evapotranspiration which indicates that evapotranspiration estimate by noah mp is greatly affected by the shallow soil datb affects the shallow soil this is consistent to the expression of root water uptake of vegetation in the model it is not surprising that datws shows a greater impact improvement in the estimation of tws anomalies the degradation of tws anomalies estimated by datb indicate that the brightness temperature cannot reflect the information of the deep water component 6 conclusions the purposes of this study are to examine the impact of the assimilation of remote sensed brightness temperature and terrestrial water storage anomalies on soil moisture estimation and explore the situation of agricultural drought based on data assimilation over texas during 2010 2013 soil moisture from three ground networks tws anomalies from grace and evapotranspiration from fluxcom are used to evaluate the results from assimilation experiments moreover the temporal spatial characteristics of the agricultural drought are assessed and analyzed using the drought indicator related to root zone soil moisture percentile improvement for soil moisture with assimilation can be found at most of the sites by decreasing the bias and rmse especially for soil moisture at deeper layers but the degradation in r is evident and partly due to the already high correlation between ol and measurements tws anomalies are greatly improved by da over the study area and only minor degradation in the north and central texas is indicated by the bias similarly da shows obvious improvements for evapotranspiration in terms of rmse and r but some degradation in the north and west is indicated by the bias compared with ol da tends to predict more severe droughts in texas for both the well known drought in 2011 and the continuing severe drought in 2012 and 2013 in terms of spatial distribution drought occurred more frequently in the north west and southwest according to da in addition the estimation of total drought area by da is consistent with usdm but da identifies more exceptional drought d4 than usdm there are still some uncertainties in the model and satellite observations that cause the degradation of the performance of data assimilation in some regions however data assimilation is proved to effectively improve the accuracy of the model simulations in this study when validated with in situ measurements and satellite datasets in addition when compared to the separate assimilation of tb and tws anomalies the multi sensor data assimilation successfully combined the strengths of different kinds of observations in particular the improvement of simulation accuracy of root zone soil moisture with assimilation in this study is of great significance to the accurate estimation of agricultural drought to enhance the assimilation performance future studies could focus more on the representation of human intervention in the water cycle groundwater and vegetation water in land surface model as well as the synergy of different observations in multi source data assimilation credit authorship contribution statement weijing chen conceptualization methodology
