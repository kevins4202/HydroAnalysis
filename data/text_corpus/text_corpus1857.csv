9285,water shortages frequently occur in karst areas and there is an urgent need to quantify water fluxes to provide information for sustainable management of water resources thus a variety of models have been developed to simulate the water balance process including actual evapotranspiration etc which is a key variable for linking water and energy cycles however high heterogeneity of the land surface makes it hard to get precise complete set of parameters for single model and a single model often has uncertainties in simulating evapotranspiration in karst regions therefore this study integrated three well known individual models penman monteith pm priestley and taylor pt and shuttleworth wallace sw with two multi model ensemble approaches bayesian model averaging bma and simple model average sa to enhance etc modeling in a subtropical humid karst catchment results show that 1 the individual models show different strengths for different ecosystems which could be attributed to differences in the underlying landscape surface characteristics 2 individual models exhibited seasonal uncertainties for example simulated etc et s by the pm and pt model was lower than et o observed etc during november march but higher than during april october for forest grass mixed and grass ecosystems 3 two multi model ensemble approaches r 2 0 85 performed better than any individual model r 2 0 85 most likely because multi model ensemble approaches reduce model uncertainties by weakening the bias of individual models keywords evapotranspiration eco hydrology soil hydrology landscape ecology ventilated chambers earth s critical zone data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction karst landscapes cover 10 of the earth s land surface and their water resources supply approximately 25 of the world s population hartmann et al 2014a in recent years severe rocky desertification has occurred in many areas mainly as a result of deforestation and agricultural intensification in fragile karst ecosystems yang et al 2016 aquifers typically show marked and rapid reactions to precipitation events hartmann et al 2014a due to low water retention in thin soil liu et al 2016 therefore water stress and water shortages occur more frequently when rainfall is low and there is an urgent need to quantify water fluxes to provide reliable evidence for the protection and sustainable management of karst water resources however various porosities such as micropores small fissures and fractures large fractures and conduits result in the movement of water storage from the surface to the subsurface in karst regions bakalowicz 2005 consequently the monitoring data usually exhibits substantial uncertainty yang et al 2017 a variety of models have been developed to simulate hydrological processes and the water balance in karst regions hartmann et al 2012 2014b jones et al 2000 jukic and denic jukic 2009 pardo iguzquiza et al 2012 evapotranspiration etc returns approximately 67 of annual terrestrial precipitation to the atmosphere and is a critical nexus in water energy and carbon cycles in the global oki and kanae 2006 however previous karst models mainly focus on groundwater recharge hartmann et al 2014a models for etc estimation in karst landscapes are relatively limited because they face greater challenges than other landscapes it is difficult to measure actual etc and upscale it to regional scales in karst landscapes the reason for such a difficulty is that the surface of karst areas is not uniform i e the great variations of thickness of the soil layer dense distribution of bare rock and karst cave resulting in different growth patterns of plants even over the similar fields and forests although etc can be measured for individual plants it is not representative of the same type of ecosystem even at short distances zhang et al 2018 for example zhong et al 2018 estimated etc of a karst basin however the actual etc was replaced by transpiration of trees in his study the accuracy of retrieved parameters of models is usually low for example luo et al 2019 retrieved spatial distribution of soil moisture for a karst catchment and concluded that the models did not perform well in highly heterogeneous landscapes r 2 0 36 therefore accurate etc estimation based models for karst landscapes is required and more difficult than those regions which the underlying surface is uniform previous use of individual models has large uncertainties when estimating etc kim et al 2015 rings et al 2012 yao et al 2017 for example stannard 1993 found that the penman monteith pm model which is a physically based equation proposed by penman 1948 to estimate potential evaporation and developed by monteith 1965 did not perform well in the san luis valley colorado usa which is a semiarid region where vegetation cover is sparse stannard 1993 whitley et al 2009 found that etc simulations for a woodland in north western new south wales australia using the pm equation during winter was low li et al 2016 found that the pm sw shuttleworth wallace sw and priestley and taylor pt a simplified version of pm model models all underestimated daily etc to some extent when estimating crop potential and actual etc in arid regions to overcome this problem multi model ensemble approaches were proposed to better constrain etc estimation and reduce uncertainties in particular previous studies have demonstrated that both bayesian model average bma and simple models average sa approaches were superior to the use of a single algorithm or model for example zhu et al 2016 demonstrated that both bma and sa approaches performed better than four single models in terrestrial etc predictions across northern china based on comparison with direct observations from 12 flux towers yao et al 2017 also found that bma which integrated three process based etc algorithms was more robust than the application of various individual models similarly ershadi et al 2014 showed that a sa method outperformed any individual model s estimation of etc chen et al 2015b indicated that the bma approach was more accurate than any single model in estimating terrestrial etc in china especially for karst landscapes it is harder to get precise complete set of parameters model as same as the validated data i e measured actual et data therefore constructing a single model with higher accuracy may need to pay a greater price than constructing integration model which is applied relatively limited on karst landforms for et estimation bai et al 2021 bhattarai et al 2019 therefore this study aims to 1 strengthen etc estimation by integrating three individual models penman monteith pm priestley and taylor pt and shuttleworth wallace sw into multi model ensemble approaches bayesian model average bma and simple models average sa and 2 characterize and simulate etc processes in three humid karst agroforestry ecosystems mixed forest grass crop and grass 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area 24 44 25 33 n 107 51 108 43 e covers approximately 0 3 km2 and is a typical peak cluster depression in the karst landscape of southwestern china it is characterized by shallow soils and high coverage of bedrock outcrops and is located in the guzhou watershed huanjiang county guangxi province fig 1 formed from limestone the calcareous soil can be classified into two types continuous and isolated both the continuous and large isolated areas are severely weathered and are characterized by a network of soil filled cracks and crevices yang et al 2016 with an annual mean temperature of 18 5 c and an annual mean precipitation of approximately 1389 mm year 1 the area has a humid subtropical monsoon climate approximately 70 of the precipitation falls between april and september 2 2 experiment design and field measurements land cover in the catchment is dominated by crops elephant grass pennisetum purpureum schum and zenia insigins zenia insigins chun trees nie et al 2012 yang et al 2017 therefore three agroforestry ecosystems mixed forest grass crop and grass were selected to measure and simulate etc processes in plot scale studies as shown in table 1 the data were recorded from 12th march 2015 26 th may 2016 in the forest grass mixed ecosystem study lot there are 85 zenia insigins trees and 6 representative trees based on different stem sizes and canopy sizes in the forest were selected to measure transpiration calculated by sap flow in grass and forest grass mixed

once every 10 15 days every 2 h from 6 00 am to 8 00 pm during a day with a skpm1400 british skye cor ltd u k 2 3 evapotranspiration observation etc is the sum of e evaporation and t transpiration t calculated by sap flow of trees was measured by tdp thermal dissipation probes e of bare soil was measured by micro lysimeters interception loss was calculated by using the precipitation gauge in the forest and comparing it with precipitation values from outside the forest etc of crop and grass ecosystems was measured by ventilated chambers as shown in table 1 the ventilated chamber technique for measuring etc from crops reicosky and peters 1977 trees and plantations has demonstrated its utility for application at plot scales greenwood et al 1982 1985a 1985b however the ventilated chambers used in previous studies were not transferable to karst environments because traditional ventilated chambers were non removable therefore we modified the ventilated chambers fig 1 for karst and a patent has been approved for this innovation patent no zl201410756225 x the design features an outlet near the top connected to an aspirator pump by a pvc tube and an inlet hole connected with a pvc tube temperature and humidity sensors were placed inside both the pvc tube inlet and outlet with this etc was calculated using the following empirical equations 1 ah 217 rh 6 1078 e 17 269 ta 237 3 ta

sa was the sapwood area of a plant the relationship between sapwood area and dbh diameter at breast height was first determined based on the data of 18 adjacent trees in the surrounding ecosystem area sa 11 9 dbh 82 4 r 2 0 94 n 18 note that the sapwood width was measured by drilling through trees trunk and extracting cores fiora and cescatti 2006 forrester et al 2010 the daily etc mm day 1 of forest grass ecosystem was estimated as 4 etc t sum a et v where t sum kg day 1 is the sum of 6 zenia insigins trees transpiration a m2 is the area including both canopy projected area and inter canopy area covered by the 6 trees and etc is measured by ventilated chamber in the understory of this ecosystem bare soil evaporation was measured using micro lysimeters made of 10 cm outer diameter 20 cm depth pvc cylinders the inner diameter was 9 5 cm boast and robertson 1982 the pvc cylinders were encased by outer cylinders of slightly larger diameter also made from pvc but with the same depth balwinder et al 2014 every cylinder held a soil core that was obtained using a wooden hammer driving it into the soil this was done causing minimum soil disturbance so that the obtained soil core remained as far as possible in the same condition as the surrounding soil allen 1990 three cylinders were set in every ecosystem under grass or crops near the ventilated chamber synchronized with the ventilated chamber operation the cylinders were weighed every two hours from 6 00 am to 8 00 pm 2 4 etc simulation by the pm model the pt model and the sw models the physically based pm model eq 5 is probably the most widely used approach for estimating etc stannard 1993 the pt model is a simplification of penman equation pereira 2004 many types of vegetation have complex canopy structures and soil evaporation can account for a significant proportion of total etc iritz et al 1999 therefore shuttleworth and wallace 1985 developed a two layer modeling scheme in which the evaporation from the canopy and the soil surface are evaluated separately the numerical range for the parameters of pm pt and sw models differed by vegetation and season as shown in tables 2a and 2b however the parameters are not directly measurable and need to be estimated indirectly from other observed data for example r a m s 1 is the aerodynamic resistance between canopy and atmosphere in the water vapor transfer it can be calculated as follow equation allen et al 1994 thom 1968 1972 5 r a ln z d z 0 ln z d z e k 2 μ where μ is wind speed at height z m s 1 k is the von karman constant k 0 41 d is the zero plane displacement height taken as 66 of the plant canopy height h in meters d 0 67 h m z 0 is the movement roughness length z 0 0 13 h m and z e is the roughness length for vapor transport z e 0 1 z 0 m langensiepen et al 2009 another parameter r c m s 1 is the resistance that the canopy opposes to the diffusion of water vapor from inner leaves toward the atmosphere and it is influenced by biological climatological and agronomical variables it is calculated as 6 r c r s lai e where lai e is leaf area index of the leaves effective in transpiration obviously r c m s 1 is determined as a function of daily mean stomatal resistance of the single leaves r s and lai e m2 m 2 it also can be simulated by the following equations dickinson 1984 dickinson et al 1991 sellers et al 1986 7 r c r

photosynthetically active radiation and r min m s 1 and r max m s 1 are minimum and maximum stomatal resistance respectively lai e is effective lai r g mj m 2 d 1 is active radiation that reaches the canopy and r gl mj m 2 d 1 is a limit value of 100 w m 2 for crop or grass the factor f 2 takes into account the effect of the water stress on the surface resistance it varies between 0 and 1 when θ varies between θ w and θ f thompson 1981 10 f 2 1 if θ θ f θ θ w θ f θ w if θ w θ θ f 0 if θ θ w where θ cm3 cm 3 is soil water content θ f cm3 cm 3 is field water capacity θ w cm3 cm 3 is wilting

probability density function pdf by integrating the results of several individual models duan and phillips 2010 according the law of total probability the predictive distribution of variable y the observations y and independent predictions of models m k k 1 2 k can be expressed as follow shahrbanou and moradkhani 2014 13 p y m 1 m i y i 1 k p m i y p y m i y where k is the number of models combined in bma model p y m i y denotes the posterior distribution of y given the model prediction m i and training data y m i denotes the independent prediction of i models m 1 m 2 m i p m i y is the likelihood of model prediction being correct given the observations y during the training period which reflects the performance of model mi in predicting the forecast variable considering that model predictions are time variant eq 13 can be rewritten as 14 p y t m 1 t m 2 t m i t y i 1 k p w i y t m i t y before applying bma bias correction methods must be used to guarantee that the expected values of observed and predicated by every model are equal to each other if model forecasts are biased the bias corrected forecasts f i t should be replaced by original model predictions m i t as follow equation shahrbanou and moradkhani 2014 15 f i t a i b i m i t for computational simplicity the likelihood function is commonly assumed to be a gaussian pdf and is represented as n f i t σ i 2 σ i 2 reflects the uncertainty of the i th model both modeled and observed data must be preprocessed using the one parameter box cox transformation as follows 16 f i t λ f i 1 λ 1 λ λ 0 in f i t λ 0 where f i t is the bias corrected forecast of model i at time t λ is the box cox coefficient f i t λ is the transformed bias corrected forecast of model i at time t the log likelihood function was used to estimate the variance σ i 2 and weight w i of each forecast model setting the vector of parameters as θ w i σ i 2 i 1 2 k then the function of θ can be approximated as follow huang et al 2019 17 l θ log i 1 k w i p y f i y because the analytical solution to maximize the log likelihood function is complex therefore the expectation maximization em algorithm was recommended by raftery et al 2005 it is iterative procedure that updates the weights and variances of posterior distributions by introducing a latent variable z the initial weight and variance for each model are set to w i iter 1 k and σ i iter 2 1 k t 1 t i 1 k y t f i t 2 t as the em algorithm proceeds the parameter vector is updated as follows shahrbanou and moradkhani 2014 18 w i iter 1 t t 1 t z i iter t 19 σ i iter 2 t 1

t is the length of the training period and the iteration process stops until the termination criterion l θ iter l θ iter 1 ε is achieved all other variables are defined the same as in the previous equations to evaluate the performance of the models taylor diagrams were used which are polar style graphs yao et al 2017 taylor diagrams include the centered root mean square error rmse the correlation coefficient r and the standard deviation std between observed and modeled etc in addition the determination efficiency r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were used in model evaluation gupta et al 2009 hartmann et al 2013 these indexes were calculated by the following equations 22 r 2 t 1 n q m t q m q o t q o t 1 n q m t q m 2 t 1 n q o t q o 2 2 23 rmse t 1 n q m t q o

3 results and discussion 3 1 etc dynamics of three agroforestry ecosystems as shown in fig 2 observed daily etc exhibited clear seasonal variation it should be noted that only sunny days were selected to compare etc dynamics ventilated chambers cannot be used during rainy days as they would restrict plant to access water daily etc in the growing period april october averaged 9 8 4 1 mm day 1 mean one standard deviation 5 7 3 3 mm day 1 and 7 2 3 4 mm day 1 for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively this was much higher than in winter november march where the means were 3 26 1 97 mm day 1 1 65 1 17 mm day 1 and 3 06 1 38 mm day 1 for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystems respectively clearly daily etc varied substantially between the different ecosystems overall mean daily etc during the study period was 6 58 4 38 mm day 1 4 18 3 20 mm day 1 and 5 67 3 31 mm day 1 for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively table 3 daily etc in the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem exhibited similar seasonal trends and short term dynamics during the study period however daily etc amounts were significantly different between the three ecosystems fig 2 this reflects the integrated effects of environmental controls plant species and land management methods in our study daily etc of the three ecosystems exhibited similar seasonality as shown in fig 2 similar results have been observed in various climatic zones including cold climates temperate climates tropical systems and arid semi arid regions li et al 2012 parka et al 2008 shao et al 2012 tanaka et al 2008 yang and zhou 2011 potential etc is approximately 1129 3 mm year 1 during study period which is similar with those results in the same bioclimatic zone chen et al 2015a tian et al 2018 yao et al 2014 for example the annual potential etc mainly fell in the range of 950 1350 mm year 1 in the southwestern china during 8 years 2008 2016 tian et al 2018 the annual potential etc calculated by yao et al 2014 during 1982 2010 was between 800 and 1400 mm year 1 in the same zone chen et al 2015a calculated 50 year 1956 2006 actual annual etc for guangdong province which is in the same latitude with the area of our study results showed that actual annual etc was within the scope of 600 1200 mm year 1 previous studies have demonstrated that the seasonality in etc was mainly related to precipitation solar radiation soil water content swc and leaf area index lai parka et al 2008 shao et al 2012 tanaka et al 2008 yang and zhou 2011 in our study three agroforestry ecosystems were located in the same depression and therefore the sites had similar meteorological factors and this was the main control responsible for the similar etc seasonality for three ecosystems however with different vegetation cover soil water and labor control daily etc quantities exhibited differences between the three ecosystems table 3 daily etc was highest in the forest grass mixed ecosystem followed by the grass ecosystem and crop ecosystem this was probably due to differences in plant species having different transpiration rates water use efficiencies and density of conducting tissue e g lai dickinson et al 1991 ge et al 2011 kite 2000 kite and droogers 2000 tanaka et al 2008 specifically the space between crops mainly for maize and soybean is larger than grass to ensure crop growth which leads to smaller lai and less water consumption alkaisi et al 1989 soegaard and boegh 1995 steduto and hsiao 1998 and in the same conditions the transpiration of trees is higher than crops and grass and therefore forest grass mixed ecosystems have higher water demand than grass ecosystem and crop ecosystem at our study site bernhofer 1992 bernhofer and gay 1989 cornish and vertessy 2001 cristiano et al 2015 kumagai et al 2014 sun et al 2008 swift et al 1975 vourlitis et al 2002 3 2 performance of different models as shown in fig 2 the curves of simulated daily etc using the five methods were broadly similar to that of observed daily etc however the performance of each individual model in the growing and non growing seasons showed obvious differences for the three ecosystems as shown in table 3 simulated etc et s by the pm and pt model was lower than et o observed etc during november march but higher than during april october for forest grass mixed and grass ecosystems as for the sw models et s were slightly higher than et o for forest grass mixed ecosystem during the whole study period et s by pm model was lower than et o observed etc during november march but higher than during april october for crop and grass ecosystems however et s by pt and sw models exhibited opposite results for the two ecosystems i e et s was higher than et o during november march but lower during april october for crop and grass ecosystems fig 3a c show the taylor diagrams of the observed daily etc and simulated etc based on the different models for the three agroforestry ecosystems tables 3 and 4 show the relationships between simulated and observed daily etc for different ecosystems as shown in fig 3a and table 4 the bma approach p 0 01 had a greater r 2 0 91 greater nse 0 91 and smaller rmse 1 87 mm day 1 and therefore performed better than other individual models for forest grass mixed ecosystems the sa method and pt model took the second and last place for this ecosystem respectively similarly for the crop and grass ecosystems the bma approach performed better than any other method however the pt model performed more poorly than any other method for the forest grass mixed ecosystem r 2 0 68 nse 0 68 rmse 3 82 mm day 1 and crop ecosystem r 2 0 57 nse 0 35 rmse 2 38 mm day 1 the pm model performed slightly worse than the other methods for the estimates for the grass ecosystem with a smaller r 2 0 84 and nse 0 34 and a higher rmse 3 02 mm day 1 each individual model performed differently for the three agroforestry ecosystems with contrasting strengths and weaknesses table 4 in our study the sw model r 2 0 85 performed better than the pm model r 2 0 72 and the pt model r 2 0 68 for forestry grass mixed ecosystem since grass ecosystem under the trees was affected by the tree coverage and the etc dynamics of grass ecosystem can t be treated synchronously with trees transpiration and canopy evaporation just as the different cover of two types of grass leads to different simulation results of the same model the different bare rock ratio of the surface also leads to different results of the same model as shown in fig 5 the bare rock ratio of forest grass mixed ecosystem was higher than that of the crop and grass systems it means that the rate of surface heterogeneity for forestry grass mixed ecosystem was significantly higher than that of the other two ecosystems therefore one dimensional models may not work out so well for this ecosystem to simulate etc it is well known that the pm and pt models are one dimensional based on aerodynamic theory and energy balance penman 1948 and they are applied to the whole area as if all vegetation is a single big leaf therefore canopy resistance is a major control of the pm and pt models as a result the complex nature of the canopy and underlying soil of the forest grass mixed ecosystem is not consistent with the big leaf assumption stannard 1993 therefore the sw model performed better than the pm and pt models in forest grass mixed ecosystem for the crop ecosystem the crop rotation maize soybean and sweet potato leads to high variability of stomatal resistance over the course of the year consequently simulated values of canopy resistance r c and canopy surface resistance r might be imprecise irmak et al 2013 whitley et al 2009 in other words the values of a calibrated α parameter for the crop ecosystem were more imprecise than for the grass and forest grass mixed ecosystems therefore the pt model did not perform as well as the other two models for the crop ecosystem table 4 compared with forest grass mixed ecosystem and the crop ecosystem the vegetation in the grass ecosystem was more homogenous only grass and the soil depth sd was thicker than other two ecosystems li et al 2013 2016 zhou et al 2007 consequently the models performed equally well table 4 r 2 0 84 for this ecosystem similar results have been reported in previous studies for example zhang et al 2008 found significant differences in etc estimation for a vineyard located in an arid area of northwest china between the pm and sw models the differences in model performances may be related to drought stress from low soil moisture and variations in lai burba and verma 2005 the difference in lai can lead to different proportions of soil evaporation which determines whether evaporation can be neglected in models and it has substantial effects on simulation accuracy fisher et al 2005 3 3 contribution of each individual model to bma model as shown in fig 4a simulated daily etc by the sw model made the highest percentage contribution 51 5 to the bma approach for the forest grass mixed ecosystem for this ecosystem etc simulated by the pm model and pt model only accounted for 27 3 and 21 2 of the total respectively similarly the sw model made the largest contribution to the bma approach for crop ecosystem fig 4b and grass ecosystem fig 4c however compared to the forest grass mixed ecosystem the contribution reduced to 42 4 and 36 4 for the crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively the pt model 33 3 ranks slightly ahead of the pm model 30 3 in the bma approach for the grass ecosystem in the bma model the contributions of single models differed for forest grass mixed ecosystem and this underlines its superiority compared to sa method each individual model exhibited uncertainties in our study for example as shown in table 3 models would overestimate or underestimate etc in different seasons for the three agroforestry ecosystems similar results have been reported in previous research for example zhang et al 2008 found the pm model significantly overestimated etc over a vineyard located in an arid area northwest china a possible explanation for over or under estimation might be that the parameterization of canopy resistance in the models is unequal to the actual surface resistance which is an integration of canopy and soil surface resistances stannard 1993 another explanation for model underestimation of etc by might be related to uncertainty in model parameters such as r min minimum stomatal resistance for example the r min values can differ for vineyards 146 s m 1 in northwest china and for maize crop 252 s m 1 in north italy gharsallah et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 moreover in managed landscapes models do not capture the interference of labor management such as un scheduled cutting weeding and soil plowing which can greatly affect lai and soil surface resistance yang et al 2017 consequently the advantages of the multi model ensemble approaches i e bma and sa can help minimize some of these problems and generally perform better than individual models chen et al 2015b ershadi et al 2014 yao et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 in our study the sa and bma approaches successfully improved the estimation of etc for all three agroforestry ecosystems with increased nse r 2 and decreased rmse table 4 compared to individual models similar results were found in previous studies chen et al 2015b ershadi et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 in general the performance of multi model ensemble approaches depend on the success of individual models vrugt and robinson 2007 however estimation by individual models often resulted in a significant bias as a result of intrinsic uncertainties specific to each model hoeting et al 1999 parrish et al 2012 raftery et al 2005 in contrast multi model ensemble approaches reduced model uncertainties by weakening the bias of individual models hoeting et al 1999 parrish et al 2012 raftery et al 2005 we also found that bma approach performed slightly better than sa approach for crop and forest grass mixed ecosystem but the models showed similar performance in the grass ecosystem similar results have been reported in previous studies barnes et al 2003 diks and vrugt 2010 raftery et al 2005 vrugt and robinson 2007 zhu et al 2016 for example barnes et al 2003 found that a bma approach produced more accurate estimation of etc than a sa approach as did zhu et al 2016 who reported that the bma approach performed better than sa approach for etc prediction across north china this reflects the flexibility of the bma approach in weighing the likelihood of individual models which perform best whereas the sa approach neglects this through averaging raftery et al 2005 for example in our study the sw model performed best among three individual models for the forest grass mixed ecosystem in our study and the weight fig 4 of sw model in bma approach 51 5 was higher than that in sa approach 33 3 but for the grass ecosystem the performances of three individual models were similar pm r 2 0 84 pt r 2 0 85 sw r 2 0 85 consequently bma and sa approach exhibited similar performances for estimation of etc estimation in the grass ecosystem according to the results of our study each model will show the advantages and disadvantages depending on the type of cover and growth stage therefore if we want to simulate a larger scale of etc we can redistrict a watershed according vegetation types firstly we will build several single models for a single vegetation type secondly build multiple models such as bma model to get a simulation result for every single vegetation in the end combine every single vegetation type to produce an overall simulation of etc of a watershed 4 conclusions in this study three individual models pm pt and sw were integrated by two multi model ensemble approaches bma and sa to improve accuracy of etc for three agroforestry ecosystems forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystems in a humid subtropical karst region results show that the magnitude of daily etc varies depending on prevailing environmental controls including growing stages of crops plant species and crop management methods the individual models show different strengths for different ecosystems which could be attributed to differences in the underlying landscape surface characteristics such as lai vegetation composition and rock coverage two multi model ensemble approaches performed better than any individual model most likely because multi model ensemble approaches reduce model uncertainties by weakening the bias of individual models it is recommended that multi model ensemble approaches be used for estimation of evapotranspiration from vegetation in complex terrain areas declaration of competing interest the

9285,water shortages frequently occur in karst areas and there is an urgent need to quantify water fluxes to provide information for sustainable management of water resources thus a variety of models have been developed to simulate the water balance process including actual evapotranspiration etc which is a key variable for linking water and energy cycles however high heterogeneity of the land surface makes it hard to get precise complete set of parameters for single model and a single model often has uncertainties in simulating evapotranspiration in karst regions therefore this study integrated three well known individual models penman monteith pm priestley and taylor pt and shuttleworth wallace sw with two multi model ensemble approaches bayesian model averaging bma and simple model average sa to enhance etc modeling in a subtropical humid karst catchment results show that 1 the individual models show different strengths for different ecosystems which could be attributed to differences in the underlying landscape surface characteristics 2 individual models exhibited seasonal uncertainties for example simulated etc et s by the pm and pt model was lower than et o observed etc during november march but higher than during april october for forest grass mixed and grass ecosystems 3 two multi model ensemble approaches r 2 0 85 performed better than any individual model r 2

ecology ventilated chambers earth s critical zone data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction karst landscapes cover 10 of the earth s land surface and their water resources supply approximately 25 of the world s population hartmann et al 2014a in recent years severe rocky desertification has occurred in many areas mainly as a result of deforestation and agricultural intensification in fragile karst ecosystems yang et al 2016 aquifers typically show marked and rapid reactions to precipitation events hartmann et al 2014a due to low water retention in thin soil liu et al 2016 therefore water stress and water shortages occur more frequently when rainfall is low and there is an urgent need to quantify water fluxes to provide reliable evidence for the protection and sustainable management of karst water resources however various porosities such as micropores small fissures and fractures large fractures and conduits result in the movement of water storage from the surface to the subsurface in karst regions bakalowicz 2005 consequently the monitoring data usually exhibits substantial uncertainty yang et al 2017 a variety of models have been developed to simulate hydrological processes and the water balance in karst regions hartmann et al 2012 2014b jones et al 2000 jukic and denic jukic 2009 pardo iguzquiza et al 2012 evapotranspiration etc returns approximately 67 of annual terrestrial precipitation to the atmosphere and is a critical nexus in water energy and carbon cycles in the global oki and kanae 2006 however previous karst models mainly focus on groundwater recharge hartmann et al 2014a models for etc estimation in karst landscapes are relatively limited because they face greater challenges than other landscapes it is difficult to measure actual etc and upscale it to regional scales in karst landscapes the reason for such a difficulty is that the surface of karst areas is not uniform i e the great variations of thickness of the soil layer dense distribution of bare rock and karst cave resulting in different growth patterns of plants even over the similar fields and forests although etc can be measured for individual plants it is not representative of the same type of ecosystem even at short distances zhang et al 2018 for example zhong et al 2018 estimated etc of a karst basin however the actual etc was replaced by transpiration of trees in his study the accuracy of retrieved parameters of models is usually low for example luo et al 2019 retrieved spatial distribution of soil moisture for a karst catchment and concluded that the models did not perform well in highly heterogeneous landscapes r 2 0 36 therefore accurate etc estimation based models for karst landscapes is required and more difficult than those regions which the underlying surface is uniform previous use of individual models has large uncertainties when estimating etc kim et al 2015 rings et al 2012 yao et al 2017 for example stannard 1993 found that the penman monteith pm model which is a physically based equation proposed by penman 1948 to estimate potential evaporation and developed by monteith 1965 did not perform well in the san luis valley colorado usa which is a semiarid region where vegetation cover is sparse stannard 1993 whitley et al 2009 found that etc simulations for a woodland in north western new south wales australia using the pm equation during winter was low li et al 2016 found that the pm sw shuttleworth wallace sw and priestley and taylor pt a simplified version of pm model models all underestimated daily etc to some extent when estimating crop potential and actual etc in arid regions to overcome this problem multi model ensemble approaches were proposed to better constrain etc estimation and reduce uncertainties in particular previous studies have demonstrated that both bayesian model average bma and simple models average sa approaches were superior to the use of a single algorithm or model for example zhu et al 2016 demonstrated that both bma and sa approaches performed better than four single models in terrestrial etc predictions across northern china based on comparison with direct observations from 12 flux towers yao et al 2017 also found that bma which integrated three process based etc algorithms was more robust than the application of various individual models similarly ershadi et al 2014 showed that a sa method outperformed any individual model s estimation of etc chen et al 2015b indicated that the bma approach was more accurate than any single model in estimating terrestrial etc in china especially for karst landscapes it is harder to get precise complete set of parameters model as same as the validated data i e measured actual et data therefore constructing a single model with higher accuracy may need to pay a greater price than constructing integration model which is applied relatively limited on karst landforms for et estimation bai et al 2021 bhattarai et al 2019 therefore this study aims to 1 strengthen etc estimation by integrating three individual models penman monteith pm priestley and taylor pt and shuttleworth wallace sw into multi model ensemble approaches bayesian model average bma and simple models average sa and 2 characterize and simulate etc processes in three humid karst agroforestry

in the karst landscape of southwestern china it is characterized by shallow soils and high coverage of bedrock outcrops and is located in the guzhou watershed huanjiang county guangxi province fig 1 formed from limestone the calcareous soil can be classified into two types continuous and isolated both the continuous and large isolated areas are severely weathered and are characterized by a network of soil filled cracks and crevices yang et al 2016 with an annual mean temperature of 18 5 c and an annual mean precipitation of approximately 1389 mm year 1 the area has a humid subtropical monsoon climate approximately 70 of the precipitation falls between april and september 2 2 experiment design and field measurements land cover in the catchment is dominated by crops elephant grass pennisetum purpureum schum and zenia insigins zenia insigins chun trees nie et al 2012 yang et al 2017 therefore three agroforestry ecosystems mixed forest grass crop and grass were selected to measure and simulate etc processes in plot scale studies as shown in table 1 the data were recorded from 12th march 2015 26 th may 2016 in the forest grass mixed ecosystem study lot there are 85 zenia insigins trees and 6 representative trees based on different stem sizes and canopy sizes in the forest were selected to measure transpiration calculated by sap flow in grass and forest grass mixed

once every 10 15 days every 2 h from 6 00 am to 8 00 pm during a day with a skpm1400 british skye cor ltd u k 2 3 evapotranspiration observation etc is the sum of e evaporation and t transpiration t calculated by sap flow of trees was measured by tdp thermal dissipation probes e of bare soil was measured by micro lysimeters interception loss was calculated by using the precipitation gauge in the forest and comparing it with precipitation values from outside the forest etc of crop and grass ecosystems was measured by ventilated chambers as shown in table 1 the ventilated chamber technique for measuring etc from crops reicosky and peters 1977 trees and plantations has demonstrated its utility for application at plot scales greenwood et al 1982 1985a 1985b however the ventilated chambers used in previous studies were not transferable to karst environments because traditional ventilated chambers were non removable therefore we modified the ventilated chambers fig 1 for karst and a patent has been approved for this innovation patent no zl201410756225 x the design features an outlet near the top connected to an aspirator pump by a pvc tube and an inlet hole connected with a pvc tube temperature and humidity sensors were placed inside both the pvc tube inlet and outlet with this etc was calculated using the following empirical equations 1 ah 217 rh 6 1078 e 17 269 ta 237 3 ta

when a tree is transpiring the sap flow will cool the heated probe and decrease the ta d when the sap flow ceases e g at night the ta d will reach its maximum t dm bosch et al 2014 the sap flow can be

sa was the sapwood area of a plant the relationship between sapwood area and dbh diameter at breast height was first determined based on the data of 18 adjacent trees in the surrounding ecosystem area sa 11 9 dbh 82 4 r 2 0 94 n 18 note that the sapwood width was measured by drilling through trees trunk and extracting cores fiora and cescatti 2006 forrester et al 2010 the daily etc mm day 1 of forest grass ecosystem was estimated as 4 etc t sum a et v where t sum kg day 1 is the sum of 6 zenia insigins trees transpiration a m2 is the area including both canopy projected area and inter canopy area covered by the 6 trees and etc is measured by ventilated chamber in the understory of this ecosystem bare soil evaporation was measured using micro lysimeters made of 10 cm outer diameter 20 cm depth pvc cylinders the inner diameter was 9 5 cm boast and robertson 1982 the pvc cylinders were encased by outer cylinders of slightly larger diameter also made from pvc but with the same depth balwinder et al 2014 every cylinder held a soil core that was obtained using a wooden hammer driving it into the soil this was done causing minimum soil disturbance so that the obtained soil core remained as far as possible in the same condition as the surrounding soil allen 1990 three cylinders were set in every ecosystem under grass or crops near the ventilated chamber synchronized with the ventilated chamber operation the cylinders were weighed every two hours from 6 00 am to 8 00 pm 2 4 etc simulation by the pm model the pt model and the sw models the physically based pm model eq 5 is probably the most widely used approach for estimating etc stannard 1993 the pt model is a simplification of penman equation pereira 2004 many types of vegetation have complex canopy structures and soil evaporation can account for a significant proportion of total etc iritz et al 1999 therefore shuttleworth and wallace 1985 developed a two layer modeling scheme in which the evaporation from the canopy and the soil surface are evaluated separately the numerical range for the parameters of pm pt and sw models differed by vegetation and season as shown in tables 2a and 2b however the parameters are not directly measurable and need to be estimated indirectly from other observed data for example r a m s 1 is the aerodynamic resistance between canopy and atmosphere in the water vapor transfer it can be calculated as follow equation allen et al 1994 thom 1968 1972 5 r a ln z d z 0 ln z d z e k 2 μ where μ is wind speed at height z m s 1 k is the von karman constant k 0 41 d is the zero plane displacement height taken as 66 of the plant canopy height h in meters d 0 67 h m z 0 is the movement roughness length z 0 0 13 h m and z e is the roughness length for vapor transport z e 0 1 z 0 m langensiepen et al 2009 another parameter r c m s 1 is the resistance that the canopy opposes to the diffusion of water vapor from inner leaves toward the atmosphere and it is influenced by biological climatological and agronomical variables it is calculated as 6 r c r s lai e where lai e is leaf area index of the leaves effective in transpiration obviously r c m s 1 is determined as a function of daily mean stomatal resistance of the single leaves r s and lai e m2 m 2 it also can be simulated by the following equations dickinson 1984 dickinson et al 1991 sellers et al 1986 7 r c r

photosynthetically active radiation and r min m s 1 and r max m s 1 are minimum and maximum stomatal resistance respectively lai e is effective lai r g mj m 2 d 1 is active radiation that reaches the canopy and r gl mj m 2 d 1 is a limit value of 100 w m 2 for crop or grass the factor f 2 takes into account the effect of the water stress on the surface resistance it varies between 0 and 1 when θ varies between θ w and θ f thompson 1981 10 f 2 1 if θ θ f θ θ w θ f θ w if θ w θ θ f 0 if θ θ w where θ cm3 cm 3 is soil water content θ f cm3 cm 3 is field water capacity θ w cm3 cm 3 is wilting

e a pa are saturation vapor pressure and actual vapor pressure respectively the factor f 4 introduces an air temperature dependence on the surface resistance and it is expressed as dickinson 1984

probability density function pdf by integrating the results of several individual models duan and phillips 2010 according the law of total probability the predictive distribution of variable y the observations y and independent predictions of models m k k 1 2 k can be expressed as follow shahrbanou and moradkhani 2014 13 p y m 1 m i y i 1 k p m i y p y m i y where k is the number of models combined in bma model p y m i y denotes the posterior distribution of y given the model prediction m i and training data y m i denotes the independent prediction of i models m 1 m 2 m i p m i y is the likelihood of model prediction being correct given the observations y during the training period which reflects the performance of model mi in predicting the forecast variable considering that model predictions are time variant eq 13 can be rewritten as 14 p y t m 1 t m 2 t m i t y i 1 k p w i y t m i t y before applying bma bias correction methods must be used to guarantee that the expected values of observed and predicated by every model are equal to each other if model forecasts are biased the bias corrected forecasts f i t should be replaced by original model predictions m i t as follow equation shahrbanou and moradkhani 2014 15 f i t a i b i m i t for computational simplicity the likelihood function is commonly assumed to be a gaussian pdf and is represented as n f i t σ i 2 σ i 2 reflects the uncertainty of the i th model both modeled and observed data must be preprocessed using the one parameter box cox transformation as follows 16 f i t λ f i 1 λ 1 λ λ 0 in f i t λ 0 where f i t is the bias corrected forecast of model i at time t λ is the box cox coefficient f i t λ is the transformed bias corrected forecast of model i at time t the log likelihood function was used to estimate the variance σ i 2 and weight w i of each forecast model setting the vector of parameters as θ w i σ i 2 i 1 2 k then the function of θ can be approximated as follow huang et al 2019 17 l θ log i 1 k w i p y f i y because the analytical solution to maximize the log likelihood function is complex therefore the expectation maximization em algorithm was recommended by raftery et al 2005 it is iterative procedure that updates the weights and variances of posterior distributions by introducing a latent variable z the initial weight and variance for each model are set to w i iter 1 k and σ i iter 2 1 k t 1 t i 1 k y t f i t 2 t as the em algorithm proceeds the parameter vector is updated as follows shahrbanou and moradkhani 2014 18 w i iter 1 t t 1 t z i iter t 19 σ i iter 2 t 1

t is the length of the training period and the iteration process stops until the termination criterion l θ iter l θ iter 1 ε is achieved all other variables are defined the same as in the previous equations to evaluate the performance of the models taylor diagrams were used which are polar style graphs yao et al 2017 taylor diagrams include the centered root mean square error rmse the correlation coefficient r and the standard deviation std between observed and modeled etc in addition the determination efficiency r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were used in model evaluation gupta et al 2009 hartmann et al 2013 these indexes were calculated by the following equations 22 r 2 t 1 n q m t q m q o t q o t 1 n q m t q m 2 t 1 n q o t q o 2 2 23 rmse t 1 n q m t q o

3 results and discussion 3 1 etc dynamics of three agroforestry ecosystems as shown in fig 2 observed daily etc exhibited clear seasonal variation it should be noted that only sunny days were selected to compare etc dynamics ventilated chambers cannot be used during rainy days as they would restrict plant to access water daily etc in the growing period april october averaged 9 8 4 1 mm day 1 mean one standard deviation 5 7 3 3 mm day 1 and 7 2 3 4 mm day 1 for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively this was much higher than in winter november march where the means were 3 26 1 97 mm day 1 1 65 1 17 mm day 1 and 3 06 1 38 mm day 1 for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystems respectively clearly daily etc varied substantially between the different ecosystems overall mean daily etc during the study period was 6 58 4 38 mm day 1 4 18 3 20 mm day 1 and 5 67 3 31 mm day 1 for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively table 3 daily etc in the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem exhibited similar seasonal trends and short term dynamics during the study period however daily etc amounts were significantly different between the three ecosystems fig 2 this reflects the integrated effects of environmental controls plant species and land management methods in our study daily etc of the three ecosystems exhibited similar seasonality as shown in fig 2 similar results have been observed in various climatic zones including cold climates temperate climates tropical systems and arid semi arid regions li et al 2012 parka et al 2008 shao et al 2012 tanaka et al 2008 yang and zhou 2011 potential etc is approximately 1129 3 mm year 1 during study period which is similar with those results in the same bioclimatic zone chen et al 2015a tian et al 2018 yao et al 2014 for example the annual potential etc mainly fell in the range of 950 1350 mm year 1 in the southwestern china during 8 years 2008 2016 tian et al 2018 the annual potential etc calculated by yao et al 2014 during 1982 2010 was between 800 and 1400 mm year 1 in the same zone chen et al 2015a calculated 50 year 1956 2006 actual annual etc for guangdong province which is in the same latitude with the area of our study results showed that actual annual etc was within the scope of 600 1200 mm year 1 previous studies have demonstrated that the seasonality in etc was mainly related to precipitation solar radiation soil water content swc and leaf area index lai parka et al 2008 shao et al 2012 tanaka et al 2008 yang and zhou 2011 in our study three agroforestry ecosystems were located in the same depression and therefore the sites had similar meteorological factors and this was the main control responsible for the similar etc seasonality for three ecosystems however with different vegetation cover soil water and labor control daily etc quantities exhibited differences between the three ecosystems table 3 daily etc was highest in the forest grass mixed ecosystem followed by the grass ecosystem and crop ecosystem this was probably due to differences in plant species having different transpiration rates water use efficiencies and density of conducting tissue e g lai dickinson et al 1991 ge et al 2011 kite 2000 kite and droogers 2000 tanaka et al 2008 specifically the space between crops mainly for maize and soybean is larger than grass to ensure crop growth which leads to smaller lai and less water consumption alkaisi et al 1989 soegaard and boegh 1995 steduto and hsiao 1998 and in the same conditions the transpiration of trees is higher than crops and grass and therefore forest grass mixed ecosystems have higher water demand than grass ecosystem and crop ecosystem at our study site bernhofer 1992 bernhofer and gay 1989 cornish and vertessy 2001 cristiano et al 2015 kumagai et al 2014 sun et al 2008 swift et al 1975 vourlitis et al 2002 3 2 performance of different models as shown in fig 2 the curves of simulated daily etc using the five methods were broadly similar to that of observed daily etc however the performance of each individual model in the growing and non growing seasons showed obvious differences for the three ecosystems as shown in table 3 simulated etc et s by the pm and pt model was lower than et o observed etc during november march but higher than during april october for forest grass mixed and grass ecosystems as for the sw models et s were slightly higher than et o for forest grass mixed ecosystem during the whole study period et s by pm model was lower than et o observed etc during november march but higher than during april october for crop and grass ecosystems however et s by pt and sw models exhibited opposite results for the two ecosystems i e et s was higher than et o during november march but lower during april october for crop and grass ecosystems fig 3a c show the taylor diagrams of the observed daily etc and simulated etc based on the different models for the three agroforestry ecosystems tables 3 and 4 show the relationships between simulated and observed daily etc for different ecosystems as shown in fig 3a and table 4 the bma approach p 0 01 had a greater r 2 0 91 greater nse 0 91 and smaller rmse 1 87 mm day 1 and therefore performed better than other individual models for forest grass mixed ecosystems the sa method and pt model took the second and last place for this ecosystem respectively similarly for the crop and grass ecosystems the bma approach performed better than any other method however the pt model performed more poorly than any other method for the forest grass mixed ecosystem r 2 0 68 nse 0 68 rmse 3 82 mm day 1 and crop ecosystem r 2 0 57 nse 0 35 rmse 2 38 mm day 1 the pm model performed slightly worse than the other methods for the estimates for the grass ecosystem with a smaller r 2 0 84 and nse 0 34 and a higher rmse 3 02 mm day 1 each individual model performed differently for the three agroforestry ecosystems with contrasting strengths and weaknesses table 4 in our study the sw model r 2 0 85 performed better than the pm model r 2 0 72 and the pt model r 2 0 68 for forestry grass mixed ecosystem since grass ecosystem under the trees was affected by the tree coverage and the etc dynamics of grass ecosystem can t be treated synchronously with trees transpiration and canopy evaporation just as the different cover of two types of grass leads to different simulation results of the same model the different bare rock ratio of the surface also leads to different results of the same model as shown in fig 5 the bare rock ratio of forest grass mixed ecosystem was higher than that of the crop and grass systems it means that the rate of surface heterogeneity for forestry grass mixed ecosystem was significantly higher than that of the other two ecosystems therefore one dimensional models may not work out so well for this ecosystem to simulate etc it is well known that the pm and pt models are one dimensional based on aerodynamic theory and energy balance penman 1948 and they are applied to the whole area as if all vegetation is a single big leaf therefore canopy resistance is a major control of the pm and pt models as a result the complex nature of the canopy and underlying soil of the forest grass mixed ecosystem is not consistent with the big leaf assumption stannard 1993 therefore the sw model performed better than the pm and pt models in forest grass mixed ecosystem for the crop ecosystem the crop rotation maize soybean and sweet potato leads to high variability of stomatal resistance over the course of the year consequently simulated values of canopy resistance r c and canopy surface resistance r might be imprecise irmak et al 2013 whitley et al 2009 in other words the values of a calibrated α parameter for the crop ecosystem were more imprecise than for the grass and forest grass mixed ecosystems therefore the pt model did not perform as well as the other two models for the crop ecosystem table 4 compared with forest grass mixed ecosystem and the crop ecosystem the vegetation in the grass ecosystem was more homogenous only grass and the soil depth sd was thicker than other two ecosystems li et al 2013 2016 zhou et al 2007 consequently the models performed equally well table 4 r 2 0 84 for this ecosystem similar results have been reported in previous studies for example zhang et al 2008 found significant differences in etc estimation for a vineyard located in an arid area of northwest china between the pm and sw models the differences in model performances may be related to drought stress from low soil moisture and variations in lai burba and verma 2005 the difference in lai can lead to different proportions of soil evaporation which determines whether evaporation can be neglected in models and it has substantial effects on simulation accuracy fisher et al 2005 3 3 contribution of each individual model to bma model as shown in fig 4a simulated daily etc by the sw model made the highest percentage contribution 51 5 to the bma approach for the forest grass mixed ecosystem for this ecosystem etc simulated by the pm model and pt model only accounted for 27 3 and 21 2 of the total respectively similarly the sw model made the largest contribution to the bma approach for crop ecosystem fig 4b and grass ecosystem fig 4c however compared to the forest grass mixed ecosystem the contribution reduced to 42 4 and 36 4 for the crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively the pt model 33 3 ranks slightly ahead of the pm model 30 3 in the bma approach for the grass ecosystem in the bma model the contributions of single models differed for forest grass mixed ecosystem and this underlines its superiority compared to sa method each individual model exhibited uncertainties in our study for example as shown in table 3 models would overestimate or underestimate etc in different seasons for the three agroforestry ecosystems similar results have been reported in previous research for example zhang et al 2008 found the pm model significantly overestimated etc over a vineyard located in an arid area northwest china a possible explanation for over or under estimation might be that the parameterization of canopy resistance in the models is unequal to the actual surface resistance which is an integration of canopy and soil surface resistances stannard 1993 another explanation for model underestimation of etc by might be related to uncertainty in model parameters such as r min minimum stomatal resistance for example the r min values can differ for vineyards 146 s m 1 in northwest china and for maize crop 252 s m 1 in north italy gharsallah et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 moreover in managed landscapes models do not capture the interference of labor management such as un scheduled cutting weeding and soil plowing which can greatly affect lai and soil surface resistance yang et al 2017 consequently the advantages of the multi model ensemble approaches i e bma and sa can help minimize some of these problems and generally perform better than individual models chen et al 2015b ershadi et al 2014 yao et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 in our study the sa and bma approaches successfully improved the estimation of etc for all three agroforestry ecosystems with increased nse r 2 and decreased rmse table 4 compared to individual models similar results were found in previous studies chen et al 2015b ershadi et al 2014 zhu et al 2016 in general the performance of multi model ensemble approaches depend on the success of individual models vrugt and robinson 2007 however estimation by individual models often resulted in a significant bias as a result of intrinsic uncertainties specific to each model hoeting et al 1999 parrish et al 2012 raftery et al 2005 in contrast multi model ensemble approaches reduced model uncertainties by weakening the bias of individual models hoeting et al 1999 parrish et al 2012 raftery et al 2005 we also found that bma approach performed slightly better than sa approach for crop and forest grass mixed ecosystem but the models showed similar performance in the grass ecosystem similar results have been reported in previous studies barnes et al 2003 diks and vrugt 2010 raftery et al 2005 vrugt and robinson 2007 zhu et al 2016 for example barnes et al 2003 found that a bma approach produced more accurate estimation of etc than a sa approach as did zhu et al 2016 who reported that the bma approach performed better than sa approach for etc prediction across north china this reflects the flexibility of the bma approach in weighing the likelihood of individual models which perform best whereas the sa approach neglects this through averaging raftery et al 2005 for example in our study the sw model performed best among three individual models for the forest grass mixed ecosystem in our study and the weight fig 4 of sw model in bma approach 51 5 was higher than that in sa approach 33 3 but for the grass ecosystem the performances of three individual models were similar pm r 2 0 84 pt r 2 0 85 sw r 2 0 85 consequently bma and sa approach exhibited similar performances for estimation of etc estimation in the grass ecosystem according to the results of our study each model will show the advantages and disadvantages depending on the type of cover and growth stage therefore if we want to simulate a larger scale of etc we can redistrict a watershed according vegetation types firstly we will build several single models for a single vegetation type secondly build multiple models such as bma model to get a simulation result for every single vegetation in the end combine every single vegetation type to produce an overall simulation of etc of a watershed 4 conclusions in this study three individual models pm pt and sw were integrated by two multi model ensemble approaches bma and sa to improve accuracy of etc for three agroforestry ecosystems forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystems in a humid subtropical karst region results show that the magnitude of daily etc varies depending on prevailing environmental controls including growing stages of crops plant species and crop management methods the individual models show different strengths for different ecosystems which could be attributed to differences in the underlying landscape surface characteristics such as lai vegetation composition and rock coverage two multi model ensemble approaches performed better than any individual model most likely because multi model ensemble approaches reduce model uncertainties by weakening the bias of individual models it is recommended that multi model ensemble approaches be used for estimation of evapotranspiration from vegetation in complex terrain areas declaration of competing interest the

9286,soil water deficit in apple orchards is a common phenomenon related to land degradation on the loess plateau however little is known regarding the degree of soil water depletion and its effects on orchard productivity in rainfed apple orchards we used a combination of field sampling and modeling to understand the impact of apple orchards on soil water availability and changes in orchard productivity over a long term time series a total of 51 soil profiles from eight experimental sites in the loess plateau were collected in 2010 and 2016 and modeling was used to evaluate the long term effects of apple plantations on soil water depletion and orchard productivity a process based model the environmental policy integrated climate epic was calibrated and validated using survey data from field experiments the calibrated epic model could well simulate soil moisture and orchard productivity with relative root mean square errors rrmse of 11 12 and 2 71 respectively field sampling and modeling showed that conversion from farmlands to orchards decreased soil moisture leading to severe soil water depletion swd in the 0 15 0 m soil profiles stand age was the main factor influencing soil moisture and swd gradually increased with increasing stand age depleted soil water led to land degradation and decreased orchard productivity especially in water limited regions simulation results suggested that the optimal planting density and fertilizer application rates were often related to variability in climatic conditions therefore appropriate management practices need to be adapted to local natural conditions although swd in apple orchards is inevitable the detrimental effects could be minimized during orchard development provided that appropriate management measures are selected based on precipitation and soil water conditions these findings may provide a basis for evaluating the extent of swd and its effect on orchard productivity in dryland apple orchards keywords soil water depletion orchard productivity epic model apple orchards rainfed ecosystems data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the loess plateau is the largest apple producing belt in china because of its unique natural conditions including soil texture abundant sunshine and large day night temperature variation cao et al 2012 zhang et al 2021 since the 1980s farmlands have been converted to apple orchards because of their higher economic benefits however the water consumption of orchards with deep rooted apple trees is much higher than that of farmlands song et al 2018 the annual precipitation in apple producing areas of the loess plateau is only 400 650 mm zhang et al 2021 significantly lower than the actual evapotranspiration in apple orchards zhang et al 2020 in addition more than 80 of apple orchards are dryland orchards where precipitation is the main source of soil water because irrigation conditions are not met cao et al 2012 therefore annual precipitation and water stored in soil profiles are critical water resources to support plant growth affecting regional productivity long term contradictions between the supply and demand of soil moisture accelerate soil water consumption aggravating soil water deficits in dryland orchards wang and wang 2018 however unreasonable management measures can also accelerate swd suo et al 2016 most studies carried out in fields and small catchments failed to provide sufficient information on swd at a regional scale few studies have explored the impact of soil water deficits on the water productivity of economic forests such as apple orchards in rainfed ecosystems soil water deficit a phenomenon of soil degradation poses severe problem affecting agricultural land productivity huang et al 2016 liu et al 2020 the most direct manifestation of swd is the reduction in soil water availability implying decreased soil water that plants can extract chen et al 2008b water availability is the dominant driver limiting ecosystem productivity in many environments especially semiarid ecosystems mendham et al 2011 liu et al 2020 panzacchi et al 2012 also revealed that the soil water availability affects the primary productivity of apple trees generally swd weaken the regulation of interannual and seasonal droughts by soil reservoirs resulting in large fluctuations in water productivity with natural changes in rainfall in dryland ecosystems bossio et al 2010 guo et al 2016 soil water deficits also reduce the infiltration depth of precipitation and damage the soil structure reducing soil porosity bossio et al 2010 leading to the degradation of soil quality and poor vegetation growth wang et al 2018 therefore swd affects growth and yield stability posing potential threat to the sustainable development of agricultural production in water limited regions chen et al 2008a li et al 2018 consequently there is considerable interest in understanding the adverse impacts of swd on dryland apple orchard systems although results of field experiments on swd and orchard productivity of apple orchards have been reported huang et al 2018 2021 li et al 2019 we still lack adequate information on the degree of swd and dynamic variations in orchard productivity at the regional scale moreover there is limited information on the long term effect of swd on orchard productivity in rainfed agroecosystems generally to explore the potential negative impacts of swd on ecosystem productivity more experimental data is needed however the prohibitive cost of performing multilevel and long term field experiments limits the availability of adequate data nevertheless some studies have demonstrated that a process based model allows researchers to evaluate the long term effects of management practice changes on soil water status and ecosystem productivity mendham et al 2011 wang et al 2012 turkeltaub et al 2018 the environmental policy integrated climate epic model one of the most popular and reliable models has been calibrated for many environmental conditions worldwide therond et al 2011 xiong et al 2014 yang et al 2019 the epic model has been used extensively to explore the impact of management practices on soil water dynamics and evaluate the impacts of soil water availability on ecosystem productivity costantini et al 2002 chavas et al 2009 gaiser et al 2010 wang et al 2019 several experiments have been conducted on the loess plateau to explore the effects of planting density and fertilizer application rate on the trade off between swd and productivity in apple orchards guo et al 2016 2021 peng et al 2017 ultimately a better understanding of how climatic and soil factors are combined to alter the orchard response to swd will allow more detailed predictions of which areas of the loess plateau are most vulnerable to climate change however optimal management practices vary widely due to annual rainfall variability and the orchard productivity response is often site specific therefore in this study we selected the major apple producing areas on the loess plateau to 1 study the extent of swd in the deep soil profile in different climatic regions 2 evaluate the effect of swd on orchard productivity in dryland orchards and 3 investigate the response characteristics and appropriate management practices of orchard productivity in drylands in different climatic regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area was on the loess plateau 35 41 n 102 114 e which lies in northern china covering approximately 630 000 km2 with an elevation ranging from 200 to 3000 m the loess paleosol deposits are deep ranging from 30 to 80 m shi and shao 2000 the climate is temperate continental monsoon with annual average temperatures of 3 6 c and 14 3 c in the northwest and southeast respectively and annual evaporation of 1400 2000 mm wang et al 2011 rainfall in this area is largely seasonal and highly variable from year to year with mean annual rainfall between 150 mm and 800 mm over 60 of which falls from june to september wang et al 2010 2 2 study methods and soil sampling two rolling surveys covering the major apple producing areas were conducted soil sampling locations are shown in fig 1 a total of 51 soil profiles were collected from eight experimental sites in july 2010 and 2016 information regarding the eight study sites is shown in table 1 apple trees fuji can extract soil water from deep profiles because of their deep roots wu et al 2021 therefore soil sampling was conducted to a depth of 15 0 m to investigate swd in the deep soil layers to evaluate the soil water consumption of apple orchards soil samples from farmlands ck were also collected at every experimental site such land use types did not cause swd in the study area because of the relatively low evapotranspiration of crops maize or wheat wang et al 2011 soil samples were obtained using a hand soil drill 5 cm in diameter at a random location in the center of an area bordered by four trees in each apple orchard soil samples were collected in 0 2 m increments from 0 to 15 0 m sealed in airtight aluminum cylinders and brought to the laboratory for soil water condition analyses simultaneously surveys of stand age planting area fertilization economic benefit fruit yield and other field management aspects were conducted the annual n p and k fertilizer inputs were 500 650 250 350 and 300 400 kg ha 1 respectively with approximately 30 40 and 30 of fertilizers applied before tillage in april july and october respectively crop weeds pests and diseases were controlled with registered pesticides irrigation was not applied throughout the year 2 3 soil analysis the soil moisture was determined using the gravimetric method soil water storage sws available soil water storage asws and soil water depletion swd were calculated using the following equations cao et al 2012 sws mm i 1 n sm i d i h

epic model was developed by the usda united states department of agriculture to assess how agricultural activities affect the status of soil and water resources williams 1990 1995 the model is continuously updated and version 3060 was used in this study the epic model runs continuously with a daily time step and can be employed to simulate long term dynamic changes in soil water nutrient utilization and crop productivity among different scenarios therond et al 2011 the epic model is composed of eight major sub models including modules for weather generators soil water dynamics and hydrology erosion by wind and water nutrient and carbon cycling soil temperature tillage crop growth and crop and soil management gaiser et al 2010 xiong et al 2014 the model offers options for simulating yields with inter alia different potential evapotranspiration equations allowing reasonable model applications in distinct natural areas balkovič et al 2013 in the crop growth routine daily biomass was determined by the radiation use efficiency and reduction factors for moisture and temperature stress crop yield was calculated as a proportion of the economic yield over the total actual aboveground biomass at maturity defined by a harvest index xiong et al 2014 the model was used to optimize crop management practices ko et al 2009 therond et al 2011 xiong et al 2014 yang et al 2019 and to evaluate the effects of environmental factors on agricultural production worldwide tan and shibasaki 2003 chavas et al 2009 reidsma et al 2009 angulo et al 2013 our team calibrated and validated the epic model on the loess plateau and used it to investigate the soil water dynamics and water productivity among different management practices in this region wang and li 2010 wang et al 2012 peng et al 2017 2 4 2 model calibration and validation the calibration of the epic model aimed to obtain reasonable estimates of the model parameters by comparing simulated and observed values the model was calibrated using a dataset from field experiments conducted on the loess plateau the selected experimental sites contained sufficient information regarding meteorological data soil conditions and crop management the yield data and soil moisture collected from long term experimental sites were selected to calibrate the epic model a detailed description of the input parameters used in the model is presented in table 2 the epic performance was evaluated by comparing soil moisture and fruit yield from field experiments with simulated values the epic output data for the measured values were assessed using the root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse model efficiency me relative error re and coefficient of determination r2 these indicators were computed as follows wang et al 2019 rmse 1 n i 1 n si oi 2 rrmse rmse 1 n i 1 n oi 100 me 1 i 1 n si oi 2 i 1 n si 0 2 re 1 n i 1 n si oi oi 100 r 2 i 1 n oi o si s 2 i 1 n oi o 2 i 1 n si s 2 where si and oi are the simulated and observed values and s and o are the average simulated and observed values respectively the re rmse and rrmse were used to measure the differences between the observed and simulated values re and rmse values close to zero expresses a perfect agreement between simulated and observed values yang et al 2019 the simulation results were considered excellent good fair or poor when the rrmse value was 10 10 20 20 30 or 30 respectively yang et al 2019 the agreement between simulated and measured values was considered acceptable if r2 0 5 me and r2 close to 1 indicate a good fit between simulated and measured values gaiser et al 2010 2 5 model application and apple orchards management scenarios the validated model was used to assess the long term effects of orchard management scenarios on the soil water status and orchard productivity of rainfed apple orchards at eight different experimental sites scenario 1 and different management practices scenario 2 table 3 in two different climatic regions on the loess plateau fig 1 different climatic regions were divided based on precipitation isolines wan et al 2014 in this study fx fengxiang lc luochuan cw changwu and bs baishui represented the semihumid region while ya yan an xf xifeng jn jingning and mz mizhi were the semiarid region in the present study we chose luochuan lc and yan an ya as representative semihumid and semiarid regions in scenario 2 the weather datasets contained the daily minimum and maximum temperatures daily rainfall wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation from 1965 to 2009 data were compiled from the national meteorological database http data cma cn the meteorological station covers an area of a 5 20 km radius around the experiment field 2 6 statistical analysis two way analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate differences in swd and orchard productivity between different management practices and climatic regions once the swd and orchard productivity of the different experimental sites were compared one way anova followed by duncan s multiple range test was applied all data were analyzed using the ibm spss statistical software package version 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa followed by the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 regression analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between swd and orchard productivity furthermore redundancy analysis rda was performed to evaluate the effects of climate soil properties and management factors on the swd and orchard productivity using the canoco v 5 0 ithaca ny usa figures were generated using origin software v pro 2019 originlab corp northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 field experiment 3 1 1 soil water depletion of apple orchards fig 2 shows the process of soil water dynamics after land use changes in dryland ecosystems the vertical distribution of soil moisture at different experimental sites is shown in fig 3 in our study stand age had a significant impact on swd figs 3 and 4a the highest value in the measurement sequence was recorded in farmlands followed by young orchards after ten years of growth the water absorbed by apple trees extended to a depth of more than 7 0 m and the soil profile showed a marked and sustained reduction in soil water when apple trees are grown for 20 years their roots can extract soil water from a depth of 15 0 m they could extract water at the full depth 15 0 m measured in apple orchards still soil moisture patterns differed across climatic regions fig 3 there was a greater drawdown in the soil water in water limited areas soil moisture at shallow depths 0 2 0 m in aging orchards was replenished by rainfall but there was still a serious soil water deficit below 2 0 m at each site after ten years the soil moisture within the 2 0 15 0 m profile was below the stable field capacity a threshold for soil desiccation which created strong water stress for apple tree growth the conversion from farmlands to apple orchards resulted in apple trees depleting soil moisture by approximately 600 mm to meet the demand for evapotranspiration at depths from 0 to 15 0 m 3 1 2 impacts of swd on the orchard productivity to explore the impact of swd on the productivity of dryland apple orchards we investigated the yield of 40 apple orchards with different stand ages in the dominant apple producing areas of the loess plateau the relationship between swd and fruit yield was examined using regression and redundancy analyses figs 4b and 5 swd had a significant impact on the orchard productivity the orchard productivity was also significantly positively correlated with the mean annual precipitation and temperature fertilizer application rates soil bulk density planting density and stand age however orchard productivity showed significant negative correlations with the altitude soil moisture and asws at 5 0 15 0 m soil depth 3 2 model simulation performance 3 2 1 model calibration the default and calibrated parameters of the epic model are listed in table 2 the soil moisture was used to calibrate the model performance and our results showed the goodness of fit indicators for the comparisons fig 6c and table 4 after calibrating soil moisture data collected from the four long term experimental sites were used to validate the fruit yield the r2 rmse rrmse me and re for fruit yield were 0 9051 1 36 mg ha 1 3 82 0 85 and 3 99 respectively these results show a close agreement between the measured and simulated fruit yields 3 2 2 model validation the calibrated epic model was further validated using field data from our experimental sites that were not used in the calibration process the simulated soil moisture and fruit yield of the apple orchards were consistent with the measured values the rmse values of soil moisture and fruit yield were 1 74 and 1 20 mg ha 1 for the four experimental sites and rrmse values were 11 12 and 2 71 respectively table 4 in addition the r2 me and re for soil moisture were 0 9184 0 84 and 9 95 and 0 8883 0 85 and 3 70 for fruit yield respectively fig 6b and d table 4 these results indicated that the epic model could simulate the soil moisture and fruit yield of apple orchards in the dryland agroecosystem 3 3 model application scenario 3 3 1 scenario simulation 1 long term simulation at different experimental sites after calibration and validation the epic model was used to evaluate soil water and orchard productivity at different experimental sites in rainfed agroecosystems 3 3 1 1 orchard productivity and soil water under different experimental sites using historical weather data simulations performed from 1965 to 2009 showed that the simulated values fluctuated yearly fig 7 the simulated fruit yield and water use efficiency of the different experimental sites exhibit fluctuate decreased trend with increasing stand age the asws significantly decreased before 15 years and remained stable or slightly changed after 15 years simulated swd showed the opposite trend with asws under long term simulation the simulated fruit yield asws and swd reached a significant level among different experimental sites and higher fruit yield and lower swd were recorded in areas with sufficient rainfall p 0 05 however no significant differences were detected in water use efficiency fig 8 3 3 1 2 simulated soil moisture distribution the vertical trend of simulated soil moisture in the 0 15 0 m soil layers was consistent with our sampling values which decreased with increasing stand age figs 3 and 9 in addition the soil moisture of the mature orchards 15 years was close to the wilting point in both experimental methods however the water consumption depths were different the field sampling value showed that apple trees could extract the soil water below 15 0 m however the maximum depth in the simulation experiment was limited to 12 0 m the soil water consumption rate in areas with limited rainfall was higher than in areas with sufficient precipitation fig 9 3 3 2 scenario simulation 2 long term simulation of different management practices the calibrated model was used to evaluate the long term 1965 2009 impact of different management practices different planting densities and fertilizer application rates on soil water and orchard productivity of apple orchards under different climatic regions in the present study we chose luochuan lc and yan an ya as representative semihumid and semiarid regions 3 3 2 1 orchard productivity and soil water under different management practices orchard productivity and soil water under different management practices different planting densities and fertilizer application rates were simulated in our study figs 10 and 11 different climatic regions responded differently to the management practices of apple orchards the long term simulated fruit yield and water use efficiency revealed a parabolic relationship with increasing planting density the highest average values were recorded in d3 in the semihumid region and d2 in the semiarid region although simulated swd increased with increasing density there were no significant differences between different planting densities simulated asws showed the opposite trend with swd under long term simulation simulated fruit yield asws and swd showed a significant response to the fertilizer application rate at both sites p 0 05 fig 11 the long term simulated fruit yield and water use efficiency exhibited a parabolic relationship with increasing fertilizer application rates the highest average values were recorded in f3 in the semihumid region and f2 in the semiarid region although swd tended to increase with increasing fertilizer application rates in apple orchards the asws showed a decreasing trend 3 3 2 2 simulated soil moisture distribution under different management practices soil moisture distributions in the 0 15 0 m soil layers of different management practices were simulated in our study figs 12 and 13 as planting density and fertilizer application rate increased soil moisture decreased in both climatic regions treatments with higher planting density and fertilizer application rate depleted soil moisture faster and earlier during apple orchard development still there were no significant effects on soil moisture after 15 years i e in luochuan 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of the epic model the epic model reasonably predicted soil water status and orchard productivity on the loess plateau fig 6 and table 4 differences between simulated and observed values of soil moisture and orchard productivity across the main apple producing regions were within acceptable ranges rrmses for soil moisture and fruit yield were 11 12 and 2 71 respectively previous studies also suggested that the epic model could accurately predict the soil water regime and crop productivity under different management practices worldwide gaiser et al 2010 wang et al 2012 balkovič et al 2013 xiong et al 2014 although the simulated soil moisture was relatively good over the whole soil depth rmse rrmse r2 me and re were 1 89 20 01 0 8981 0 68 and 11 21 respectively the model could not accurately reflect the soil moisture in deep soil layers in our study the apple trees can extract soil water from layers below 15 0 m in field experiments but the simulated depth was limited to 12 0 m figs 3 and 9 revealing the model limitations in simulating the soil water in deep soil layers this discrepancy was mainly attributed to the epic model water uptake method which did not consider root morphological parameters it is assumed that water is preferentially used from topsoil layers and the potential water supply rate decreases exponentially downward costantini et al 2002 camargo and kemanian 2016 markewitz et al 2010 also demonstrated that soil moisture depletion in deep soil was not well predicted when plant roots were below 5 0 m in the amazon although these defects might lead to differences between simulated and measured results the simulation still reflects soil water dynamics and orchard productivity under different management practices thus providing a scientific basis for optimizing orchard management in addition the model parameters should be further modified to more accurately simulate soil moisture in deep soil layers and the effects of deep soil desiccation on crop productivity in the future 4 2 soil water depletion of apple orchards a soil water deficit results from an imbalance between the supply and demand of soil moisture wang et al 2011 field sampling and simulation results showed a marked decrease in soil moisture after the conversion of farmlands to apple orchards figs 3 and 9 with previous studies reporting similar results huang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2021 this was mainly related to the plant type change that followed the land use type change generally soil water extraction is strongly controlled by the plant rooting systems li et al 2019 deep rooted apple trees can extract soil water in deep profiles when local precipitation cannot meet the water demand of apple tree growth ultimately resulting in soil water loss in deep soil zhang et al 2018 in addition the plantation age of apple orchards significantly affected soil moisture in the vertical profile the profile soil moisture showed a significant reduction after ten years and the soil water within the profile from 2 0 to 15 0 m was below the stable field capacity leading to soil desiccation and consequent strong water stress for apple trees li and huang 2008 li et al 2019 showed that the increase in water consumption in apple orchards was mainly due to increased root depth and biomass with increasing stand age hence increasing stand age leads to excessive soil water consumption and swd in deep soil layers of dryland orchards apple orchards can extract water from soil depths of up to 15 0 m and the consumption rate is faster in water limited areas this is attributed to the lower precipitation which cannot meet the water demand for apple tree growth in water limited areas wang et al 2011 moreover once the soil water deficit in apple orchards reaches a severe degree it results in soil quality degradation and poor vegetation growth which is unsuitable for developing long term apple production suggesting that swd poses greater potential risks to the sustainable development of the apple industry farmers and local governments should pay more attention to dryland agroecosystems 4 3 effect of swd on orchard productivity and its mitigation strategies the most direct result of swd is a decline in soil quality leading to land degradation bossio et al 2010 the main result of land degradation is reduced agricultural productivity leta and iticha 2018 field and simulated experimental results demonstrated that swd had significant effects on the fruit yield of apple orchards figs 4 and 5 previous results have also revealed that soil water availability dominates ecosystem productivity globally especially in water limited regions panzacchi et al 2012 liu et al 2020 in this study we used historical weather data from 1965 to 2009 as possible weather scenarios to forecast soil water and orchard productivity in the loess plateau the simulated orchard productivity gradually decreased with increasing stand age whereas the swd increased with increasing stand age and remained stable or changed slightly after 15 years fig 7 one possible explanation is that apple trees depleted the available soil water stored in the soil profile after growing for 15 years swd significantly reduces sws and the ability of soil reservoirs to supply water to the deep soil layer for plant growth li and huang 2008 it is difficult for rainwater to penetrate the dried soil layer with severe soil desiccation robinson et al 2006 chen et al 2008b therefore deep swd becomes an isolated strip for water transfer and separates the approach for groundwater supply from rainfall infiltration which intensifies the water cycle in the soil plant atmosphere continuum on a small scale wang et al 2011 affecting the growth of plants and reducing ecosystem productivity soil water deficit has evident negative effects on soil water conditions often cuts off the water pathway to supplement groundwater dramatically influencing the growth of apple trees and ecosystem productivity and heavily affecting the long term sustainable development of rainfed agroecosystems however if appropriate management measures are implemented based on rainfall and soil water conditions and the control of plant growth and productivity are coupled with soil water conservation measures the adverse effects of soil water deficit could be reduced during the orchard management process chen et al 2008b the density and fertilizer application rate of apple orchards should be tuned according to soil water conditions our results showed that feasible planting densities and fertilization rates were higher in regions with sufficient rainfall than in water limited regions fig s 10 and 11 suo et al 2019 also suggested that timely thinning tending measures and quantitative supplementary irrigation effectively increased the water supply of fruit trees ultimately reducing the soil water deficit and fueling the stable production capacity of apple orchards in addition many new orchard management techniques can effectively reduce soil desiccation for instance living mulches can reduce water loss and evaporation increasing sws suo et al 2019 in addition ridge mulching and rain harvesting measures can reduce evaporation between plants and soil storage song et al 2018 in recent years the apple producing areas of the loess plateau are promoting a low rootstock dense planting approach to replace the traditional apple cultivation model which is expected to reduce the water consumption of fruit trees therefore in orchard management it is necessary to use the abovementioned appropriate management measures to reduce the extent of soil desiccation and land degradation to achieve sustainable development of apple orchards in rainfed ecosystems 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the extent of soil water and orchard productivity in apple orchards on the loess plateau sampling data and modeling results demonstrated that changing land use from farmlands to orchards decreased the soil moisture in the 0 15 0 m soil profiles leading to severe swd in apple orchards the stand age was the dominant driving force for the different soil moisture dynamics in the vertical profiles swd deteriorated soil quality and decreased orchard productivity in apple orchards in dryland ecosystems the field survey and epic model simulation results suggested that swd and orchard productivity are sensitive to climatic conditions appropriate planting density and fertilization rates should be controlled at a lower level in water limited regions however if appropriate management measures are selected based on precipitation and soil water conditions the detrimental effects of swd could be minimized during orchard management the results obtained from this study are important for the sustainable utilization of limited water resources evaluation of soil water deficit scientific management of arable land

9286,soil water deficit in apple orchards is a common phenomenon related to land degradation on the loess plateau however little is known regarding the degree of soil water depletion and its effects on orchard productivity in rainfed apple orchards we used a combination of field sampling and modeling to understand the impact of apple orchards on soil water availability and changes in orchard productivity over a long term time series a total of 51 soil profiles from eight experimental sites in the loess plateau were collected in 2010 and 2016 and modeling was used to evaluate the long term effects of apple plantations on soil water depletion and orchard productivity a process based model the environmental policy integrated climate epic was calibrated and validated using survey data from field experiments the calibrated epic model could well simulate soil moisture and orchard productivity with relative root mean square errors rrmse of 11 12 and 2 71 respectively field sampling and modeling showed that conversion from farmlands to orchards decreased soil moisture leading to severe soil water depletion swd in the 0 15 0 m soil profiles stand age was the main factor influencing soil moisture and swd gradually increased with increasing stand age depleted soil water led to land degradation and decreased orchard productivity especially in water limited regions simulation results suggested that the optimal planting density and fertilizer application rates were often related to variability in climatic conditions therefore appropriate management practices need to be adapted to local natural conditions although swd in apple orchards is inevitable the detrimental effects could be minimized during orchard development provided that appropriate management measures are selected based on precipitation and soil water conditions these findings may provide a basis for evaluating the extent of swd and its effect on orchard productivity in dryland apple orchards keywords soil water depletion orchard productivity epic model apple orchards rainfed ecosystems data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the loess plateau is the largest apple producing belt in china because of its unique natural conditions including soil texture abundant sunshine and large day night temperature variation cao et al 2012 zhang et al 2021 since the 1980s farmlands have been converted to apple orchards because of their higher economic benefits however the water consumption of orchards with deep rooted apple trees is much higher than that of farmlands song et al 2018 the annual precipitation in apple producing areas of the loess plateau is only 400 650 mm zhang et al 2021 significantly lower than the actual evapotranspiration in apple orchards zhang et al 2020 in addition more than 80 of apple orchards are dryland orchards where precipitation is the main source of soil water because irrigation conditions are not met cao et al 2012 therefore annual precipitation and water stored in soil profiles are critical water resources to support plant growth affecting regional productivity long term contradictions between the supply and demand of soil moisture accelerate soil water consumption aggravating soil water deficits in dryland orchards wang and wang 2018 however unreasonable management measures can also accelerate swd suo et al 2016 most studies carried out in fields and small catchments failed to provide sufficient information on swd at a regional scale few studies have explored the impact of soil water deficits on the water productivity of economic forests such as apple orchards in rainfed ecosystems soil water deficit a phenomenon of soil degradation poses severe problem affecting agricultural land productivity huang et al 2016 liu et al 2020 the most direct manifestation of swd is the reduction in soil water availability implying decreased soil water that plants can extract chen et al 2008b water availability is the dominant driver limiting ecosystem productivity in many environments especially semiarid ecosystems mendham et al 2011 liu et al 2020 panzacchi et al 2012 also revealed that the soil water availability affects the primary productivity of apple trees generally swd weaken the regulation of interannual and seasonal droughts by soil reservoirs resulting in large fluctuations in water productivity with natural changes in rainfall in dryland ecosystems bossio et al 2010 guo et al 2016 soil water deficits also reduce the infiltration depth of precipitation and damage the soil structure reducing soil porosity bossio et al 2010 leading to the degradation of soil quality and poor vegetation growth wang et al 2018 therefore swd affects growth and yield stability posing potential threat to the sustainable development of agricultural production in water limited regions chen et al 2008a li et al 2018 consequently there is considerable interest in understanding the adverse impacts of swd on dryland apple orchard systems although results of field experiments on swd and orchard productivity of apple orchards have been reported huang et al 2018 2021 li et al 2019 we still lack adequate information on the degree of swd and dynamic variations in orchard productivity at the regional scale moreover there is limited information on the long term effect of swd on orchard productivity in rainfed agroecosystems generally to explore the potential negative impacts of swd on ecosystem productivity more experimental data is needed however the prohibitive cost of performing multilevel and long term field experiments limits the availability of adequate data nevertheless some studies have demonstrated that a process based model allows researchers to evaluate the long term effects of management practice changes on soil water status and ecosystem productivity mendham et al 2011 wang et al 2012 turkeltaub et al 2018 the environmental policy integrated climate epic model one of the most popular and reliable models has been calibrated for many environmental conditions worldwide therond et al 2011 xiong et al 2014 yang et al 2019 the epic model has been used extensively to explore the impact of management practices on soil water dynamics and evaluate the impacts of soil water availability on ecosystem productivity costantini et al 2002 chavas et al 2009 gaiser et al 2010 wang et al 2019 several experiments have been conducted on the loess plateau to explore the effects of planting density and fertilizer application rate on the trade off between swd and productivity in apple orchards guo et al 2016 2021 peng et al 2017 ultimately a better understanding of how climatic and soil factors are combined to alter the orchard response to swd will allow more detailed predictions of which areas of the loess plateau are most vulnerable to climate change however optimal management practices vary widely due to annual rainfall variability and the orchard productivity response is often site specific therefore in this study we selected the major apple producing areas on the loess plateau to 1 study the extent of swd in the deep soil profile in different climatic regions 2 evaluate the effect of swd on orchard productivity in dryland orchards and 3 investigate the response characteristics and appropriate management practices of orchard productivity in drylands in different climatic regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area was on the loess plateau 35 41 n 102 114 e which lies in northern china covering approximately 630 000 km2 with an elevation ranging from 200 to 3000 m the loess paleosol deposits are deep ranging from 30 to 80 m shi and shao 2000 the climate is temperate continental monsoon with annual average temperatures of 3 6 c and 14 3 c in the northwest and southeast respectively and annual evaporation of 1400 2000 mm wang et al 2011 rainfall in this area is largely seasonal and highly variable from year to year with mean annual rainfall between 150 mm and 800 mm over 60 of which falls from june to september wang et al 2010 2 2 study methods and soil sampling two rolling surveys covering the major apple producing areas were conducted soil sampling locations are shown in fig 1 a total of 51 soil profiles were collected from eight experimental sites in july 2010 and 2016 information regarding the eight study sites is shown in table 1 apple trees fuji can extract soil water from deep profiles because of their deep roots wu et al 2021 therefore soil sampling was conducted to a depth of 15 0 m to investigate swd in the deep soil layers to evaluate the soil water consumption of apple orchards soil samples from farmlands ck were also collected at every experimental site such land use types did not cause swd in the study area because of the relatively low evapotranspiration of crops maize or wheat wang et al 2011 soil samples were obtained using a hand soil drill 5 cm in diameter at a random location in the center of an area bordered by four trees in each apple orchard soil samples were collected in 0 2 m increments from 0 to 15 0 m sealed in airtight aluminum cylinders and brought to the laboratory for soil water condition analyses simultaneously surveys of stand age planting area fertilization economic benefit fruit yield and other field management aspects were conducted the annual n p and k fertilizer inputs were 500 650 250 350 and 300 400 kg ha 1 respectively with approximately 30 40 and 30 of fertilizers applied before tillage in april july and october respectively crop weeds pests and diseases were controlled with registered pesticides irrigation was not applied throughout the year 2 3 soil analysis the soil moisture was determined using the gravimetric method soil water storage sws available soil water storage asws and soil water depletion swd were calculated using the following equations cao et al 2012 sws mm i 1 n sm i d i h

epic model was developed by the usda united states department of agriculture to assess how agricultural activities affect the status of soil and water resources williams 1990 1995 the model is continuously updated and version 3060 was used in this study the epic model runs continuously with a daily time step and can be employed to simulate long term dynamic changes in soil water nutrient utilization and crop productivity among different scenarios therond et al 2011 the epic model is composed of eight major sub models including modules for weather generators soil water dynamics and hydrology erosion by wind and water nutrient and carbon cycling soil temperature tillage crop growth and crop and soil management gaiser et al 2010 xiong et al 2014 the model offers options for simulating yields with inter alia different potential evapotranspiration equations allowing reasonable model applications in distinct natural areas balkovič et al 2013 in the crop growth routine daily biomass was determined by the radiation use efficiency and reduction factors for moisture and temperature stress crop yield was calculated as a proportion of the economic yield over the total actual aboveground biomass at maturity defined by a harvest index xiong et al 2014 the model was used to optimize crop management practices ko et al 2009 therond et al 2011 xiong et al 2014 yang et al 2019 and to evaluate the effects of environmental factors on agricultural production worldwide tan and shibasaki 2003 chavas et al 2009 reidsma et al 2009 angulo et al 2013 our team calibrated and validated the epic model on the loess plateau and used it to investigate the soil water dynamics and water productivity among different management practices in this region wang and li 2010 wang et al 2012 peng et al 2017 2 4 2 model calibration and validation the calibration of the epic model aimed to obtain reasonable estimates of the model parameters by comparing simulated and observed values the model was calibrated using a dataset from field experiments conducted on the loess plateau the selected experimental sites contained sufficient information regarding meteorological data soil conditions and crop management the yield data and soil moisture collected from long term experimental sites were selected to calibrate the epic model a detailed description of the input parameters used in the model is presented in table 2 the epic performance was evaluated by comparing soil moisture and fruit yield from field experiments with simulated values the epic output data for the measured values were assessed using the root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse model efficiency me relative error re and coefficient of determination r2 these indicators were computed as follows wang et al 2019 rmse 1 n i 1 n si oi 2 rrmse rmse 1 n i 1 n oi 100 me 1 i 1 n si oi 2 i 1 n si 0 2 re 1 n i 1 n si oi oi 100 r 2 i 1 n oi o si s 2 i 1 n oi o 2 i 1 n si s 2 where si and oi are the simulated and observed values and s and o are the average simulated and observed values respectively the re rmse and rrmse were used to measure the differences between the observed and simulated values re and rmse values close to zero expresses a perfect agreement between simulated and observed values yang et al 2019 the simulation results were considered excellent good fair or poor when the rrmse value was 10 10 20 20 30 or 30 respectively yang et al 2019 the agreement between simulated and measured values was considered acceptable if r2 0 5 me and r2 close to 1 indicate a good fit between simulated and measured values gaiser et al 2010 2 5 model application and apple orchards management scenarios the validated model was used to assess the long term effects of orchard management scenarios on the soil water status and orchard productivity of rainfed apple orchards at eight different experimental sites scenario 1 and different management practices scenario 2 table 3 in two different climatic regions on the loess plateau fig 1 different climatic regions were divided based on precipitation isolines wan et al 2014 in this study fx fengxiang lc luochuan cw changwu and bs baishui represented the semihumid region while ya yan an xf xifeng jn jingning and mz mizhi were the semiarid region in the present study we chose luochuan lc and yan an ya as representative semihumid and semiarid regions in scenario 2 the weather datasets contained the daily minimum and maximum temperatures daily rainfall wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation from 1965 to 2009 data were compiled from the national meteorological database http data cma cn the meteorological station covers an area of a 5 20 km radius around the experiment field 2 6 statistical analysis two way analysis of variance anova was used to evaluate differences in swd and orchard productivity between different management practices and climatic regions once the swd and orchard productivity of the different experimental sites were compared one way anova followed by duncan s multiple range test was applied all data were analyzed using the ibm spss statistical software package version 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa followed by the least significant difference lsd test p 0 05 regression analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between swd and orchard productivity furthermore redundancy analysis rda was performed to evaluate the effects of climate soil properties and management factors on the swd and orchard productivity using the canoco v 5 0 ithaca ny usa figures were generated using origin software v pro 2019 originlab corp northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 field experiment 3 1 1 soil water depletion of apple orchards fig 2 shows the process of soil water dynamics after land use changes in dryland ecosystems the vertical distribution of soil moisture at different experimental sites is shown in fig 3 in our study stand age had a significant impact on swd figs 3 and 4a the highest value in the measurement sequence was recorded in farmlands followed by young orchards after ten years of growth the water absorbed by apple trees extended to a depth of more than 7 0 m and the soil profile showed a marked and sustained reduction in soil water when apple trees are grown for 20 years their roots can extract soil water from a depth of 15 0 m they could extract water at the full depth 15 0 m measured in apple orchards still soil moisture patterns differed across climatic regions fig 3 there was a greater drawdown in the soil water in water limited areas soil moisture at shallow depths 0 2 0 m in aging orchards was replenished by rainfall but there was still a serious soil water deficit below 2 0 m at each site after ten years the soil moisture within the 2 0 15 0 m profile was below the stable field capacity a threshold for soil desiccation which created strong water stress for apple tree growth the conversion from farmlands to apple orchards resulted in apple trees depleting soil moisture by approximately 600 mm to meet the demand for evapotranspiration at depths from 0 to 15 0 m 3 1 2 impacts of swd on the orchard productivity to explore the impact of swd on the productivity of dryland apple orchards we investigated the yield of 40 apple orchards with different stand ages in the dominant apple producing areas of the loess plateau the relationship between swd and fruit yield was examined using regression and redundancy analyses figs 4b and 5 swd had a significant impact on the orchard productivity the orchard productivity was also significantly positively correlated with the mean annual precipitation and temperature fertilizer application rates soil bulk density planting density and stand age however orchard productivity showed significant negative correlations with the altitude soil moisture and asws at 5 0 15 0 m soil depth 3 2 model simulation performance 3 2 1 model calibration the default and calibrated parameters of the epic model are listed in table 2 the soil moisture was used to calibrate the model performance and our results showed the goodness of fit indicators for the comparisons fig 6c and table 4 after calibrating soil moisture data collected from the four long term experimental sites were used to validate the fruit yield the r2 rmse rrmse me and re for fruit yield were 0 9051 1 36 mg ha 1 3 82 0 85 and 3 99 respectively these results show a close agreement between the measured and simulated fruit yields 3 2 2 model validation the calibrated epic model was further validated using field data from our experimental sites that were not used in the calibration process the simulated soil moisture and fruit yield of the apple orchards were consistent with the measured values the rmse values of soil moisture and fruit yield were 1 74 and 1 20 mg ha 1 for the four experimental sites and rrmse values were 11 12 and 2 71 respectively table 4 in addition the r2 me and re for soil moisture were 0 9184 0 84 and 9 95 and 0 8883 0 85 and 3 70 for fruit yield respectively fig 6b and d table 4 these results indicated that the epic model could simulate the soil moisture and fruit yield of apple orchards in the dryland agroecosystem 3 3 model application scenario 3 3 1 scenario simulation 1 long term simulation at different experimental sites after calibration and validation the epic model was used to evaluate soil water and orchard productivity at different experimental sites in rainfed agroecosystems 3 3 1 1 orchard productivity and soil water under different experimental sites using historical weather data simulations performed from 1965 to 2009 showed that the simulated values fluctuated yearly fig 7 the simulated fruit yield and water use efficiency of the different experimental sites exhibit fluctuate decreased trend with increasing stand age the asws significantly decreased before 15 years and remained stable or slightly changed after 15 years simulated swd showed the opposite trend with asws under long term simulation the simulated fruit yield asws and swd reached a significant level among different experimental sites and higher fruit yield and lower swd were recorded in areas with sufficient rainfall p 0 05 however no significant differences were detected in water use efficiency fig 8 3 3 1 2 simulated soil moisture distribution the vertical trend of simulated soil moisture in the 0 15 0 m soil layers was consistent with our sampling values which decreased with increasing stand age figs 3 and 9 in addition the soil moisture of the mature orchards 15 years was close to the wilting point in both experimental methods however the water consumption depths were different the field sampling value showed that apple trees could extract the soil water below 15 0 m however the maximum depth in the simulation experiment was limited to 12 0 m the soil water consumption rate in areas with limited rainfall was higher than in areas with sufficient precipitation fig 9 3 3 2 scenario simulation 2 long term simulation of different management practices the calibrated model was used to evaluate the long term 1965 2009 impact of different management practices different planting densities and fertilizer application rates on soil water and orchard productivity of apple orchards under different climatic regions in the present study we chose luochuan lc and yan an ya as representative semihumid and semiarid regions 3 3 2 1 orchard productivity and soil water under different management practices orchard productivity and soil water under different management practices different planting densities and fertilizer application rates were simulated in our study figs 10 and 11 different climatic regions responded differently to the management practices of apple orchards the long term simulated fruit yield and water use efficiency revealed a parabolic relationship with increasing planting density the highest average values were recorded in d3 in the semihumid region and d2 in the semiarid region although simulated swd increased with increasing density there were no significant differences between different planting densities simulated asws showed the opposite trend with swd under long term simulation simulated fruit yield asws and swd showed a significant response to the fertilizer application rate at both sites p 0 05 fig 11 the long term simulated fruit yield and water use efficiency exhibited a parabolic relationship with increasing fertilizer application rates the highest average values were recorded in f3 in the semihumid region and f2 in the semiarid region although swd tended to increase with increasing fertilizer application rates in apple orchards the asws showed a decreasing trend 3 3 2 2 simulated soil moisture distribution under different management practices soil moisture distributions in the 0 15 0 m soil layers of different management practices were simulated in our study figs 12 and 13 as planting density and fertilizer application rate increased soil moisture decreased in both climatic regions treatments with higher planting density and fertilizer application rate depleted soil moisture faster and earlier during apple orchard development still there were no significant effects on soil moisture after 15 years i e in luochuan 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of the epic model the epic model reasonably predicted soil water status and orchard productivity on the loess plateau fig 6 and table 4 differences between simulated and observed values of soil moisture and orchard productivity across the main apple producing regions were within acceptable ranges rrmses for soil moisture and fruit yield were 11 12 and 2 71 respectively previous studies also suggested that the epic model could accurately predict the soil water regime and crop productivity under different management practices worldwide gaiser et al 2010 wang et al 2012 balkovič et al 2013 xiong et al 2014 although the simulated soil moisture was relatively good over the whole soil depth rmse rrmse r2 me and re were 1 89 20 01 0 8981 0 68 and 11 21 respectively the model could not accurately reflect the soil moisture in deep soil layers in our study the apple trees can extract soil water from layers below 15 0 m in field experiments but the simulated depth was limited to 12 0 m figs 3 and 9 revealing the model limitations in simulating the soil water in deep soil layers this discrepancy was mainly attributed to the epic model water uptake method which did not consider root morphological parameters it is assumed that water is preferentially used from topsoil layers and the potential water supply rate decreases exponentially downward costantini et al 2002 camargo and kemanian 2016 markewitz et al 2010 also demonstrated that soil moisture depletion in deep soil was not well predicted when plant roots were below 5 0 m in the amazon although these defects might lead to differences between simulated and measured results the simulation still reflects soil water dynamics and orchard productivity under different management practices thus providing a scientific basis for optimizing orchard management in addition the model parameters should be further modified to more accurately simulate soil moisture in deep soil layers and the effects of deep soil desiccation on crop productivity in the future 4 2 soil water depletion of apple orchards a soil water deficit results from an imbalance between the supply and demand of soil moisture wang et al 2011 field sampling and simulation results showed a marked decrease in soil moisture after the conversion of farmlands to apple orchards figs 3 and 9 with previous studies reporting similar results huang et al 2018 ouyang et al 2021 this was mainly related to the plant type change that followed the land use type change generally soil water extraction is strongly controlled by the plant rooting systems li et al 2019 deep rooted apple trees can extract soil water in deep profiles when local precipitation cannot meet the water demand of apple tree growth ultimately resulting in soil water loss in deep soil zhang et al 2018 in addition the plantation age of apple orchards significantly affected soil moisture in the vertical profile the profile soil moisture showed a significant reduction after ten years and the soil water within the profile from 2 0 to 15 0 m was below the stable field capacity leading to soil desiccation and consequent strong water stress for apple trees li and huang 2008 li et al 2019 showed that the increase in water consumption in apple orchards was mainly due to increased root depth and biomass with increasing stand age hence increasing stand age leads to excessive soil water consumption and swd in deep soil layers of dryland orchards apple orchards can extract water from soil depths of up to 15 0 m and the consumption rate is faster in water limited areas this is attributed to the lower precipitation which cannot meet the water demand for apple tree growth in water limited areas wang et al 2011 moreover once the soil water deficit in apple orchards reaches a severe degree it results in soil quality degradation and poor vegetation growth which is unsuitable for developing long term apple production suggesting that swd poses greater potential risks to the sustainable development of the apple industry farmers and local governments should pay more attention to dryland agroecosystems 4 3 effect of swd on orchard productivity and its mitigation strategies the most direct result of swd is a decline in soil quality leading to land degradation bossio et al 2010 the main result of land degradation is reduced agricultural productivity leta and iticha 2018 field and simulated experimental results demonstrated that swd had significant effects on the fruit yield of apple orchards figs 4 and 5 previous results have also revealed that soil water availability dominates ecosystem productivity globally especially in water limited regions panzacchi et al 2012 liu et al 2020 in this study we used historical weather data from 1965 to 2009 as possible weather scenarios to forecast soil water and orchard productivity in the loess plateau the simulated orchard productivity gradually decreased with increasing stand age whereas the swd increased with increasing stand age and remained stable or changed slightly after 15 years fig 7 one possible explanation is that apple trees depleted the available soil water stored in the soil profile after growing for 15 years swd significantly reduces sws and the ability of soil reservoirs to supply water to the deep soil layer for plant growth li and huang 2008 it is difficult for rainwater to penetrate the dried soil layer with severe soil desiccation robinson et al 2006 chen et al 2008b therefore deep swd becomes an isolated strip for water transfer and separates the approach for groundwater supply from rainfall infiltration which intensifies the water cycle in the soil plant atmosphere continuum on a small scale wang et al 2011 affecting the growth of plants and reducing ecosystem productivity soil water deficit has evident negative effects on soil water conditions often cuts off the water pathway to supplement groundwater dramatically influencing the growth of apple trees and ecosystem productivity and heavily affecting the long term sustainable development of rainfed agroecosystems however if appropriate management measures are implemented based on rainfall and soil water conditions and the control of plant growth and productivity are coupled with soil water conservation measures the adverse effects of soil water deficit could be reduced during the orchard management process chen et al 2008b the density and fertilizer application rate of apple orchards should be tuned according to soil water conditions our results showed that feasible planting densities and fertilization rates were higher in regions with sufficient rainfall than in water limited regions fig s 10 and 11 suo et al 2019 also suggested that timely thinning tending measures and quantitative supplementary irrigation effectively increased the water supply of fruit trees ultimately reducing the soil water deficit and fueling the stable production capacity of apple orchards in addition many new orchard management techniques can effectively reduce soil desiccation for instance living mulches can reduce water loss and evaporation increasing sws suo et al 2019 in addition ridge mulching and rain harvesting measures can reduce evaporation between plants and soil storage song et al 2018 in recent years the apple producing areas of the loess plateau are promoting a low rootstock dense planting approach to replace the traditional apple cultivation model which is expected to reduce the water consumption of fruit trees therefore in orchard management it is necessary to use the abovementioned appropriate management measures to reduce the extent of soil desiccation and land degradation to achieve sustainable development of apple orchards in rainfed ecosystems 5 conclusions in this study we evaluated the extent of soil water and orchard productivity in apple orchards on the loess plateau sampling data and modeling results demonstrated that changing land use from farmlands to orchards decreased the soil moisture in the 0 15 0 m soil profiles leading to severe swd in apple orchards the stand age was the dominant driving force for the different soil moisture dynamics in the vertical profiles swd deteriorated soil quality and decreased orchard productivity in apple orchards in dryland ecosystems the field survey and epic model simulation results suggested that swd and orchard productivity are sensitive to climatic conditions appropriate planting density and fertilization rates should be controlled at a lower level in water limited regions however if appropriate management measures are selected based on precipitation and soil water conditions the detrimental effects of swd could be minimized during

9287,nature based solutions nbss are implemented worldwide to mitigate the impact of industrial agriculture on sediment and nutrient losses however their effectiveness depends on site specific features such as surficial hydrology soil permeability and erodability this study analyzed the effects of vegetative buffer strips vbss and winter cover crops ccs in a land reclamation area of the catchment of lake massaciuccoli central italy by modelling water and soil dynamics at a very detailed scale using a novel approach based on high resolution input data to this aim swat was applied on digital terrain models dtms from close range photogrammetry land cover mapping real crop rotations and a detailed calendar of farming practices nbss behaviour was investigated in two test areas namely the studiati and the gioia areas with uniform geomorphological settings but different soil types and annual crop rotations nbs effects were compared with a baseline control scenario without nbss and assessed under future climate conditions rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 specifically vbss and ccs showed different capabilities in mitigating runoff and sediment losses and their combination provided maximum effectiveness for the current climate scenarios the implementation of vbss produced a reduction of runoff depth of about 41 and 64 in the studiati and gioia areas respectively whereas showing a limited with the ccs implementation under the future climate conditions similar patterns were observed even if predicting significantly lower runoff depths the sediment loss reduction was in the order of 79 and 64 in studiati and gioia areas respectively concerning soil and water dynamics the study remarked that slight topographic irregularities on flat morphologies can trigger concentrated flows responsible for high runoff and sediment losses furthermore the differences in soil texture and organic matter content affected soil erodability rate on a local scale driving the consistency of nbs mitigating effects future climate changes scenarios exhibiting higher temperature and rarer but more concentrated rainfall events emphasize the impact of different soil types results observed at a very local scale with a spatialization of a few square meters which clearly relates to the types of crop rotations nbss and soil distribution noticed that swat is a suitable tool to aid farmers in

dale and polasky 2007 montgomery 2007 in temperate areas these phenomena are mainly triggered by rainfall patterns linsley 1967 peel and mcmahon 2020 other predisposing causes affecting soil erosion are soil texture organic matter content land cover and land use slope angle and length and adoption of agricultural conservation practices arnaez et al 2007 bryan and poesen 1989 dodd and sharpley 2016 githui et al 2009 kinnell and risse 1998 lasanta et al 2000 liu et al 2000 loague 1992 nasta et al 2017 ruiz colmenero et al 2013 sajikumar and remya 2015 saxton and rawls 2006 shanshan et al 2018 sharpley 1985 tuppad et al 2010 wallace et al 2017 williams 1975 in agricultural areas where annual crops are largely widespread the stage of plant growth strongly affects the rainfall runoff ratio burkart 2010 and consequently the soil erosion rate many different conservation practices are applied worldwide to mitigate such effects reichenberger et al 2007 wezel et al 2014 by acting on local morphology and environmental settings e g contour farming strip cropping minimum or zero tillage often coupling with conservation practices several types of nature based solutions nbss have been introduced such as the integration of both perennial and annual crops in rotations weißhuhn et al 2017 wick et al 2017 the insertion of cover crops ccs dabney et al 2001 fageria et al 2005 lu et al 2000 and the use of vegetative buffer strips vbss along the field borders dillaha et al 1989 zhang et al 2010 they can limit surficial runoff and consequently soil erosion by enhancing the water infiltration rate intercepting surface water flow and increasing sediment trapping efficacy borin et al 2005 dillaha et al 1989 vbss and ccs are considered the most feasible mitigation measures in conventional agriculture especially where other conservation practices are unsuitable due to morphological or economic matters however their actual effectiveness depends on the site specific conditions reichenberger et al 2007 stehle et al 2016 xuyang zhang et al 2010 for example abu zreig et al 2004 tested the effectiveness of vbss at varying both the strip geometry width and length and the vegetation species in a field experiment several authors analyzed the effect of converging and or diverging flows in vbs areas helmers et al 2005 stehle et al 2016 white and arnold 2009 in their review zhang et al 2010 analyzed the influence of soil type on the vbss performance in pollutant removal as a function of the drainage ability observing that their impact is statistically no significant on the other hand the scientific literature lacks evidence on how soil texture and organic matter content can affect the vbss and ccs mitigation effectiveness the nbss efficacy can be evaluated by monitoring borin et al 2005 or modelling scenarios before and after the implementation the comparison of different approaches enables to predict the level of mitigation and the residual hazard of a post operam scenario under variable pedo climatic conditions many models have been developed to assess the effectiveness of different nbss focusing on runoff and solid transport they work on different scales and with different approaches ranging from entirely empirical ghosal and das bhattacharya 2020 renard et al 1991 to physically based ones abu zreig et al 2001 arnold et al 2012 bieger et al 2017 gassman et al 2014 shrestha et al 2021 up to models that directly simulate the pollutant routing oecd 2000 probst et al 2005 stehle et al 2016 the choice of the most suitable model is mainly driven by both the specific phenomena to be investigated and the type of mitigation measures adopted nbss in this case afterwards the morphological geological and hydrological features of the investigated area the working scale and the data availability have to be carefully taken into account aleotti and chowdhury 1999 chung and fabbri 1999 fell et al 2008 hervás and bobrowsky 2009 hungr 2018 van westen et al 2006 the simplest models rely on the revised universal soil loss equation rusle ghosal and das bhattacharya 2020 renard et al 1991 in connection with the low need for site specific data however the rusle based models cannot simulate runoff volumes and are more designed to be used at regional or catchment scales rather than at field scale outputs of this set of models are very sensitive to soil morphology especially to slope steepness renard et al 1991 thus having low feasibility to flat areas physically based models such as vsfmod abu zreig et al 2001 munoz caprina et al 1992 can successfully estimate the vbss effectiveness providing reliable results especially when diversifying the analysis at varying the flow concentration across vbss abu zreig et al 2001 the model simulates the transport of agrochemicals such as pesticides and nutrients however it explicitly focuses on vbss and cannot simulate the effects of other mitigation measures such as ccs moreover it is high data demanding especially for large scale applications abu zreig et al 2001 gericke et al 2020 munoz caprina et al 1992 and it runs on a single rainfall event thus resulting unreliable for seasonal or annual simulations finally it provides only one dimensional simulations without considering the interactions in space and time rouzies et al 2019 for this reason it is more suitable for design purposes rather than for the assessment of spatial hazard process based chemical transport models such as rextox oecd 2000 probst et al 2005 were effectively applied to investigate the spatial distribution of runoff and the routed pesticides and nutrients at different levels as well as at the field scale stehle et al 2016 however they work on individual rainfall events without simulating the sediment transport swat bieger et al 2017 dile et al 2016 gassman et al 2014 is a fully revised version of soil water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2014 that adopts a comprehensive modelling approach based on spatial data such as digital terrain models dtms soil maps land use and weather data it enables to investigate different types of phenomena affecting water and soil dynamics and provides for an estimation of runoff sediment loss and streamflow resulting from runoff and lateral flow arnold and allen 1999 zhao et al 2013 swat applications were made under many different conditions including the field scale karki et al 2020 sinnathamby et al 2017 and flat agricultural areas bosch et al 2004 donmez et al 2020 many authors applied swat to assess the effects of mitigation measures such as vbss and ccs arabi et al 2008 himanshu et al 2019 merriman et al 2018 phomcha et al 2012 ullrich and volk 2009 white and arnold 2009 and produced spatialized results through maps into gis platforms dile et al 2021 moreover swat can be used to simulate phenomena over long periods long term dynamics as well as seasonal trends arnold et al 1998 2012 when used for high spatial temporal resolution estimations the model is highly demanding in terms of both the accuracy of input data soil properties farming practices and climate data and computational capacity yalew et al 2013 this issue is strictly related to the calibrated or non calibrated use of the model originally swat was implemented for large scale ungauged catchments to evaluate spatial and temporal differences in hydrological behaviour and associated solute and sediment transport without or with little calibration efforts santhi et al 2001 shi et al 2011 although many authors have underlined afterwards the significance of the calibration stage in improving the consistency of model estimates daggupati et al 2015 niraula et al 2011 other studies have proved that input parameters can be successfully set up by using readily available gis data previously developed or default values thus bypassing the calibration step under many different hydrologic and geographic conditions srinivasan et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 moreover calibration besides being high time and computational resource demanding may force parameter values towards optimization objectives biasing the variables not included in calibration zhang et al 2009 2011 in the frame of this work application to an ungauged system on field scale we based the use of swat on the uncommon availability of detailed and high spatial resolution input data that by reducing the empirical residue of the model should balance the lack of calibration and improve the reliability of estimates despite several models available in the literature no applications are currently available on a detailed scale based on high resolution input data to test the swat reliability to simulate the spatial effectiveness of nbss in addition few papers have dealt with the investigation of the open field effects of vbss and ccs in conventional cropping systems because of the effort required for monitoring wide areas the employment of models enables to deal with this issue and observed results can support farmers in new crop systems design they also allow assessing the nbss benefits in limiting the water quality degradation caused by solid soil transport processes this study investigated the swat application to a flat area under conventional agriculture where vbss and ccs were adopted in two different experimental sites within the reclamation area surrounding lake massaciuccoli central italy it aimed at assessing the nbss suitability and effectiveness by simulating the main hydrological processes that occurred in the experimental area specifically the nbss design scenario s1 post operam with the current adoption of vbss and ccs was compared with a baseline control one s0 ante operam without any nbss considering different climate scenarios in such a way the nbss effectiveness in reducing nutrient losses by intercepting the runoff and the sediments routed by surficial waters was thoroughly estimated and analyzed the experimental sites considered in modelling are located in the same geomorphological setting but exhibit contrasting soil types mineral soils and peat soils this enabled to assess the effect of soil types on the nbs effectiveness providing new evidence on this scarcely investigated topic the detailed analysis hereafter reported can be thus intended as a starting point to evaluate the cost benefit ratios of nbss and then upscale the investigated solutions to wider areas e g to the whole lake catchment obtained results can be used to support farmers in cropping systems design and to test the agricultural models able to limit the degradation of water quality 2 methods 2 1 the test sites the study was carried out on two test sites located in the westernmost part of the serchio river basin a few kilometres to the north of the river outlet and to the south of the lake massaciuccoli here one of italy s most important residual marshy areas was partially reclaimed in the 1920 s in favour of two large areas the vecchiano sub catchment located to the south west side and the lake massaciuccoli sub catchment to the south east one brunelli and cannicci 1942 cenni 1997 these areas were then turned into an agricultural plain mechanically drained by a network of artificial channels a set of pumping stations installed along the main draining channels conveys water from the agricultural plain toward the lake to ensure a water table depth suitable for cultivation flow direction can be reversed during the summer to satisfy the needs of crop irrigation the reclamation areas are characterized by fluvial to lacustrine surficial deposits ranging from silty clays to the south which gradually change to sands moving northward the organic content of the soils remarkably increases when approaching the lake ranging from 3 in the southern part up to 55 close to the southernmost lake embankments fig 1 intensive agriculture developed in the area since 1970 s contributed to increase the nutrient content in water through both base flow and secondly runoff other significant nutrient sources consisted of two wastewater treatment plants since 2011 only one of 4250 person equivalent is working and the production of n and p soluble compounds due to the soil organic matter mineralization caused by the drainage of peat soils surrounding the lake because of all these contributions the lake water resulted in eutrophic and then its status is seriously harmed bathing and fishing are still forbidden brunelli and cannicci 1942 cenni 1997 pistocchi et al 2012 silvestri et al 2017 the reclamation has been unavoidable due to the shallow groundwater depth that in many points of the lake catchment could reach the soil level when the pumping plants don t work thus preventing cultivation these conditions further worsen the groundwater quality due to seawater intrusion from the west resulting in a trigger for salinization and seepage from the lake embankments pistocchi et al 2012 rossetto et al 2010 the drainage also provokes the subsidence of the whole agricultural area because of physical compaction and bio chemical processes peat oxidation baldaccini 2018 so that the soil quote dropped up to 3 m below the sea level the role interplayed by peat oxidation soil subsidence and conventional industrial agriculture resulted in several hazardous phenomena ranging from groundwater and surficial water pollution to soil erosion and flooding the latter threatened the environmental and economical resources as well as people living in the area and led to a complex ad extended risk arrangement to address such issues local authorities led by the autorità di bacino distrettuale dell appennino settentrionale a b d a s implemented a series of nbss measures throughout the catchment among these we considered two test sites namely the studiati area to the north and the gioia area to the south within the catchment of lake massaciuccoli where the following measures were implemented i vbss featured with perennial grass species along the edges of some cultivated fields ii adoption of techniques of conservative agriculture by planting winter ccs and adopting minimum tillage systems silvestri et al 2017 the two test areas studiati and gioia fig 2 extend for 19 9 104 m2 and 36 7 104 m2 including 33 and 39 different plots respectively with individual sizes ranging from 5000 m2 to 11000 m2 in the studiati test site vbss and ccs were implemented on 14 plots with just 3 of them interested by coupling both measures fig 2a thus resulting in a cumulative area of 7 7 104 m2 with ccs and of 6 0 104 m2 draining towards vbss they correspond to 38 7 and 30 1 of the whole areas respectively in the gioia test site vbss and ccs were implemented on 14 plots with just 2 of them interested by coupling both measures fig 2b instead the resulting cumulative area of ccs is 13 0 104 m2 and the cumulative area draining towards vbss is 11 6 104 m2 corresponding to 35 4 and 31 6 of the whole areas respectively 2 2 swat modelling modelling the effectiveness of vbss and ccs in mitigating runoff and sediment losses was carried out with qswat v 2 0 6 dile et al 2021 and swat editor v 2 0 4 bieger et al 2017 the input data and the required accuracy mainly depend on the assessment scale they concern 1 soil properties which can derive from general soil maps developed by the us department of agriculture usda schwarz and alexander 1995 soil survey staff 2021 by fao fao 1974 or by user soil data 2 dtm at proper resolution 1 30 m for application at regional to watershed scale less than 1 m for application at field scale 3 land use maps at the suitable scale 4 weather data which can be derived from both local weather stations or climate forecasting system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 soil databases and cfsr meteorological data have proved to return reliable results especially for small scale applications in data scarce contexts such as in developing countries alemayehu et al 2016 barakat et al 2022 bressiani et al 2015 cuceloglu and ozturk 2019 dile and srinivasan 2014 mararakanye et al 2020 roth and lemann 2016 valipour 2017 conversely for large scale applications high resolution data enhance the reliability of the modelling results gassman et al 2014 kannan et al 2019 muttiah and wurbs 2002 2 2 1 digital terrain modelling dtm the dtm used for simulations fig 3 was built up by using close range photogrammetry giordan et al 2018 james and robson 2014 remondino and el hakim 2006 westoby et al 2012 carried out by the centre of geotecnologies https geotecnologie unisi it person comm in the whole massaciuccoli reclamation area hence encompassing both study areas with a ground sampling distance of 4 7 cm x pixel 1 and an average georeferencing error of 0 16 m after data processing and filtering a dtm was extracted for the whole area with a 0 20 m cell size fig 3 due to the high resolution of the digital model and the resulting dm scale roughness of the surface coupling with the flat morphology of the area the dtm post process was required to make it consistent with the hydrological network detected in the field this is essential in flat agricultural areas where the natural hydrographic network is poor and the drainage system is made of artificial channels with limited width and depth donmez et al 2020 furthermore for photogrammetry derived dtms the poor data quality in areas with dense vegetation cover often typical of wet areas such as ditch and stream banks represented a relevant barrier to the effective design of the hydrographic network in some cases returning unphysical modelling results luo et al 2011 post processing was thus unavoidable to properly delineate both the draining network and the watersheds hydrological consistent stream networks and watershed delineation can be pursued using different approaches namely 1 by applying the automatic channel network burn in function of swat dile et al 2016 2 by manually modifying dtm and carving channels and streams based on field measurements both approaches require the preliminary field delineation of the hydrographic network and its measurements the former enables to automatically decrease the dtm elevation along the user defined polylines of the channel network dile et al 2016 in some cases the automatic burn in function may not provide reliable results especially where either 3d models of channel paths are quite noisy or channel road crossings are frequent altering the morphology and continuity of the channels paths in these cases and when channels have peculiar shapes that the user would include in the modelling the second approach for dtm post processing proves to be the most suitable one in such a case the shape and depth of channels are required for properly carving the dtm in gis environment in this work the automatic delineation of watersheds returned unphysical results for both areas indeed in the gioia area 17 of the agricultural land was neglected from watershed delineation following a slight slope opposite to the drainage direction fig 3a whereas in the studiati area the modelling overlooked 30 of the studied area given the inverted draining direction of the watershed provoked by both the noisiness of the digital model along channels and the frequent road crossings fig 3c based on the inconsistencies of the automatic watershed delineation dtm post processing was differentiated between the two areas the gentle approach based on the burn in function was applied to the gioia site using the shapefile of the draining network surveyed in the field providing reliable results with both watershed and stream networks fig 3b the manual carving was adopted at the studiati site to delineate the watershed and channel network instead field topographical surveys of the channel sections allowed the implementation of a triangular irregular network tin 3d model of the channel network depths below the ground level were used in tin creation instead of elevations and tin was then converted into a raster for map algebra in qgis software qgis org 2021 conversely road crossings were replaced by linear interpolation of the channels geometries the resulting post processed dtm was then used for the automatic delineation of watershed and produced results matching the real draining network and watershed fig 3d 2 2 2 soil maps soil data input in swat is in the form of indexed raster maps with associated look up tables that link the soil indexes to the soil properties bieger et al 2017 dile et al 2021 indexes of soil raster maps represent homogeneous soil units having a univocal set of soil parameters at the study areas soil maps and tables were built based on the soil samples parameters suggested by silvestri et al 2002 soil sample spatial density was constant over the whole massaciuccoli reclamation area with an average value of 0 2 samples ha which resulted in 12 and 17 soil samples collected in the studiati and the gioia area respectively fig 4 soil parameters available for samples were soil granulometry percentage of sand silt and clay usda classification of soil textures usda 1999 per cent content of organic matter om ph electrical conductivity ec albedo ratio a and caco3 per cent content the empirical pedo transfer functions allowed calculating the additional parameters required for swat modelling they were applied to each soil sample based on soil texture and organic matter content specifically for bulk density bd the empirical eqs 1 and 2 from hollis et al 2012 calibrated for european cultivated soils and differentiated according to the organic matter content were applied 1 when om 25 bd g cm 3 1 4903 0 33293 ln oc 2 when om 25 bd g cm 3 0

expressed as the k factor of the usle equation ghosal and das bhattacharya 2020 renard et al 1991 was estimated by applying the following pedo transfer eq 6 from williams 1995 6 k usle f csand f clay silt f oc f hisand where fcsand fclay silt foc and fhisand represent the soil erodibility as a function of coarse sand content clay to silt ratios organic carbon content and extremely high sand

the per cent sand silt and clay contents respectively and oc is the per cent organic carbon content the hydraulic conductivity ksat was estimated using the values in table 1 deduced from direct measurements on soils with similar textures and organic content in similar contexts for soils with high organic contents om 20 a constant value of ksat 1 8 mm x h 1 was set based on the authors knowledge all the soil parameters were mapped over the whole area by interpolating each variable fig 4 the regular spacing of samples and the lack of significant auto correlation detected in preliminary analyses enabled to perform the natural neighbour interpolation to get raster maps rasters of sand silt and clay contents were then matched to classify the texture of each cell according to the usda soil ranking system usda 1999 to convert the soil texture into a polygonal shapefile fig 5a the organic matter content was also classified and vectorized fig 5b the soil texture and the organic content map were overlayed to create the map of soil units fig 5c which represented areas for zonal statistics based on rasters of soil parameters to compute averages to be set as input data of the swat user soil database dile et al 2021 2 2 3 land use maps high resolution orthophoto represented the core to map the land use and land covers supported by high resolution dtm 0 20 m cell size both cadastral maps and actual crop plans this allowed detecting single land parcels characterized by different crop rotations and agricultural practices fig 6a d in turn resulting in different agricultural land use units along with these narrow rural unpaved roads small ditches and stream vegetated banks were also mapped as individual land use units fig 6b e moreover given the small scale of the study the actual extension of the implemented vbss was delineated as polygonal areas and handled as individual land cover units with specific agricultural practices this allowed overcoming hurdles in modelling the concentrated flow across vbss which represents an essential feature for properly predicting the effects on runoff and sediment transport reduction dosskey et al 2002 helmers et al 2005 white and arnold 2009 a similar approach was applied to differentiate the areas where different agricultural techniques were adopted fig 6c f land use maps were thus generated for both the s0 fig 6b e and the s1 scenarios fig 6c f agricultural land units exhibiting conventional and conservative agriculture were processed according to the crop rotations schemes table 2 and agricultural operations calendars provided by farm owners for each crop type 2 2 4 climate data to assess the impacts of climate change on the nbss effectiveness we compared the modelling results for s1 and s0 under different climate conditions namely i current climate conditions ii mild future climate variations iii strong climate variations the last two represent the rcp ipcc 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively clarke et al 2007 meinshausen et al 2011 moss et al 2008 moss et al 2010 rao and riahi 2006 furthermore the simulations included the furthest period available with global circulation models and climate scenarios years up to 2100 to evaluate long term climate variations the historical weather data used for simulations were based on the recordings of the metato weather station located 4 8 km far from the south of the studied areas having the same morphological and environmental settings rainfall temperature humidity wind velocity and direction and solar radiation with 15 min time intervals are available and freely accessible from the regional hydrological and geological sector of tuscany portal tuscany region 2021 temperature and rainfall data were recorded since 1990 with few gaps generally due to brief periodical maintenance activities conversely solar radiation humidity and wind data have been available since 2010 similarly to calendars of agricultural operations the 2010 2015 timespan resulted in the most complete and continuous period for swat simulations weather data for future scenarios were modelled with climate change toolkit cct ashraf vaghefi et al 2017 for the distant future climate changes consistently with the adopted climate approach data downscaling and bias correction were carried out to calibrate future weather data ahmed et al 2013 hempel et al 2013 ines and hansen 2006 teutschbein and seibert 2012 downscaling was carried out based on rainfall and temperature data collected by 3 different weather stations close to the area table 3 located in similar morphological and climate settings these provided critical data over a sufficiently large overlapping time interval 1996 2005 although the time span used for future climate model calibration doesn t fit that used for modelling the current climate scenario it was chosen because of the better control given by the simultaneous recording of all the considered weather stations not available for the following periods the three weather stations are those installed in lido di camaiore strettoia and metato localities tuscany region 2021 historical data from 5 global circulation models gcm 1 gfdl esm2m gcm 2 hadgem2 es gcm 3 ipsl cm5a lr gcm 4 miroc gcm 5 noeresm1 m available with the cct hempel et al 2013 moss et al 2008 stocker et al 2013 were compared with downscaled observed historical data considering both uncorrected data and bias corrected data both downscaling and calibration were performed on daily data whereas the comparison to select the most suitable model was based on the average monthly cumulative rainfall depths for the whole investigated period results of metato station are reported in fig 7 and root mean square error rmse was estimated to assess the best gcm model fig 8 gcm4 miroc returned the highest correlation in terms of rainfall fig 8a whereas gcm3 gave the lowest scatter for temperature nevertheless given the comparable result with gcm4 and the greater interest in rainfall variation gcm4 was applied to model future weather data for both rcp 4 5 mild and rcp 8 5 strong climate change scenarios referred to the 2095 2100 timespan fig 7 2 3 data processing the implemented modelling was based on high resolution dtms soil maps land covers and management data which enabled to assess the nbss performance and the agricultural practice effects lasanta et al 2000 probst et al 2005 williams 2015 with ground resolutions of few square meters spatial units used in the modelling were the uniform hydrological response units hrus ranging from 1 m2 to 1500 m2 among the possible swat outputs the study focused on the hrus runoff and sediment yield triggered by water erosion runoff was estimated for the surface component and thus intended as the annual amount of surficial water leaving the hrus sediment yield represents the sediment mobilized at each hru instead since sediment yielded by a hru can be deposited in downstream areas aimed at estimating the real impact of rainfall on soil erosion we accounted only for the amount of sediments that reaches the field ditches and leaves the cultivated areas as a soil loss this implies that the effects on soil erosion are reported as average annual amounts of remobilized sediment sediment yield sy suspended sediment loss ssl and total sediment loss sl runoff and soil erosion estimation was thus the proxy to investigate the nbss effectiveness at the two test sites of studiati and gioia in the massaciuccoli reclamation agricultural area the nbss scenario s1 including the implementation of vbss and ccs was compared with the ante operam scenario s0 which was based on the usual farming practices adopted by local farmers conventional tillage no cover crops and no buffer strips under the abovementioned different climate conditions current rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 results from s0 and s1 scenarios were given in the form of susceptibility maps compared in figs 9 11 and synthesized in table 4 here the results are reported as both simulated annual values of runoff ro mm y 1 and transported sediments sy t ha 1 y 1 averaged for areas where the nbss vgss and ccs were implemented aimed at investigating the changes triggered by the nbs implementation on the other hand simulated values of suspended ssl t ha 1 y 1 and total sediment losses the latter including the bed load portion sl t ha 1 y 1 were averaged over the whole experimental area under the s0 and s1 scenarios 3 results and discussion simulations were performed for both s0 and s1 scenarios under three different climate configurations i current climate scenario ii rcp 4 5 future climate scenario and iii rcp 8 5 future climate scenario the modelled climatic trend for future scenarios implied a decrease in the average yearly cumulative rainfall depth from 73 18 mm y 1 to 66 95 mm y 1 for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively nevertheless the average monthly cumulative rainfall depth strongly depended on the seasons showing more concentrated rainfall events during fall and winter the temperature increase was observed for both scenarios reaching an average yearly increase of 2 54 c peak of 4 93 c during summer season at rcp 4 5 and 4 54 c peak of 9 50 c during summer season at rcp 8 5 3 1 current climate scenario when simulating the current climate for ante operam s0 given the flat morphology of the sites a limited runoff was experienced in both areas observing average medium to low annual depths specifically the studiati area returned the lowest runoff ranging from 15 to 130 mm y 1 74 mm y 1 on average except for the sections along the rural roads which exhibited an average value of 831 mm y 1 fig 9a the latter was very close to the average annual precipitation of 1178 mm y 1 conversely on average the gioia area showed higher runoff depth and more complex spatial distribution ranging from 40 to 100 mm y 1 fig 9e greater runoff depths were detected along the plot edges uphill to the first order channels draining the area by exceeding 110 mm y 1 this was due to the influence of the local topography presenting areas penchant to flow accumulation and thus high runoff depths as for the studiati area higher runoff depths occurred along the rural roads also achieving 800 mm y 1 nevertheless against the former in the studiati area this was mainly emphasized on the western side of the parcel whereas lower intensity was detected on the opposite side as expected in both areas the higher the runoff depth the greater the sl showing lower effects on the inner side of each plot whereas presenting higher rates around the borders where flow accumulation occurs specifically in the studiati area fig 9b despite the overall reduced sy estimated in the range of 0 0 2 t ha 1 y 1 a sediment production of 6 7 t ha 1 y 1 was achieved along the borders the channel paths and the rural roads thus emphasizing the significant effects of channelized flows on sediment removal in the studiati area the average total sediment loss was 0 539 t ha 1 y 1 while the average suspended sediment loss deployed at 0 443 t ha 1 y 1 similarly in the gioia area the innermost parts of the plots exhibited low sediment loss ranging between 0 and 0 2 t x ha 1 nevertheless the influence of flow accumulation was even more prevalent with sediment loss reaching 34 t x ha 1 along both the channel paths and the plot borders fig 9f this effect was strictly related to soil composition thus resulting in greater relevance in the eastern side of the area which is mainly composed of clay and silty clay fig 5c no evident correlation was observed with the om instead although the sy still showed high values at the plot borders in the remaining part of the plot it never exceeded 8 t ha 1 this implied that the sl at the gioia area was higher than the studiati s exceeding 0 6 t ha 1 y 1 table 4 the nbss implementation in both areas significantly reduced runoff depth along the plots borders where vbss were implemented in these areas runoff amounts dropped to average depths around 44 mm y 1 and 30 mm y 1 at the studiati and gioia areas respectively table 4 the s1 showed a reduction of runoff depth of 41 and 64 at studiati and gioia areas respectively where vbss were implemented the benefits of ccs were irrelevant with a few percentage rates improvement several studies proved that flow accumulation negatively affects vbss performance abu zreig et al 2001 stehle et al 2016 white and arnold 2009 nevertheless in the study areas especially in the gioia s runoff reduction generally occurred along the vbss with average depths halved from 80 mm y 1 to 40 mm y 1 especially in areas where concentrated flows occurred conversely in areas with ccs the decrease in runoff depths was almost negligible fig 9c g and table 4 when considering soil erosion the benefits from coupling both nbss were much more evident along the channels and the plots borders with channelized flows fig 9d h in greater detail in the studiati area a sl decrease of about 79 was observed lowering to 0 114 t ha 1 y 1 table 4 with predominant impacts in areas of flow accumulation along the channel s paths fig 9 the reduction was more relevant for the ssl which decreased by 84 up to 0 073 t ha 1 y 1 table 4 the mitigative effect of both types of nbss was noticeable also in the gioia area where sl was limited to 0 218 t ha 1 y 1 table 4 thus implying a decrease of 64 compared to the ante operam scenario s0 this also reduced ssl to 0 067 t ha 1 y 1 table 4 corresponding to 20 of the ssl at s0 specifically where ccs or vbss were implemented even where not coupled peaks of sy disappeared and the highest average areal values never exceeded 4 t ha 1 y 1 fig 9h the soil erosion reduction was more appreciated in the central side parcel 253 5 table 2 where sunflower durum wheat rotations were interspersed with winter cover crops oats and legumes the predicted values of soil losses under current climatic conditions 2010 2015 lied within the range of variation reported for the exact locations by silvestri et al 2017 by comparing different cropping systems table 4 during a two year field experiment the suspended sediment loss for plots under conventional cultivation ranged between 0 374 and 0 315 t ha 1 y 1 at on peat soil studiati and between 0 557 and 0 744 t ha 1 y 1 on loamy soils gioia conversely the sediment collected from the strip tilled plots equipped with buffer strips 1 0 m wide along the field ditches resulted significantly lower 0 194 0 204 and 0 197 0 261 t ha 1 y 1 for studiati and gioia area respectively considering that the modelling was carried out in an ungauged system which prevented robust model calibration and validation although the convergence of the estimates from the modelling with the measured data cannot exactly replace the validation process the correlation between simulated and observed data corroborates the consistency of the modelling results 3 2 rcp 4 5 future climatic scenario the effects of climate change were estimated by comparing the s0 and s1 scenarios in long future climate 2095 2100 accounting for climate changes set by the rcp 4 5 fig 10 and rcp 8 5 scenarios fig 11 and modelled using the gcm4 miroc a possible future scenario characterized by mild climate change resulted in a rainfall reduction to 898 mm y 1 much more concentrated during the winter and less frequent and intense during summer than the current conditions fig 7 modelled temperature is generally higher than the current one with an average increase of 2 54 c and peak values of 4 93 c during summer such a climatic increment induced two different behaviours in the investigated areas on the one hand consistently with the general reduction of rainfall depth in the studiati area low runoff depths were predicted widespread fig 10a mainly ranging between 0 and 20 mm y 1 with an average of 5 0 mm y 1 this corresponds to a reduction of 87 and 93 of the average runoff depth against the current climate scenario where vbss and ccs were implemented respectively peak values were again observed just along the rural roads exceeding 450 mm y 1 table 4 thus corresponding to a 46 reduction in the current climate scenario on the other hand in the gioia area the runoff distribution was much more complex fig 10e indeed it ranged over a larger interval 20 160 mm y 1 compared to current climate modelling 40 80 mm y 1 the lowest values in the northeast ranged between 0 and 80 mm y 1 in the central and southwestern parts it mostly ranged between 40 and 160 mm y 1 instead moreover the runoff distribution followed the soil texture patterns with the highest values achieved where clay loams and silty clay loams outcropped remarking the increasing influence of soil texture in climate conditions characterized by drier weather conversely no clear correlation was found with om which never exceeded 4 unlike the current climate scenario runoff did not significantly increase at the plot borders where it did not exceed 80 mm y 1 rural roads showed the highest runoff values exceeding 400 mm y 1 whereas channel and stream embankments characterized by covers of perennial grass always returned runoff depths not higher than 80 mm y 1 mild climate change at the studiati area induced trends in soil erosion matching the runoff with a general reduction remarked by sl decreasing of 99 from 0 539 to 0 003 t ha 1 y 1 table 4 sediment losses reflect the very low sediment yield modelled at each hru 0 0 2 t ha 1 y 1 showing on average 0 1 t ha 1 y 1 slightly higher values were limited to major stream embankments and rural roads ranging between 0 2 and 0 8 t ha 1 y 1 fig 10b in the gioia area according to lower rainfall sediment losses decreased over the whole area fig 10f with the lowest values modelled in the innermost areas of the plots where they ranged between 0 and 0 2 t ha 1 y 1 nevertheless zones of high sediment production were detected along the plot borders especially in parcels 253 5 and 60 248 6 where they varied in the interval 4 16 t ha 1 y 1 in substantially limited areas in parcel 251 4 sediment loss persisted higher along the borders while never exceeding 2 t ha 1 y 1 the sl modelled for s0 in the area was significantly lower than current climate modelling 80 with an average value of about 0 123 t ha 1 y 1 considering the generally low runoff and sediment loss modelled at the studiati area for rcp 4 5 the nbss effects were highly reduced accordingly in fact throughout the cultivated area s1 showed no significant variations in the runoff than s0 fig 10c and table 4 and no discrepancies were detected between vbss and ccs similarly the nbss mitigative effect was negligible for sediment production and loss fig 10d and table 4 conversely in the gioia area the runoff depth lowered along the plot borders with vbss where it was limited to 30 mm y 1 fig 10g and table 4 plots featured with ccs did not show any significant variations of runoff depth table 4 instead resulting in an essential constancy in both scenarios soil erosion was significantly mitigated by both vbss and ccs fig 10h with losses being reduced by 50 varying from 0 123 t ha 1 y 1 at s0 to 0 062 t ha 1 y 1 at s1 3 3 rcp 8 5 future climate scenario climate change modelled for rcp 8 5 resulted in a further average decrease of rainfall 738 mm x y 1 more concentrated during the fall and late wintertime than in the current setting the predicted temperature showed a general increase averaging around 4 54 c with peaks of 9 5 c during the summer fig 7 consistently with simulations of rcp 4 5 modelling carried out for this climate setting resulted in diverging trends for the two test sites in such conditions low runoff depths were predicted in the studiati area mostly ranging between 0 and 20 mm y 1 with on average 6 8 mm y 1 fig 11a as observed in the previous cases higher depths were predicted along the stream embankments ranging between 40 and 80 mm y 1 and along the rural roads where the highest runoff values attained 400 mm y 1 in the gioia area runoff prediction also presented low values although higher than the studiati s ranging between 0 and 80 mm y 1 with an average of 45 mm y 1 fig 11e the soil texture highly influenced its distribution indeed it reached slightly higher values 40 80 mm y 1 where silty clay loams with low organic content 3 and where clay loams with medium low organic content 5 outcropped as observed in the previous cases higher values were also recorded along the stream embankments considering soil erosion in the studiati area the modelled trends matched with the runoff fig 11b with very low sy values mainly attaining in the range 0 0 2 t ha 1 y 1 as for previous scenarios higher values characterized the rural roads reaching 2 05 t ha 1 y 1 nevertheless the sl predicted was highly lower 0 005 t ha 1 y 1 than that for the current climate setting table 4 in the gioia area the soil erosion experienced a slight increase with sl varying from 0 123 to 0 172 t ha 1 y 1 compared to the rcp 4 5 scenario this was explicitly noticeable when considering suspended component ssl from 0 018 to 0 062 t ha 1 y 1 thus remarking the enhanced erosive capacity of rainfall indeed although rainfalls exhibited lower annual depths moving from a monthly average depth of 72 12 mm y 1 at rcp 4 5 66 95 mm y 1 at rcp 8 5 they occurred as more extreme events concentrated over shorter periods especially during fall and late winter seasons i e soon after crop harvesting and before new cash crop planting precisely an increase in the monthly average depth was estimated in october and november moving from 101 15 to 124 97 mm y 1 and from 142 80 to 167 69 mm y 1 respectively february and march showed a monthly average depth increase from 74 12 to 77 42 and from 35 24 to 48 39 mm y 1 respectively modelled values were generally low in the central part of each plot disregarding differences in crop rotations and soil types fig 11f conversely they ranged between 2 and 27 t ha 1 y 1 in limited areas along the plot borders considering the nbss implementation no significant changes were detected in the studiati area fig 11c and table 4 the different behaviour shown by the two test sites is confirmed in the variable mitigative impacts of nbss indeed in the studiati area they showed scarce mitigation of runoff reduced from 6 to 2 mm y 1 just along vbss fig 11c and soil erosion sl reduced from 0 005 to 0 002 t ha 1 y 1 fig 11d on the contrary in the gioia area a significant mitigative effect of nbss was predicted for both runoff depth reduced from 53 to 25 mm y 1 just along vbss fig 11g and table 4 and sediment yield at hrus fig 11h however their effects in reducing sediment yield at hrus were much more relevant indeed the sy reduced to 0 01 t ha 1 y 1 in central areas of plots and to 4 t ha 1 y 1 along the borders the reduction was uniform in areas of ccs implementation although in the southeastern part sediment yielded was still higher 0 8 4 t ha 1 y 1 than in other sides 0 0 8 t ha 1 y 1 in all plots featured with vbss sy at plot borders was limited to 0 t ha 1 y 1 table 4 on the whole area the sl was reduced by 65 dropping from 0 172 t ha 1 y 1 at s0 to 0 061 t ha 1 y 1 at s1 with a huge impact on the suspended sediment amounts reduced by 89 table 4 the mitigative effect of nbss was particularly remarkable on sediment losses since they positively reduce the erosivity of fall and winter rainfall affecting bare soils between cash crop cycles the different distribution of rainfall events predicted by rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios characterized by more concentrated less frequent and intense rainfall events implied a significant variation of susceptibility maps for both runoff and sediment loss specifically due to the reduction of rainfall depth an overall limitation of runoff depth was observed this was mainly noticeable in the gioia area where the complex runoff distribution was coupled with the soil texture composed of clay loams and silty clay loams the om slightly influenced the runoff variation instead moving from rcp4 5 to rcp8 5 further remarked this trend conversely the different distribution of rainfall events predicted by the future climate scenarios exhibited a more intense erosive rainfall capacity given the more intense and concentrated events 4 conclusions the present study is one of the few applications of the swat model at the field scale feed with very high resolution data the modelling activity was addressed to assess the nbss effectiveness in mitigating runoff and soil erosion hazards under flat and conventional agriculture conditions the influence of soil texture organic matter content and slight topographic variations were explored by considering two different experimental sites showing homogeneous morphological and climate conditions instead given the unavailability of gauge data to calibrate the model the study was based on a relative base comparing modelling results for the nbs scenarios including vbss and or ccs with a baseline control scenario without any conservation practices modelling data were compared with the recordings of previous experimental studies which verified the consistency of model results the same approach was used to test the nbss performance against climate changes in future scenarios with both mild and strong variations rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively to this aim 12 different scenarios were modelled to assess the effects on runoff and sediment loss the study showed that flow accumulation might occur in flat agricultural areas especially beside channels and streams determining high runoff volumes and consequently peaks of sediment losses over large areas results also highlighted the influence of soil texture on runoff generation remarking that significant variations are expected where fine grained mineral soils outcrop such settings are well represented in the southwestern part of the catchment of lake massaciuccoli where the gioia test area is located here agricultural soils are silty and clay loams characterized by low permeability in such conditions the adverse effects of flow accumulation were much more evident indeed when more concentrated rainfalls as expected for future climate scenarios occur the behaviour of soils with different textures was stressed especially in terms of runoff volumes showed larger ranges and the highest values were recorded for fine grained soils under such extreme conditions the nbss ensured the highest mitigation effect on soil erosion resulting in a valuable tool to improve the environmental friendliness of cropping systems on the contrary when soils are coarse grain sized with high organic matter content like those characterizing the eastern part of the lake massaciuccoli area where the studiati test area is placed the runoff was correlated to the average annual rainfall rather than to the rainfall intensity therefore the predicted reduction of rainfall depths corresponded to the ubiquitous low values of runoff and soil erosion in this case the mitigating effects of the tested nbss were significantly reduced with such pedological settings this trend was further emphasized when extreme climate changes were considered and the mitigative effect of nbss on long term analyses became negligible this implies that the nbss ability to limit runoff and soil erosion was strongly influenced by soil texture organic matter content water flow accumulation and rainfall distribution concerning the effects of different nbs types simulations showed that vbss reduced both runoff and sediment losses especially when the overall mitigation effect of nbss was more significant ccs could limit solid transport significantly having only a secondary effect on the generation of runoff volumes although the study concerned an ungauged system that did not allow us to perform the calibration and validation procedures the availability of very detailed input data and the comparison with the results of previous research activities supported the reliability of the simulations demonstrating the suitability of swat in hydrological modelling of vbss and ccs even on at local scale the evaluation of the role that the nbss could exert within all the cultivated areas surrounding lake massaciuccoli represents one of the most promising implications for the future development of this research in this way from the authors point of view this work represents the starting point to assess whether these measures may represent an effective solution to limit the sediment loads delivered each year to the lake the transport of soil particles is the main threat to water quality in terms of landfill and eutrophication swat enabled to model all these aspects and proved to be a viable approach also on the field scale the widespread adoption of nbss could be thus intended as a long lasting and cheap solution to restore the water quality of lake massaciuccoli as

9287,nature based solutions nbss are implemented worldwide to mitigate the impact of industrial agriculture on sediment and nutrient losses however their effectiveness depends on site specific features such as surficial hydrology soil permeability and erodability this study analyzed the effects of vegetative buffer strips vbss and winter cover crops ccs in a land reclamation area of the catchment of lake massaciuccoli central italy by modelling water and soil dynamics at a very detailed scale using a novel approach based on high resolution input data to this aim swat was applied on digital terrain models dtms from close range photogrammetry land cover mapping real crop rotations and a detailed calendar of farming practices nbss behaviour was investigated in two test areas namely the studiati and the gioia areas with uniform geomorphological settings but different soil types and annual crop rotations nbs effects were compared with a baseline control scenario without nbss and assessed under future climate conditions rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 specifically vbss and ccs showed different capabilities in mitigating runoff and sediment losses and their combination provided maximum effectiveness for the current climate scenarios the implementation of vbss produced a reduction of runoff depth of about 41 and 64 in the studiati and gioia areas respectively whereas showing a limited with the ccs implementation under the future climate conditions similar patterns were observed even if predicting significantly lower runoff depths the sediment loss reduction was in the order of 79 and 64 in studiati and gioia areas respectively concerning soil and water dynamics the study remarked that slight topographic irregularities on flat morphologies can trigger concentrated flows responsible for high runoff and sediment losses furthermore the differences in soil texture and organic matter content affected soil erodability rate on a local scale driving the consistency of nbs mitigating effects future climate changes scenarios exhibiting higher temperature and rarer but more concentrated rainfall events emphasize the impact of different soil types results observed at a very local scale with a spatialization of a few square meters which clearly relates to the types of crop rotations nbss and soil distribution noticed that swat is a suitable tool to aid farmers in

dale and polasky 2007 montgomery 2007 in temperate areas these phenomena are mainly triggered by rainfall patterns linsley 1967 peel and mcmahon 2020 other predisposing causes affecting soil erosion are soil texture organic matter content land cover and land use slope angle and length and adoption of agricultural conservation practices arnaez et al 2007 bryan and poesen 1989 dodd and sharpley 2016 githui et al 2009 kinnell and risse 1998 lasanta et al 2000 liu et al 2000 loague 1992 nasta et al 2017 ruiz colmenero et al 2013 sajikumar and remya 2015 saxton and rawls 2006 shanshan et al 2018 sharpley 1985 tuppad et al 2010 wallace et al 2017 williams 1975 in agricultural areas where annual crops are largely widespread the stage of plant growth strongly affects the rainfall runoff ratio burkart 2010 and consequently the soil erosion rate many different conservation practices are applied worldwide to mitigate such effects reichenberger et al 2007 wezel et al 2014 by acting on local morphology and environmental settings e g contour farming strip cropping minimum or zero tillage often coupling with conservation practices several types of nature based solutions nbss have been introduced such as the integration of both perennial and annual crops in rotations weißhuhn et al 2017 wick et al 2017 the insertion of cover crops ccs dabney et al 2001 fageria et al 2005 lu et al 2000 and the use of vegetative buffer strips vbss along the field borders dillaha et al 1989 zhang et al 2010 they can limit surficial runoff and consequently soil erosion by enhancing the water infiltration rate intercepting surface water flow and increasing sediment trapping efficacy borin et al 2005 dillaha et al 1989 vbss and ccs are considered the most feasible mitigation measures in conventional agriculture especially where other conservation practices are unsuitable due to morphological or economic matters however their actual effectiveness depends on the site specific conditions reichenberger et al 2007 stehle et al 2016 xuyang zhang et al 2010 for example abu zreig et al 2004 tested the effectiveness of vbss at varying both the strip geometry width and length and the vegetation species in a field experiment several authors analyzed the effect of converging and or diverging flows in vbs areas helmers et al 2005 stehle et al 2016 white and arnold 2009 in their review zhang et al 2010 analyzed the influence of soil type on the vbss performance in pollutant removal as a function of the drainage ability observing that their impact is statistically no significant on the other hand the scientific literature lacks evidence on how soil texture and organic matter content can affect the vbss and ccs mitigation effectiveness the nbss efficacy can be evaluated by monitoring borin et al 2005 or modelling scenarios before and after the implementation the comparison of different approaches enables to predict the level of mitigation and the residual hazard of a post operam scenario under variable pedo climatic conditions many models have been developed to assess the effectiveness of different nbss focusing on runoff and solid transport they work on different scales and with different approaches ranging from entirely empirical ghosal and das bhattacharya 2020 renard et al 1991 to physically based ones abu zreig et al 2001 arnold et al 2012 bieger et al 2017 gassman et al 2014 shrestha et al 2021 up to models that directly simulate the pollutant routing oecd 2000 probst et al 2005 stehle et al 2016 the choice of the most suitable model is mainly driven by both the specific phenomena to be investigated and the type of mitigation measures adopted nbss in this case afterwards the morphological geological and hydrological features of the investigated area the working scale and the data availability have to be carefully taken into account aleotti and chowdhury 1999 chung and fabbri 1999 fell et al 2008 hervás and bobrowsky 2009 hungr 2018 van westen et al 2006 the simplest models rely on the revised universal soil loss equation rusle ghosal and das bhattacharya 2020 renard et al 1991 in connection with the low need for site specific data however the rusle based models cannot simulate runoff volumes and are more designed to be used at regional or catchment scales rather than at field scale outputs of this set of models are very sensitive to soil morphology especially to slope steepness renard et al 1991 thus having low feasibility to flat areas physically based models such as vsfmod abu zreig et al 2001 munoz caprina et al 1992 can successfully estimate the vbss effectiveness providing reliable results especially when diversifying the analysis at varying the flow concentration across vbss abu zreig et al 2001 the model simulates the transport of agrochemicals such as pesticides and nutrients however it explicitly focuses on vbss and cannot simulate the effects of other mitigation measures such as ccs moreover it is high data demanding especially for large scale applications abu zreig et al 2001 gericke et al 2020 munoz caprina et al 1992 and it runs on a single rainfall event thus resulting unreliable for seasonal or annual simulations finally it provides only one dimensional simulations without considering the interactions in space and time rouzies et al 2019 for this reason it is more suitable for design purposes rather than for the assessment of spatial hazard process based chemical transport models such as rextox oecd 2000 probst et al 2005 were effectively applied to investigate the spatial distribution of runoff and the routed pesticides and nutrients at different levels as well as at the field scale stehle et al 2016 however they work on individual rainfall events without simulating the sediment transport swat bieger et al 2017 dile et al 2016 gassman et al 2014 is a fully revised version of soil water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2014 that adopts a comprehensive modelling approach based on spatial data such as digital terrain models dtms soil maps land use and weather data it enables to investigate different types of phenomena affecting water and soil dynamics and provides for an estimation of runoff sediment loss and streamflow resulting from runoff and lateral flow arnold and allen 1999 zhao et al 2013 swat applications were made under many different conditions including the field scale karki et al 2020 sinnathamby et al 2017 and flat agricultural areas bosch et al 2004 donmez et al 2020 many authors applied swat to assess the effects of mitigation measures such as vbss and ccs arabi et al 2008 himanshu et al 2019 merriman et al 2018 phomcha et al 2012 ullrich and volk 2009 white and arnold 2009 and produced spatialized results through maps into gis platforms dile et al 2021 moreover swat can be used to simulate phenomena over long periods long term dynamics as well as seasonal trends arnold et al 1998 2012 when used for high spatial temporal resolution estimations the model is highly demanding in terms of both the accuracy of input data soil properties farming practices and climate data and computational capacity yalew et al 2013 this issue is strictly related to the calibrated or non calibrated use of the model originally swat was implemented for large scale ungauged catchments to evaluate spatial and temporal differences in hydrological behaviour and associated solute and sediment transport without or with little calibration efforts santhi et al 2001 shi et al 2011 although many authors have underlined afterwards the significance of the calibration stage in improving the consistency of model estimates daggupati et al 2015 niraula et al 2011 other studies have proved that input parameters can be successfully set up by using readily available gis data previously developed or default values thus bypassing the calibration step under many different hydrologic and geographic conditions srinivasan et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 moreover calibration besides being high time and computational resource demanding may force parameter values towards optimization objectives biasing the variables not included in calibration zhang et al 2009 2011 in the frame of this work application to an ungauged system on field scale we based the use of swat on the uncommon availability of detailed and high spatial resolution input data that by reducing the empirical residue of the model should balance the lack of calibration and improve the reliability of estimates despite several models available in the literature no applications are currently available on a detailed scale based on high resolution input data to test the swat reliability to simulate the spatial effectiveness of nbss in addition few papers have dealt with the investigation of the open field effects of vbss and ccs in conventional cropping systems because of the effort required for monitoring wide areas the employment of models enables to deal with this issue and observed results can support farmers in new crop systems design they also allow assessing the nbss benefits in limiting the water quality degradation caused by solid soil transport processes this study investigated the swat application to a flat area under conventional agriculture where vbss and ccs were adopted in two different experimental sites within the reclamation area surrounding lake massaciuccoli central italy it aimed at assessing the nbss suitability and effectiveness by simulating the main hydrological processes that occurred in the experimental area specifically the nbss design scenario s1 post operam with the current adoption of vbss and ccs was compared with a baseline control one s0 ante operam without any nbss considering different climate scenarios in such a way the nbss effectiveness in reducing nutrient losses by intercepting the runoff and the sediments routed by surficial waters was thoroughly estimated and analyzed the experimental sites considered in modelling are located in the same geomorphological setting but exhibit contrasting soil types mineral soils and peat soils this enabled to assess the effect of soil types on the nbs effectiveness providing new evidence on this scarcely investigated topic the detailed analysis hereafter reported can be thus intended as a starting point to evaluate the cost benefit ratios of nbss and then upscale the investigated solutions to wider areas e g to the whole lake catchment obtained results can be used to support farmers in cropping systems design and to test the agricultural models able to limit the degradation of water quality 2 methods 2 1 the test sites the study was carried out on two test sites located in the westernmost part of the serchio river basin a few kilometres to the north of the river outlet and to the south of the lake massaciuccoli here one of italy s most important residual marshy areas was partially reclaimed in the 1920 s in favour of two large areas the vecchiano sub catchment located to the south west side and the lake massaciuccoli sub catchment to the south east one brunelli and cannicci 1942 cenni 1997 these areas were then turned into an agricultural plain mechanically drained by a network of artificial channels a set of pumping stations installed along the main draining channels conveys water from the agricultural plain toward the lake to ensure a water table depth suitable for cultivation flow direction can be reversed during the summer to satisfy the needs of crop irrigation the reclamation areas are characterized by fluvial to lacustrine surficial deposits ranging from silty clays to the south which gradually change to sands moving northward the organic content of the soils remarkably increases when approaching the lake ranging from 3 in the southern part up to 55 close to the southernmost lake embankments fig 1 intensive agriculture developed in the area since 1970 s contributed to increase the nutrient content in water through both base flow and secondly runoff other significant nutrient sources consisted of two wastewater treatment plants since 2011 only one of 4250 person equivalent is working and the production of n and p soluble compounds due to the soil organic matter mineralization caused by the drainage of peat soils surrounding the lake because of all these contributions the lake water resulted in eutrophic and then its status is seriously harmed bathing and fishing are still forbidden brunelli and cannicci 1942 cenni 1997 pistocchi et al 2012 silvestri et al 2017 the reclamation has been unavoidable due to the shallow groundwater depth that in many points of the lake catchment could reach the soil level when the pumping plants don t work thus preventing cultivation these conditions further worsen the groundwater quality due to seawater intrusion from the west resulting in a trigger for salinization and seepage from the lake embankments pistocchi et al 2012 rossetto et al 2010 the drainage also provokes the subsidence of the whole agricultural area because of physical compaction and bio chemical processes peat oxidation baldaccini 2018 so that the soil quote dropped up to 3 m below the sea level the role interplayed by peat oxidation soil subsidence and conventional industrial agriculture resulted in several hazardous phenomena ranging from groundwater and surficial water pollution to soil erosion and flooding the latter threatened the environmental and economical resources as well as people living in the area and led to a complex ad extended risk arrangement to address such issues local authorities led by the autorità di bacino distrettuale dell appennino settentrionale a b d a s implemented a series of nbss measures throughout the catchment among these we considered two test sites namely the studiati area to the north and the gioia area to the south within the catchment of lake massaciuccoli where the following measures were implemented i vbss featured with perennial grass species along the edges of some cultivated fields ii adoption of techniques of conservative agriculture by planting winter ccs and adopting minimum tillage systems silvestri et al 2017 the two test areas studiati and gioia fig 2 extend for 19 9 104 m2 and 36 7 104 m2 including 33 and 39 different plots respectively with individual sizes ranging from 5000 m2 to 11000 m2 in the studiati test site vbss and ccs were implemented on 14 plots with just 3 of them interested by coupling both measures fig 2a thus resulting in a cumulative area of 7 7 104 m2 with ccs and of 6 0 104 m2 draining towards vbss they correspond to 38 7 and 30 1 of the whole areas respectively in the gioia test site vbss and ccs were implemented on 14 plots with just 2 of them interested by coupling both measures fig 2b instead the resulting cumulative area of ccs is 13 0 104 m2 and the cumulative area draining towards vbss is 11 6 104 m2 corresponding to 35 4 and 31 6 of the whole areas respectively 2 2 swat modelling modelling the effectiveness of vbss and ccs in mitigating runoff and sediment losses was carried out with qswat v 2 0 6 dile et al 2021 and swat editor v 2 0 4 bieger et al 2017 the input data and the required accuracy mainly depend on the assessment scale they concern 1 soil properties which can derive from general soil maps developed by the us department of agriculture usda schwarz and alexander 1995 soil survey staff 2021 by fao fao 1974 or by user soil data 2 dtm at proper resolution 1 30 m for application at regional to watershed scale less than 1 m for application at field scale 3 land use maps at the suitable scale 4 weather data which can be derived from both local weather stations or climate forecasting system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 soil databases and cfsr meteorological data have proved to return reliable results especially for small scale applications in data scarce contexts such as in developing countries alemayehu et al 2016 barakat et al 2022 bressiani et al 2015 cuceloglu and ozturk 2019 dile and srinivasan 2014 mararakanye et al 2020 roth and lemann 2016 valipour 2017 conversely for large scale applications high resolution data enhance the reliability of the modelling results gassman et al 2014 kannan et al 2019 muttiah and wurbs 2002 2 2 1 digital terrain modelling dtm the dtm used for simulations fig 3 was built up by using close range photogrammetry giordan et al 2018 james and robson 2014 remondino and el hakim 2006 westoby et al 2012 carried out by the centre of geotecnologies https geotecnologie unisi it person comm in the whole massaciuccoli reclamation area hence encompassing both study areas with a ground sampling distance of 4 7 cm x pixel 1 and an average georeferencing error of 0 16 m after data processing and filtering a dtm was extracted for the whole area with a 0 20 m cell size fig 3 due to the high resolution of the digital model and the resulting dm scale roughness of the surface coupling with the flat morphology of the area the dtm post process was required to make it consistent with the hydrological network detected in the field this is essential in flat agricultural areas where the natural hydrographic network is poor and the drainage system is made of artificial channels with limited width and depth donmez et al 2020 furthermore for photogrammetry derived dtms the poor data quality in areas with dense vegetation cover often typical of wet areas such as ditch and stream banks represented a relevant barrier to the effective design of the hydrographic network in some cases returning unphysical modelling results luo et al 2011 post processing was thus unavoidable to properly delineate both the draining network and the watersheds hydrological consistent stream networks and watershed delineation can be pursued using different approaches namely 1 by applying the automatic channel network burn in function of swat dile et al 2016 2 by manually modifying dtm and carving channels and streams based on field measurements both approaches require the preliminary field delineation of the hydrographic network and its measurements the former enables to automatically decrease the dtm elevation along the user defined polylines of the channel network dile et al 2016 in some cases the automatic burn in function may not provide reliable results especially where either 3d models of channel paths are quite noisy or channel road crossings are frequent altering the morphology and continuity of the channels paths in these cases and when channels have peculiar shapes that the user would include in the modelling the second approach for dtm post processing proves to be the most suitable one in such a case the shape and depth of channels are required for properly carving the dtm in gis environment in this work the automatic delineation of watersheds returned unphysical results for both areas indeed in the gioia area 17 of the agricultural land was neglected from watershed delineation following a slight slope opposite to the drainage direction fig 3a whereas in the studiati area the modelling overlooked 30 of the studied area given the inverted draining direction of the watershed provoked by both the noisiness of the digital model along channels and the frequent road crossings fig 3c based on the inconsistencies of the automatic watershed delineation dtm post processing was differentiated between the two areas the gentle approach based on the burn in function was applied to the gioia site using the shapefile of the draining network surveyed in the field providing reliable results with both watershed and stream networks fig 3b the manual carving was adopted at the studiati site to delineate the watershed and channel network instead field topographical surveys of the channel sections allowed the implementation of a triangular irregular network tin 3d model of the channel network depths below the ground level were used in tin creation instead of elevations and tin was then converted into a raster for map algebra in qgis software qgis org 2021 conversely road crossings were replaced by linear interpolation of the channels geometries the resulting post processed dtm was then used for the automatic delineation of watershed and produced results matching the real draining network and watershed fig 3d 2 2 2 soil maps soil data input in swat is in the form of indexed raster maps with associated look up tables that link the soil indexes to the soil properties bieger et al 2017 dile et al 2021 indexes of soil raster maps represent homogeneous soil units having a univocal set of soil parameters at the study areas soil maps and tables were built based on the soil samples parameters suggested by silvestri et al 2002 soil sample spatial density was constant over the whole massaciuccoli reclamation area with an average value of 0 2 samples ha which resulted in 12 and 17 soil samples collected in the studiati and the gioia area respectively fig 4 soil parameters available for samples were soil granulometry percentage of sand silt and clay usda classification of soil textures usda 1999 per cent content of organic matter om ph electrical conductivity ec albedo ratio a and caco3 per cent content the empirical pedo transfer functions allowed calculating the additional parameters required for swat modelling they were applied to each soil sample based on soil texture and organic matter content specifically for bulk density bd the empirical eqs 1 and 2 from

measurements on soils with similar textures and organic content in similar contexts for soils with high organic contents om 20 a constant value of ksat 1 8 mm x h 1 was set based on the authors knowledge all the soil parameters were mapped over the whole area by interpolating each variable fig 4 the regular spacing of samples and the lack of significant auto correlation detected in preliminary analyses enabled to perform the natural neighbour interpolation to get raster maps rasters of sand silt and clay contents were then matched to classify the texture of each cell according to the usda soil ranking system usda 1999 to convert the soil texture into a polygonal shapefile fig 5a the organic matter content was also classified and vectorized fig 5b the soil texture and the organic content map were overlayed to create the map of soil units fig 5c which represented areas for zonal statistics based on rasters of soil parameters to compute averages to be set as input data of the swat user soil database dile et al 2021 2 2 3 land use maps high resolution orthophoto represented the core to map the land use and land covers supported by high resolution dtm 0 20 m cell size both cadastral maps and actual crop plans this allowed detecting single land parcels characterized by different crop rotations and agricultural practices fig 6a d in turn resulting in different agricultural land use units along with these narrow rural unpaved roads small ditches and stream vegetated banks were also mapped as individual land use units fig 6b e moreover given the small scale of the study the actual extension of the implemented vbss was delineated as polygonal areas and handled as individual land cover units with specific agricultural practices this allowed overcoming hurdles in modelling the concentrated flow across vbss which represents an essential feature for properly predicting the effects on runoff and sediment transport reduction dosskey et al 2002 helmers et al 2005 white and arnold 2009 a similar approach was applied to differentiate the areas where different agricultural techniques were adopted fig 6c f land use maps were thus generated for both the s0 fig 6b e and the s1 scenarios fig 6c f agricultural land units exhibiting conventional and conservative agriculture were processed according to the crop rotations schemes table 2 and agricultural operations calendars provided by farm owners for each crop type 2 2 4 climate data to assess the impacts of climate change on the nbss effectiveness we compared the modelling results for s1 and s0 under different climate conditions namely i current climate conditions ii mild future climate variations iii strong climate variations the last two represent the rcp ipcc 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios respectively clarke et al 2007 meinshausen et al 2011 moss et al 2008 moss et al 2010 rao and riahi 2006 furthermore the simulations included the furthest period available with global circulation models and climate scenarios years up to 2100 to evaluate long term climate variations the historical weather data used for simulations were based on the recordings of the metato weather station located 4 8 km far from the south of the studied areas having the same morphological and environmental settings rainfall temperature humidity wind velocity and direction and solar radiation with 15 min time intervals are available and freely accessible from the regional hydrological and geological sector of tuscany portal tuscany region 2021 temperature and rainfall data were recorded since 1990 with few gaps generally due to brief periodical maintenance activities conversely solar radiation humidity and wind data have been available since 2010 similarly to calendars of agricultural operations the 2010 2015 timespan resulted in the most complete and continuous period for swat simulations weather data for future scenarios were modelled with climate change toolkit cct ashraf vaghefi et al 2017 for the distant future climate changes consistently with the adopted climate approach data downscaling and bias correction were carried out to calibrate future weather data ahmed et al 2013 hempel et al 2013 ines and hansen 2006 teutschbein and seibert 2012 downscaling was carried out based on rainfall and temperature data collected by 3 different weather stations close to the area table 3 located in similar morphological and climate settings these provided critical data over a sufficiently large overlapping time interval 1996 2005 although the time span used for future climate model calibration doesn t fit that used for modelling the current climate scenario it was chosen because of the better control given by the simultaneous recording of all the considered weather stations not available for the following periods the three weather stations are those installed in lido di camaiore strettoia and metato localities tuscany region 2021 historical data from 5 global circulation models gcm 1 gfdl esm2m gcm 2 hadgem2 es gcm 3 ipsl cm5a lr gcm 4 miroc gcm 5 noeresm1 m available with the cct hempel et al 2013 moss et al 2008 stocker et al 2013 were compared with downscaled observed historical data considering both uncorrected data and bias corrected data both downscaling and calibration were performed on daily data whereas the comparison to select the most suitable model was based on the average monthly cumulative rainfall depths for the whole investigated period results of metato station are reported in fig 7 and root mean square error rmse was estimated to assess the best gcm model fig 8 gcm4 miroc returned the highest correlation in terms of rainfall fig 8a whereas gcm3 gave the lowest scatter for temperature nevertheless given the comparable result with gcm4 and the greater interest in rainfall variation gcm4 was applied to model future weather data for both rcp 4 5 mild and rcp 8 5 strong climate change scenarios referred to the 2095 2100 timespan fig 7 2 3 data processing the implemented modelling was based on high resolution dtms soil maps land covers and management data which enabled to assess the nbss performance and the agricultural practice effects lasanta et al 2000 probst et al 2005 williams 2015 with ground resolutions of few square meters spatial units used in the modelling were the uniform hydrological response units hrus ranging from 1 m2 to 1500 m2 among the possible swat outputs the study focused on the hrus runoff and sediment yield triggered by water erosion runoff was estimated for the surface component and thus intended as the annual amount of surficial water leaving the hrus sediment yield represents the sediment mobilized at each hru instead since sediment yielded by a hru can be deposited in downstream areas aimed at estimating the real impact of rainfall on soil erosion we accounted only for the amount of sediments that reaches the field ditches and leaves the cultivated areas as a soil loss this implies that the effects on soil erosion are reported as average annual amounts of remobilized sediment sediment yield sy suspended sediment loss ssl and total sediment loss sl runoff and soil erosion estimation was thus the proxy to investigate the nbss effectiveness at the two test sites of studiati and gioia in the massaciuccoli reclamation agricultural area the nbss scenario s1 including the implementation of vbss and ccs was compared with the ante operam scenario s0 which was based on the usual farming practices adopted by local farmers conventional tillage no cover crops and no buffer strips under the abovementioned different climate conditions current rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 results from s0 and s1 scenarios were given in the form of susceptibility maps compared in figs 9 11 and synthesized in table 4 here the results are reported as both simulated annual values of runoff ro mm y 1 and transported sediments sy t ha 1 y 1 averaged for areas where the nbss vgss and ccs were implemented aimed at investigating the changes triggered by the nbs implementation on the other hand simulated values of suspended ssl t ha 1 y 1 and total sediment losses the latter including the bed load portion sl t ha 1 y 1 were averaged over the whole experimental area under the s0 and s1 scenarios 3 results and discussion simulations were performed for both s0 and s1 scenarios under three different climate configurations i current climate scenario ii rcp 4 5 future climate scenario and iii rcp 8 5 future climate scenario the modelled climatic trend for future scenarios implied a decrease in the average yearly cumulative rainfall depth from 73 18 mm y 1 to 66 95 mm y 1 for rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively nevertheless the average monthly cumulative rainfall depth strongly depended on the seasons showing more concentrated rainfall events during fall and winter the temperature increase was observed for both scenarios reaching an average yearly increase of 2 54 c peak of 4 93 c during summer season at rcp 4 5 and 4 54 c peak of 9 50 c during summer season at rcp 8 5 3 1 current climate scenario when simulating the current climate for ante operam s0 given the flat morphology of the sites a limited runoff was experienced in both areas observing average medium to low annual depths specifically the studiati area returned the lowest runoff ranging from 15 to 130 mm y 1 74 mm y 1 on average except for the sections along the rural roads which exhibited an average value of 831 mm y 1 fig 9a the latter was very close to the average annual precipitation of 1178 mm y 1 conversely on average the gioia area showed higher runoff depth and more complex spatial distribution ranging from 40 to 100 mm y 1 fig 9e greater runoff depths were detected along the plot edges uphill to the first order channels draining the area by exceeding 110 mm y 1 this was due to the influence of the local topography presenting areas penchant to flow accumulation and thus high runoff depths as for the studiati area higher runoff depths occurred along the rural roads also achieving 800 mm y 1 nevertheless against the former in the studiati area this was mainly emphasized on the western side of the parcel whereas lower intensity was detected on the opposite side as expected in both areas the higher the runoff depth the greater the sl showing lower effects on the inner side of each plot whereas presenting higher rates around the borders where flow accumulation occurs specifically in the studiati area fig 9b despite the overall reduced sy estimated in the range of 0 0 2 t ha 1 y 1 a sediment production of 6 7 t ha 1 y 1 was achieved along the borders the channel paths and the rural roads thus emphasizing the significant effects of channelized flows on sediment removal in the studiati area the average total sediment loss was 0 539 t ha 1 y 1 while the average suspended sediment loss deployed at 0 443 t ha 1 y 1 similarly in the gioia area the innermost parts of the plots exhibited low sediment loss ranging between 0 and 0 2 t x ha 1 nevertheless the influence of flow accumulation was even more prevalent with sediment loss reaching 34 t x ha 1 along both the channel paths and the plot borders fig 9f this effect was strictly related to soil composition thus resulting in greater relevance in the eastern side of the area which is mainly composed of clay and silty clay fig 5c no evident correlation was observed with the om instead although the sy still showed high values at the plot borders in the remaining part of the plot it never exceeded 8 t ha 1 this implied that the sl at the gioia area was higher than the studiati s exceeding 0 6 t ha 1 y 1 table 4 the nbss implementation in both areas significantly reduced runoff depth along the plots borders where vbss were implemented in these areas runoff amounts dropped to average depths around 44 mm y 1 and 30 mm y 1 at the studiati and gioia areas respectively table 4 the s1 showed a reduction of runoff depth of 41 and 64 at studiati and gioia areas respectively where vbss were implemented the benefits of ccs were irrelevant with a few percentage rates improvement several studies proved that flow accumulation negatively affects vbss performance abu zreig et al 2001 stehle et al 2016 white and arnold 2009 nevertheless in the study areas especially in the gioia s runoff reduction generally occurred along the vbss with average depths halved from 80 mm y 1 to 40 mm y 1 especially in areas where concentrated flows occurred conversely in areas with ccs the decrease in runoff depths was almost negligible fig 9c g and table 4 when considering soil erosion the benefits from coupling both nbss were much more evident along the channels and the plots borders with channelized flows fig 9d h in greater detail in the studiati area a sl decrease of about 79 was observed lowering to 0 114 t ha 1 y 1 table 4 with predominant impacts in areas of flow accumulation along the channel s paths fig 9 the reduction was more relevant for the ssl which decreased by 84 up to 0 073 t ha 1 y 1 table 4 the mitigative effect of both types of nbss was noticeable also in the gioia area where sl was limited to 0 218 t ha 1 y 1 table 4 thus implying a decrease of 64 compared to the ante operam scenario s0 this also reduced ssl to 0 067 t ha 1 y 1 table 4 corresponding to 20 of the ssl at s0 specifically where ccs or vbss were implemented even where not coupled peaks of sy disappeared and the highest average areal values never exceeded 4 t ha 1 y 1 fig 9h the soil erosion reduction was more appreciated in the central side parcel 253 5 table 2 where sunflower durum wheat rotations were interspersed with winter cover crops oats and legumes the predicted values of soil losses under current climatic conditions 2010 2015 lied within the range of variation reported for the exact locations by silvestri et al 2017 by comparing different cropping systems table 4 during a two year field experiment the suspended sediment loss for plots under conventional cultivation ranged between 0 374 and 0 315 t ha 1 y 1 at on peat soil studiati and between 0 557 and 0 744 t ha 1 y 1 on loamy soils gioia conversely the sediment collected from the strip tilled plots equipped with buffer strips 1 0 m wide along the field ditches resulted significantly lower 0 194 0 204 and 0 197 0 261 t ha 1 y 1 for studiati and gioia area respectively considering that the modelling was carried out in an ungauged system which prevented robust model calibration and validation although the convergence of the estimates from the modelling with the measured data cannot exactly replace the validation process the correlation between simulated and observed data corroborates the consistency of the modelling results 3 2 rcp 4 5 future climatic scenario the effects of climate change were estimated by comparing the s0 and s1 scenarios in long future climate 2095 2100 accounting for climate changes set by the rcp 4 5 fig 10 and rcp 8 5 scenarios fig 11 and modelled using the gcm4 miroc a possible future scenario characterized by mild climate change resulted in a rainfall reduction to 898 mm y 1 much more concentrated during the winter and less frequent and intense during summer than the current conditions fig 7 modelled temperature is generally higher than the current one with an average increase of 2 54 c and peak values of 4 93 c during summer such a climatic increment induced two different behaviours in the investigated areas on the one hand consistently with the general reduction of rainfall depth in the studiati area low runoff depths were predicted widespread fig 10a mainly ranging between 0 and 20 mm y 1 with an average of 5 0 mm y 1 this corresponds to a reduction of 87 and 93 of the average runoff depth against the current climate scenario where vbss and ccs were implemented respectively peak values were again observed just along the rural roads exceeding 450 mm y 1 table 4 thus corresponding to a 46 reduction in the current climate scenario on the other hand in the gioia area the runoff distribution was much more complex fig 10e indeed it ranged over a larger interval 20 160 mm y 1 compared to current climate modelling 40 80 mm y 1 the lowest values in the northeast ranged between 0 and 80 mm y 1 in the central and southwestern parts it mostly ranged between 40 and 160 mm y 1 instead moreover the runoff distribution followed the soil texture patterns with the highest values achieved where clay loams and silty clay loams outcropped remarking the increasing influence of soil texture in climate conditions characterized by drier weather conversely no clear correlation was found with om which never exceeded 4 unlike the current climate scenario runoff did not significantly increase at the plot borders where it did not exceed 80 mm y 1 rural roads showed the highest runoff values exceeding 400 mm y 1 whereas channel and stream embankments characterized by covers of perennial grass always returned runoff depths not higher than 80 mm y 1 mild climate change at the studiati area induced trends in soil erosion matching the runoff with a general reduction remarked by sl decreasing of 99 from 0 539 to 0 003 t ha 1 y 1 table 4 sediment losses reflect the very low sediment yield modelled at each hru 0 0 2 t ha 1 y 1 showing on average 0 1 t ha 1 y 1 slightly higher values were limited to major stream embankments and rural roads ranging between 0 2 and 0 8 t ha 1 y 1 fig 10b in the gioia area according to lower rainfall sediment losses decreased over the whole area fig 10f with the lowest values modelled in the innermost areas of the plots where they ranged between 0 and 0 2 t ha 1 y 1 nevertheless zones of high sediment production were detected along the plot borders especially in parcels 253 5 and 60 248 6 where they varied in the interval 4 16 t ha 1 y 1 in substantially limited areas in parcel 251 4 sediment loss persisted higher along the borders while never exceeding 2 t ha 1 y 1 the sl modelled for s0 in the area was significantly lower than current climate modelling 80 with an average value of about 0 123 t ha 1 y 1 considering the generally low runoff and sediment loss modelled at the studiati area for rcp 4 5 the nbss effects were highly reduced accordingly in fact throughout the cultivated area s1 showed no significant variations in the runoff than s0 fig 10c and table 4 and no discrepancies were detected between vbss and ccs similarly the nbss mitigative effect was negligible for sediment production and loss fig 10d and table 4 conversely in the gioia area the runoff depth lowered along the plot borders with vbss where it was limited to 30 mm y 1 fig 10g and table 4 plots featured with ccs did not show any significant variations of runoff depth table 4 instead resulting in an essential constancy in both scenarios soil erosion was significantly mitigated by both vbss and ccs fig 10h with losses being reduced by 50 varying from 0 123 t ha 1 y 1 at s0 to 0 062 t ha 1 y 1 at s1 3 3 rcp 8 5 future climate scenario climate change modelled for rcp 8 5 resulted in a further average decrease of rainfall 738 mm x y 1 more concentrated during the fall and late wintertime than in the current setting the predicted temperature showed a general increase averaging around 4 54 c with peaks of 9 5 c during the summer fig 7 consistently with simulations of rcp 4 5 modelling carried out for this climate setting resulted in diverging trends for the two test sites in such conditions low runoff depths were predicted in the studiati area mostly ranging between 0 and 20 mm y 1 with on average 6 8 mm y 1 fig 11a as observed in the previous cases higher depths were predicted along the stream embankments ranging between 40 and 80 mm y 1 and along the rural roads where the highest runoff values attained 400 mm y 1 in the gioia area runoff prediction also presented low values although higher than the studiati s ranging between 0 and 80 mm y 1 with an average of 45 mm y 1 fig 11e the soil texture highly influenced its distribution indeed it reached slightly higher values 40 80 mm y 1 where silty clay loams with low organic content 3 and where clay loams with medium low organic content 5 outcropped as observed in the previous cases higher values were also recorded along the stream embankments considering soil erosion in the studiati area the modelled trends matched with the runoff fig 11b with very low sy values mainly attaining in the range 0 0 2 t ha 1 y 1 as for previous scenarios higher values characterized the rural roads reaching 2 05 t ha 1 y 1 nevertheless the sl predicted was highly lower 0 005 t ha 1 y 1 than that for the current climate setting table 4 in the gioia area the soil erosion experienced a slight increase with sl varying from 0 123 to 0 172 t ha 1 y 1 compared to the rcp 4 5 scenario this was explicitly noticeable when considering suspended component ssl from 0 018 to 0 062 t ha 1 y 1 thus remarking the enhanced erosive capacity of rainfall indeed although rainfalls exhibited lower annual depths moving from a monthly average depth of 72 12 mm y 1 at rcp 4 5 66 95 mm y 1 at rcp 8 5 they occurred as more extreme events concentrated over shorter periods especially during fall and late winter seasons i e soon after crop harvesting and before new cash crop planting precisely an increase in the monthly average depth was estimated in october and november moving from 101 15 to 124 97 mm y 1 and from 142 80 to 167 69 mm y 1 respectively february and march showed a monthly average depth increase from 74 12 to 77 42 and from 35 24 to 48 39 mm y 1 respectively modelled values were generally low in the central part of each plot disregarding differences in crop rotations and soil types fig 11f conversely they ranged between 2 and 27 t ha 1 y 1 in limited areas along the plot borders considering the nbss implementation no significant changes were detected in the studiati area fig 11c and table 4 the different behaviour shown by the two test sites is confirmed in the variable mitigative impacts of nbss indeed in the studiati area they showed scarce mitigation of runoff reduced from 6 to 2 mm y 1 just along vbss fig 11c and soil erosion sl reduced from 0 005 to 0 002 t ha 1 y 1 fig 11d on the contrary in the gioia area a significant mitigative effect of nbss was predicted for both runoff depth reduced from 53 to 25 mm y 1 just along vbss fig 11g and table 4 and sediment yield at hrus fig 11h however their effects in reducing sediment yield at hrus were much more relevant indeed the sy reduced to 0 01 t ha 1 y 1 in central areas of plots and to 4 t ha 1 y 1 along the borders the reduction was uniform in areas of ccs implementation although in the southeastern part sediment yielded was still higher 0 8 4 t ha 1 y 1 than in other sides 0 0 8 t ha 1 y 1 in all plots featured with vbss sy at plot borders was limited to 0 t ha 1 y 1 table 4 on the whole area the sl was reduced by 65 dropping from 0 172 t ha 1 y 1 at s0 to 0 061 t ha 1 y 1 at s1 with a huge impact on the suspended sediment amounts reduced by 89 table 4 the mitigative effect of nbss was particularly remarkable on sediment losses since they positively reduce the erosivity of fall and winter rainfall affecting bare soils between cash crop cycles the different distribution of rainfall events predicted by rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios characterized by more concentrated less frequent and intense rainfall events implied a significant variation of susceptibility maps for both runoff and sediment loss specifically due to the reduction of rainfall depth an overall limitation of runoff depth was observed this was mainly noticeable in the gioia area where the complex runoff distribution was coupled with the soil texture composed of clay loams and silty clay loams the om slightly influenced the runoff variation instead moving from rcp4 5 to rcp8 5 further remarked this trend conversely the different distribution of rainfall events predicted by the future climate scenarios exhibited a more intense erosive rainfall capacity given the more intense and concentrated events 4 conclusions the present study is one of the few applications of the swat model at the field scale feed with very high resolution data the modelling activity was addressed to assess the nbss effectiveness in mitigating runoff and soil erosion hazards under flat and conventional agriculture conditions the influence of soil texture organic matter content and slight topographic variations were explored by considering two different experimental sites showing homogeneous morphological and climate conditions instead given the unavailability of gauge data to calibrate the model the study was based on a relative base comparing modelling results for the nbs scenarios including vbss and or ccs with a baseline control scenario without any conservation practices modelling data were compared with the recordings of previous experimental studies which verified the consistency of model results the same approach was used to test the nbss performance against climate changes in future scenarios with both mild and strong variations rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively to this aim 12 different scenarios were modelled to assess the effects on runoff and sediment loss the study showed that flow accumulation might occur in flat agricultural areas especially beside channels and streams determining high runoff volumes and consequently peaks of sediment losses over large areas results also highlighted the influence of soil texture on runoff generation remarking that significant variations are expected where fine grained mineral soils outcrop such settings are well represented in the southwestern part of the catchment of lake massaciuccoli where the gioia test area is located here agricultural soils are silty and clay loams characterized by low permeability in such conditions the adverse effects of flow accumulation were much more evident indeed when more concentrated rainfalls as expected for future climate scenarios occur the behaviour of soils with different textures was stressed especially in terms of runoff volumes showed larger ranges and the highest values were recorded for fine grained soils under such extreme conditions the nbss ensured the highest mitigation effect on soil erosion resulting in a valuable tool to improve the environmental friendliness of cropping systems on the contrary when soils are coarse grain sized with high organic matter content like those characterizing the eastern part of the lake massaciuccoli area where the studiati test area is placed the runoff was correlated to the average annual rainfall rather than to the rainfall intensity therefore the predicted reduction of rainfall depths corresponded to the ubiquitous low values of runoff and soil erosion in this case the mitigating effects of the tested nbss were significantly reduced with such pedological settings this trend was further emphasized when extreme climate changes were considered and the mitigative effect of nbss on long term analyses became negligible this implies that the nbss ability to limit runoff and soil erosion was strongly influenced by soil texture organic matter content water flow accumulation and rainfall distribution concerning the effects of different nbs types simulations showed that vbss reduced both runoff and sediment losses especially when the overall mitigation effect of nbss was more significant ccs could limit solid transport significantly having only a secondary effect on the generation of runoff volumes although the study concerned an ungauged system that did not allow us to perform the calibration and validation procedures the availability of very detailed input data and the comparison with the results of previous research activities supported the reliability of the simulations demonstrating the suitability of swat in hydrological modelling of vbss and ccs even on at local scale the evaluation of the role that the nbss could exert within all the cultivated areas surrounding lake massaciuccoli represents one of the most promising implications for the future development of this research in this way from the authors point of view this work represents the starting point to assess whether these measures may represent an effective solution to limit the sediment loads delivered each year to the lake the transport of soil particles is the main threat to water quality in terms of landfill and eutrophication swat enabled to model all these aspects and proved to be a viable approach also on the field scale the widespread adoption of nbss could be thus intended as a long lasting and cheap solution to restore the water quality of lake massaciuccoli as

comprehensive evaluation method of distance which is widely used in engineering agriculture and economy and has achieved good results awasthi et al 2011 this model is advantageous because it could

frequency combinations at different temperatures the regression equations y 1 y 2 and y 3 for topsis comprehensive evaluation value in 2020f 2021s and 2021f used to determine the effects on the comprehensive growth of cucumber from at x 1 ia x 2 and ff x 3 are described as follows 28 y1 0 892 0 065 1 0 018 2 0 014 3 0 208 12 0 108 22 0 135 32 0 024 1x2 0 008 1x3 0 062 2x3 29 y2 0 931 0 053 1

these results show that regression models for cucumber comprehensive growth in three seasons were accurate 3 3 1 effect of single experimental factor on the cucumber comprehensive growth for three growing seasons the integrated growth evaluation value of three growing seasons cucumber gradually increased with at ia and ff followed by a subsequent decrease maximum value in 2020 f were observed at the 0 15 at 27 8 17 8 day night c and 0 03 ia 100 etc levels fig 2a the evaluation value in 2021s gradually increased with at and ia levels below 0 002 27 0 17 0 day night c and 0 002 100 etc respectively if the experiment factors exceeded these levels the comprehensive evaluation value showed a downward trend fig 2b peak levels in 2021f were observed at the 0 20 at 25 9 15 9 day night c and 0 05 ia 101 etc levels fig 2c the peak levels in three growing seasons were observed at the same ff time 6 days levels 3 3 2 two experimental factor coupling effects on the cucumber comprehensive growth the coupling effects of at ia on the cucumber comprehensive growth in three growing seasons are shown in fig 3a c specifically the comprehensive evaluation value of three growing seasons cucumber gradually increased and then decreased with the increase of at and ia the maximum comprehensive evaluation value in 2020 f was observed when at 27 8 17 8 day night c and ia ia 99 etc were 0 15 and 0 07 respectively fig 3a for 2021s the maximum comprehensive evaluation value was observed when at 26 5 16 5 day night c and ia ia 103 etc were 0 10 and 0 21 fig 3b maximum comprehensive evaluation value in 2021 f was observed when at 25 9 15 9 day night c and ia 101 etc were 0 21 and 0 05 respectively fig 3c at ff coupling effect fig 3d f at ff fig 3d f ia ff fig 3g i and at ia coupling effect fig 3a c had the same change trend on the comprehensive evaluation value in three growing seasons 3 3 3 three experimental factor coupling effects for the cucumber comprehensive growth the relationship between the three season experimental factors coupling and cucumber comprehensive growth was obtained fig 4 for the at ia ff combination in 2020 f levels 0 15 for at 27 8 17 8 day night c 0 09 for ia 99 etc and 0 08 for ff time 6 days were the optimal for the cucumber comprehensive growth fig 4a for the 2021 s at ia ff combination levels 0 09 for at 26 5 16 5 c day night 0 21 for ia 97 etc and 0 13 for ff 6 days were found to be the optimal for the cucumber comprehensive growth fig 4b in terms of the at ia ff combination in 2021f the levels of 0 21 for at 25 9 15 9 day night c 0 05 for ia 101 etc and 0 07 for ff time 6 days were the optimal for the comprehensive growth of cucumber by contrast the opposite results were found for very low or high levels of at ia and ff fig 4 3 3 4 optimal ia and ff strategy for the cucumber comprehensive growth at different at ranges to explore the scheme of ia and ff suitable for cucumber comprehensive growth at different temperatures we determined the combination of ia and ff with the highest topsis comprehensive score at different at ranges through simulation optimization table 8 when the at ranges were 18 8 21 7 11 7 21 7 11 7 27 17 27 17 32 4 22 4 32 4 22 4 36 26 day night c the optimal ia and ff combination measures are as follows 87 91 etc and time 6 7 days 94 98 etc and time 5 6 days 99 104 etc and time 4 5 days 107 114 etc and time 3 4 days 4 discussion the growth development yield and quality of cucumber in protective cultivation is affected by temperature basirat and mousavi 2022 irrigation and fertilization abdalhi et al 2016 among others e g variety light and humidity çakir et al 2017 li et al 2022 the high yield and quality of cucumber under low environmental control investment cost e g operation and electricity cost of temperature control equipment can be obtained by comprehensively understanding the environmental factors suitable for the integrated growth of cucumber which could be determined according to various indicators a certain interaction occurs between different indicators making it difficult to optimize all indicators at the same time however the effects of various factors on the comprehensive growth of cucumber were hard to determined only by using a single evaluation method therefore the integrated growth status of cucumber should be effectively evaluated using a set of comprehensive evaluation system previous studies on the coupling of water and fertilizer in cucumber mostly focused on the single factor of ff fasina et al 2021a the coupling of ia and fertilization amount geng et al 2022 or the coupling of ia and irrigation frequency to determine the best management scheduling he et al 2021 some studies also used the gray correlation principal component analysis entropy and ahp and topsis comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate the comprehensive quality of protected vegetables liu et al 2013a reed et al 2014 studies have also established a unified model of water saving high yield and high quality based on the optimal quality and determined the optimal irrigation and fertilization mode jiang et al 2019 li et al 2021 however only few comprehensive and optimal management strategies have considered at ia and ff in the current study we constructed a comprehensive evaluation system to coordinate the effect of different indexes on the cucumber comprehensive growth and ensure that the established comprehensive evaluation system could reflect the integrated growth status of cucumber spearman correlation analysis found a significant correlation between the subfactor indicators tables1 3 interestingly tss was observed to be significantly negatively correlated with nc this may be because tss was the product of carbon metabolism carbon metabolism provided energy and carbon framework for nitrogen metabolism in crops and n metabolism could renew enzyme proteins however photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency decreased with increasing leaf nc and then inhibited carbohydrate accumulation therefore carbon and n metabolism was not only interrelated but also had certain reciprocal inhibition perchlik and tegeder 2018 information overlap might have occurred between multiple indicators when evaluating the comprehensive growth with a single index therefore the unreliability of the evaluation results obtained using a single evaluation index as the target value can be avoided using the game theory combined weighting method that integrates the objective weighting of entropy weight method and the subjective weighting of ahp hong et al 2022 moreover the weight of each subfactor index was determined and the representative subfactors of various indexes were screened out topsis comprehensive analysis showed that the coding values ranking first in the score value of the three growing seasons experiment were all 0 0 0 in which the at was 27 17 c day night the ia was 100 etc and the ff was time 6 days table 7 and these values are consistent with several reports abdalhi et al 2016 amer et al 2009 hashem et al 2011 however irrigation less than 100 etc and high ff had the highest yield wue and fertilization use efficiency farneselli et al 2015 sensoy et al 2007 the different results may be attributed to the limited studies on the integrated evaluation of experimental indexes and the influence of other factors such as cultivation environment and crop varieties in greenhouse in the comprehensive evaluation regression model the absolute value of the primary term coefficient of the at in the three growing seasons was greater than that of the ia and ff the comprehensive evaluation value changed sharply with the increase in at while the change of the comprehensive evaluation value was relatively gentle with the increase of ia and ff this finding indicates that the positive effect of at on improving the comprehensive evaluation index of cucumber was greater than that of ia and ff and the negative effect is also greater than that of ia and ff after exceeding a certain level temperature affects the occurrence of biochemical reaction by affecting the enzyme activity in plants li et al 2013 liu et al 2012 as well as the synthesis and consumption of organic matter and the absorption of nutrients by affecting physiological metabolic processes sauser et al 1998 for example temperature could affect the activities of enzymes related to respiration and photosynthesis unfavorable environmental temperature will increase the energy consumption of respiration and photosynthesis reduce enzyme activities and inhibit crop growth when the environmental temperature varies with the optimum temperature allen and ort 2001 changes in crop morphological structure osmotic stress oxidative stress and photoinhibition occur the growth and development of cucumber are hindered and the yield and quality are hindered long and ort 2010 sage and kubien 2007 in the present study similar findings were obtained where the comprehensive evaluation value of three growing seasons cucumber first increased and then decreased with the increase of temperature showing a parabolic trend that is opening downward fig 2 cucumber plants are very sensitive to soil water conditions especially in greenhouses therefore the supply of soil water could greatly affect the growth development and yield of cucumbers yan et al 2019 the absorption of water by crops is a dynamic process which is based on the transpiration and evaporation of crops therefore a threshold is set for the absorption of water by crops a condition that is lower or higher than this threshold is detrimental to the comprehensive growing of crops zhang et al 2017 the results of the present study are consistent with previous findings in which the comprehensive evaluation value of three growing season cucumber first increased and then decreased with the increase of ia showing a parabolic trend of opening downward fig 2 in addition to using freshwater resources recent research found that it was a possible approach the economic considerations of the nutrient utilization in wastewater management for optimizing irrigation and cost competitiveness maroušek and maroušková 2021 in the case of a certain amount of fertilizer the appropriate high ff means less amount of fertilizer applied at each time and the water and fertilizer were mainly distributed in the shallow soil which was conducive to root growth liu et al 2019 a very high ff is not conducive to the absorption of water and fertilizer by crops and it can reduce soil permeability and hinder crop growth li et al 2021 putra et al 2019 at a very low ff the amount of single irrigation and fertilization is high and the irrigation cycle is long which easily causes drastic changes in soil water content resulting in soil compaction low soil respiration poor soil physicochemical properties and buffering capacity el hendawy et al 2008 some water and fertilizer will be distributed below the root layer thus reducing the use efficiency of water and fertilizer and is not conducive to crop growth therefore a very high or low ff is not conducive to plant comprehensive growth fang et al 2019 fasina et al 2021b moreover we also found that the comprehensive evaluation value of three growing season cucumber first increased and then decreased with the increase of ff showing a parabolic trend of opening downward fig 2 some studies showed that the coupling of temperature water and fertilizer could promote the respiration of soil microorganisms and roots ouyang et al 2021 enriches the soil microbial biomass zhou et al 2019 which is conducive to the reproduction and growth of microorganisms and improves the microenvironment of crop roots and soil wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 moreover the coupling of temperature water and fertilizer could improve soil enzyme activity and enhance the absorption of mineral nutrients in soil by crop roots al rawahy et al 2019 soil respiration is an essential issue in carbon sequestration and carbon budget research with the increase of global temperature soil is heating up which promotes soil respiration increases soil carbon dioxide emission and causes the loss of carbon dioxide in soil knorr et al 2005 rising global temperature is expected to lead to notably higher decomposition rates of soil carbon and thus carbon dioxide release from soils reynolds et al 2017 largely because of more energy available for microbial decomposer communities haaf et al 2021 this condition allows crop roots to absorb more water and nutrients from the soil for crop growth and development and thus provide sufficient substrate for plant photosynthesis improve leaf chlorophyll content and enhance plant photosynthetic rate zhang et al 2020 this condition is conducive to the accumulation of plant dry matter quality and the improvement of fruit quality and yield to promote the comprehensive growth of crops therefore at ia and ff are not independent and they could have an interaction on the comprehensive effect of crops we also found the significant coupling effects of at ff at ia and ia ff for cucumber comprehensive growth in 2020f 2021s and 2021f fig 3 similar trends of at ia and ff combinations with cucumber comprehensive growth within the three growing seasons although optimal values varied fig 4 the optimum ia and ff varied because of the different temperatures in greenhouse although their trend was consistent table 8 these results showed that irrigation and application of fertilizer scheduling must be matched with corresponding objectives because of the difference in ia and ff at different temperatures the findings also demonstrate that topsis method of combining weights based on game theory could effectively weigh the cucumber growth yield fruit quality and water and fertilizer use of efficiency parameters to optimize the comprehensive growth of cucumber in greenhouse at different environment temperatures in this study multiple linear regression equations were used to fit the relationship between the cucumber comprehensive growth and at ai and ff experimental factors in the greenhouse but it did not explain the physiological mechanism of cucumber growth therefore when the model is applied to other crops its predictive ability may be reduced which needs to be further verified at the same time the temperature range for this experiment was set 18 8 36 26 day night c and whether the optimal water and fertilizer management is applicable beyond the temperature setting ranges so the follow up research needs to expand the temperature test ranges to further improve the applicability of the model from a commercial point of view the cost and economic benefits could not be ignored in the optimization process it requires a full economic evaluation to verify optimal water and fertilizer management for a following study 5 conclusion the growth yield fruit quality water and fertilizer use efficiency of cucumber was evaluated comprehensively by using topsis method of combining weights based on game theory at was mainly limited factor for the comprehensive growth of cucumber in three growing seasons when the at ranges were 18 8 21 7 11 7 21 7 11 7 27 17 27 17 32 4 22 4 32 4 22 4 36 26 day night c the optimal ia and ff were as follows 87 91 etc and time 6 7 days 94 99 etc and time 5 6 days 99 104 etc and time 4 5 days 107 114 etc and time 3 4 days respectively the optimal irrigation and fertilization management plan was determined based on cucumber comprehensive growth under different temperatures in this study which subsequently improved the accuracy of ia and ff in addition other environmental factors such as humidity and light conditions and cultivation patterns and crop growth cycle would affect the application amounts of irrigation and fertilization in actual production but the method could be referred to as irrigation and fertilization management in other regions or other crops in the context of global climate change these results play an important role in guiding irrigation and fertilization

applied to construct cucumber comprehensive growth evaluation model single and two experimental factors analysis showed that single factor and the coupling of at ia at ff and ia ff both had significant effects on the integrated growth of cucumber for three seasons for the at ia ff combination in 2020 s levels of 0 09 for at 26 5 16 5 day night c 0 21 for ia 97 crop evapotranspiration etc and 0 13 for ff time 6 days were the optimal parameters for comprehensive cucumber growth the corresponding combinations for 2020f and 2021f were determined as 0 15 and 0 21 for at 27 8 17 8 and 25 9 15 9 day night c 0 09 and 0 05 for ia 99 and 101 etc and 0 08 and 0 07 for ff both time 6 days furthermore when the at ranges were 18 8 21 7 11 7 21 7 11 7 27 17 27 17 32 4 22 4 and 32 4 22 4 36 26 day night c the corresponding to ia and ff intervals that maximized cucumber integrated growth were 87 91 etc and time 6 7 days 94 99 etc and time 5 6 days 99 104 etc and time 4 5 days 107 114 etc and time 3 4 days respectively these results suggest for the future global climate change comprehensively understanding the growth of cucumber could save resources and potentially enhance cucumber

annually in the world liu et al 2019 ia ff and temperature are important factors affect cucumber production in greenhouse singh et al 2017 previous studies mostly focused on ia and ff and researches focused less on the effects of irrigation strategies under different temperatures on the cucumber comprehensive growth therefore in the context of global climate change it has important guiding significance for greenhouse cucumber production to determining the optimal irrigation and fertilization strategies under different temperature ranges the present study aimed to 1 investigate the comprehensive effects of ia and ff on greenhouse cucumber at different temperatures 2 establish an evaluation system of cucumber comprehensive growth by using the technique for order preference by

determination of comprehensive evaluation factor weights 2 4 2 1 determination of the objective weight based on entropy method the entropy method could effectively reflect the information implied by the data and demonstrates strong operability which is used to calculate the objective weight of indicators the subfactor objective weights are calculated as follows 8 y ij x ij i 1 n x ij i 1 2 n j 1 2 m where x ij is the initial experimental data n is the number of subfactor indicators and m is the number of treatments the i th index information entropy e zi of the subfactor is calculated as follows 9 e zi 1 ln n i 1 n y ij ln y ij z 1 2 3 4 i 1 2 n the entropy weight wzi is calculated as follows 10 w z i d z i d z i d z i 1 e z i where dzi is information entropy redundancy 2 4 2 2 determination of subjective weights based on analytic hierarchy process ahp method ahp is a widely used method to determine subjective weight of indicators we used yaahp software to establish a hierarchical model for cucumber comprehensive evaluation fig 1 the specific calculation methods are as follows karami 2006 after the hierarchical model is established a scale of 1 9 is used to establish a judgment matrix a 11 a a ij n n where a ij is a subfactor and n is the number of evaluation indicators the weight vector ω is obtained from the arithmetic mean of all vectors as follows 12 ω i 1 n i 1 n a ij i 1 n a ij i 1 2 n 13 λ max 1 n i 1 n 1 ω i 1 n a ij ω j where ω i is the weight of the i th index λmax is the maximum eigenvalue of the judgment matrix and ω j is the weight of the j th index the consistency of the matrix is checked as follows 14 b i λ max n n 1 15 b r b i r l where b i is the consistency index b r is the consistency ratio and r l is the consistency check indicator 2 4 2 3 combination weight based on game theory the combined weight based on game theory aims to study the coordinated relationship between the subjective and objective weighting methods in the conflict and determine the maximized common interests of the two podimata and yannopoulos 2015 it aims to determine a combined weight to minimize the sum of deviations between it and the basic weights to maximize the common interests of subjective and objective weights finally the combined weight that reflects the decision maker s intention and the objective attributes of the evaluation index is obtained based on the two weights assigned by the entropy and ahp method a new weight set was constructed as follows 16 u k 1 g α k u k t g 1 2 where α k and u k are the weights obtained by the ahp and the entropy method respectively based on the centralized model of game theory the optimal strategy model is derived as follows 17 min j 1 m α j u j t u i t i 1 2 n according to the differential properties of the matrix the optimal first derivative conditions of this formula are obtained as follows 18 j 1 m α j u i u j t u i u i t the optimized set of combined coefficients is α 1 α 2 α g which is normalized as follows 19 α k α k k 1 g α k the combined weight is calculated as follows 20 u k 1 g α k u k t 2 4 2 4 comprehensive evaluation of cucumber growth based on topsis the topsis method also known as the approximate ideal solution method is a technique for finite scheme multi objective decision analysis in systems engineering dymova et al 2013 this model is a comprehensive evaluation method of distance which is widely used in engineering agriculture and economy and has achieved good results awasthi et al 2011 this model is advantageous because it could make full use of the original data the loss of data in the calculation process is small the geometric meaning is intuitive and it is not disturbed by the selection of reference sequences by using the topsis method to evaluate the comprehensive growth of cucumber the specific steps are as follows deng et al 2000 construct the decision matrix 21 x x ij i 1 2 n j 1 2 m the dimensionless processing of the decision matrix is as follows 22 y ij x ij i 1 n x ij 2 the following weighting matrix was constructed to determine indicator weight 23 z ij u i y ij n m the positive ideal solution z and the negative ideal solution z of the weighted normalization matrix were determined as follows 24 z max 1 i n z ij i 1 2 n z 1 z 2 z 3 z n 25 z min 1 i n z ij i 1 2 n z 1 z 2 z 3 z n the euclidean distance between evaluation vector for each combination and the positive and negative ideal solutions is calculated as follows 26 d j i 1 n z i z i j 2 i 1 2 n 27 d j i 1 n z i z i j 2 i 1 2 n where z ij is the weighted normalized value of the i th index and the j th treatment and z i and z i are the maximum and minimum values of the i th index in different treatments respectively the relative closeness degree c j between different treatment combination schemes and the optimal scheme was calculated as follows 28 c j d i d i d i j 1 2 m in this expression 0 c j 1 z i z when c j 0 and z i z when c j 1 c j value that is close to 1 indicates better cucumber comprehensive growth 2 5 data analysis microsoft excel office2013 microsoft corp usa was used for data recording statistics and calculation of objective weights by using entropy method and evaluation by topsis method spearman analysis was performed using spss 26 0 spss ibm chicago usa software the ahp evaluation system was established using yaahp software shanxi yuan juece software technology co ltd china to determine the subjective weight the dps 7 05 hangzhou rui feng information technology co ltd china was used to establish the regression model of cucumber comprehensive growth index response to multi factor response matlab r2021a mathworks usa software was used to calculate and graph the comprehensive growth response model of cucumber 3 results 3 1 spearman s correlation analysis a reasonable comprehensive evaluation system for cucumber growth was established using spearman correlation analysis among 19 subfactor

were significantly positively correlated with sp a31 while fruit number per plant a22 was significantly positively correlated with nc a36 sp a31 had a significant positive correlation with faa a35 total n content a41 pfp a44 and wue a45 while tss a32 had a significant negative correlation with nc a36 a significant positive correlation was observed between vc a34 and wue a44 and faa a35 had a significant positive correlation with total n content a41 the total n content a41 had a significant positive correlation with total n content a42 and wue a45 the correlation between multiple subfactor indicated some overlap between the information of multiple subfactors when cucumber single subfactor index was used to evaluate the comprehensive growth status of cucumber and it indicates that each index of cucumber comprehensive growth is essential therefore a reasonable evaluation system should be established to evaluate the comprehensive growth of cucumber 3 2 determination of subfactor index weight 3 2 1 objective weights determined based on entropy the entropy weight method was used to carry out weighted analysis on the single index of cucumber calculate the weight of each index of cucumber in the three seasons experiment and finally obtain the objective weight table 4 among the parameters g s a14 had the largest objective weight followed by faa a35 and then c i a15 wue a45 had the highest objective weight while c i a15 had the lowest objective weight among various indexes of 2021s the maximum objective weight index of cucumber in 2021f was the same as that in 2020f wue a45 and pfp a44 ranked 4th and 5th respectively yield index a2 and quality index a3 followed and c i a15 had the lowest objective weight 3 2 2 subjective weight determined based on ahp the results of cr based on ahp were all less than 0 10 which indicating that the consistency test was satisfactory and the established judgment matrix was reliable and reasonable table 5 the four indexes of cucumber were in descending order of weight as follows yield a2 fruit quality a3 wue a4 and growth index a1 the order of subjective weight of each index of cucumber is as follows yield per hectare a21 fruit number per plant a22 vc a34 single fruit weight a23 faa a35 nc a36 pfp a44 wue a45 total dry matter weight a11 tss a32 rs a33 total n content a41 sp a31 p n a12 total p content a42 total k content a43 g s a14 t r a13 c i a15 3 2 3 weight determined based on game theory combination weighting based on game theory combination weighting method the weight order of three season cucumber indexes is basically the same table 6 the highest combination weight of cucumber indexes in three growing seasons was yield per hectare a21 whereas the lowest weight index was c i a15 in the subfactor layer of growth index the weight of g s was the highest and the weight of c i was the lowest in terms of yield index the weight of yield per hectare a21 was the highest the weight of fruit number per plant a22 was several times as much and the weight of single fruit weight a23 was the lowest in three seasons in terms of fruit quality indexes the highest weight of faa a35 was observed in 2020f and the highest weight of vc a34 was in 2021s and 2021f followed by faa a35 among the indexes of water and fertilizer use efficiency wue a45 was the highest in three growing seasons followed by fertilizer use efficiency 3 2 4 comprehensive growth evaluation of cucumber based on game theory combined weighting and topsis topsis method was used to rank cucumber in three growing seasons table 7 t18 treatment had the highest c j followed by t17 treatment and then t9 treatment in 2020 f t15 treatment had the highest c j followed by t16 and then t10 treatment in 2021 s among the cucumber multi factor treatment combinations t16 treatment had the largest c j followed by t18 treatment and then t3 treatment in 2021 f 3 3 comprehensive growth response of cucumber to drip irrigation and fertilization frequency combinations at different temperatures the regression equations y 1 y 2 and y 3 for topsis comprehensive evaluation value in 2020f 2021s and 2021f used to determine the effects on the comprehensive growth of cucumber from at x 1 ia x 2 and ff x 3 are described as follows 28 y1 0 892 0 065 1 0 018 2 0 014 3 0 208 12 0 108 22 0 135 32 0 024 1x2 0 008 1x3 0 062 2x3 29 y2 0 931 0 053 1

2 of y 1 was 0 970 and the regression was significant p 0 0001 moreover the r 2 values of y 2 and y 3 were 0 981 and 0 924 and the regressions were both significant p 0 0001 and 0 0001 respectively these results show that regression models for cucumber comprehensive growth in three seasons were accurate 3 3 1 effect of single experimental factor on the cucumber comprehensive growth for three growing seasons the integrated growth evaluation value of three growing seasons cucumber gradually increased with at ia and ff followed by a subsequent decrease maximum value in 2020 f were observed at the 0 15 at 27 8 17 8 day night c and 0 03 ia 100 etc levels fig 2a the evaluation value in 2021s gradually increased with at and ia levels below 0 002 27 0 17 0 day night c and 0 002 100 etc respectively if the experiment factors exceeded these levels the comprehensive evaluation value showed a downward trend fig 2b peak levels in 2021f were observed at the 0 20 at 25 9 15 9 day night c and 0 05 ia 101 etc levels fig 2c the peak levels in three growing seasons were observed at the same ff time 6 days levels 3 3 2 two experimental factor coupling effects on the cucumber comprehensive growth the coupling effects of at ia on the cucumber comprehensive growth in three growing seasons are shown in fig 3a c specifically the comprehensive evaluation value of three growing seasons cucumber gradually increased and then decreased with the increase of at and ia the maximum comprehensive evaluation value in 2020 f was observed when at 27 8 17 8 day night c and ia ia 99 etc were 0 15 and 0 07 respectively fig 3a for 2021s the maximum comprehensive evaluation value was observed when at 26 5 16 5 day night c and ia ia 103 etc were 0 10 and 0 21 fig 3b maximum comprehensive evaluation value in 2021 f was observed when at 25 9 15 9 day night c and ia 101 etc were 0 21 and 0 05 respectively fig 3c at ff coupling effect fig 3d f at ff fig 3d f ia ff fig 3g i and at ia coupling effect fig 3a c had the same change trend on the comprehensive evaluation value in three growing seasons 3 3 3 three experimental factor coupling effects for the cucumber comprehensive growth the relationship between the three season experimental factors coupling and cucumber comprehensive growth was obtained fig 4 for the at ia ff combination in 2020 f levels 0 15 for at 27 8 17 8 day night c 0 09 for ia 99 etc and 0 08 for ff time 6 days were the optimal for the cucumber comprehensive growth fig 4a for the 2021 s at ia ff combination levels 0 09 for at 26 5 16 5 c day night 0 21 for ia 97 etc and 0 13 for ff 6 days were found to be the optimal for the cucumber comprehensive growth fig 4b in terms of the at ia ff combination in 2021f the levels of 0 21 for at 25 9 15 9 day night c 0 05 for ia 101 etc and 0 07 for ff time 6 days were the optimal for the comprehensive growth of cucumber by contrast the opposite results were found for very low or high levels of at ia and ff fig 4 3 3 4 optimal ia and ff strategy for the cucumber comprehensive growth at different at ranges to explore the scheme of ia and ff suitable for cucumber comprehensive growth at different temperatures we determined the combination of ia and ff with the highest topsis comprehensive score at different at ranges through simulation optimization table 8 when the at ranges were 18 8 21 7 11 7 21 7 11 7 27 17 27 17 32 4 22 4 32 4 22 4 36 26 day night c the optimal ia and ff combination measures are as follows 87 91 etc and time 6 7 days 94 98 etc and time 5 6 days 99 104 etc and time 4 5 days 107 114 etc and time 3 4 days 4 discussion the growth development yield and quality of cucumber in protective cultivation is affected by temperature basirat and mousavi 2022 irrigation and fertilization abdalhi et al 2016 among others e g variety light and humidity çakir et al 2017 li et al 2022 the high yield and quality of cucumber under low environmental control investment cost e g operation and electricity cost of temperature control equipment can be obtained by comprehensively understanding the environmental factors suitable for the integrated growth of cucumber which could be determined according to various indicators a certain interaction occurs between different indicators making it difficult to optimize all indicators at the same time however the effects of various factors on the comprehensive growth of cucumber were hard to determined only by using a single evaluation method therefore the integrated growth status of cucumber should be effectively evaluated using a set of comprehensive evaluation system previous studies on the coupling of water and fertilizer in cucumber mostly focused on the single factor of ff fasina et al 2021a the coupling of ia and fertilization amount geng et al 2022 or the coupling of ia and irrigation frequency to determine the best management scheduling he et al 2021 some studies also used the gray correlation principal component analysis entropy and ahp and topsis comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate the comprehensive quality of protected vegetables liu et al 2013a reed et al 2014 studies have also established a unified model of water saving high yield and high quality based on the optimal quality and determined the optimal irrigation and fertilization mode jiang et al 2019 li et al 2021 however only few comprehensive and optimal management strategies have considered at ia and ff in the current study we constructed a comprehensive evaluation system to coordinate the effect of different indexes on the cucumber comprehensive growth and ensure that the established comprehensive evaluation system could reflect the integrated growth status of cucumber spearman correlation analysis found a significant correlation between the subfactor indicators tables1 3 interestingly tss was observed to be significantly negatively correlated with nc this may be because tss was the product of carbon metabolism carbon metabolism provided energy and carbon framework for nitrogen metabolism in crops and n metabolism could renew enzyme proteins however photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency decreased with increasing leaf nc and then inhibited carbohydrate accumulation therefore carbon and n metabolism was not only interrelated but also had certain reciprocal inhibition perchlik and tegeder 2018 information overlap might have occurred between multiple indicators when evaluating the comprehensive growth with a single index therefore the unreliability of the evaluation results obtained using a single evaluation index as the target value can be avoided using the game theory combined weighting method that integrates the objective weighting of entropy weight method and the subjective weighting of ahp hong et al 2022 moreover the weight of each subfactor index was determined and the representative subfactors of various indexes were screened out topsis comprehensive analysis showed that the coding values ranking first in the score value of the three growing seasons experiment were all 0 0 0 in which the at was 27 17 c day night the ia was 100 etc and the ff was time 6 days table 7 and these values are consistent with several reports abdalhi et al 2016 amer et al 2009 hashem et al 2011 however irrigation less than 100 etc and high ff had the highest yield wue and fertilization use efficiency farneselli et al 2015 sensoy et al 2007 the different results may be attributed to the limited studies on the integrated evaluation of experimental indexes and the influence of other factors such as cultivation environment and crop varieties in greenhouse in the comprehensive evaluation regression model the absolute value of the primary term coefficient of the at in the three growing seasons was greater than that of the ia and ff the comprehensive evaluation value changed sharply with the increase in at while the change of the comprehensive evaluation value was relatively gentle with the increase of ia and ff this finding indicates that the positive effect of at on improving the comprehensive evaluation index of cucumber was greater than that of ia and ff and the negative effect is also greater than that of ia and ff after exceeding a certain level temperature affects the occurrence of biochemical reaction by affecting the enzyme activity in plants li et al 2013 liu et al 2012 as well as the synthesis and consumption of organic matter and the absorption of nutrients by affecting physiological metabolic processes sauser et al 1998 for example temperature could affect the activities of enzymes related to respiration and photosynthesis unfavorable environmental temperature will increase the energy consumption of respiration and photosynthesis reduce enzyme activities and inhibit crop growth when the environmental temperature varies with the optimum temperature allen and ort 2001 changes in crop morphological structure osmotic stress oxidative stress and photoinhibition occur the growth and development of cucumber are hindered and the yield and quality are hindered long and ort 2010 sage and kubien 2007 in the present study similar findings were obtained where the comprehensive evaluation value of three growing seasons cucumber first increased and then decreased with the increase of temperature showing a parabolic trend that is opening downward fig 2 cucumber plants are very sensitive to soil water conditions especially in greenhouses therefore the supply of soil water could greatly affect the growth development and yield of cucumbers yan et al 2019 the absorption of water by crops is a dynamic process which is based on the transpiration and evaporation of crops therefore a threshold is set for the absorption of water by crops a condition that is lower or higher than this threshold is detrimental to the comprehensive growing of crops zhang et al 2017 the results of the present study are consistent with previous findings in which the comprehensive evaluation value of three growing season cucumber first increased and then decreased with the increase of ia showing a parabolic trend of opening downward fig 2 in addition to using freshwater resources recent research found that it was a possible approach the economic considerations of the nutrient utilization in wastewater management for optimizing irrigation and cost competitiveness maroušek and maroušková 2021 in the case of a certain amount of fertilizer the appropriate high ff means less amount of fertilizer applied at each time and the water and fertilizer were mainly distributed in the shallow soil which was conducive to root growth liu et al 2019 a very high ff is not conducive to the absorption of water and fertilizer by crops and it can reduce soil permeability and hinder crop growth li et al 2021 putra et al 2019 at a very low ff the amount of single irrigation and fertilization is high and the irrigation cycle is long which easily causes drastic changes in soil water content resulting in soil compaction low soil respiration poor soil physicochemical properties and buffering capacity el hendawy et al 2008 some water and fertilizer will be distributed below the root layer thus reducing the use efficiency of water and fertilizer and is not conducive to crop growth therefore a very high or low ff is not conducive to plant comprehensive growth fang et al 2019 fasina et al 2021b moreover we also found that the comprehensive evaluation value of three growing season cucumber first increased and then decreased with the increase of ff showing a parabolic trend of opening downward fig 2 some studies showed that the coupling of temperature water and fertilizer could promote the respiration of soil microorganisms and roots ouyang et al 2021 enriches the soil microbial biomass zhou et al 2019 which is conducive to the reproduction and growth of microorganisms and improves the microenvironment of crop roots and soil wang et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 moreover the coupling of temperature water and fertilizer could improve soil enzyme activity and enhance the absorption of mineral nutrients in soil by crop roots al rawahy et al 2019 soil respiration is an essential issue in carbon sequestration and carbon budget research with the increase of global temperature soil is heating up which promotes soil respiration increases soil carbon dioxide emission and causes the loss of carbon dioxide in soil knorr et al 2005 rising global temperature is expected to lead to notably higher decomposition rates of soil carbon and thus carbon dioxide release from soils reynolds et al 2017 largely because of more energy available for microbial decomposer communities haaf et al 2021 this condition allows crop roots to absorb more water and nutrients from the soil for crop growth and development and thus provide sufficient substrate for plant photosynthesis improve leaf chlorophyll content and enhance plant photosynthetic rate zhang et al 2020 this condition is conducive to the accumulation of plant dry matter quality and the improvement of fruit quality and yield to promote the comprehensive growth of crops therefore at ia and ff are not independent and they could have an interaction on the comprehensive effect of crops we also found the significant coupling effects of at ff at ia and ia ff for cucumber comprehensive growth in 2020f 2021s and 2021f fig 3 similar trends of at ia and ff combinations with cucumber comprehensive growth within the three growing seasons although optimal values varied fig 4 the optimum ia and ff varied because of the different temperatures in greenhouse although their trend was consistent table 8 these results showed that irrigation and application of fertilizer scheduling must be matched with corresponding objectives because of the difference in ia and ff at different temperatures the findings also demonstrate that topsis method of combining weights based on game theory could effectively weigh the cucumber growth yield fruit quality and water and fertilizer use of efficiency parameters to optimize the comprehensive growth of cucumber in greenhouse at different environment temperatures in this study multiple linear regression equations were used to fit the relationship between the cucumber comprehensive growth and at ai and ff experimental factors in the greenhouse but it did not explain the physiological mechanism of cucumber growth therefore when the model is applied to other crops its predictive ability may be reduced which needs to be further verified at the same time the temperature range for this experiment was set 18 8 36 26 day night c and whether the optimal water and fertilizer management is applicable beyond the temperature setting ranges so the follow up research needs to expand the temperature test ranges to further improve the applicability of the model from a commercial point of view the cost and economic benefits could not be ignored in the optimization process it requires a full economic evaluation to verify optimal water and fertilizer management for a following study 5 conclusion the growth yield fruit quality water and fertilizer use efficiency of cucumber was evaluated comprehensively by using topsis method of combining weights based on game theory at was mainly limited factor for the comprehensive growth of cucumber in three growing seasons when the at ranges were 18 8 21 7 11 7 21 7 11 7 27 17 27 17 32 4 22 4 32 4 22 4 36 26 day night c the optimal ia and ff were as follows 87 91 etc and time 6 7 days 94 99 etc and time 5 6 days 99 104 etc and time 4 5 days 107 114 etc and time 3 4 days respectively the optimal irrigation and fertilization management plan was determined based on cucumber comprehensive growth under different temperatures in this study which subsequently improved the accuracy of ia and ff in addition other environmental factors such as humidity and light conditions and cultivation patterns and crop growth cycle would affect the application amounts of irrigation and fertilization in actual production but the method could be referred to as irrigation and fertilization management in other regions or other crops in the context of global climate change these results play an important role in guiding irrigation and fertilization

9289,emitter clogging is a problem that occurs with high frequency in drip irrigation systems and it is usually caused by physical chemical or biological factors isolated or associated there are situations in which clogging can occur from contaminants entering the irrigation system during assembly or repair of broken pipes in the field studies on the processes of emitter clogging under these conditions by pulses of soil particle directly in the lateral lines have not been reported in the literature yet although they occur with relative frequency in the field thus the objective of this research was to evaluate the clogging of emitters by pulses of soil particles that entered the pipes downstream of the filtering system as a function of the discharge from the emitters the particle size concentration of the contaminating particles and orientation of installation of the emitters in the lateral lines the experiment was carried out on a test bench specially developed for this study two non pressure compensating npc driplines with integrated flat emitters were evaluated the tested emitters had nominal discharges of 1 6 l h 1 emitter a and 2 3 l h 1 emitter b for each emitter model 30 treatments were performed consisting of combinations of three factors emitter orientation soil particle size and amount of soil per pulse concentration in addition three more blank treatments were tested the tested emitters showed different responses when exposed to pulses of soil particles of different sizes and amounts emitter a had a mean value of relative discharge dra of 73 in all treatments while the dra of emitter b was 91 indicating that emitter a was more sensitive to clogging than emitter b the particle size of the soil was a dominant factor in the physical clogging of these emitters treatments involving particles with diameters ranging from 0 26 to 0 50 mm resulted in mean dra values of 67 for emitter a and 87 for b the position of the emitter was a factor that contributed to the increase in susceptibility to clogging by pulses of soil particle and emitter position facing to the side presented the best performance it should be noted that this dripper orientation has not been used in subsurface drip irrigated areas to date because traditional burial implements are not able to install this emitter orientation in the field treatments that involved the sideways position resulted in mean dra values of 75 for emitter a and 94 for b keywords discharge drip irrigation emitter orientation particle concentration particle size data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drip irrigation systems have the advantage of applying water to crops while reducing losses by evaporation and deep percolation enabling more efficient water and nutrient use for agricultural production with lower energy consumption among pressurized systems however emitters used in these systems have narrow discharge sections that can be easily clogged partially or totally by organic and inorganic particles isolated or combined resende et al 2000 qingsong et al 2008 ribeiro et al 2012 bounoua et al 2016 solé torres et al 2019 el bouhali et al 2020 field requirements for a good drip irrigation system are turbulent discharge emitters containing a pre filter associated with vortex mechanisms for pressure dissipation and self cleaning along the labyrinths efficient filtration system water treatment and maintenance routines such as flushing application of acids chlorine or hydrogen peroxide and periodic evaluation of operational conditions pressure and discharge at strategic points emitter clogging in drip irrigation is due to physical chemical or biological factors isolated or associated it is a problem that occurs with high frequency in drip irrigation systems in agricultural areas around the world several studies have sought to understand the factors and mechanisms that dominate the clogging process niu et al 2013 bounoua et al 2016 li et al 2019 wang et al 2021 almeida et al 2022 at the field level there are situations in which clogging can occur from contaminants that enter the hydraulic network of surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems during the assembly or repair of broken pipes in the field or under pressure failures that allow contaminants to enter the system through the emitter orifices in contact with the ground during assembly of a drip irrigation system it is possible for plastic drilling debris pvc and soil particles to enter the hydraulic network of the system more experienced assembly teams employ temporary plugs at the ends of the lateral lines during the stretching process of the driplines in the field to prevent the entry of soil particles directly at the beginning of the lateral lines and riser pipes without having passed through the filtration system but pvc drilling debris is impossible to avoid entering the system because it is necessary to drill holes in pvc secondary lines at regular spaces for lateral derivations line the same technical recommendation must be followed in the assembly process of the pvc lines of water mains and derivation lines which are also prone to this type of contamination due to the numerous splices made at regular intervals of approximately six meters commercial size of the tubes of pvc if the pipes are not flushed before pressurization of the emitters when the system is activated these residues will enter the lateral lines as pulses of soil particle which may clog emitters or serve as an initial shield for the accumulation of dirt inside the labyrinths bucks et al 1979 gilbert et al 1981 coelho et al 2007 camargo et al 2014 lavanholi et al 2018 yu et al 2019 oliveira et al 2020 lequette et al 2021 additionally when pipe ruptures occur in the hydraulic network and the system is shut down for repair negative pressure may occur in the pipes under certain topographic and hydraulic conditions and this can result in the entry of large amounts of soil into the pipes by suction this kind of problem cannot be prevented by the filtration system the depressurization of the hydraulic system under conditions of inadequate operation of anti vacuum valves can allow entry of contaminants through emitters in contact with the ground or through the flexible sealing rings of the non welded pipes coelho et al 2007 nakayama et al 2007 a flushing technique can be used to remove these pvc debris from the interior of the hydraulic network which consists of opening the final ends of the pipes to flush these undesirable sediments out of the system the formation of biofilm inside the pipes is a factor capable of amplifying the effects resulting from the entry of soil particles into the pipes

process of emitter clogging by soil particles entering past filters have not been reported in the literature although they are quite common most researchers assume that emitter clogging process will

attempted to understand the mechanism of emitter clogging by solid particles but most of them test the system with constant particle concentrations in the irrigation water during the operating time the orientation of flat mounted emitters inside lateral lines of drip irrigation can also favor clogging due to the exposure of emitters to particles by deposition facing down or supernatants facing

experimental design and treatments a completely randomized experimental design was adopted with four lines of driplines being evaluated for each treatment in each dripline line seven drippers were

same for each dripline tested 1st to 7th positions for each emitter model 30 treatments consisting of the combination of three factors and three more blank treatments were used factorial 3 3 3 3 the

filtration systems 100 130 µm and larger particles g2 and g3 that can enter the hydraulic network because of certain problems in the filtering system soil particle pulse amounts concentration were defined based on preliminary field trials an attempt was made to quantify the weight of soil particles that could enter the lateral lines in the field when installing the drip irrigation system in the area to be irrigated by deliberately sticking the ends of the drip lines into loose soil the presence of loose soil occurs in the digging of ditches for installing the pipes in the field where the lateral lines are connected to the hydraulic network soil particles used in the tests were obtained by field collection of natural soil the test soil contained 60 6 clay 12 5 silt and 26 9 sand the soil ph was 5 70 and its electrical conductivity was 2416 μs cm 1 2 3 test procedures for the proper imposition of treatments a pattern of introduction of soil particles was adopted in a concentrated way at the beginning of the lateral lines simulating the contamination process that occurs in the field initially the soil particles were separated by sieves in order to obtain the specific particle sizes ranges then the amount of soil particles required for each experimental condition was weighed on a precision scale expanded uncertainty 0 1 g resolution 0 01 g before applying the pulses of soil particle the driplines were pressurized 0 10 mpa using clean water to check the discharge of the evaluated emitters thus ensuring that the tested factors were free from discharge variations caused by possible manufacturing defects at the end of the pressurization step of the lateral lines the pulses of soil particle were applied decoupling the lateral line from the manifold a small fold was made at 0 20 m from the beginning of the line with the aid of a funnel the soil particles were introduced at the entrance of the lateral line so that they were concentrated at the chosen bend point thus the pulses of soil particle in all lines started from the same point inside the dripline a pulse of soil particles was performed for each repetition in each of the treatments and driplines tested the lateral lines were re coupled to the initial connectors of the manifold carefully undoing the bend in the pipe where the soil particles were injected in a concentrated way the system was activated for 20 min and afterwards the emitter discharge was determined by a gravimetric method test time was estimated based on the average size of the lateral lines in the field at a speed of 1 m s 1 in such a way as to ensure that the soil particles could travel through the entire pipeline when the water was returned to the tank a metallic screen with a 100 µm was installed to filter and preserve the quality of the recirculated water in the tests the drippers were replaced at the end of each test the collected discharge values were converted into relative discharge values using eq 1 capra and scicolone 1998 1 dra 100 i n q i q o n where dra is the relative discharge in qo is the initial discharge of the emitters using clean water in l h 1 qi is the current discharge of the emitter on the evaluation day in l h 1 and n is the number of observations 2 4 data analysis the f test was used to verify significant differences between treatments and tukey s test at 5 probability to compare means analysis of variance and comparison of means were performed using the sas software sas stat software sas institute cary nc 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of treatments involving the interaction of emitter position particle size and amount of soil per pulse the interaction between emitter position particle size and amount of soil per pulse was statistically significant table 3 all pulses of soil particle defined by the interaction of the emitter position particles per pulse and particle size caused a reduction in the average values of relative discharge dra of emitters a and b fig 4 the blank treatments resulted in dra values equivalent to the best performance of the emitters subjected to treatments with soil particle as expected considering the average of all treatments with soil particles emitter a had a dra of 73 after application of the pulses of soil particle and the dra of emitter b was 91 showing that emitters of the same model but of different discharges can yield different responses when exposed to pulses of soil particle of different amounts and particle sizes and also showed that emitter discharge may influence the sensitivity of emitters to clogging in general it was found that a test time of 20 min which was based on the average size of the lateral lines in the field and a velocity of 1 m s 1 ensured that the soil particles traveled through the entire tested pipeline laboratory testing of processes that occur in the field requires a reduced time but it does accurately simulate actual conditions pei et al 2014 evaluated the clogging resistance of different emitters subjected to treatments consisting of tests with water at different quality levels and found that the dra varied depending on the emitter models and the period of operation of the system corroborating the results found in this research for emitter a the effect of particle size in the range of 0 26 0 50 mm was a reduction in the dra of emitters in the downward facing position at pulses of c2 and c3 with values of 59 and 52 respectively this effect may have been observed because of the dragging and deposition of soil particles in this particle size range along the dripline it was also observed that emitter a suffered considerable clogging in the upward position in the g2 particle size and c1 concentration and this effect may be the result of supernatant particles very fine sand silt and clay present in the water inside the dripline this treatment resulted in a dra of 65 the upward position also showed a significant reduction in dra for treatments with pulses of particles of size g3 and concentration c3 in which a dra of 60 was found as observed for emitter a emitter b showed the same propensity to be clogged by soil particles when positioned downwards the particle size in this case played a prominent role in the reduction of the average values of dra given that the treatments with larger particle size g3 presented values of 70 81 and 82 for c1 c2 and c3 respectively significant clogging was also observed in the upward position in emitter b with soil pulses of particle size g3 and concentration c2 in which a dra of 81 was observed the influence of particle size soil particle concentration and emitter models on dra was reported by bounoua et al 2016 who studied the main causes of the phenomena of physical emitter clogging by focusing on particle agglomeration and its impact on the operation of the drip irrigation system the authors concluded that small soil particles can agglomerate into larger aggregates causing a reduction in dra they demonstrated that such aggregation was governed by the presence of clay particles whose electrical charges induced agglomeration in the presence of salts they also stated that the role of concentration particle size and emitter design were decisive supporting the idea that there was an interaction between these factors which was substantiated by the results of the present research in the field the emitting pipes should be installed according to the manufacturer s recommendations most manufacturers recommend laying the emitting pipes with the drippers facing upwards however the emitting pipes may have their position modified due to adverse conditions like material dilation incidence of solar radiation and wind and general farm routines related to crop cultivation overall the presented results indicated that irrigation with side positioned emitters provided higher values of dra demonstrating less sensitivity to clogging than the other positions 3 2 effect of treatments composed by the interaction of two factors in the analysis of the interaction between the two factors only the interaction between emitter position and particle size was statistically significant the interaction between the soil particle concentration and emitter position factors resulted in average dra values ranging from 68 to 76 for emitter a fig 5 emitter b presented the highest average dra values in the side facing position at all concentrations with values close to 94 for c1 c2 and c3 the lowest dra of emitter b was observed in the downward facing position at the c1 concentration with a value of 85 c2 and c3 concentrations had similar statistical responses in the down and up positions in the analysis of the interaction of the particle size and emitter position fig 6 it was observed that for emitter a the highest average dra values were obtained in treatments with soil particles of size g1 in all evaluated positions with values ranging from 77 to 81 the lowest average dra values for emitter a were found for treatments with pulses of g3 size particles with emphasis on the downward facing position dra 63 performing the statistical analysis of the same interactions for emitter b we verified that the increase in soil particle size caused a reduction in the average dra values of the emitters in the downward facing position presenting a value of 78 for particle size g3 the other treatments showed no statistically significant differences for emitter b in the analysis of the interaction of particle size and concentration fig 7 it was observed that pulses of soil particles with larger particle size g3 and higher particle amounts per pulse c3 tended to reduce the average dra values of emitter a with a value of 59 this same pattern of results was observed for emitter b which presented high levels of clogging for all particle size ranges associated with the treatment at the higher concentration c3 similar observations were reported by recent studies such as lavanholi et al 2018 pereira et al 2020 and zhang et al 2021 3 3 effect of isolated factors and specific positions of emitters in the line analyzing the effect of isolated factors we observed decreasing trends in the average dra values of emitters a and b when they were positioned downward fig 8 treatments involving the downward position resulted in mean dra values of 72 and 87 for emitters a and b respectively the downward facing position makes the drippers more prone to clogging due to a possible effect of deposition contaminants during the passage of the pulses of soil particle especially when the particle size range is high coelho et al 2007 tested the sensitivity of five emitter models to physical clogging with up and down facing line positions and also observed higher levels of clogging in the downward facing emitters treatments involving the upward facing position resulted in mean dra values of 73 and 92 for emitters a and b respectively the position of the line facing the side presented the highest average dra values for both emitters showing that this emitter position can help to reduce clogging in drip irrigation treatments involving the sideways position resulted in mean dra values of 75 and 94 for emitters a and b there was also a tendency toward lower average dra values of emitters a and b as the concentration levels and particle size ranges of the tested soil particles increased this trend was also verified by qingsong et al 2008 in their simulation trials of clogging in different emitter models treatments with c1 c2 and c3 resulted in mean dra values of 75 74 and 71 for emitter a for emitter b treatments with c1 c2 and c3 resulted in mean dra values of 91 91 and 90 respectively non pressure compensating emitters are prone to clogging but it is also important to note that the dimensions and geometry of the emitter labyrinth can influence the susceptibility to clogging either due to particle size or particle agglomeration at different diameters in a given place coelho et al 2014 2022 analyzing the isolated particle size factor we found that for emitter a treatment g1 was significantly different from treatment g3 demonstrating that the particle size of the soil was a dominant factor in the physical clogging of emitters according to adin and sacks 1991 the risk of emitter clogging depended more on the particle size of the soil than on the concentration of total suspended solids in the irrigation water niu et al 2013 concluded that particle size and concentration were primary factors that affected emitter clogging in drip irrigation treatments g1 g2 and g3 resulted in mean dra values of 79 74 and 67 for emitter a and 94 92 and 87 for emitter b we verified that there were no trends of emitter clogging by soil particles for the same position in the line regardless of the emitter model and the isolated factor under analysis fig 9 the average dra values of emitters a and b at specific locations on the line 1st to 7th positions and as a function of the isolated factors of emitter orientation amount of soil per pulse and soil particle size showed that there was no predominant effect of deposition of soil particles in the emitters in initial positions and no predominant effect of dragging supernatant soil particles in the establishment of the water discharge in the line with the advancement of the pulse of soil particles in the line the water solution and particles assume greater homogeneity reducing the effect of supernatants and deposition it is possible that stabilizing the water velocity would facilitate the reduction of emitter clogging such responses indicate the randomness of the process of clogging by soil particles with regard to specific positions in the line reinforcing the assertion that they should be considered as repetitions in the statistical analysis of dra values as a function of the experimental treatments it is likely that certain positions of the emitters in the line may be more susceptible to clogging by soil particles for the same treatment it is possible that at a considerable distance from the emitter in relation to the beginning of the line there will be a reduction in the chances of clogging by pulses of soil particles however this would not exempt them from this occurrence 4 conclusions laboratory simulation of the accidental entry of soil particles directly into the lateral lines of the drip irrigation system favored emitter clogging by soil particles over the short term such a simulation is similar to what can occur in assembly steps or inadequate maintenance routines in the field drippers with similar architectural arrangements but with different discharges showed different responses when exposed to pulses of soil particle of different particle size and amount emitters a and b presented mean values of relative discharge dra in all treatments of soil particles pulse of 73 and 91 respectively showing that emitter discharge is an important factor affecting clogging in emitters the particle size of the soil was a dominant factor in the physical clogging of emitters treatments that involved soil particles with diameters in the range of 0 26 0 50 mm resulted in the most severe clogging with emitters a and b having mean dra values of 67 and 87 respectively the orientation of flat mounted emitters in the lateral lines of drip irrigation systems is a factor that contributes to increased susceptibility to clogging by soil particles of different size and concentration the downward facing position made the tested emitters more likely to clog resulting in average dra values of 72 for emitter a and 87 for b treatments involving the up position resulted in mean dra values of 73 for emitter a and 92 for b the side facing position afforded the best performance showing that this emitter position can contribute to reducing the problem of clogging in drip irrigation treatments that involved the sideways position resulted in mean dra values of 75 for emitter a and 94 for b it will be necessary to adapt traditional burial dripline implements for installation of subsurface emitters in this promising side orientation in the field special attention is recommended to the irrigation assembly teams in the field in terms of inlet and outlet preventive plugging of main pipeline derivation lines lateral lines and riser pipes during the process of assembling the drip system in the field to avoid accidental entry of soil particles into the hydraulic system which

9289,emitter clogging is a problem that occurs with high frequency in drip irrigation systems and it is usually caused by physical chemical or biological factors isolated or associated there are situations in which clogging can occur from contaminants entering the irrigation system during assembly or repair of broken pipes in the field studies on the processes of emitter clogging under these conditions by pulses of soil particle directly in the lateral lines have not been reported in the literature yet although they occur with relative frequency in the field thus the objective of this research was to evaluate the clogging of emitters by pulses of soil particles that entered the pipes downstream of the filtering system as a function of the discharge from the emitters the particle size concentration of the contaminating particles and orientation of installation of the emitters in the lateral lines the experiment was carried out on a test bench specially developed for this study two non pressure compensating npc driplines with integrated flat emitters were evaluated the tested emitters had nominal discharges of 1 6 l h 1 emitter a and 2 3 l h 1 emitter b for each emitter model 30 treatments were performed consisting of combinations of three factors emitter orientation soil particle size and amount of soil per pulse concentration in addition three more blank treatments were tested the tested emitters showed different responses when exposed to pulses of soil particles of different sizes and amounts emitter a had a mean value of relative discharge dra of 73 in all treatments while the dra of emitter b was 91 indicating that emitter a was more sensitive to clogging than emitter b the particle size of the soil was a dominant factor in the physical clogging of these emitters treatments involving particles with diameters ranging from 0 26 to 0 50 mm resulted in mean dra values of 67 for emitter a and 87 for b the position of the emitter was a factor that contributed to the increase in susceptibility to clogging by pulses of soil particle and emitter position facing to the side presented the best performance it should be noted that this dripper orientation has not been used in subsurface drip irrigated areas to date because traditional burial implements are not able to install this emitter orientation in the field treatments that involved the sideways position resulted in mean dra values of 75 for emitter a and 94 for b keywords discharge drip irrigation emitter orientation particle concentration particle size data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drip irrigation systems have the advantage of applying water to crops while reducing losses by evaporation and deep percolation enabling more efficient water and nutrient use for agricultural production with lower energy consumption among pressurized systems however emitters used in these systems have narrow discharge sections that can be easily clogged partially or totally by organic and inorganic particles isolated or combined resende et al 2000 qingsong et al 2008 ribeiro et al 2012 bounoua et al 2016 solé torres et al 2019 el bouhali et al 2020 field requirements for a good drip irrigation system are turbulent discharge emitters containing a pre filter associated with vortex mechanisms for pressure dissipation and self cleaning along the labyrinths efficient filtration system water treatment and maintenance routines such as flushing application of acids chlorine or hydrogen peroxide and periodic evaluation of operational conditions pressure and discharge at strategic points emitter clogging in drip irrigation is due to physical chemical or biological factors isolated or associated it is a problem that occurs with high frequency in drip irrigation systems in agricultural areas around the world several studies have sought to understand the factors and mechanisms that dominate the clogging process niu et al 2013 bounoua et al 2016 li et al 2019 wang et al 2021 almeida et al 2022 at the field level there are situations in which clogging can occur from contaminants that enter the hydraulic network of surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems during the assembly or repair of broken pipes in the field or under pressure failures that allow contaminants to enter the system through the emitter orifices in contact with the ground during assembly of a drip irrigation system it is possible for plastic drilling debris pvc and soil particles to enter the hydraulic network of the system more experienced assembly teams employ temporary plugs at the ends of the lateral lines during the stretching process of the driplines in the field to prevent the entry of soil particles directly at the beginning of the lateral lines and riser pipes without having passed through the filtration system but pvc drilling debris is impossible to avoid entering the system because it is necessary to drill holes in pvc secondary lines at regular spaces for lateral derivations line the same technical recommendation must be followed in the assembly process of the pvc lines of water mains and derivation lines which are also prone to this type of contamination due to the numerous splices made at regular intervals of approximately six meters commercial size of the tubes of pvc if the pipes are not flushed before pressurization of the emitters when the system is activated these residues will enter the lateral lines as pulses of soil particle which may clog emitters or serve as an initial shield for the accumulation of dirt inside the labyrinths bucks et al 1979 gilbert et al 1981 coelho et al 2007 camargo et al 2014 lavanholi et al 2018 yu et al 2019 oliveira et al 2020 lequette et al 2021

scicolone 1998 1 dra 100 i n q i q o n where dra is the relative discharge in qo is the initial discharge of the emitters using clean water in l h 1 qi is the current discharge of the emitter on the evaluation day in l h 1 and n is the number of observations 2 4 data analysis the f test was used to verify significant differences between treatments and tukey s test at 5 probability to compare means analysis of variance and comparison of means were performed using the sas software sas stat software sas institute cary nc 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of treatments involving the interaction of emitter position particle size and amount of soil per pulse the interaction between emitter position particle size and amount of soil per pulse was statistically significant table 3 all pulses of soil particle defined by the interaction of the emitter position particles per pulse and particle size caused a reduction in the average values of relative discharge dra of emitters a and b fig 4 the blank treatments resulted in dra values equivalent to the best performance of the emitters subjected to treatments with soil particle as expected considering the average of all treatments with soil particles emitter a had a dra of 73 after application of the pulses of soil particle and the dra of emitter b was 91 showing that emitters of the same model but of different discharges can yield different responses when exposed to pulses of soil particle of different amounts and particle sizes and also showed that emitter discharge may influence the sensitivity of emitters to clogging in general it was found that a test time of 20 min which was based on the average size of the lateral lines in the field and a velocity of 1 m s 1 ensured that the soil particles traveled through the entire tested pipeline laboratory testing of processes that occur in the field requires a reduced time but it does accurately simulate actual conditions pei et al 2014 evaluated the clogging resistance of different emitters subjected to treatments consisting of tests with water at different quality levels and found that the dra varied depending on the emitter models and the period of operation of the system corroborating the results found in this research for emitter a the effect of particle size in the range of 0 26 0 50 mm was a reduction in the dra of emitters in the downward facing position at pulses of c2 and c3 with values of 59 and 52 respectively this effect may have been observed because of the dragging and deposition of soil particles in this particle size range along the dripline it was also observed that emitter a suffered considerable clogging in the upward position in the g2 particle size and c1 concentration and this effect may be the result of supernatant particles very fine sand silt and clay present in the water inside the dripline this treatment resulted in a dra of 65 the upward position also showed a significant reduction in dra for treatments with pulses of particles of size g3 and concentration c3 in which a dra of 60 was found as observed for emitter a emitter b showed the same propensity to be clogged by soil particles when positioned downwards the particle size in this case played a prominent role in the reduction of the average values of dra given that the treatments with larger particle size g3 presented values of 70 81 and 82 for c1 c2 and c3 respectively significant clogging was also observed in the upward position in emitter b with soil pulses of particle size g3 and concentration c2 in which a dra of 81 was observed the influence of particle size soil particle concentration and emitter models on dra was reported by bounoua et al 2016 who studied the main causes of the phenomena of physical emitter clogging by focusing on particle agglomeration and its impact on the operation of the drip irrigation system the authors concluded that small soil particles can agglomerate into larger aggregates causing a reduction in dra they demonstrated that such aggregation was governed by the presence of clay particles whose electrical charges induced agglomeration in the presence of salts they also stated that the role of concentration particle size and emitter design were decisive supporting the idea that there was an interaction between these factors which was substantiated by the results of the present research in the field the emitting pipes should be installed according to the manufacturer s recommendations most manufacturers recommend laying the emitting pipes with the drippers facing upwards however the emitting pipes may have their position modified due to adverse conditions like material dilation incidence of solar radiation and wind and general farm routines related to crop cultivation overall the presented results indicated that irrigation with side positioned emitters provided higher values of dra demonstrating less sensitivity to clogging than the other positions 3 2 effect of treatments composed by the interaction of two factors in the analysis of the interaction between the two factors only the interaction between emitter position and particle size was statistically significant the interaction between the soil particle concentration and emitter position factors resulted in average dra values ranging from 68 to 76 for emitter a fig 5 emitter b presented the highest average dra values in the side facing position at all concentrations with values close to 94 for c1 c2 and c3 the lowest dra of emitter b was observed in the downward facing position at the c1 concentration with a value of 85 c2 and c3 concentrations had similar statistical responses in the down and up positions in the analysis of the interaction of the particle size and emitter position fig 6 it was observed that for emitter a the highest average dra values were obtained in treatments with soil particles of size g1 in all evaluated positions with values ranging from 77 to 81 the lowest average dra values for emitter a were found for treatments with pulses of g3 size particles with emphasis on the downward facing position dra 63 performing the statistical analysis of the same interactions for emitter b we verified that the increase in soil particle size caused a reduction in the average dra values of the emitters in the downward facing position presenting a value of 78 for particle size g3 the other treatments showed no statistically significant differences for emitter b in the analysis of the interaction of particle size and concentration fig 7 it was observed that pulses of soil particles with larger particle size g3 and higher particle amounts per pulse c3 tended to reduce the average dra values of emitter a with a value of 59 this same pattern of results was observed for emitter b which presented high levels of clogging for all particle size ranges associated with the treatment at the higher concentration c3 similar observations were reported by recent studies such as lavanholi et al 2018 pereira et al 2020 and zhang et al 2021 3 3 effect of isolated factors and specific positions of emitters in the line analyzing the effect of isolated factors we observed decreasing trends in the average dra values of emitters a and b when they were positioned downward fig 8 treatments involving the downward position resulted in mean dra values of 72 and 87 for emitters a and b respectively the downward facing position makes the drippers more prone to clogging due to a possible effect of deposition contaminants during the passage of the pulses of soil particle especially when the particle size range is high coelho et al 2007 tested the sensitivity of five emitter models to physical clogging with up and down facing line positions and also observed higher levels of clogging in the downward facing emitters treatments involving the upward facing position resulted in mean dra values of 73 and 92 for emitters a and b respectively the position of the line facing the side presented the highest average dra values for both emitters showing that this emitter position can help to reduce clogging in drip irrigation treatments involving the sideways position resulted in mean dra values of 75 and 94 for emitters a and b there was also a tendency toward lower average dra values of emitters a and b as the concentration levels and particle size ranges of the tested soil particles increased this trend was also verified by qingsong et al 2008 in their simulation trials of clogging in different emitter models treatments with c1 c2 and c3 resulted in mean dra values of 75 74 and 71 for emitter a for emitter b treatments with c1 c2 and c3 resulted in mean dra values of 91 91 and 90 respectively non pressure compensating emitters are prone to clogging but it is also important to note that the dimensions and geometry of the emitter labyrinth can influence the susceptibility to clogging either due to particle size or particle agglomeration at different diameters in a given place coelho et al 2014 2022 analyzing the isolated particle size factor we found that for emitter a treatment g1 was significantly different from treatment g3 demonstrating that the particle size of the soil was a dominant factor in the physical clogging of emitters according to adin and sacks 1991 the risk of emitter clogging depended more on the particle size of the soil than on the concentration of total suspended solids in the irrigation water niu et al 2013 concluded that particle size and concentration were primary factors that affected emitter clogging in drip irrigation treatments g1 g2 and g3 resulted in mean dra values of 79 74 and 67 for emitter a and 94 92 and 87 for emitter b we verified that there were no trends of emitter clogging by soil particles for the same position in the line regardless of the emitter model and the isolated factor under analysis fig 9 the average dra values of emitters a and b at specific locations on the line 1st to 7th positions and as a function of the isolated factors of emitter orientation amount of soil per pulse and soil particle size showed that there was no predominant effect of deposition of soil particles in the emitters in initial positions and no predominant effect of dragging supernatant soil particles in the establishment of the water discharge in the line with the advancement of the pulse of soil particles in the line the water solution and particles assume greater homogeneity reducing the effect of supernatants and deposition it is possible that stabilizing the water velocity would facilitate the reduction of emitter clogging such responses indicate the randomness of the process of clogging by soil particles with regard to specific positions in the line reinforcing the assertion that they should be considered as repetitions in the statistical analysis of dra values as a function of the experimental treatments it is likely that certain positions of the emitters in the line may be more susceptible to clogging by soil particles for the same treatment it is possible that at a considerable distance from the emitter in relation to the beginning of the line there will be a reduction in the chances of clogging by pulses of soil particles however this would not exempt them from this occurrence 4 conclusions laboratory simulation of the accidental entry of soil particles directly into the lateral lines of the drip irrigation system favored emitter clogging by soil particles over the short term such a simulation is similar to what can occur in assembly steps or inadequate maintenance routines in the field drippers with similar architectural arrangements but with different discharges showed different responses when exposed to pulses of soil particle of different particle size and amount emitters a and b presented mean values of relative discharge dra in all treatments of soil particles pulse of 73 and 91 respectively showing that emitter discharge is an important factor affecting clogging in emitters the particle size of the soil was a dominant factor in the physical clogging of emitters treatments that involved soil particles with diameters in the range of 0 26 0 50 mm resulted in the most severe clogging with emitters a and b having mean dra values of 67 and 87 respectively the orientation of flat mounted emitters in the lateral lines of drip irrigation systems is a factor that contributes to increased susceptibility to clogging by soil particles of different size and concentration the downward facing position made the tested emitters more likely to clog resulting in average dra values of 72 for emitter a and 87 for b treatments involving the up position resulted in mean dra values of 73 for emitter a and 92 for b the side facing position afforded the best performance showing that this emitter position can contribute to reducing the problem of clogging in drip irrigation treatments that involved the sideways position resulted in mean dra values of 75 for emitter a and 94 for b it will be necessary to adapt traditional burial dripline implements for installation of subsurface emitters in this promising side orientation in the field special attention is recommended to the irrigation assembly teams in the field in terms of inlet and outlet preventive plugging of main pipeline derivation lines lateral lines and riser pipes during the process of assembling the drip system in the field to avoid accidental entry of soil particles into the hydraulic system which will reduce the problem of clogging presented in this paper declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that
