21665,the performance of a submerged cylindrical point absorbing wave energy converter was explored under the addition of different nonlinear stiffness bistable conditions the limitations of previous studies were addressed by incorporating higher fidelity modelling devices employing bistability in other energy harvesting applications have improved the amount of power generated for wave energy converters most theoretical models with bistability were limited to one degree of freedom neglect nonlinearities such as viscous drag and are excited by unrealistic sinusoidal waves such simplifications lead to neglecting features such as modal interactions the presented model investigated a three degree of freedom submerged point absorber with bistability subjected to regular and irregular waves the bistable mechanism was an adjustable magnetic model such that a range of potential profiles were examined and parameterised for generality by features common between mechanisms for this device bistability may be used to obtain near optimal results and was suitably robust for changing ocean conditions regions of improvement were identified in terms of the changing natural frequency due to a nonlinear stiffness and a phase matching property in varying sea states a selected bistable condition demonstrated a 10 20 improvement in power production the consistency implies that semi active elements may be able to adjust the bistability to enhance power production keywords bistable performance enhancement passive control submerged point absorber 1 introduction ocean wave energy generation has been the subject of over two centuries of research cruz 2008 typical wave energy converters wec can be broadly classed as one of three types an attenuator a point absorber pa or a terminator drew et al 2009 there are other significant devices which are difficult to categorise into these classes such as oscillating water columns or overtopping devices however this paper focuses on a pa type wec which are systems in which the buoy is small relative to the wavelengths of incident waves and for a single pa is subsequently relatively insensitive to wave direction a representative diagram of the simplified ceto pa carnegie clean energy 2018 used in this study is shown in fig 1 whilst smaller than typical wavelengths the ceto is one of the large pas and therefore is more accurately described as a quasi pa for the purposes of this paper the ceto device will be referred to as a pa while the simple operation of a generic pa wec is well known there remains many challenges for wave energy greaves and iglesias 2018 due to the complexity of these unique challenges in the context of wave energy the technology as a whole remains at a low technology readiness level one of the areas which remains an actively studies topic is the methodology behind controlling pa devices hybrid control in which passively applied dynamics supplement an active controller may provide some advantages over active control algorithms wu et al 2018 bistable mechanisms using nonlinear stiffness have received notable attention over the past few years a generic bistable system is given in fig 2 for further clarity specific to wave energy a characteristic time history of the wec operating at low medium and high levels of bistability in terms of the central potential barrier is shown in fig 3 and the corresponding frequency domain displacement and generated power amplitudes are provided in fig 4 these figures simply show how increasing levels of bistability changes the resulting motion and power generation that is higher levels of bistability tends to force the wec to oscillate about two different stable regions and leads to an increase in the bandwidth of power generated while decreasing the peak performance this finding is in general consistent with many bistable or nonlinear dynamics that nonlinear systems may be very sensitive to small changes in system parameters particularly parameters responsible for transitions between linear and nonlinear regimes substantial benefits have been observed when using a bistable mechanism within the power take off unit pto with simple single degree of freedom dof simulation models zhang et al 2016 wu et al 2018 younesian and alam 2017 xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 there have been some attempts to optimise a nonlinear reactive force for power production abdelkhalik and darani 2018 however no method of implementing this force profile was provided methods using an asymmetric mass distribution to emulate a nonlinear effective stiffness have also been proposed meng et al 2019b a a model using a bistable mechanism composed of magnets xiao et al 2017 found that a bistable wec can harvest more energy than a linear wec when the excitation frequency is less than the natural frequency of the linear system another magnetic design composed of coaxial cylinders concluded that bistability can enhance the efficiency of a floating wec zhang et al 2019b however this study was restricted to a single dof and used a linear stiffness only valid for small oscillations though the damping in the system was optimised the linear stiffness was not the addition of bistability in this case did show significant improvement on the suboptimised system experimental investigations using different devices showed that the realistic benefit of bistability is significant and in some cases may be as much as a three times power increase due to phase matching têtu et al 2018 todalshaug et al 2016 since the geometries and general operation of wec devices and mechanisms differ significantly bistability is employed in various ways to either excite super harmonics to convert low frequency oscillations into high frequency oscillations harne and wang 2013 or to provide passive phase matching for a floating pa wec todalshaug et al 2016 conventional pas are designed to be floating rather than submerged accordingly there has been more research into floating systems than submerged systems while both systems may seem similar they undergo fundamentally different excitation and forces as a result submerged pas typically generate lower levels of power at longer wavelengths have reduced bandwidths but more readily capture power from multiple dof when compared to floating systems sergiienko et al 2017 in particular there is limited work in taking into account nonlinearity in stiffness in the theoretical modelling of a submerged wec wang et al 2018 and such work is related to a device that does not operate in the vertical heave direction in addition to restricted dofs many of the models previously employed do not include drag a study of a submerged wec compares the effect of bistability in 1 dof and 3 dof which includes drag schubert et al 2020 the study concluded that for regular waves an improvement is only seen under certain circumstances when the device is non optimally tuned the study was limited to regular wave scenarios and was primarily directed at observing if there was potential for any benefit but did not attempt to explore the cause of the benefit there have been numerous ideas proposed for the mechanism to provide a bistable force including mechanical springs zhang et al 2019a magnetic systems xiao et al 2017 and pneumatic systems todalshaug et al 2016 each of these suggestions provide unique benefits generally electromagnetic reactive mechanisms in the form of direct drive systems can be expected to have smaller reactive power losses compared to alternatives such as hydraulic systems pecher and kofoed 2017 how a submerged pa wec subject to irregular waves behaves when bistability is included and what bistable attributes are beneficial within the context of submerged wec remains a gap within current literature in this paper the limitation of previous studies will be addressed by incorporating higher fidelity system modelling including nonlinear coupling between the dynamic degrees of freedom in particular the following features differentiate the current work and contribute to the enhanced fidelity 1 the 1 dof model used by prior authors with relatively simple dynamics has been extended to 3 dof to allow for coupling between dof 2 a drag coefficient has been included to improve the estimation of velocity dependent forces acting on the buoy and consequently preventing unrealistically large amplitudes of motion 3 the regular wave excitation has been extended to irregular waves to better estimate the buoy performance under a more realistic broadband excitation 4 systems with bistability are often compared to poorly tuned monostable counterparts in the aforementioned studies such an assumption can lead to systems with nonlinear stiffnesses showing better performance but could be further improved by careful selection of a linear stiffness this study analyses both regular and irregular results with respect to the well tuned monostable counterparts to understand the real potential for improvement the combination of both the improved dynamic model and the broader range of simulation conditions furthers the current understanding of the applicability of bistability to submerged point absorbing wecs the impact of bistable control on a submerged 3 dof pa wec was explored to quantify how simple hydrodynamics and the passive control system interact a 3 dof theoretical model of the ceto device being developed by carnegie clean energy 2018 was constructed the model was subjected to a set of regular waves and three different irregular waves or sea states a nonlinear stiffness mechanism was included and varied to understand what characteristics are important for power production capability the mathematical models are described in section 2 with the representation of the magnetic bistable mechanism given in section 2 1 4 as well as a dimensionless parameter pertinent to any bistable system as a means to generalise results the considerations and limitations of the used modelling method are outlined in section 3 and the results of these simulations are presented and discussed in section 4 with a summary of the findings in section 5 2 mathematical models the governing equation for both regular and irregular scenarios can be derived from the contributing forces represented in the equation 1 m x t f e x t f r x x t f h f pto x x t f d x x t f bi x t where the inertia of each dof of the system is represented by the matrix m and x is the position vector containing the surge x heave z and pitch θ coordinates also f represents a 3 dof force vector and the subscripts e r h pto d and bi indicate the excitation radiation hydrostatic pto drag and bistable forces respectively the time is represented by t and the dependencies of each force denoted in eq 1 are considered implicit in subsequent equations for succinct notation this equation forms the basis of the governing equations for all three models presented with constituting force components either simplified or represented differently 2 1 regular waves when subjected to a single monochromatic wave the forces in eq 1 may be quantified in the time domain through the following approaches 2 1 1 excitation force the excitation force f e is the superposition of the froude krylov and diffraction forces and can be calculated using linear potential flow theory this force may be considered as the force on the buoy due to incoming waves in the work presented here the boundary element method bem solver nemoh babarit 2014 which numerically calculates various hydrodynamic quantities using linear potential flow theory was used to calculate the amplitude f e and phase ϕ of the excitation force relative to the incident wave in all 3 dof within a range of frequencies and can be represented in vector form as falnes 2007 2 f e f e cos ϕ ϕ s ω t where ω represent the excitation frequency the hadamard product operator is used to indicate element wise multiplication the additional surge phase offset applied to each dof ϕ s represents the phase difference due to the horizontal position of the buoy relative to the incoming wave this phase difference may be quantified by 3 ϕ s k x where k is the wavenumber which is the solution to the dispersion relationship chao jiang et al 2014 4 ω 2 g k tanh k h where the depth of the water is represented by h and the acceleration due to gravity is represented by g 2 1 2 radiation force the radiation force may be considered as the force on the buoy due to the waves radiating when the buoy moves this force is represented in the time domain by the cummins equation cummins 1962 5 f r a x 0 t k t t x t d t where a and k are termed the infinite frequency added mass and the memory function respectively the convolution integral quantifies the influence of the previous state on the current state in practice this integral may be computationally expensive for active control and real time implementation thus an alternative approach is more commonly implemented the frequency domain representation represented by the ˆ symbol of the radiation force is perez and fossen 2009 6 f ˆ r b ω i ω a ω x ˆ i ω where b ω is the frequency dependent radiation damping and a ω is the added mass these hydrodynamic quantities are also able to be calculated using nemoh and other bem solvers a transfer function relating the velocity to the value of the integral in eq 5 may be constructed using these two hydrodynamic quantities perez and fossen 2009 in general the radiation forces experienced in each dof may be influenced by motion in other dofs and by geometry accordingly transfer functions between all velocity components and all convolution integral components may be constructed and combined into a single state space model to account for interaction between different dofs under the linear bem theory used by nemoh for an axisymmetric device in a nominal horizontal position the radiation force in the heave direction is independent of motion in the surge or pitch directions however the radiation forces in the surge and pitch directions are coupled therefore in general the contribution of the convolution integral in each dof μ which is effectively the fluid memory may be described as 7 p a ss p b ss x μ c ss p where p is a state vector of non physical variables and a ss b ss and c ss are state space matrices constructed from the aforementioned transfer functions and are provided in appendix b the memory function or impulse response function can be represented as armesto et al 2015 8 k t 2 π 0 b ω cos ω t d ω which may be split into a finite and an infinite integral which may be solved numerically and analytically respectively armesto et al 2015 further details and reasoning may be found in the literature sources provided through comparison over an appropriate range of frequencies it was found that the state space representation results with an error of less than 2 thereby adequately representing the integral term shown in eq 5 the direct evaluation is more computationally demanding than the state space representation and both methods give similar results therefore the state space representation was used in this study 2 1 3 hydrostatic and pto forces the hydrostatic or buoyancy force acts only in the heave direction and is the difference between the weight of displaced water and the weight of the buoy given by 9 f h z ρ g v m g where ρ m and v are the density of water buoy mass and buoy volume respectively for a fully submerged buoy this force is constant accordingly a pretension force f p equal in magnitude to the hydrostatic force is included in the pto force in addition to a stiffness and damping term as follows 10 f pto b δ l k s δ l f p in eq 10 b is the damping coefficient k s is the spring constant and δ l is the extension of the tether this defines the submerged nominal position to be δ l 0 the pto force is quantified in terms of the tether motions and acts in the direction of the tether extension in order to relate the tether motions to the surge heave and pitch coordinates the relationship between x z θ and δ l α ϕ with both sets of coordinates represented in fig 5 is 11 δ l x a sin θ 2 z l a a cos θ 2 l 12 α arctan x a sin θ z l a a cos θ 13 ϕ θ α where a and l are the distance between buoy centre and tether attachment point and the total tether length respectively both the damping coefficient and spring constant may be optimised for a given frequency the optimal values may be derived falnes 2002 and for a heaving pa in a linear hydrodynamic regime are defined to be 14 b opt b z ω k s opt ω 2 m a z ω where the subscript z denotes the heave component for a 3 dof system subjected to regular wave scenarios the optimal pto stiffness may be found approximately by using eq 14 as an initial estimate and adjusting k s until the time averaged power is at a local maximum the pto damping was found using the same method as the optimal stiffness using matlab s constrained nonlinear minimisation function fmincon using an interior point algorithm to optimise for power in the 3 dof scenarios for single tether wecs heave is often considered the most influential dof related to power production the instantaneous power generated by the wec is approximated by 15 p inst t b δ l 2 t the power performance of the device may therefore be represented by the time averaged power given by 16 p avg 1 t j t i j t f p inst j δ t j where t i t f δ t j and t are the initial time final time the j th time step and the total time interval respectively these initial and final times are chosen to discard any transient effects this metric may be used to quantify the impact of bistable additions on the overall power production 2 1 4 force inducing bistability a force which can lead to a bistable scenario such as a magnetic force may induce a two well potential energy barrier as depicted on fig 2 such systems exhibit unique dynamic features not seen in systems with only a single potential well these features include two single period steady state responses for a given excitation frequency due to the bifurcation of responses a large dependence on initial conditions and excitation amplitudes stochastic resonances resonating using a combination of low amplitude inputs and the excitation of input frequency harmonics harne and wang 2017 in this context some form of stochastic resonance is expected if the bistable parameters are selected appropriately this is primarily a result of real ocean waves been stochastic in nature however for this system it is uncertain whether the phenomenon of stochastic resonance will actually provide a benefit the inclusion of all these features may lead to broader resonance bandwidths particularly at lower frequencies frequency up conversion which turns low frequency oscillations into higher frequency oscillations and performance improvement in stochastic excitation contexts the main benefit of bistability is thought to occur during interwell motion rather than intrawell due to the snap through property zhang et al 2018 in this case this snap through mechanism forms an avenue for low amplitude oscillations to change into large amplitude oscillations if the excitation is sufficient to overcome the dividing potential barrier harne and wang 2017 the escape from a potential well can broaden the frequency range of a generator mann and owens 2010 while each of these characteristic features may be exploited for different applications bistable wave energy systems may be well suited given the low frequency and stochastic nature of ocean waves for the purposes of this study a magnetic dipole model was used to create a bistable system a depiction of the wec pto model with bistability is given in fig 6 the potential energy between two magnetic dipoles in this case between the stationary outer dipole and the dipole within the translator may be derived from griffiths 2014 17 u bi m d 1 b d 2 m d 2 b d 1 where m d 1 is the dipole moment of the first dipole b d 2 is the magnetic field of the second dipole at the location of the first dipole and represents the dot product the same potential energy exists if deriving the potential energy of the other dipole the force between the two magnets may then be defined as griffiths 2014 18 f bi u bi m d 1 b d 2 assuming magnetisation in the vertical direction at nominal position the dipole moments are given by 19 m d 0 0 v m m where v m is the volume of the magnet and m is the magnetisation field per unit volume the magnetic field for a dipole is given by 20 b d 2 μ 0 4 π m d 1 r r 3 where r and r are the displacement and distance between the dipoles respectively and μ 0 is the permeability of free space yung et al 1998 using eqs 18 and 20 the force between the two dipoles may be derived as 21 f bi μ 0 m 1 v 1 m 2 v 2 4 π 9 δ l r 0 2 δ l 2 5 2 15 δ l 3 r 0 2 δ l 2 7 2 l ˆ where r 0 is the horizontal distance between dipoles as shown in fig 6 and l ˆ is the unit vector in the direction of the tether extension the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the two magnetic poles similarly the potential energy of this force can be derived as 22 u bi μ 0 m 1 v 1 m 2 v 2 4 π 1 r 0 2 δ l 2 3 2 3 δ l 2 r 0 2 δ l 2 5 2 the potential energy of the dipole representation superimposed with the potential energy from a linear stiffness provides the intended bistable profile additional theoretical dipoles may be added by superposition to scale the central peak in potential energy for the purposes of quantifying the magnetic potential energy and force and to generalise the degree of bistability between any mechanism the dimensionless parameter γ is proposed which is the ratio of the average potential energy surface density from the incoming wave field u wave and the potential energy of the bistable system at the nominal position u bi z 0 that is 23 γ u bi z 0 u wave for a regular wave the time averaged potential energy per unit area u ˆ wave may be expressed as gran 1992 24 u ˆ wave 1 4 ρ g a 2 where a is the amplitude of the incoming wave the parameter γ may be varied to define the height of the central potential peak in the potential well represented in fig 7a in addition the location of the stable regions can also be varied in this case by the changing the horizontal distance between dipole r 0 while keeping γ constant the impact of changing r 0 on the potential wells is given in fig 7b varying these parameters gave a large range of possible force and potential profiles which were used to build an understanding around which bistable conditions are favourable for the ocean wave energy context it was found that trends were more clearly visualised when γ is scaled by r 0 2 therefore the scaled dimensionless parameter γ is defined as 25 γ γ r 0 2 which represents the potential energy of the buoy normalised by the potential energy of the upstream wave over an equivalent projected area 2 1 5 drag force the viscous drag force is a nonlinear force often neglected in simple models given by 26 f d 1 2 ρ c d a d sign x r x r x r where c d a d and x r are the 3 dof coefficients of drag characteristic area and relative velocity of the buoy with respect to the surrounding fluid respectively as an approximation the instantaneous fluid velocity at the geometric centre of the buoy was used this assumption is made with the understanding that pas are typically small compared to the wavelength of the incident wave by assuming a linear wave the fluid velocity in the heave and surge directions may be estimated as 27 x f a ω cosh k h z d s sinh k h cos k x ω t 28 z f a ω sinh k h z d s sinh k h sin k x ω t where d s is the submergence depth of the geometric centre of the buoy combining these descriptions of forces into eq 1 gives the model of a 3 dof submerged pa wec further descriptions and model specifics may be found in section 3 2 2 irregular waves as an extension to the 3 dof model irregular waves which are more representative of real ocean waves may be used irregular waves may be considered the superposition of many regular waves of different frequencies and are categorised by a spectrum various methods of calculating wave spectra exist such as the jonswap or pierson moskowitz spectra for the purpose of this study and for simplicity the method used is the jonswap wave spectrum s ω given by gran 1992 29 s ω α s g 2 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω p ω 4 γ r where α s and ω p are the slope parameter and peak frequency respectively the r term is given by 30 r exp 1 2 σ 2 ω ω p 1 2 where σ is a measure of peak width and is 0 07 when ω ω p and 0 09 when ω ω p two important parameters which may be used to describe an irregular wave are the significant wave height h s and the average zero crossing wave period t z the slope parameter may be approximated by 31 α π 3 h s 2 g 2 t z 4 and the peak enhancement factor γ can be approximated by 32 γ 7 1 2 18 1 0 5 g 2 t z h s 2 once the spectrum is known a time series of the wave elevation may be produced this time series is the superposition of individual frequency waves with amplitudes related to the specified wave spectrum regular wave elevation η reg is represented as 33 η reg t a cos ω t whereas the irregular wave elevation η irr is given by 34 η irr t j 1 n 2 s ω j δ ω j cos ω j t ϵ j where ϵ i is a randomly generated phase offset for each discrete frequency in the spectrum and n is the number of discrete frequencies faltinsen 1993 2 2 1 excitation force the excitation force for irregular waves can be calculated hals 2010 using eq 34 and extending equation 2 giving 35 f e t j 1 n 2 s ω j δ ω j f e j cos ϕ ω j t ϕ s ϵ j 2 2 2 pto force as an irregular wave has many frequencies the frequency for which the pto is tuned using eq 14 is the energy frequency which may be calculated using the following equations sheng et al 2017 36 f e 1 t e where t e is the energy period calculated by 37 t e 2 π m 1 m 0 where m n is the spectral moment defined as 38 m n 0 s ω ω n d ω 2 2 3 drag force the drag force for the irregular scenario has the same form as eq 26 however the relative fluid velocities are calculated slightly differently for linear wave theory superposition may be used to give 39 x f j 1 n a j ω j cosh k j h z d s sinh k j h cos k j x ω j t ϵ j 40 z f j 1 n a j ω j sinh k j h z d s sinh k j h sin k j x ω j t ϵ j which provides a method to estimate the fluid velocity at the centre of the buoy to be used in the calculation of the drag force 2 2 4 potential energy the time averaged potential energy of the wave u wave is a metric used in eq 23 to classify the degree of bistability for an irregular wave the time averaged potential energy per unit area may be expressed as gran 1992 41 u ˆ wave 1 4 ρ g j 1 n a j 2 1 2 ρ g j 1 n s ω j δ ω to calculate the time averaged potential energy for a given buoy u ˆ wave may be multiplied by the horizontal cross sectional area of the buoy 3 simulation considerations for each simulation there were an number of considerations and parameters specific to each scenario these considerations and parameters will be provided in this section in the regular wave simulations the wec system was excited by a series of monochromatic waves and the resulting dynamic behaviour was analysed for each frequency to quantify motion and power performance for each frequency the optimal stiffness found through a local optimisation search was used in initial regular wave simulations to test the impact of bistability on poorly tuned conditions the optimal stiffness for a single frequency was used in an additional set of regular wave simulations each individual regular wave simulation was relatively fast taking approximately 10 s for the irregular scenario the wec was excited by an irregular wave with locally optimised pto settings the bistable parameters γ and r 0 were varied to explore the impact on power production the same simulations were run using the sub optimal pto settings found from eqs 14 and 36 to explore the sensitivity to tuning the mechanisms of any improvements seen were explored through the phase relationship between the excitation force and tether velocity as well as the stiffness potential energy profiles the robustness of the bistable control system was tested by subjecting the wec with a sub optimal pto setting to a different irregular wave then to establish if any trends were present two more irregular wave spectra were simulated using the corresponding sub optimal pto settings for each respective wave the irregular wave scenarios were more challenging to simulate due to the long simulation times required to get reliable time averaged results and the multitude of frequencies involved depending on the case an individual simulation could take approximately 10 15 min the model dimensions and scenario conditions are outlined below 3 1 model dimensions the geometry of the buoy was selected to be similar to the ceto design developed by carnegie clean energy 2018 the diagram in fig 1 details various relevant physical quantities these physical quantities as well as some general quantities used in the simulations are listed in table 1 the drag properties for a buoy of this shape were sourced from literature rafiee and fiévez 2015 and are given in table 2 3 2 scenario conditions the parameters pertinent to the regular and irregular scenarios are detailed in tables 3 and 4 respectively the optimal pto conditions for the irregular waves are only provided for scenario 1 because scenarios 2 and 3 are to specifically test non optimal pto conditions with bistability to check the robustness of bistability the mathematical model presented in the previous section was built and simulated in matlab and simulink mathworks inc natick ma usa a variable step solver was selected to run the simulation with simulink automatically selecting either ode45 or ode15s depending on the stiffness of the simulation this measure of numerical stiffness may change depending on the degree of nonlinearity hence the automatic solver selection was employed to ensure a suitable solver was selected for each simulation three different irregular wave scenarios were used to determine the robustness of the bistable control algorithm the magnetic coefficients given in eq 21 were determined by the specified parameter γ 4 results and discussion the results for the simulation scenarios described in section 3 are presented and discussed in the following sections 4 1 regular waves the regular wave scenarios were simulated with locally optimised and then suboptimal pto conditions the resulting motion rms and time averaged power for the optimal condition with varying γ are shown in figs 8a and 8b respectively the motion rms is calculated by 42 x t 1 n t j 1 n t x t j 2 where n t is the number of time steps and the summation and square operations are performed across each dof the results for the suboptimal conditions tuned to frequency ω 0 77 rad s are given in figs 9a and 9b respectively the frequency ω 0 77 rad s was selected as it represents an off peak response with a reasonable response amplitude as seen in fig 8b the addition of bistability for an optimally tuned system subjected to regular waves is detrimental to the power generation performance such a result is expected as additional stiffness will only lead to suboptimal tuning however for a suboptimally tuned system subjected to regular waves shown in fig 9b there are bistable conditions under which substantial improvements are seen particularly at lower frequencies the main benefit is seen when the scaled dimensionless potential γ 2 beyond this level the motion performance is reduced however higher levels of bistability seem to provide a slight benefit to higher frequencies this agrees with conventional findings as higher frequencies tend to be lower amplitude and are hence the motions are constrained to one side of the potential well when restricted to one side of a potential well a higher stiffness is seen making such regions suitably tuned for higher frequencies similarly at lower levels of bistability lower stiffnesses are seen and in general would be more suited to lower frequency excitation throughout most operating conditions though the resultant power is still less than the optimally tuned scenarios bistability has acted to improve the power production potential for a system tuned to a single frequency thereby making this passive control system more robust for regular wave conditions the motion rms shown in figs 8a and 9a show varying results as the level of bistability changes the impact is most evident in the heave results in the optimally tuned condition the heave results are inconsistently altered by the inclusion of bistability with many large amplitude responses at low frequencies reduced to small amplitude oscillations this indicates the sensitivity of the optimal conditions at lower frequencies however for the detuned results the heave rms increases for lower levels of bistability and decreases for higher levels similar to the corresponding time averaged power results the surge and pitch motions generally tended to reduce for both optimal and non optimal conditions to understand the origins of the peaks seen in the motion rms the sub optimal frequency domain responses ignoring geometric and drag nonlinearities for surge x ˆ heave z ˆ pitch θ ˆ along with the transfer function between excitation force and wave amplitude are provided in fig 10 these results demonstrate that the driving factor behind the widest peak shown in fig 9a is the force amplitude at different frequencies combined with the system dynamics consequently the predominant peak in power in fig 9b is due to the heave motion primarily governed by the force amplitude at each frequency the additional peaks seen are due to large motions in the surge and pitch dof it can also been seen that the surge and pitch dofs are coupled through hydrodynamics but heave is not coupled in the frequency domain the absence of coupling stems from the linearisation about a nominal position in this nominal position the radiation force in heave is not coupled to either surge or pitch and the geometric nonlinearity from the tether is not present these assumptions provide clarity as to why they may be insufficient to fully capture indicative dynamics intrinsic to the system the time domain results demonstrate that all dofs interact to some degree one of the key differences between the frequency domain and time domain simulations is the addition of drag which reduces the amplitude of motion observed in surge and pitch to much more realistic levels the pitch resonance is no longer noticeable in the time domain results likely due to a combination of geometric and drag nonlinearities the lower two peaks seen in the heave rms results for the non optimised system are not present in the frequency domain responses and therefore are likely the result of coupling with another dof each excitation frequency results in different hydrodynamic characteristics which causes the natural frequency of the system to change the natural frequencies in surge ω n x heave ω n z and pitch ω n θ for the submerged pa were derived as 43 ω n x g ρ v m l a m a x ω 44 ω n z k s m a z ω 45 ω n θ a a l f p l i θ a θ ω where a x ω a z ω and a θ ω are the surge heave and pitch frequency dependent added mass respectively the natural frequencies ω n x and ω n z have been derived previously meng et al 2019b and the derivation for ω n θ is given in appendix a the natural frequencies for both the optimised system and the suboptimal system are provided on fig 11 unsurprisingly the natural frequency in the heave dof for the optimal system closely follows the excitation frequency with only a small deviation around the second peak in surge i e when surge and pitch motions become significant therefore the general best practice for such systems is to tune the pto to enforce the heave natural frequency to equal the frequency of excitation another interesting quality occurs when the heave and surge natural frequencies coincide the surge natural frequency 0 3 rad s does not change significantly with frequency and is evident on the motion results as a large peak in the surge rms at the first harmonic of this frequency 0 6 rad s another peak occurs even in the sub optimal results in figs 9a and 9b these peaks are seen to influence the performance of the device the pitch natural frequency results in a peak in the frequency domain but does not appear in the time domain results even when the heave and pitch natural frequencies coincide the frequency domain responses combined with the respective natural frequencies exemplify why drag additional dofs and geometric nonlinearities should not be ignored ignoring these factors can lead to overestimation of motion slight shifts in frequency peaks and the absence of significant peaks altogether 4 2 irregular waves with optimal and non optimal tuning the irregular wave scenario 1 table 4 with an optimised pto linear stiffness was simulated and the time averaged power for varying γ and r 0 is given in fig 12a the same scenarios were simulated with the non optimal linear stiffness and the corresponding results are given in fig 12b comparing the optimal with non optimal the resulting peak power performance seen in figs 12a and 12b are the same however the peak occurs at different bistable conditions this demonstrates that a bistable system is capable of achieving the same optimal results as an optimal passively tuned controller therefore the same conclusion may be inferred as for regular waves for an optimally tuned system bistability does not increase the amount of power extracted however the results from the non optimal condition showed clear regions of beneficial and detrimental impacts the main benefit is seen when γ 1 which indicates that the bistability or the potential energy profile is beneficially exploited when the overall system is monostable there are three principal regions of benefit observed in the power generation results for the non optimal pto irregular wave scenario 1 1 region 1 r 0 2 m and γ 3 2 region 2 r 0 5 and γ 1 5 2 5 and 3 region 3 r 0 2 m and γ 1 which are marked in fig 12b the mechanisms behind the benefit seen in each of these regions provide insight for optimal bistable conditions and is explored in the following section 4 3 irregular waves phase and natural frequency to further investigate these beneficial regions indicated in fig 12b the time averaged power and time lag t lag between the excitation force and tether velocity for varying γ and a constant r 0 for irregular wave scenario 1 are given in fig 13 the simulations sampled are shown by the line on fig 12b which passes through region 2 and the edge of region 3 a time lag was used as a proxy for phase lag as the phase difference for an irregular wave is not clearly defined the time lag was calculated using matlab s cross correlation function xcorr which measures the similarity between two signals as one signal is offset in time the time offset at which the maximum cross correlation occurs has been taken to be the time lag the phase relationship shows that this system experiences strong phase matching which is beneficial for power as the power maxima correlate with minimising lag for some levels of bistability there also exists a region between γ 0 75 and γ 1 75 where the power reduces to a minimum indicating that for some levels of bistability very poor tuning exists so a finer understanding of how bistability impacts the tuning parameters in each bistable scenario is required it should be noted that a negative time lag here represents the scenario when the excitation force is leading the tether extension velocity the significant drop and increase in lag at low and high γ respectively may be a result of the system oscillating near resonance conditions in each region the zero crossing period is 8 s which corresponds to the jumps in the time lag indicating the presence of a sudden phase shift these results suggest that the effective stiffness experienced by the system when power is maximised due to change in bistable circumstance causes the system to be well tuned for the incident irregular wave conditions the jumps in time lag at γ 0 4 and 2 5 in monochromatic systems would typically indicate the presence of a resonant condition for this irregular excitation spectrum a similar effective resonant condition feature may be the cause behind these sharp jumps the results in fig 12b demonstrate that any beneficial or detrimental effect due to the nonlinear stiffness is highly dependent on both γ and r 0 to emphasise the substantial difference between the bistable circumstances over each region the stiffness potential energy profile u stiff around the peak power response as well as the normalised histogram showing the distribution of tether extension δ l are shown in fig 14a respectively additionally a number of potential profiles which demonstrated detrimental responses are shown in fig 14b the normalised distribution of tether extension is overlaid on these graphs to indicate the change in resulting system dynamics due to the nonlinear stiffness of the system the effective natural frequency ω n of the system in heave also changes during operation this property may be calculated as 46 ω n k s f bi l m a z where f bi l represents the contribution to the stiffness due to the bistable force and a z represents the infinite frequency added mass in the heave direction the effective natural frequencies for the beneficial and detrimental cases are given in figs 15a and 15b respectively there are several known mechanisms through which bistability can improve performance of systems harne and wang 2017 the snap through mechanism in which the central peak in the potential well is frequently overcome seems to not provide much benefit here and is overall detrimental as depicted in the results presented in fig 14b for case r 0 2 7 and γ 2 3 the regions that showed some benefit may be explained by different mechanisms in region 1 the natural frequency of the system see fig 15a b1 dips below the optimal linear natural frequency the location of the oscillations in these scenarios imply that the system is operating in a physical regime which is exposed to near optimal natural frequencies this property would improve the power performance as the device would be effectively tuned for a large portion of the operating range due to the large range of natural frequencies in standard operation such a system should be robust for varying sea conditions by extension the best results seen in region 2 are when the natural frequencies of the system are at or close to the optimal linear natural frequency as region 2 just touches the optimal frequency such systems are not exposed to the large range of natural frequencies seen in region 1 but are well tuned for a given operational condition consequently it is expected that for changing sea conditions such passive control systems would detune in region 3 the effective stiffness about the nominal position is negative creating a new equilibrium area the effective natural frequency at the new equilibrium position coincides with the optimal linear natural frequency this is the same fundamental finding as regions 1 and 2 but about a new operating condition this shows that the best performance is when the operating natural frequency roughly matches the optimal linear natural frequency and when the heave component of the excitation force and tether velocity are in phase in contrast in the regions of significant detrimental contributions see fig 15b the operating natural frequency has been shifted further away from the optimal natural frequency or rather the natural frequency around the equilibrium point does not coincide with the optimal linear natural frequency in these cases bistability has acted to inhibit motion as if the system was poorly tuned 4 4 irregular waves changing sea states to test the robustness of the bistable systems the pto conditions from the detuned irregular wave scenario 2 were used for irregular wave scenario 1 excitation the resulting time averaged power is shown in fig 16a furthermore maps for non optimal pto configurations for irregular wave scenarios 2 and 3 are given in figs 16b and 16c respectively these additional plots demonstrate the applicability of such systems to a variety of sea states results from regular waves demonstrated that a bistable system can exhibit improved responses when the system is suboptimal thereby improving the robustness of the passive control system similarly if a system is tuned for one irregular wave the performance when subjected to an alternative sea state is an indication of the robustness of the passive system the results presented in fig 16a demonstrate how the system responds to irregular wave scenario 2 when non optimally tuned for irregular wave scenario 1 the trend of results resemble the findings of fig 12b with local maxima around similar regions this finding indicates that a bistable system may be found which is well suited to both sea states furthermore such a passive system would be suitably robust to deal with the changing sea states observed in real ocean conditions the results from the simulations of irregular wave scenarios 2 and 3 depict similar trends compared to irregular wave scenario 1 irregular wave scenario 2 has a lower significant wave height and irregular wave scenario 3 has a lower significant wave height and a higher zero crossing wave period as shown in table 4 the regions of optimal performance region 2 and good phase matching region 3 did shift a small amount for different wave conditions but the regions which are exposed to a larger range of natural frequencies region 1 was reasonably consistent as expected for example if a control system with γ 0 625 and r 0 3 was selected as marked in each graph in fig 16 all systems would experience a 10 20 improvement to power production compared to the initial passive control system without bistability when tuned for the energy frequency of the specific irregular wave the variety of waves presented show that there are common trends seen in the benefit of bistability for different conditions and imply that if a sea state can be characterised a suitable bistable potential energy profile could be determined therefore in addition to a robust passive control system it may be beneficial to provide an active or semi active component to make fine adjustments to the bistable force as required the findings presented in this work imply that bistability or nonlinear stiffness can provide some passive benefit for a specific system and a given sea state and that this benefit will be relatively robust in applying to changing sea conditions without the need for sophisticated control systems to further extend this work the impact of nonlinear hydrodynamics on bistable mechanics should be explored either by including a nonlinear representation of froude krylov forces or by simulating using computational fluid dynamics the practical implementation of these should also be further investigated as the presented approach effectively constructs a particular potential profile from fictitious magnetic dipoles in principle if an optimal nonlinear stiffness is identified a passive system can be constructed by springs or magnets to realise the benefit additionally an active component to adjust the nonlinear stiffness subsystem based on a changing sea state could be included to further improve the system furthermore while an understanding of how bistability impacts a single pa in a passive control context is useful in reality such wecs will more likely be deployed in arrays the array context should therefore also be further explored with bistability to understand the impact of nonlinear stiffness on coupling dynamics between submerged pa wecs 5 conclusion the impact of a nonlinear stiffness or a bistable force acting on a submerged point absorbing wave energy converter was investigated a model of a 3 dof ceto shaped device was constructed and subjected to regular waves the degree of bistability was varied the resultant motion and time averaged power showed that for an optimally tuned system bistability provided no benefit whereas for a non optimally tuned system certain levels of bistability were able to improve the performance for different frequency ranges lower levels of bistability seem to benefit lower frequencies while higher levels benefit higher frequencies the same model was then subjected to an irregular wave to better reflect real operating conditions again for an optimally tuned system nonlinear stiffness tended to reduce performance but for sub optimally tuned conditions bistability was able to obtain near optimal performance by varying the bistable potential profile three regions of benefit were observed the primary mechanism of improvement was due to the nonlinear stiffness exposing the operating system to a range of apparent natural frequencies specifically in close proximity to the optimal linear natural frequency which resulted in improved performance for a range of operating conditions this mechanism seems to be robust over varying sea states with a consistent 10 20 improvement to power production in the systems simulated another linked mechanism is a passive phase matching property which appears to be associated with the natural frequency of the system but was demonstrated to be strongly connected with the power generation capability the addition of a bistable force has been shown to provide a robust passive control system with common performance trends between different ocean conditions which invites the possibility of an active bistable system to adjust the nonlinear stiffness force appropriately for different sea conditions credit authorship contribution statement

21665,the performance of a submerged cylindrical point absorbing wave energy converter was explored under the addition of different nonlinear stiffness bistable conditions the limitations of previous studies were addressed by incorporating higher fidelity modelling devices employing bistability in other energy harvesting applications have improved the amount of power generated for wave energy converters most theoretical models with bistability were limited to one degree of freedom neglect nonlinearities such as viscous drag and are excited by unrealistic sinusoidal waves such simplifications lead to neglecting features such as modal interactions the presented model investigated a three degree of freedom submerged point absorber with bistability subjected to regular and irregular waves the bistable mechanism was an adjustable magnetic model such that a range of potential profiles were examined and parameterised for generality by features common between mechanisms for this device bistability may be used to obtain near optimal results and was suitably robust for changing ocean conditions regions of improvement were identified in terms of the changing natural frequency due to a nonlinear stiffness and a phase matching property in varying sea states a selected bistable condition demonstrated a 10 20 improvement in power production the consistency implies that semi active elements may be able to adjust the bistability to enhance power production keywords bistable performance enhancement passive control submerged point absorber 1 introduction ocean wave energy generation has been the subject of over two centuries of research cruz 2008 typical wave energy converters wec can be broadly classed as one of three types an attenuator a point absorber pa or a terminator drew et al 2009 there are other significant devices which are difficult to categorise into these classes such as oscillating water columns or overtopping devices however this paper focuses on a pa type wec which are systems in which the buoy is small relative to the wavelengths of incident waves and for a single pa is subsequently relatively insensitive to wave direction a representative diagram of the simplified ceto pa carnegie clean energy 2018 used in this study is shown in fig 1 whilst smaller than typical wavelengths the ceto is one of the large pas and therefore is more accurately described as a quasi pa for the purposes of this paper the ceto device will be referred to as a pa while the simple operation of a generic pa wec is well known there remains many challenges for wave energy greaves and iglesias 2018 due to the complexity of these unique challenges in the context of wave energy the technology as a whole remains at a low technology readiness level one of the areas which remains an actively studies topic is the methodology behind controlling pa devices hybrid control in which passively applied dynamics supplement an active controller may provide some advantages over active control algorithms wu et al 2018 bistable mechanisms using nonlinear stiffness have received notable attention over the past few years a generic bistable system is given in fig 2 for further clarity specific to wave energy a characteristic time history of the wec operating at low medium and high levels of bistability in terms of the central potential barrier is shown in fig 3 and the corresponding frequency domain displacement and generated power amplitudes are provided in fig 4 these figures simply show how increasing levels of bistability changes the resulting motion and power generation that is higher levels of bistability tends to force the wec to oscillate about two different stable regions and leads to an increase in the bandwidth of power generated while decreasing the peak performance this finding is in general consistent with many bistable or nonlinear dynamics that nonlinear systems may be very sensitive to small changes in system parameters particularly parameters responsible for transitions between linear and nonlinear regimes substantial benefits have been observed when using a bistable mechanism within the power take off unit pto with simple single degree of freedom dof simulation models zhang et al 2016 wu et al 2018 younesian and alam 2017 xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 there have been some attempts to optimise a nonlinear reactive force for power production abdelkhalik and darani 2018 however no method of implementing this force profile was provided methods using an asymmetric mass distribution to emulate a nonlinear effective stiffness have also been proposed meng et al 2019b a a model using a bistable mechanism composed of magnets xiao et al 2017 found that a bistable wec can harvest more energy than a linear wec when the excitation frequency is less than the natural frequency of the linear system another magnetic design composed of coaxial cylinders concluded that bistability can enhance the efficiency of a floating wec zhang et al 2019b however this study was restricted to a single dof and used a linear stiffness only valid for small oscillations though the damping in the system was optimised the linear stiffness was not the addition of bistability in this case did show significant improvement on the suboptimised system experimental investigations using different devices showed that the realistic benefit of bistability is significant and in some cases may be as much as a three times power increase due to phase matching têtu et al 2018 todalshaug et al 2016 since the geometries and general operation of wec devices and mechanisms differ significantly bistability is employed in various ways to either excite super harmonics to convert low frequency oscillations into high frequency oscillations harne and wang 2013 or to provide passive phase matching for a floating pa wec todalshaug et al 2016 conventional pas are designed to be floating rather than submerged accordingly there has been more research into floating systems than submerged systems while both systems may seem similar they undergo fundamentally different excitation and forces as a result submerged pas typically generate lower levels of power at longer wavelengths have reduced bandwidths but more readily capture power from multiple dof when compared to floating systems sergiienko et al 2017 in particular there is limited work in taking into account nonlinearity in stiffness in the theoretical modelling of a submerged wec wang et al 2018 and such work is related to a device that does not operate in the vertical heave direction in addition to restricted dofs many of the models previously employed do not include drag a study of a submerged wec compares the effect of bistability in 1 dof and 3 dof which includes drag schubert et al 2020 the study concluded that for regular waves an improvement is only seen under certain circumstances when the device is non optimally tuned the study was limited to regular wave scenarios and was primarily directed at observing if there was potential for any benefit but did not attempt to explore the cause of the benefit there have been numerous ideas proposed for the mechanism to provide a bistable force including mechanical springs zhang et al 2019a magnetic systems xiao et al 2017 and pneumatic systems todalshaug et al 2016 each of these suggestions provide unique benefits generally electromagnetic reactive mechanisms in the form of direct drive systems can be expected to have smaller reactive power losses compared to alternatives such as hydraulic systems pecher and kofoed 2017 how a submerged pa wec subject to irregular waves behaves when bistability is included and what bistable attributes are beneficial within the context of submerged wec remains a gap within current literature in this paper the limitation of previous studies will be addressed by incorporating higher fidelity system modelling including nonlinear coupling between the dynamic degrees of freedom in particular the following features differentiate the current work and contribute to the enhanced fidelity 1 the 1 dof model used by prior authors with relatively simple dynamics has been extended to 3 dof to allow for coupling between dof 2 a drag coefficient has been included to improve the estimation of velocity dependent forces acting on the buoy and consequently preventing unrealistically large amplitudes of motion 3 the regular wave excitation has been extended to irregular waves to better estimate the buoy performance under a more realistic broadband excitation 4 systems with bistability are often compared to poorly tuned monostable counterparts in the aforementioned studies such an assumption can lead to systems with nonlinear stiffnesses showing better performance but could be further improved by careful selection of a linear stiffness this study analyses both regular and irregular results with respect to the well tuned monostable counterparts to understand the real potential for improvement the combination of both the improved dynamic model and the broader range of simulation conditions furthers the current understanding of the applicability of bistability to submerged point absorbing wecs the impact of bistable control on a submerged 3 dof pa wec was explored to quantify how simple hydrodynamics and the passive control system interact a 3 dof theoretical model of the ceto device being developed by carnegie clean energy 2018 was constructed the model was subjected to a set of regular waves and three different irregular waves or sea states a nonlinear stiffness mechanism was included and varied to understand what characteristics are important for power production capability the mathematical models are described in section 2 with the representation of the magnetic bistable mechanism given in section 2 1 4 as well as a dimensionless parameter pertinent to any bistable system as a means to generalise results the considerations and limitations of the used modelling method are outlined in section 3 and the results of these simulations are presented and discussed in section 4 with a summary of the findings in section 5 2 mathematical models the governing equation for both regular and irregular scenarios can be derived from the contributing forces represented in the equation 1 m x t f e x t f r x x t f h f pto x x t f d x x t f bi x t where the inertia of each dof of the system is represented by the matrix m and x is the position vector containing the surge x heave z and pitch θ coordinates also f represents a 3 dof force vector and the subscripts e r h pto d and bi indicate the excitation radiation hydrostatic pto drag and bistable forces respectively the time is represented by t and the dependencies of each force denoted in eq 1 are considered implicit in subsequent equations for succinct notation this equation forms the basis of the governing equations for all three models presented with constituting force components either simplified or represented differently 2 1 regular waves when subjected to a single monochromatic wave the forces in eq 1 may be quantified in the time domain through the following approaches 2 1 1 excitation force the excitation force f e is the superposition of the froude krylov and diffraction forces and can be calculated using linear potential flow theory this force may be considered as the force on the buoy due to incoming waves in the work presented here the boundary element method bem solver nemoh babarit 2014 which numerically calculates various hydrodynamic quantities using linear potential flow theory was used to calculate the amplitude f e and phase ϕ of the excitation force relative to the incident wave in all 3 dof within a range of frequencies and can be represented in vector form as falnes 2007 2 f e f e cos ϕ ϕ s ω t where ω represent the excitation frequency the hadamard product operator is used to indicate element wise multiplication the additional surge phase offset applied to each dof ϕ s represents the phase difference due to the horizontal position of the buoy relative to the incoming wave this phase difference may be quantified by 3 ϕ s k x where k is the wavenumber which is the solution to the dispersion relationship chao jiang et al 2014 4 ω 2 g k tanh k h where the depth of the water is represented by h and the acceleration due to gravity is represented by g 2 1 2 radiation force the radiation force may be considered as the force on the buoy due to the waves radiating when the buoy moves this force is represented in the time domain by the cummins equation cummins 1962 5 f r a x 0 t k t t x t d t where a and k are termed the infinite frequency added mass and the memory function respectively the convolution integral quantifies the influence of the previous state on the current state in practice this integral may be computationally expensive for active control and real time implementation thus an alternative approach is more commonly implemented the frequency domain representation represented by the ˆ symbol of the radiation force is perez and fossen 2009 6 f ˆ r b ω i ω a ω x ˆ i ω where b ω is the frequency dependent radiation damping and a ω is the added mass these hydrodynamic quantities are also able to be calculated using nemoh and other bem solvers a transfer function relating the velocity to the value of the integral in eq 5 may be constructed using these two hydrodynamic quantities perez and fossen 2009 in general the radiation forces experienced in each dof may be influenced by motion in other dofs and by geometry accordingly transfer functions between all velocity components and all convolution integral components may be constructed and combined into a single state space model to account for interaction between different dofs under the linear bem theory used by nemoh for an axisymmetric device in a nominal horizontal position the radiation force in the heave direction is independent of motion in the surge or pitch directions however the radiation forces in the surge and pitch directions are coupled therefore in general the contribution of the convolution integral in each dof μ which is effectively the fluid memory may be described as 7 p a ss p b ss x μ c ss p where p is a state vector of non physical variables and a ss b ss and c ss are state space matrices constructed from the aforementioned transfer functions and are provided in appendix b the memory function or impulse response function can be represented as armesto et al 2015 8 k t 2 π 0 b ω cos ω t d ω which may be split into a finite and an infinite integral which may be solved numerically and analytically respectively armesto et al 2015 further details and reasoning may be found in the literature sources provided through comparison over an appropriate range of frequencies it was found that the state space representation results with an error of less than 2 thereby adequately representing the integral term shown in eq 5 the direct evaluation is more computationally demanding than the state space representation and both methods give similar results therefore the state space representation was used in this study 2 1 3 hydrostatic and pto forces the hydrostatic or buoyancy force acts only in the heave direction and is the difference between the weight of displaced water and the weight of the buoy given by 9 f h z ρ g v m g where ρ m and v are the density of water buoy mass and buoy volume respectively for a fully submerged buoy this force is constant accordingly a pretension force f p equal in magnitude to the hydrostatic force is included in the pto force in addition to a stiffness and damping term as follows 10 f pto b δ l k s δ l f p in eq 10 b is the damping coefficient k s is the spring constant and δ l is the extension of the tether this defines the submerged nominal position to be δ l 0 the pto force is quantified in terms of the tether motions and acts in the direction of the tether extension in order to relate the tether motions to the surge heave and pitch coordinates the relationship between x z θ and δ l α ϕ with both sets of coordinates represented in fig 5 is 11 δ l x a sin θ 2 z l a a cos θ 2 l 12 α arctan x a sin θ z l a a cos θ 13 ϕ θ α where a and l are the distance between buoy centre and tether attachment point and the total tether length respectively both the damping coefficient and spring constant may be optimised for a given frequency the optimal values may be derived falnes 2002 and for a heaving pa in a linear hydrodynamic regime are defined to be 14 b opt b z ω k s opt ω 2 m a z ω where the subscript z denotes the heave component for a 3 dof system subjected to regular wave scenarios the optimal pto stiffness may be found approximately by using eq 14 as an initial estimate and adjusting k s until the time averaged power is at a local maximum the pto damping was found using the same method as the optimal stiffness using matlab s constrained nonlinear minimisation function fmincon using an interior point algorithm to optimise for power in the 3 dof scenarios for single tether wecs heave is often considered the most influential dof related to power production the instantaneous power generated by the wec is approximated by 15 p inst t b δ l 2 t the power performance of the device may therefore be represented by the time averaged power given by 16 p avg 1 t j t i j t f p inst j δ t j where t i t f δ t j and t are the initial time final time the j th time step and the total time interval respectively these initial and final times are chosen to discard any transient effects this metric may be used to quantify the impact of bistable additions on the overall power production 2 1 4 force inducing bistability a force which can lead to a bistable scenario such as a magnetic force may induce a two well potential energy barrier as depicted on fig 2 such systems exhibit unique dynamic features not seen in systems with only a single potential well these features include two single period steady state responses for a given excitation frequency due to the bifurcation of responses a large dependence on initial conditions and excitation amplitudes stochastic resonances resonating using a combination of low amplitude inputs and the excitation of input frequency harmonics harne and wang 2017 in this context some form of stochastic resonance is expected if the bistable parameters are selected appropriately this is primarily a result of real ocean waves been stochastic in nature however for this system it is uncertain whether the phenomenon of stochastic resonance will actually provide a benefit the inclusion of all these features may lead to broader resonance bandwidths particularly at lower frequencies frequency up conversion which turns low frequency oscillations into higher frequency oscillations and performance improvement in stochastic excitation contexts the main benefit of bistability is thought to occur during interwell motion rather than intrawell due to the snap through property zhang et al 2018 in this case this snap through mechanism forms an avenue for low amplitude oscillations to change into large amplitude oscillations if the excitation is sufficient to overcome the dividing potential barrier harne and wang 2017 the escape from a potential well can broaden the frequency range of a generator mann and owens 2010 while each of these characteristic features may be exploited for different applications bistable wave energy systems may be well suited given the low frequency and stochastic nature of ocean waves for the purposes of this study a magnetic dipole model was used to create a bistable system a depiction of the wec pto model with bistability is given in fig 6 the potential energy between two magnetic dipoles in this case between the stationary outer dipole and the dipole within the translator may be derived from griffiths 2014 17 u bi m d 1 b d 2 m d 2 b d 1 where m d 1 is the dipole moment of the first dipole b d 2 is the magnetic field of the second dipole at the location of the first dipole and represents the dot product the same potential energy exists if deriving the potential energy of the other dipole the force between the two magnets may then be defined as griffiths 2014 18 f bi u bi m d 1 b d 2 assuming magnetisation in the vertical direction at nominal position the dipole moments are given by 19 m d 0 0 v m m where v m is the volume of the magnet and m is the magnetisation field per unit volume the magnetic field for a dipole is given by 20 b d 2 μ 0 4 π m d 1 r r 3 where r and r are the displacement and distance between the dipoles respectively and μ 0 is the permeability of free space yung et al 1998 using eqs 18 and 20 the force between the two dipoles may be derived as 21 f bi μ 0 m 1 v 1 m 2 v 2 4 π 9 δ l r 0 2 δ l 2 5 2 15 δ l 3 r 0 2 δ l 2 7 2 l ˆ where r 0 is the horizontal distance between dipoles as shown in fig 6 and l ˆ is the unit vector in the direction of the tether extension the subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the two magnetic poles similarly the potential energy of this force can be derived as 22 u bi μ 0 m 1 v 1 m 2 v 2 4 π 1 r 0 2 δ l 2 3 2 3 δ l 2 r 0 2 δ l 2 5 2 the potential energy of the dipole representation superimposed with the potential energy from a linear stiffness provides the intended bistable profile additional theoretical dipoles may be added by superposition to scale the central peak in potential energy for the purposes of quantifying the magnetic potential energy and force and to generalise the degree of bistability between any mechanism the dimensionless parameter γ is proposed which is the ratio of the average potential energy surface density from the incoming wave field u wave and the potential energy of the bistable system at the nominal position u bi z 0 that is 23 γ u bi z 0 u wave for a regular wave the time averaged potential energy per unit area u ˆ wave may be expressed as gran 1992 24 u ˆ wave 1 4 ρ g a 2 where a is the amplitude of the incoming wave the parameter γ may be varied to define the height of the central potential peak in the potential well represented in fig 7a in addition the location of the stable regions can also be varied in this case by the changing the horizontal distance between dipole r 0 while keeping γ constant the impact of changing r 0 on the potential wells is given in fig 7b varying these parameters gave a large range of possible force and potential profiles which were used to build an understanding around which bistable conditions are favourable for the ocean wave energy context it was found that trends were more clearly visualised when γ is scaled by r 0 2 therefore the scaled dimensionless parameter γ is defined as 25 γ γ r 0 2 which represents the potential energy of the buoy normalised by the potential energy of the upstream wave over an equivalent projected area 2 1 5 drag force the viscous drag force is a nonlinear force often neglected in simple models given by 26 f d 1 2 ρ c d a d sign x r x r x r where c d a d and x r are the 3 dof coefficients of drag characteristic area and relative velocity of the buoy with respect to the surrounding fluid respectively as an approximation the instantaneous fluid velocity at the geometric centre of the buoy was used this assumption is made with the understanding that pas are typically small compared to the wavelength of the incident wave by assuming a linear wave the fluid velocity in the heave and surge directions may be estimated as 27 x f a ω cosh k h z d s sinh k h cos k x ω t 28 z f a ω sinh k h z d s sinh k h sin k x ω t where d s is the submergence depth of the geometric centre of the buoy combining these descriptions of forces into eq 1 gives the model of a 3 dof submerged pa wec further descriptions and model specifics may be found in section 3 2 2 irregular waves as an extension to the 3 dof model irregular waves which are more representative of real ocean waves may be used irregular waves may be considered the superposition of many regular waves of different frequencies and are categorised by a spectrum various methods of calculating wave spectra exist such as the jonswap or pierson moskowitz spectra for the purpose of this study and for simplicity the method used is the jonswap wave spectrum s ω given by gran 1992 29 s ω α s g 2 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω p ω 4 γ r where α s and ω p are the slope parameter and peak frequency respectively the r term is given by 30 r exp 1 2 σ 2 ω ω p 1 2 where σ is a measure of peak width and is 0 07 when ω ω p and 0 09 when ω ω p two important parameters which may be used to describe an irregular wave are the significant wave height h s and the average zero crossing wave period t z the slope parameter may be approximated by 31 α π 3 h s 2 g 2 t z 4 and the peak enhancement factor γ can be approximated by 32 γ 7 1 2 18 1 0 5 g 2 t z h s 2 once the spectrum is known a time series of the wave elevation may be produced this time series is the superposition of individual frequency waves with amplitudes related to the specified wave spectrum regular wave elevation η reg is represented as 33 η reg t a cos ω t whereas the irregular wave elevation η irr is given by 34 η irr t j 1 n 2 s ω j δ ω j cos ω j t ϵ j where ϵ i is a randomly generated phase offset for each discrete frequency in the spectrum and n is the number of discrete frequencies faltinsen

the calculation of the drag force 2 2 4 potential energy the time averaged potential energy of the wave u wave is a metric used in eq 23 to classify the degree of bistability for an irregular wave the time averaged potential energy per unit area may be expressed as gran 1992 41 u ˆ wave 1 4 ρ g j 1 n a j 2 1 2 ρ g j 1 n s ω j δ ω to calculate the time averaged potential energy for a given buoy u ˆ wave may be multiplied by the horizontal cross sectional area of the buoy 3 simulation considerations for each simulation there were an number of considerations and parameters specific to each scenario these considerations and parameters will be provided in this section in the regular wave simulations the wec system was excited by a series of monochromatic waves and the resulting dynamic behaviour was analysed for each frequency to quantify motion and power performance for each frequency the optimal stiffness found through a local optimisation search was used in initial regular wave simulations to test the impact of bistability on poorly tuned conditions the optimal stiffness for a single frequency was used in an additional set of regular wave simulations each individual regular wave simulation was relatively fast taking approximately 10 s for the irregular scenario the wec was excited by an irregular wave with locally optimised pto settings the bistable parameters γ and r 0 were varied to explore the impact on power production the same simulations were run using the sub optimal pto settings found from eqs 14 and 36 to explore the sensitivity to tuning the mechanisms of any improvements seen were explored through the phase relationship between the excitation force and tether velocity as well as the stiffness potential energy profiles the robustness of the bistable control system was tested by subjecting the wec with a sub optimal pto setting to a different irregular wave then to establish if any trends were present two more irregular wave spectra were simulated using the corresponding sub optimal pto settings for each respective wave the irregular wave scenarios were more challenging to simulate due to the long simulation times required to get reliable time averaged results and the multitude of frequencies involved depending on the case an individual simulation could take approximately 10 15 min the model dimensions and scenario conditions are outlined below 3 1 model dimensions the geometry of the buoy was selected to be similar to the ceto design developed by carnegie clean energy 2018 the diagram in fig 1 details various relevant physical quantities these physical quantities as well as some general quantities used in the simulations are listed in table 1 the drag properties for a buoy of this shape were sourced from literature rafiee and fiévez 2015 and are given in table 2 3 2 scenario conditions the parameters pertinent to the regular and irregular scenarios are detailed in tables 3 and 4 respectively the optimal pto conditions for the irregular waves are only provided for scenario 1 because scenarios 2 and 3 are to specifically test non optimal pto conditions with bistability to check the robustness of bistability the mathematical model presented in the previous section was built and simulated in matlab and simulink mathworks inc natick ma usa a variable step solver was selected to run the simulation with simulink automatically selecting either ode45 or ode15s depending on the stiffness of the simulation this measure of numerical stiffness may change depending on the degree of nonlinearity hence the automatic solver selection was employed to ensure a suitable solver was selected for each simulation three different irregular wave scenarios were used to determine the robustness of the bistable control algorithm the magnetic coefficients given in eq 21 were determined by the specified parameter γ 4 results and discussion the results for the simulation scenarios described in section 3 are presented and discussed in the following sections 4 1 regular waves the regular wave scenarios were simulated with locally optimised and then suboptimal pto conditions the resulting motion rms and time averaged power for the optimal condition with varying γ are shown in figs 8a and 8b respectively the motion rms is calculated by 42 x t 1 n t j 1 n t x t j 2 where n t is the number of time steps and the summation and square operations are performed across each dof the results for the suboptimal conditions tuned to frequency ω 0 77 rad s are given in figs 9a and 9b respectively the frequency ω 0 77 rad s was selected as it represents an off peak response with a reasonable response amplitude as seen in fig 8b the addition of bistability for an optimally tuned system subjected to regular waves is detrimental to the power generation performance such a result is expected as additional stiffness will only lead to suboptimal tuning however for a suboptimally tuned system subjected to regular waves shown in fig 9b there are bistable conditions under which substantial improvements are seen particularly at lower frequencies the main benefit is seen when the scaled dimensionless potential γ 2 beyond this level the motion performance is reduced however higher levels of bistability seem to provide a slight benefit to higher frequencies this agrees with conventional findings as higher frequencies tend to be lower amplitude and are hence the motions are constrained to one side of the potential well when restricted to one side of a potential well a higher stiffness is seen making such regions suitably tuned for higher frequencies similarly at lower levels of bistability lower stiffnesses are seen and in general would be more suited to lower frequency excitation throughout most operating conditions though the resultant power is still less than the optimally tuned scenarios bistability has acted to improve the power production potential for a system tuned to a single frequency thereby making this passive control system more robust for regular wave conditions the motion rms shown in figs 8a and 9a show varying results as the level of bistability changes the impact is most evident in the heave results in the optimally tuned condition the heave results are inconsistently altered by the inclusion of bistability with many large amplitude responses at low frequencies reduced to small amplitude oscillations this indicates the sensitivity of the optimal conditions at lower frequencies however for the detuned results the heave rms increases for lower levels of bistability and decreases for higher levels similar to the corresponding time averaged power results the surge and pitch motions generally tended to reduce for both optimal and non optimal conditions to understand the origins of the peaks seen in the motion rms the sub optimal frequency domain responses ignoring geometric and drag nonlinearities for surge x ˆ heave z ˆ pitch θ ˆ along with the transfer function between excitation force and wave amplitude are provided in fig 10 these results demonstrate that the driving factor behind the widest peak shown in fig 9a is the force amplitude at different frequencies combined with the system dynamics consequently the predominant peak in power in fig 9b is due to the heave motion primarily governed by the force amplitude at each frequency the additional peaks seen are due to large motions in the surge and pitch dof it can also been seen that the surge and pitch dofs are coupled through hydrodynamics but heave is not coupled in the frequency domain the absence of coupling stems from the linearisation about a nominal position in this nominal position the radiation force in heave is not coupled to either surge or pitch and the geometric nonlinearity from the tether is not present these assumptions provide clarity as to why they may be insufficient to fully capture indicative dynamics intrinsic to the system the time domain results demonstrate that all dofs interact to some degree one of the key differences between the frequency domain and time domain simulations is the addition of drag which reduces the amplitude of motion observed in surge and pitch to much more realistic levels the pitch resonance is no longer noticeable in the time domain results likely due to a combination of geometric and drag nonlinearities the lower two peaks seen in the heave rms results for the non optimised system are not present in the frequency domain responses and therefore are likely the result of coupling with another dof each excitation frequency results in different hydrodynamic characteristics which causes the natural frequency of the system to change the natural frequencies in surge ω n x heave ω n z and pitch ω n θ for the submerged pa were derived as 43 ω n x g ρ v m l a m a x ω 44 ω n z k s m a z ω 45 ω n θ a a l f p l i θ a θ ω where a x ω a z ω and a θ ω are the surge heave and pitch frequency dependent added mass respectively the natural frequencies ω n x and ω n z have been derived previously meng et al 2019b and the derivation for ω n θ is given in appendix a the natural frequencies for both the optimised system and the suboptimal system are provided on fig 11 unsurprisingly the natural frequency in the heave dof for the optimal system closely follows the excitation frequency with only a small deviation around the second peak in surge i e when surge and pitch motions become significant therefore the general best practice for such systems is to tune the pto to enforce the heave natural frequency to equal the frequency of excitation another interesting quality occurs when the heave and surge natural frequencies coincide the surge natural frequency 0 3 rad s does not change significantly with frequency and is evident on the motion results as a large peak in the surge rms at the first harmonic of this frequency 0 6 rad s another peak occurs even in the sub optimal results in figs 9a and 9b these peaks are seen to influence the performance of the device the pitch natural frequency results in a peak in the frequency domain but does not appear in the time domain results even when the heave and pitch natural frequencies coincide the frequency domain responses combined with the respective natural frequencies exemplify why drag additional dofs and geometric nonlinearities should not be ignored ignoring these factors can lead to overestimation of motion slight shifts in frequency peaks and the absence of significant peaks altogether 4 2 irregular waves with optimal and non optimal tuning the irregular wave scenario 1 table 4 with an optimised pto linear stiffness was simulated and the time averaged power for varying γ and r 0 is given in fig 12a the same scenarios were simulated with the non optimal linear stiffness and the corresponding results are given in fig 12b comparing the optimal with non optimal the resulting peak power performance seen in figs 12a and 12b are the same however the peak occurs at different bistable conditions this demonstrates that a bistable system is capable of achieving the same optimal results as an optimal passively tuned controller therefore the same conclusion may be inferred as for regular waves for an optimally tuned system bistability does not increase the amount of power extracted however the results from the non optimal condition showed clear regions of beneficial and detrimental impacts the main benefit is seen when γ 1 which indicates that the bistability or the potential energy profile is beneficially exploited when the overall system is monostable there are three principal regions of benefit observed in the power generation results for the non optimal pto irregular wave scenario 1 1 region 1 r 0 2 m and γ 3 2 region 2 r 0 5 and γ 1 5 2 5 and 3 region 3 r 0 2 m and γ 1 which are marked in fig 12b the mechanisms behind the benefit seen in each of these regions provide insight for optimal bistable conditions and is explored in the following section 4 3 irregular waves phase and natural frequency to further investigate these beneficial regions indicated in fig 12b the time averaged power and time lag t lag between the excitation force and tether velocity for varying γ and a constant r 0 for irregular wave scenario 1 are given in fig 13 the simulations sampled are shown by the line on fig 12b which passes through region 2 and the edge of region 3 a time lag was used as a proxy for phase lag as the phase difference for an irregular wave is not clearly defined the time lag was calculated using matlab s cross correlation function xcorr which measures the similarity between two signals as one signal is offset in time the time offset at which the maximum cross correlation occurs has been taken to be the time lag the phase relationship shows that this system experiences strong phase matching which is beneficial for power as the power maxima correlate with minimising lag for some levels of bistability there also exists a region between γ 0 75 and γ 1 75 where the power reduces to a minimum indicating that for some levels of bistability very poor tuning exists so a finer understanding of how bistability impacts the tuning parameters in each bistable scenario is required it should be noted that a negative time lag here represents the scenario when the excitation force is leading the tether extension velocity the significant drop and increase in lag at low and high γ respectively may be a result of the system oscillating near resonance conditions in each region the zero crossing period is 8 s which corresponds to the jumps in the time lag indicating the presence of a sudden phase shift these results suggest that the effective stiffness experienced by the system when power is maximised due to change in bistable circumstance causes the system to be well tuned for the incident irregular wave conditions the jumps in time lag at γ 0 4 and 2 5 in monochromatic systems would typically indicate the presence of a resonant condition for this irregular excitation spectrum a similar effective resonant condition feature may be the cause behind these sharp jumps the results in fig 12b demonstrate that any beneficial or detrimental effect due to the nonlinear stiffness is highly dependent on both γ and r 0 to emphasise the substantial difference between the bistable circumstances over each region the stiffness potential energy profile u stiff around the peak power response as well as the normalised histogram showing the distribution of tether extension δ l are shown in fig 14a respectively additionally a number of potential profiles which demonstrated detrimental responses are shown in fig 14b the normalised distribution of tether extension is overlaid on these graphs to indicate the change in resulting system dynamics due to the nonlinear stiffness of the system the effective natural frequency ω n of the system in heave also changes during operation this property may be calculated as 46 ω n k s f bi l m a z where f bi l represents the contribution to the stiffness due to the bistable force and a z represents the infinite frequency added mass in the heave direction the effective natural frequencies for the beneficial and detrimental cases are given in figs 15a and 15b respectively there are several known mechanisms through which bistability can improve performance of systems harne and wang 2017 the snap through mechanism in which the central peak in the potential well is frequently overcome seems to not provide much benefit here and is overall detrimental as depicted in the results presented in fig 14b for case r 0 2 7 and γ 2 3 the regions that showed some benefit may be explained by different mechanisms in region 1 the natural frequency of the system see fig 15a b1 dips below the optimal linear natural frequency the location of the oscillations in these scenarios imply that the system is operating in a physical regime which is exposed to near optimal natural frequencies this property would improve the power performance as the device would be effectively tuned for a large portion of the operating range due to the large range of natural frequencies in standard operation such a system should be robust for varying sea conditions by extension the best results seen in region 2 are when the natural frequencies of the system are at or close to the optimal linear natural frequency as region 2 just touches the optimal frequency such systems are not exposed to the large range of natural frequencies seen in region 1 but are well tuned for a given operational condition consequently it is expected that for changing sea conditions such passive control systems would detune in region 3 the effective stiffness about the nominal position is negative creating a new equilibrium area the effective natural frequency at the new equilibrium position coincides with the optimal linear natural frequency this is the same fundamental finding as regions 1 and 2 but about a new operating condition this shows that the best performance is when the operating natural frequency roughly matches the optimal linear natural frequency and when the heave component of the excitation force and tether velocity are in phase in contrast in the regions of significant detrimental contributions see fig 15b the operating natural frequency has been shifted further away from the optimal natural frequency or rather the natural frequency around the equilibrium point does not coincide with the optimal linear natural frequency in these cases bistability has acted to inhibit motion as if the system was poorly tuned 4 4 irregular waves changing sea states to test the robustness of the bistable systems the pto conditions from the detuned irregular wave scenario 2 were used for irregular wave scenario 1 excitation the resulting time averaged power is shown in fig 16a furthermore maps for non optimal pto configurations for irregular wave scenarios 2 and 3 are given in figs 16b and 16c respectively these additional plots demonstrate the applicability of such systems to a variety of sea states results from regular waves demonstrated that a bistable system can exhibit improved responses when the system is suboptimal thereby improving the robustness of the passive control system similarly if a system is tuned for one irregular wave the performance when subjected to an alternative sea state is an indication of the robustness of the passive system the results presented in fig 16a demonstrate how the system responds to irregular wave scenario 2 when non optimally tuned for irregular wave scenario 1 the trend of results resemble the findings of fig 12b with local maxima around similar regions this finding indicates that a bistable system may be found which is well suited to both sea states furthermore such a passive system would be suitably robust to deal with the changing sea states observed in real ocean conditions the results from the simulations of irregular wave scenarios 2 and 3 depict similar trends compared to irregular wave scenario 1 irregular wave scenario 2 has a lower significant wave height and irregular wave scenario 3 has a lower significant wave height and a higher zero crossing wave period as shown in table 4 the regions of optimal performance region 2 and good phase matching region 3 did shift a small amount for different wave conditions but the regions which are exposed to a larger range of natural frequencies region 1 was reasonably consistent as expected for example if a control system with γ 0 625 and r 0 3 was selected as marked in each graph in fig 16 all systems would experience a 10 20 improvement to power production compared to the initial passive control system without bistability when tuned for the energy frequency of the specific irregular wave the variety of waves presented show that there are common trends seen in the benefit of bistability for different conditions and imply that if a sea state can be characterised a suitable bistable potential energy profile could be determined therefore in addition to a robust passive control system it may be beneficial to provide an active or semi active component to make fine adjustments to the bistable force as required the findings presented in this work imply that bistability or nonlinear stiffness can provide some passive benefit for a specific system and a given sea state and that this benefit will be relatively robust in applying to changing sea conditions without the need for sophisticated control systems to further extend this work the impact of nonlinear hydrodynamics on bistable mechanics should be explored either by including a nonlinear representation of froude krylov forces or by simulating using computational fluid dynamics the practical implementation of these should also be further investigated as the presented approach effectively constructs a particular potential profile from fictitious magnetic dipoles in principle if an optimal nonlinear stiffness is identified a passive system can be constructed by springs or magnets to realise the benefit additionally an active component to adjust the nonlinear stiffness subsystem based on a changing sea state could be included to further improve the system furthermore while an understanding of how bistability impacts a single pa in a passive control context is useful in reality such wecs will more likely be deployed in arrays the array context should therefore also be further explored with bistability to understand the impact of nonlinear stiffness on coupling dynamics between submerged pa wecs 5 conclusion the impact of a nonlinear stiffness or a bistable force acting on a submerged point absorbing wave energy converter was investigated a model of a 3 dof ceto shaped device was constructed and subjected to regular waves the degree of bistability was varied the resultant motion and time averaged power showed that for an optimally tuned system bistability provided no benefit whereas for a non optimally tuned system certain levels of bistability were able to improve the performance for different frequency ranges lower levels of bistability seem to benefit lower frequencies while higher levels benefit higher frequencies the same model was then subjected to an irregular wave to better reflect real operating conditions again for an optimally tuned system nonlinear stiffness tended to reduce performance but for sub optimally tuned conditions bistability was able to obtain near optimal performance by varying the bistable potential profile three regions of benefit were observed the primary mechanism of improvement was due to the nonlinear stiffness exposing the operating system to a range of apparent natural frequencies specifically in close proximity to the optimal linear natural frequency which resulted in improved performance for a range of operating conditions this mechanism seems to be robust over varying sea states with a consistent 10 20 improvement to power production in the systems simulated another linked mechanism is a passive phase matching property which appears to be associated with the natural frequency of the system but was demonstrated to be strongly connected with the power generation capability the addition of a bistable force has been shown to provide a robust passive control system with common performance trends between different ocean conditions which invites the possibility of an active bistable system to adjust the nonlinear stiffness force appropriately for different sea conditions credit authorship contribution statement

21666,the present paper reports an experimental investigation in order to understand the characteristic evolution of a chain type floating system with increasing number of modules up to five semi submersible modules are fabricated connected by hinges and constrained by elastic mooring lines for experimental tests in a wave flume the module responses of floating structures in various configurations are measured and analyzed in different wave periods and wave heights in general the response in longitudinal direction of multi modular floating structure can be significantly improved by the increasing number of modules while the effects of increasing modules on the heave and pitch responses are negligible based on the rigid module flexible connector rmfc model validated by the experimental data the connector loads of the experimental prototypes are assessed the results indicate that longitudinal hinge loads increase doubly as modular number is added up to four and afterwards increases very slow for further additional modules the maximum longitudinal load usually occurs on the interior connectors not on the connectors near the bow and stern the level of vertical shear load mainly depends on the wave period rather than the number of modules in the floating platform more detailed remarks are listed in conclusions keywords modular floating structure hinged connector semi submersible module responses connector loads wave flume experiment 1 introduction the oceans cover over 70 percent of the earth s surface due to the rising sea levels and the growing population near coastlines it s urgent to develop ocean engineering platforms for land reclamation energy utilization working and living in response to the aforementioned needs very large floating structures vlfs emerges the concept of vlfs was firstly proposed in 1920s when edward armstrong invented a sea station intended to be used as aero plane supply and navigating stations edward armstrong 1924 the us navy applied this concept to construct a pontoon type floating airport with the size of 552 m by 83 m during the second world war wang and tay 2011 moreover the us navy also put forward mobile offshore bases mob palo 2005 which is a semi submersible type vlfs and could support military operations farther from the shorelines japan started developing the technology of constructing large floating structures in an early time the world famous mega float lamas pardo et al 2015 sasajima 2005 constructed and tested in tokyo bay demonstrated that the vlfs was indeed feasible and reliable for floating runways the large floating structure has received a considerable attention from researchers and engineers as it has various merits of economy safety and environmental friendliness watanabe et al 2004 macgregor et al 2019 one of the most important design objectives of vlfs is to minimize the hydrodynamic response under erratic and rough sea conditions in general the response amplitude of a floating structure decreases while its scale increases waals et al 2018 however large floating structure may be costly and impractical in manufacturing transportation and installation watanabe et al 2000 considering the massive size of very large floating structures extreme large bending stress may occur which could lead to local fatigue damage in the internal of the structure by employing multiple modules connected with connector tajali and shafieefar 2011 the bending moment can be greatly relieved by flexible connections for the multi modular vlfs the selection of the number of modules and the deployment of modules is crucial to functionality and safety by using hinged rigid body modes newman 1997 investigated the shear loads on hinges of a five module articulated barge serially connected with hinged joints soon after he extended the study to articulated barge in seven different configurations considering the floating system with two to eight modules arranged in longitudinal array and connected by hinges the numerical results showed that the maximum shear loads of hinges increased with the increasing number of modules and the highest loads appeared on the interior hinges newman 1998 on the basis of a hydroelastic theory of floating structures composed of flexible interconnected modules fu et al 2007 analyzed the hydroelastic response of a two module interconnected structure and found that response of structure could be determined largely by the stiffness of connectors and modules the performance of a three modular floating platform with flexible base hinged connector was studied by shi et al 2018a revealing the optimized combination of connector stiffness in order to gain the most benefit in the reduction of module responses and connector loads by applying the hydroelasticity theory and the continuous condition at the connection position the hydroelastic response of a hinged two module structure was calculated by a new method the results showed that the elasticity of the structure had great influence on the bending moment and the response of flexible structure sun et al 2018 diamantoulaki and angelides 2011 investigated the dynamic characteristic of five chain type floating breakwaters with a fixed length and different number of hinge joints single module two three four and five modules and found that the number of hinge joints directly affects the array effectiveness in both the low and middle wave frequency ranges apart from the numerical investigations some experimental studies for multi modular floating structures have been conducted in various different configurations martinelli et al 2008 experimentally analyzed the floating breakwaters composed of three pontoon type modules deployed in two layouts under long crested irregular waves the test results showed that the increase of structure inertia to roll obtained by varying the layout from i shape to j shape had small effects on wave transmission whereas significantly changed the connector loads as well as mooring tensions furthermore an l shaped physical model was also tested by his group by comparing with the data of i shape and j shape floating platforms they concluded that under more complex layouts the wave transmission increases maximum mooring tension decreases and connection forces largely increase ruol et al 2008 by employing a floating breakwater comprised of three pontoon type modules serially connected with coated wire rope and moored with inelastic mooring lines loukogeorgaki et al 2014 experimentally analyzed the effect of incident wave characteristics on the structural response and wave attenuation effectiveness a floating mega island composed of 87 large floating triangles interconnected with springs and fenders was proposed and the first conceptual test was carried out to investigate the motion response and loads on the island otto et al 2020 the floating bodies of vlfs are classified into two categories namely the pontoon type and the semi submersible type since the pontoon type module is a simple flat box structure which is only suitable for working in calm sea to mitigate the wave effect it is needed to employing the semi submersible module while the wave heights are relatively large watanabe et al 2004 peña et al 2011 conducted an experimental investigation of array type floating breakwaters in regular perpendicular and oblique incident waves and emphasized the effect of width of floating system the catamaran typology on the connector and mooring forces an experiment test was carried out by shi et al 2018b with fabricating a floating platform composed of three semi submersible modules through a comparison study between the test results and numerical analysis the network modeling method was validated wu et al 2018 experimentally investigated the motion and connector loads of a chain type floating structure deployed near islands and reefs the existing experimental studies of multi modular floating structures are related to platforms of particular shape and a fixed number of modules deployed in different configurations we are curious about a scale extendable modularized floating structure while gradually attaching additional modules onto the main system newman 1998 numerically analyzed the change of shear loads of hinges for an articulated barge in regular waves with increasing number of modules from two to eight furthermore our group investigated the dynamic features of chain type floating island with different number of modules coupled by flexible connectors in irregular waves but there has been a lack of experimental study in the present paper a wave flume experimental investigation is conducted to study the characteristic transition of floating system as the structural layout gradually evolves meanwhile verify some theoretical studies the floating structure is a chain type floating platform with varying number of semi submersible modules connected by hinge connectors the floating platform is deployed in shallow waters with the constant depth constrained by elastic mooring lines digital cameras capture the cursors on the modules to measure the responses of floating bodies as the floating structural layout gradually evolves from a seed platform to chain type systems with increasing number of modules at different wave heights and frequencies the experimental results are compared with numerical results based on which the connection loads are analyzed to confirm the newman s conclusion the arrangement of this paper is as follows firstly the numerical analysis model is briefly introduced then the wave flume experiment is elaborated including the test flume the deployment of the floating modules mooring lines measurement system wave gauges and the wave condition in the experimental analysis the characteristic transition of the floating platform is studied as the number of modules varies from one to five the effects of incident wave conditions wave period and wave height on the dynamic response of floating systems with different number of modules are also analyzed in addition using the measured mass parameters the damping coefficient obtained from the attenuation experiment and the connector stiffness derived from the finite element analysis the numerical analysis is compared with the experimental data which shows quite well agreement between the numerical and test results finally the numerical model verified by the experiments is utilized to assess the connector loads of the floating platforms with the floating modules from two to five 2 mathematical model for multi modular floating structure a chain type floating platform is considered for experiments in a wave flume it consists of a number of semi submersible modules labelled by m i as illustrated in fig 1 the floating modules have identical size and are connected by hinged connectors a global coordinate for the system is assigned where x axis is set on the undisturbed free surface plane and along longitudinal direction of floating system z axis is vertically directed upwards a local coordinate o i x i z i β i is defined at the center of gravity cg of the i th module where the translational directions are parallel to that of global coordinate only the surge heave and pitch motions are considered in wave flume tests a mathematical model for the chain type floating platform can be established by using the linear wave theory stoker 1992 and the rmfc method ertekin et al 1993 assume that there are n number of modules and the hinged connectors are treated as flexible connectors with large translational stiffness but free rotations in pitch motion the governing equation of a multi modular floating platform can be generally formulated as 1 m i x i j 1 n a i j x i b i j x i c i x i s i x i f i w e i ω t f i c where x i x i y i β i t denotes the generalized displacement vector for i th module in the global coordinate system the superscript t represent the transpose symbols m i and s i denote the mass matrix of the i th module and the hydrostatic restoring force matrix written as 2 m i m 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 i x x δ i z z δ 3 s i 0 0 0 0 ρ g a w ρ g i x w 0 ρ g i x w ρ g i x x w i z z w m g z b z g where m represents the mass of a single module ρ g and a w denote the density of water the acceleration of gravity and the water plane area respectively z b and z g are the vertical coordinates for the center of buoyancy and gravity symbols i x x δ and i z z δ are the second inertia moments of submerged volume related to the rotational center i x w i x x w and i z z w indicate the first and second inertia moments of water plane area can be formulated as i x x δ δ x x b 2 d v i z z δ δ z z b 2 d v i x w a w x x b d a i x x w a w x x b 2 d a i z z w a w z z b 2 d a a i j and b i j denote the added mass matrix and added damping matrix and f i w e i ω t is the wave force vector which are derived by hydrodynamic model c i is the damping matrix f i c is the summation of the all connector forces acting on the i th module which will be elaborated in the following section as mentioned above the module is assumed as rigid body and all the deformation occurs in connectors the hinge connector is regarded as flexible connector with very large stiffness along translational directions the stiffness matrix k of a single flexible connector defined as 4 k k x 0 0 0 k z 0 0 0 0 where k x and k z indicate the translational stiffness of the connector without considering rotational stiffness assuming that there are n c connectors installed in between the i th and the j th modules the displacement at joint points for the q th connector on the i th and the j th modules can be respectively described as 5 μ i q t i q x i μ j q t j q x j here x i and x j represent the displacement vectors of the i th and the j th modules t i q and t j q indicate the displacement transfer matrix of join points for the q th connector with respect to the cg of in the i th and the j th modules which can be expressed as 6 t s m 1 0 z s m 0 1 x s m 0 0 1 where x s m y s m z s m are the local coordinate of joint point for the m th connector on the s th module accordingly the relative displacement and the load of the q th connector between the i th and the j th modules are formulated as 7 δ μ i j q μ j q μ i q f i j q k δ μ i j q hence the force acting on the cg of the i th module caused by the q th connector can be obtained with employing the transfer matrix 8 f i j q t i q t f i j q t i q t k δ μ i j q since the i th and the j th modules are coupled by n c connectors the total connector load from these connectors can be formulated as 9 f i j q 1 n c f i j q q 1 n c t i q t k δ μ i j q the mathematical model in eq 1 can be used for experimental verification the verified model can be employed to assess some important quantities that are hardly measurable in experiments 3 experimental setup and conditions to understand the evolution of the motion response and connector load of a floating platform with the increasing number of modules experimental tests are conducted in a wave flume under different wave heights and wave periods 3 1 parameters of tested floating structures and connectors the test model starts from a single module seed platform evolving to chain type floating systems with two to five modules connected by hinged connectors along longitudinal direction it should be noted that this experiment is primarily for understanding the dynamic features along with the change of the structural configuration not designed in a particular model scale for an intended vlfs the froude criterion for floating module and the cauchy criterion for connector were applied thus the result could be analyzed at certain model scale according to different requirements and applications a perspective view of the semi submersible floating body is presented in fig 2 the semi submersible module is composed of 2 pontoons 6 columns and 1 upper hull the geometrical characteristics of the pontoon column and upper hull are listed in table 1 the design draft and the mass of the module are 0 05 m and 2 13 kg respectively to satisfy the design requirement the mass and radii of gyration of each semi submersible module can be adjusted by properly distributing lead weights inside the module the transversal stability height is of 0 022 m and longitudinal stability height is of 0 11 m to guarantee the stability of the floating modules in experimental test the mechanical properties of each module are measured and tabulated in table 2 there are two hinged connectors deployed between adjacent modules the connector consists of two stainless steel plates joined in middle by a pine and the plates are bolted with adjacent modules together as shown in fig 3 the hinge is fixedly connected to the connecting base by self tapping screws as presented in fig 4 a the connecting bases are printed by a desktop 3d printer of utimaker 2 made in netherlands the pla polylactic acid material is utilized in our 3d printing as it has enough strength with flexural modulus of 3150 mpa and poisson s ratio of 0 34 the size of connector is 0 055 m long 0 07 m width and 0 03 m height the assembled hinge connector and the printed connecting base are showed in fig 4 a and b the hinge connector is considered as a flexible connector with large stiffness which restrains linear translational displacements with free rotation around the pine the stiffness of the connector was analyzed prior to the test by applying the finite element method the loads versus the displacement are showed in fig 5 the longitudinal and the vertical stiffness of hinge connector are 1 27 10 5 n m and 413 9 n m respectively 3 2 layout of a wave flume the experimental investigation was conducted in a wave flume at xiamen university of technology the wave flume has a length of 35 m a width of 0 7 m and a height of 0 8 m the still water depth was 0 5 m in the experiment a sketch of the wave flume including the arrangement of floating modules and experimental equipment is illustrated in fig 6 a piston type active absorbing wave maker is installed on the left side of the wave flume to generate regular waves with different periods and heights while a beach with slope of 1 10 is equipped on the right side to mitigate the wave reflection to monitor the wave evolution two resistance type wave gauges w g 1 and w g 2 are deployed respectively in the upstream and downstream side of the floating structure five sets of high speed ccd cameras each set includes two ccd cameras denoted as c 1 c 5 are used to capture the moving cursors mounted on tested floating modules as labelled by m 1 m 5 respectively it is worth noting that the floating system is always arranged in the middle of two wave gauges as the module number varies in experiments the modules are deployed in an order from the largest module number to the smallest one that is to say the wave always firstly propagates through the module with the largest number then to the modules with smaller numbers sequentially to do so it is because the parameters of each floating module are different in order to prevent confusion the order of the modules in the numerical model is completely consistent with the experimental arrangement being convenient for the comparison between the analysis and the experimental results the floating modules are connected by hinged connectors along the longitudinal direction four mooring lines are attached to the upper hull of the bow and the stern of the floating model to inhibit the slow drift of floating system as shown in fig 6 b the mooring line is made of a fishing line an extension spring which is horizontally deployed through fixed pulleys installed on the wave flume as presented in fig 6 a the stiffness of the mooring line is 15n m measured prior to the test 3 3 the measuring method of floating body response since the mass of the floating module in tests is small use of common transducers may influence the dynamic response of the floating platform due to non negligible inertial effects of the instruments the non intrusive optical measuring method is employed to measure the six degrees of freedom dof responses of the floating modules in this study the surfaces of the floating modules are painted black three cursor points are marked on the top deck of each floating module by fluorescent material and the fourth cursor point is set on the top of a stick that is mounted at the middle of the desk as shown in fig 7 a the images of each marked cursors on a floating module are simultaneously acquired by two ccd cameras as shown in fig 7 b mounted above the module the grey spots on the images indicate the position of the marked cursor points and will be easily identified from the black background then the pixel coordinates of the center of the marked cursor points on the images recorded by two ccd cameras i 1 j 1 and i 2 j 2 can be calculated based on the values of i 1 j 1 and i 2 j 2 the three dimensional spacing coordinates of the marked point x y z are obtained as the spacing coordinates of the four cursor points on the floating module are known the 6 dof responses of the floating module surge sway heave pitch roll and yaw can be measured fig 7 c shows the data acquisition system of the ccd cameras in this experiment there are a set of high speed ccd cameras arranged above each module each computer controlled a set of high speed cameras via usb all computers are connected through a router in the course of data acquisition once the acquisition signal is sent by one computer the computers connected with the router starts capturing the data simultaneously hence the motions of every module could be measured at the same moment the relative motion of between modules in every moment can be derived by processing data all the data are acquired at a sampling frequency of 50 hz and an acquisition time of 50s the data collecting process starts after a wave front passes the floating system for a short while when the data acquisition in a wave condition had completed and the water had calmed down the test of next wave case can then be conducted in the present experimental investigation the tests under various wave heights and wave periods are conducted for the floating structures with one module up to five modules respectively the detailed wave conditions are listed in table 3 all the tests are investigated under the action of normally incident regular waves since this is a 2d experiment 4 experimental results and analysis the responses of modules are measured for floating structures with single module two modules up to five modules in various wave conditions listed in table 3 the modules are coupled by hinged connectors the study mainly concerns the effect of incident wave period the wave height and the number of modules on the responses and connector loads of floating platforms the numerical results are compared with experimental data to validate the correctness of the computational model the verified model is employed to estimate the connector loads for the effect analysis since the loads are difficult to be measured in experiments 4 1 attenuation experiments attenuation experiments of each floating module are conducted to measure the natural periods and estimate the damping coefficients the attenuation experiment for each degree of freedom motion is repeated more than twice the measured natural periods of floating modules are 1 6s and 1 8s respectively in heave and pitch direction the time histories of free oscillation of heave and pitch motion for module m 1 are shown in fig 8 assuming that the attenuation curve can be expressed in the equation form of a b 1 e b 2 t cos b 3 t b 4 b 5 the experimental data are fitted on the basis of the least square method the data fitting agrees well with the experiment as demonstrated in fig 8 the coefficients b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 and b 5 thus can be obtained symbol b 3 indicates the damped natural frequency the damping coefficient is the ratio of b 2 to b 3 the time histories of free oscillation for other floating modules are similar with that of module 1 and not presented here the natural periods and damping coefficients of other floating modules can be obtained by the same way which are tabulated in table 4 and table 5 for the free oscillation of heave and pitch the natural periods obtained from the data fitting of the attenuation curve for free oscillation agree well with the measure results mentioned in above paragraph 4 2 response evolution of floating structures for the floating structures with different number of modules the time histories of motions under different wave conditions show regularly periodic motions similar to section 4 1 the least square method is applied to fit the experimental data the response amplitudes obtained from the fitting results is utilized in the following experimental analysis for the tested chain type floating structures from a single module to five modules the raos response amplitude per unit wave amplitude of surge heave and pitch motions are illustrated in fig 9 in the span of wave period and with the incident wave height of 0 03 m firstly the raos of floating platform with a single module are shown in the first column of fig 9 the peak values of heave motion and pitch motion occur in the wave period of 1 7s which is induced by the resonance as the incident wave period is close to the natural period of modules that means the natural periods along heave and pitch direction are about 1 7s which are close to the value obtained from the attenuation experiments the minor difference might be because the module was constrained by mooring lines in the experiment the curve of surge motion for the single floating module m 1 demonstrates that the natural period along x direction is in the range of 0 7s 2s the raos of floating structures with two three four and five modules couple by hinged connectors are demonstrated in the second third fourth and fifth column in fig 9 respectively the first row of fig 9 shows the raos of surge motions versus incident wave period for floating systems with different number of modules similarly the second and third rows respectively are the raos of heave and pitch motion with the increasing wave period every module is indicated by a solid line with a special color and marker as illustrated in fig 9 it should be noted that the modules are deployed in order from largest to smallest module number in the wave propagation direction which has been showed in fig 6 a for example in the two module floating platform the module m 3 is in the bow and the module m 2 is in the stern the modules of four modular floating system are arranged in order of m 4 m 3 m 2 and m 1 for the raos of surge motion of coupled modules the responses of modules have the similar trend for the floating structures with two modules three modules and four modules but not for the five modules the surge motion generally increases as the wave period increases in a particular wave period all the modules in a coupled system have the similar response amplitude although there are minor differences and the oscillation of modules may have different phases differently for the floating structure with five modules the module responses diversify from each other especially in the wave period from 0 9s to 1 8s it shows that the modules m 5 and m 1 in the bow and stern oscillate back and forth more than interior modules and the middle module m 3 oscillates the least in overview of all floating structures the maximum raos of surge motion is about 1 9 for the single module 1 7 for the two modules 1 3 for the three modules 0 9 for the four modules and 0 6 for the five modules the experiment reveals an important dynamic feature that the maximum surge response is significantly decreased as increasing number of modules is attached to the chain type floating system it should be noted that our experimental results are obtained in head wave for the wave height of 0 05 m the experiment also demonstrates the same feature as well not displayed here as attaching additional module onto the main structure in longitudinal direction the floating platform becomes more stable in terms of surge motion for all wave periods for the raos of heave motion of coupled modules shown in the second row of fig 9 the responses of modules generally increase as the wave period increases the heave motions of modules are quite similar for the two module system for the systems with three four and five modules the heave responses are bit diversified among modules and the module in the stern usually involves more oscillation than others when the wave period is above 1 4s this phenomenon is particularly obvious for the five module system where module m 1 in the stern oscillates much more than others and the interior modules oscillate at the same level in the large wave period of 2s it can be seen that the modules in the bow and stern always fluctuate more than the interior modules do the whole structure looks like outspread wings of eagle the middle section consisting of interior modules remain relatively stable and the modules at the two ends flap up and down in overview of all coupled systems the maximum heave responses of modules remain within 1 5 where the heave response level does not change as additional modules are attached to the floating platform it means that extending platform scale by adding modules in longitudinal direction does not evidently increase or decrease the level of heave motions this dynamic feature is different from that of the surge motion for the raos of pitch motion of coupled modules shown in the third row of fig 9 the varying trend of the pitch response curves looks like inverted u shape in the span of wave period the pitch motion increases rapidly in the wave period range from 0 8s to 0 9s then maintains a relatively high level in the wave period range from 0 9s to 1 2s and shows a downward trend when the wave period exceeds 1 2s close to the two ends of wave period interval the pitch motion of floating bodies is relatively small for the motion modes it is interesting to note that the pitch curves are almost overlapped for all coupled floating systems as the wave period is lower than 1s within this range of wave periods all the pitch motions among the modules are identical with a phase angle difference of π which means that if module m i rotates in clockwise with a pitch angle its adjacent module rotates in anticlockwise with the same pitch angle the modules oscillate regularly in a harmonic mode as the wave period is greater than 1s the pitch responses among the modules are diversified the module in the stern of all coupled systems has relatively larger pitch motion than other modules which is very similar to the case in the heave motion and closely related discrepancy in pitch motions is mainly induced by the hydrodynamic interference over all the pitch response remains in the same level for all coupled systems which means that additional modules attached to the floating platform do not evidently affect the pitch response level in fact the pitch motion is much more dependent on the wave period rather than the scale of floating structures to clearly view the influence of attaching more modules onto a chain type floating structure on the different types of responses the mean raos of all modules in the wave period are displayed in fig 10 where the symbol n denotes the total number of modules for the tested floating system the mean raos reflect the overall level of responses for different scale of chained floating systems for the surge motion as shown in fig 10 a the divergence of the mean surge motion is small in low wave period region while it becomes large as wave period exceeds 1s the plot shows the curve pattern lowers down a grade when n increases it reveals the dynamic feature found previously that the mean rao of surge response significantly reduces as the number of modules in a floating platform increases the plot also shows the curve patterns become flattened in the left hand side as n increases it reveals another important feature that the mean rao of surge response is more insensitive to the lower wave period as number of modules increases for example as n 5 the curve of the mean rao of surge response is almost flattened which implies that the platform with five modules has much smaller mean surge motion and more insensitive to the change of wave period limited by the number of modules used in experiment the dynamic evolution law of larger scale of chain type floating platform is unable to observe nevertheless numerical computations not reported here indicate that the stability of surge motion for hinge connected floating structure can be effectively improved and the surge motion appears less dependent on the wave period by adding more modules onto the main structure fig 10 b shows the mean raos of heave motions for floating systems with one to five modules in a range of wave period in general the mean raos of heave responses rise as the wave period increases the plot shows that the discrepancy among the curves of coupled systems except n 1 is limited and the curve for n 5 in general lays in the lowest level it tells the fact that the level of heave motion mainly depends on the wave period and the heave response can be slightly improved by attaching more modules onto the chain platform for the mean raos of pitch response in fig 10 c the variation tendencies for multi modular floating structures are similar except for the single floating module in the span of wave period the curve for n 5 in general lays in the lowest level it indicates that the level of pitch motion is insensitive to the quantity of modules in the floating structure and the stability of the multi modular system can be slightly improved by adding more modules 4 3 validation of numerical model with experimental data this experimental study aims to understand the dynamic characteristic change when adding more modules onto a chain type floating platform newman 1998 numerically studied the change of shear loads of hinges for an articulated barge in regular waves with increasing number of modules from two to eight we wish to confirm the newman s important conclusions experimentally but the shear forces of hinges in our experiment are hard to measure thus the numerical model elaborated in section 2 will be employed by using the data from experimental tests in order to assess the shear loads of hinges of the experimental floating systems to this purpose the numerical model needs to be firstly validated by experimental results note that the rmfc method is employed in modeling since the aspect ratio length height for the semi submersible module is 5 25 the structure is quite rigid as semi submersible module can greatly reduce the wave effect in comparison with the traditional pontoon type module the hydroelastic effect is ignored moreover the riggs et al 2000 s works showed that the rmfc model can predict the response very well as finite element method which can be used for conceptual and preliminary design in numerical calculations the rmfc model will be utilized to compare with the experimental data for model verification substituting the measured mass properties the damping coefficients the stiffness of mooring lines and the connector stiffness obtained by finite element method into the numerical model the numerical simulations are carried out on the basis of the frequency domain approach the comparison between numerical results and experimental tests is conducted on the surge heave and pitch responses of floating systems with single module two to five modules coupled by hinges due to the space limitation only the comparisons of three modular and five modular floating structure are presented in this section fig 11 demonstrates the numerical responses in unit wave amplitude and the raos in wave height of 0 03 m for hinge connected floating platform with three modules the first row of fig 11 shows the surge responses of each module the numerical results are coincident very well with the experimental results in all tested wave period interval the second row of fig 11 demonstrates the comparison between the numerical and experimental results for raos of heave motion the tendency of numerical analysis and experimental results generally match well in the wave period domain for the module m 1 the numerical results at the period of 1 4s and 1 8s are smaller than the experimental results for the module m 2 the numerical result has a deep valley in the period range from 1 7s but the experimental result remains a weak concave change the heave response of m 3 between numerical and experimental results agrees very well except the period at 2 0s the third row of fig 11 shows pitch motions for the three modules it can be observed that the numerical results coincide with the experimental data in general trend for the pitch motion of module m 1 the numerical results are a bit smaller than the tested data as wave period is greater than 0 9s this is probably because the artificial damping utilized in the numerical model is greater than the actual viscous damping of fluid in experiments similarly for the module m 2 the experimental results are a bit larger than the numerical ones but the tendency is the same for the module m 3 the numerical and experimental results agree well for the wave period smaller than 1 2s afterwards the experimental results are obviously smaller than numerical ones fig 12 illustrates the numerical results and the experimental data for the raos of five modular floating structure contrasting with the surge raos for the three modular structure the variation of surge responses for the five modular system is more complex in the span of wave period even so as shown in the first row of fig 12 the numerical results of each module generally match well with the experimental data in the tested wave period region in the second row of fig 12 for the heave responses of the modules m 2 m 4 and m 5 the experimental values almost overlap with the numerical values the experimental heave responses of the module m 1 are generally larger than the numerical ones but the trend is similar for the module m 3 the variation tendency of experimental data is coincident with that of numerical curve though the numerical values have some discrepancies with the tested values the pitch raos of modules in the third row of fig 12 show that the variation tendency of the numerical results generally agrees well with that of the experimental data in the span of wave period range the divergence between the numerical and the experimental values are small based on the above analysis it can be concluded that both the case of three modular system and the case of five modular system show the consistency between numerical calculations and experiments for the motions of surge heave and pitch in addition the comparisons between the numerical results and the experimental data for single module two modular and four modular floating structures are also conducted not presented here the results based on the numerical method in general agree well with the tested results although there are some minor differences the rmfc numerical model is feasible for the forecast of dynamical responses for chain type floating structures in the next section this numerical model fed by experimental data will be used to estimate the loads of hinges for multi modular floating structures in order to reveal the evolution of connector loads with the increasing number of modules and validate the main conclusion made by newman in his numerical studies newman 1998 4 4 connector loads evolution of floating structures as the responses obtained by numerical calculation coincide well with that of the test results we thus trust with confidence that this numerical model could be used to assess the hinge loads which are difficult to be measured in experiments there are two hinge connectors between two adjacent modules with the excitation of head wave the loads of two connectors are basically the same under the same parameter setting hence the loads of connector in one side of the floating system are presented in fig 13 where the symbol c i j denotes the connector between the module m i and m j for the floating platforms with two up to five modules the connector loads raos in longitudinal direction are demonstrated in the first row of fig 13 it can be observed that the peak value of the longitudinal connector load is doubled as the modular number increases from two modules up to five modules the longitudinal connector load increases significantly until with four modules afterwards the load increases very slow and tends to be constant in addition the maximum load along longitudinal direction appears slightly shifting towards the lower wave period while the number of modules increases the maximum longitudinal connector load of four modular and five modular floating system occurs on the interior connectors not on the connector nearest two ends for floating structures with three four or five modules the longitudinal loads of connectors nearest the bow and the stern have the same variation pattern as the wave period varies the longitudinal load of connector nearest the bow is always greater than that nearest the stern in low wave period region and the differences gradually become small and finally disappear with the increasing wave period for the five modular floating platform there is some discrepancy in the variation patterns of the longitudinal load between the interior connectors and the connectors nearest the two ends in the span of the wave period which can also be found in the longitudinal connector load of the four modular system the peak values of the longitudinal loads for interior connectors are greater than that for the connectors in the bow and the stern it is because that the modules in the two ends are connected by the mooring line with small stiffness while the interior modules are connected by hinge in both sides resulting in much stronger constrained forces the second row of fig 13 shows the vertical shear loads of hinge connectors for multi modular floating system the maximum vertical shear load of connectors increases slightly as the number of modules increases from two to five the level of vertical shear load mainly depends on the wave period rather than the number of modules in the floating platform for the floating platforms with three four or five modules the divergence between the vertical shear loads of different connectors mainly appear in the low wave period region the curves for the vertical shear loads of different connectors are clustered together in a wide range of wave period which means the vertical connector loads tend to the same among hinges as wave period increases the highest vertical load occurs on the connector nearest the bow the peak value of the vertical shear load is reduced gradually as the connector is farther from the bow that is the peak value of the vertical loads for the connector nearest the stern is smaller than that for other connectors this feature was first noticed by newman in his numerical study newman 1998 and validated in this study comparing with the longitudinal connector load in the first row of fig 13 it can be found that the vertical shear loads of hinge connector are large than or close to the longitudinal connector load in low wave period whereas as the period increases the connector loads in vertical direction are much less than the longitudinal loads that is to say the hinge connectors suffer both the longitudinal and shear loads in small wave period and mainly suffer the longitudinal load under the excitation of large wave period these remarks are made according to the experimental prototypes under study as the dimension size of module prototype changes the particular suffering wave period could be different 5 conclusions in this paper a 2d experiment in a wave flume is conducted to investigate the characteristic evolution of a scale extendable modularized chain type floating system by adding more modules onto the main structure the floating structure consists of semi submersible modules serially connected by hinge connectors the semi submersible modules are fabricated and their physical parameters are measured in experiments in the wave flume in the experimental study the effects of the number of modules the wave period and the wave height on the dynamic responses of floating platforms are investigated in addition the numerical analysis is validated by the experimental results and numerical assessment on the connector loads of hinge connected floating platform is carried out the main conclusions of this experimental study are as follows 1 the surge motion can be significantly reduced and the stability in longitudinal direction can be improved as the number of modules increases 2 the surge response is less sensitive to the effect of lower wave period as number of modules increases 3 extending platform scale by adding modules in longitudinal direction does not evidently affect the amplitude of heave motion which is mainly affected by the wave period 4 the increase of modules in a chain type floating platform does not evidently affect the level of pitch response which is mainly affected by the wave period 5 the connector load in longitudinal direction increases significantly until the number of modules exceeds four and the load increases very slow that is insensitive to the further addition of modules 6 the maximum load along longitudinal direction appears slightly shifting towards the lower wave period while the number of modules increases the maximum load usually occurs on the interior connectors not on the connectors near the bow and stern 7 the level of vertical shear load mainly depends on the wave period rather than the quantity of modules in the floating platform 8 the vertical connector loads tend to the same among hinges as wave period increases 9 the hinge connectors suffer both the longitudinal and shear loads in small wave period and

21666,the present paper reports an experimental investigation in order to understand the characteristic evolution of a chain type floating system with increasing number of modules up to five semi submersible modules are fabricated connected by hinges and constrained by elastic mooring lines for experimental tests in a wave flume the module responses of floating structures in various configurations are measured and analyzed in different wave periods and wave heights in general the response in longitudinal direction of multi modular floating structure can be significantly improved by the increasing number of modules while the effects of increasing modules on the heave and pitch responses are negligible based on the rigid module flexible connector rmfc model validated by the experimental data the connector loads of the experimental prototypes are assessed the results indicate that longitudinal hinge loads increase doubly as modular number is added up to four and afterwards increases very slow for further additional modules the maximum longitudinal load usually occurs on the interior connectors not on the connectors near the bow and stern the level of vertical shear load mainly depends on the wave period rather than the number of modules in the floating platform more detailed remarks are listed in conclusions keywords modular floating structure hinged

population near coastlines it s urgent to develop ocean engineering platforms for land reclamation energy utilization working and living in response to the aforementioned needs very large floating structures vlfs emerges the concept of vlfs was firstly proposed in 1920s when edward armstrong invented a sea station intended to be used as aero plane supply and navigating stations edward armstrong 1924 the us navy applied this concept to construct a pontoon type floating airport with the size of 552 m by 83 m during the second world war wang and tay 2011 moreover the us navy also put forward mobile offshore bases mob palo 2005 which is a semi submersible type vlfs and could support military operations farther from the shorelines japan started developing the technology of constructing large floating structures in an early time the world famous mega float lamas pardo et al 2015 sasajima 2005 constructed and tested in tokyo bay demonstrated that the vlfs was indeed feasible and reliable for floating runways the large floating structure has received a considerable attention from researchers and engineers as it has various merits of economy safety and environmental friendliness watanabe et al 2004 macgregor et al 2019 one of the most important design objectives of vlfs is to minimize the hydrodynamic response under erratic and rough sea conditions in general the response amplitude of a floating structure decreases while its scale increases waals et al 2018 however large floating structure may be costly and impractical in manufacturing transportation and installation watanabe et al 2000 considering the massive size of very large floating structures extreme large bending stress may occur which could lead to local fatigue damage in the internal of the structure by employing multiple modules connected with connector tajali and shafieefar 2011 the bending moment can be greatly relieved by flexible connections for the multi modular vlfs the selection of the number of modules and the deployment of modules is crucial to functionality and safety by using hinged rigid body modes newman 1997 investigated the shear loads on hinges of a five module articulated barge serially connected with hinged joints soon after he extended the study to articulated barge in seven different configurations considering the floating system with two to eight modules arranged in longitudinal array and connected by hinges the numerical results showed that the maximum shear loads of hinges increased with the increasing number of modules and the highest loads appeared on the interior hinges newman 1998 on the basis of a hydroelastic theory of floating structures composed of flexible interconnected modules fu et al 2007 analyzed the hydroelastic response of a two module interconnected structure and found that response of structure could be determined largely by the stiffness of connectors and modules the performance of a three modular floating platform with flexible base hinged connector was studied by shi et al 2018a revealing the optimized combination of connector stiffness in order to gain the most benefit in the reduction of module responses and connector loads by applying the hydroelasticity theory and the continuous condition at the connection position the hydroelastic response of a hinged two module structure was calculated by a new method the results showed that the elasticity of the structure had great influence on the bending moment and the response of flexible structure sun et al 2018 diamantoulaki and angelides 2011 investigated the dynamic characteristic of five chain type floating breakwaters with a fixed length and different number of hinge joints single module two three four and five modules and found that the number of hinge joints directly affects the array effectiveness in both the low and middle wave frequency ranges apart from the numerical investigations some experimental studies for multi modular floating structures have been conducted in various different configurations martinelli et al 2008 experimentally analyzed the floating breakwaters composed of three pontoon type modules deployed in two layouts under long crested irregular waves the test results showed that the increase of structure inertia to roll obtained by varying the layout from i shape to j shape had small effects on wave transmission whereas significantly changed the connector loads as well as mooring tensions furthermore an l shaped physical model was also tested by his group by comparing with the data of i shape and j shape floating platforms they concluded that under more complex layouts the wave transmission increases maximum mooring tension decreases and connection forces largely increase ruol et al 2008 by employing a floating breakwater comprised of three pontoon type modules serially connected with coated wire rope and moored with inelastic mooring lines loukogeorgaki et al 2014 experimentally analyzed the effect of incident wave characteristics on the structural response and wave attenuation effectiveness a floating mega island composed of 87 large floating triangles interconnected with springs and fenders was proposed and the first conceptual test was carried out to investigate the motion response and loads on the island otto et al 2020 the floating bodies of vlfs are classified into two categories namely the pontoon type and the semi submersible type since the pontoon type module is a simple flat box structure which is only suitable for working in calm sea to mitigate the wave effect it is needed to employing the semi submersible module while the wave heights are relatively large watanabe et al 2004 peña et al 2011 conducted an experimental investigation of array type floating breakwaters in regular perpendicular and oblique incident waves and emphasized the effect of width of floating system the catamaran typology on the connector and mooring forces an experiment test was carried out by shi et al 2018b with fabricating a floating platform composed of three semi submersible modules through a comparison study between the test results and numerical analysis the network modeling method was validated wu et al 2018 experimentally investigated the motion and connector loads of a chain type floating structure deployed near islands and reefs the existing experimental studies of multi modular floating structures are related to platforms of particular shape and a fixed number of modules deployed in different configurations we are curious about a scale extendable modularized floating structure while gradually attaching additional modules onto the main system newman 1998 numerically analyzed the change of shear loads of hinges for an articulated barge in regular waves with increasing number of modules from two to eight furthermore our group investigated the dynamic features of chain type floating island with different number of modules coupled by flexible connectors in irregular waves but there has been a lack of experimental study in the present paper a wave flume experimental investigation is conducted to study the characteristic transition of floating system as the structural layout gradually evolves meanwhile verify some theoretical studies the floating structure is a chain type floating platform with varying number of semi submersible modules connected by hinge connectors the floating platform is deployed in shallow waters with the constant depth constrained by elastic mooring lines digital cameras capture the cursors on the modules to measure the responses of floating bodies as the floating structural layout gradually evolves from a seed platform to chain type systems with increasing number of modules at different wave heights and frequencies the experimental results are compared with numerical results based on which the connection loads are analyzed to confirm the newman s conclusion the arrangement of this paper is as follows firstly the numerical analysis model is briefly introduced then the wave flume experiment is elaborated including the test flume the deployment of the floating modules mooring lines measurement system wave gauges and the wave condition in the experimental analysis the characteristic transition of the floating platform is studied as the number of modules varies from one to five the effects of incident wave conditions wave period and wave height on the dynamic response of floating systems with different number of modules are also analyzed in addition using the measured mass parameters the damping coefficient obtained from the attenuation experiment and the connector stiffness derived from the finite element analysis the numerical analysis is compared with the experimental data which shows quite well agreement between the numerical and test results finally the numerical model verified by the experiments is utilized to assess the connector loads of the floating platforms with the floating modules from two to five 2 mathematical model for multi modular floating structure a chain type floating platform is considered for experiments in a wave flume it consists of a number of semi submersible modules labelled by m i as illustrated in fig 1 the floating modules have identical size and are connected by hinged connectors a global coordinate for the system is assigned where x axis is set on the undisturbed free surface plane and along longitudinal direction of floating system z axis is vertically directed upwards a local coordinate o i x i z i β i is defined at the center of gravity cg of the i th module where the translational directions are parallel to that of global coordinate only the surge heave and pitch motions are considered in wave flume tests a mathematical model for the chain type floating platform can be established by using the linear wave theory stoker 1992 and the rmfc method ertekin et al 1993 assume that there are n number of modules and the hinged connectors are treated as flexible connectors with large translational stiffness but free rotations in pitch motion the governing equation of a multi modular floating platform can be generally formulated as 1 m i x i j 1 n a i j x i b i j x i c i x i s i x i f i w e i ω t f i c where x i x i y i β i t denotes the generalized displacement vector for i th module in the global coordinate system the superscript t represent the transpose symbols m i and s i denote the mass matrix of the i th module and the hydrostatic restoring force matrix written as 2 m i m 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 i x x δ i z z δ 3 s i 0 0 0 0 ρ g a w ρ g i x w 0 ρ g i x w ρ g i x x w i z z w m g z b z g where m represents the mass of a single module ρ g and a w denote the density of water the acceleration of gravity and the water plane area respectively z b and z g are the vertical coordinates for the center of buoyancy and gravity symbols i x x δ and i z z δ are the second inertia moments of submerged volume related to the rotational center i x w i x x w and i z z w indicate the first and second inertia moments of water plane area can be formulated as i x x δ δ x x b 2 d v i z z δ δ z z b 2 d v i x w a w x x b d a i x x w a w x x b 2 d a i z z w a w z z b 2 d a a i j and b i j denote the added mass matrix and added damping matrix and f i w e i ω t is the wave force vector which are derived by hydrodynamic model c i is the damping matrix f i c is the summation of the all connector forces acting on the i th module which will be elaborated in the following section as mentioned above the module is assumed as rigid body and all the deformation occurs in connectors the hinge connector is regarded as flexible connector with very large stiffness along translational directions the stiffness matrix k of a single flexible connector defined as 4 k k x 0 0 0 k z 0 0 0 0 where k x and k z indicate the translational stiffness of the connector without considering rotational stiffness assuming that there are n c connectors installed in between the i th and the j th modules the displacement at joint points for the q th connector on the i th and the j th modules can be respectively described as 5 μ i q t i q x i μ j q t j q x j here x i and x j represent the displacement vectors of the i th and the j th modules t i q and t j q indicate the displacement transfer matrix of join points for the q th connector with respect to the cg of in the i th and the j th modules which can be expressed as 6 t s m 1 0 z s m 0 1 x s m 0 0 1 where x s m y s m z s m are the local coordinate of joint point for the m th connector on the s th module accordingly the relative displacement and the load of the q th connector between the i th and the j th modules are formulated as 7 δ μ i j q μ j q μ i q f i j q k δ μ i j q hence the force acting on the cg of the i th module caused by the q th connector can be obtained with employing the transfer matrix 8 f i j q t i q t f i j q t i q t k δ μ i j q since the i th and the j th modules are coupled by n c connectors the total connector load from these connectors can be formulated as 9 f i j q 1 n c f i j q q 1 n c t i q t k δ μ i j q the mathematical model in eq 1 can be used for experimental verification the verified model can be employed to assess some important quantities that are hardly measurable in experiments 3 experimental setup and conditions to understand the evolution of the motion response and connector load of a floating platform with the increasing number of modules experimental tests are conducted in a wave flume under different wave heights and wave periods 3 1 parameters of tested floating structures and connectors the test model starts from a single module seed platform evolving to chain type floating systems with two to five modules connected by hinged connectors along longitudinal direction it should be noted that this experiment is primarily for understanding the dynamic features along with the change of the structural configuration not designed in a particular model scale for an intended vlfs the froude criterion for floating module and the cauchy criterion for connector were applied thus the result could be analyzed at certain model scale according to different requirements and applications a perspective view of the semi submersible floating body is presented in fig 2 the semi submersible module is composed of 2 pontoons 6 columns and 1 upper hull the geometrical characteristics of the pontoon column and upper hull are listed in table 1 the design draft and the mass of the module are 0 05 m and 2 13 kg respectively to satisfy the design requirement the mass and radii of gyration of each semi submersible module can be adjusted by properly distributing lead weights inside the module the transversal stability height is of 0 022 m and longitudinal stability height is of 0 11 m to guarantee the stability of the floating modules in experimental test the mechanical properties of each module are measured and tabulated in table 2 there are two hinged connectors deployed between adjacent modules the connector consists of two stainless steel plates joined in middle by a pine and the plates are bolted with adjacent modules together as shown in fig 3 the hinge is fixedly connected to the connecting base by self tapping screws as presented in fig 4 a the connecting bases are printed by a desktop 3d printer of utimaker 2 made in netherlands the pla polylactic acid material is utilized in our 3d printing as it has enough strength with flexural modulus of 3150 mpa and poisson s ratio of 0 34 the size of connector is 0 055 m long 0 07 m width and 0 03 m height the assembled hinge connector and the printed connecting base are showed in fig 4 a and b the hinge connector is considered as a flexible connector with large stiffness which restrains linear translational displacements with free rotation around the pine the stiffness of the connector was analyzed prior to the test by applying the finite element method the loads versus the displacement are showed in fig 5 the longitudinal and the vertical stiffness of hinge connector are 1 27 10 5 n m and 413 9 n m respectively 3 2 layout of a wave flume the experimental investigation was conducted in a wave flume at xiamen university of technology the wave flume has a length of 35 m a width of 0 7 m and a height of 0 8 m the still water depth was 0 5 m in the experiment a sketch of the wave flume including the arrangement of floating modules and experimental equipment is illustrated in fig 6 a piston type active absorbing wave maker is installed on the left side of the wave flume to generate regular waves with different periods and heights while a beach with slope of 1 10 is equipped on the right side to mitigate the wave reflection to monitor the wave evolution two resistance type wave gauges w g 1 and w g 2 are deployed respectively in the upstream and downstream side of the floating structure five sets of high speed ccd cameras each set includes two ccd cameras denoted as c 1 c 5 are used to capture the moving cursors mounted on tested floating modules as labelled by m 1 m 5 respectively it is worth noting that the floating system is always arranged in the middle of two wave gauges as the module number varies in experiments the modules are deployed in an order from the largest module number to the smallest one that is to say the wave always firstly propagates through the module with the largest number then to the modules with smaller numbers sequentially to do so it is because the parameters of each floating module are different in order to prevent confusion the order of the modules in the numerical model is completely consistent with the experimental arrangement being convenient for the comparison between the analysis and the experimental results the floating modules are connected by hinged connectors along the longitudinal direction four mooring lines are attached to the upper hull of the bow and the stern of the floating model to inhibit the slow drift of floating system as shown in fig 6 b the mooring line is made of a fishing line an extension spring which is horizontally deployed through fixed pulleys installed on the wave flume as presented in fig 6 a the stiffness of the mooring line is 15n m measured prior to the test 3 3 the measuring method of floating body response since the mass of the floating module in tests is small use of common transducers may influence the dynamic response of the floating platform due to non negligible inertial effects of the instruments the non intrusive optical measuring method is employed to measure the six degrees of freedom dof responses of the floating modules in this study the surfaces of the floating modules are painted black three cursor points are marked on the top deck of each floating module by fluorescent material and the fourth cursor point is set on the top of a stick that is mounted at the middle of the desk as shown in fig 7 a the images of each marked cursors on a floating module are simultaneously acquired by two ccd cameras as shown in fig 7 b mounted above the module the grey spots on the images indicate the position of the marked cursor points and will be easily identified from the black background then the pixel coordinates of the center of the marked cursor points on the images recorded by two ccd cameras i 1 j 1 and i 2 j 2 can be calculated based on the values of i 1 j 1 and i 2 j 2 the three dimensional spacing coordinates of the marked point x y z are obtained as the spacing coordinates of the four cursor points on the floating module are known the 6 dof responses of the floating module surge sway heave pitch roll and yaw can be measured fig 7 c shows the data acquisition system of the ccd cameras in this experiment there are a set of high speed ccd cameras arranged above each module each computer controlled a set of high speed cameras via usb all computers are connected through a router in the course of data acquisition once the acquisition signal is sent by one computer the computers connected with the router starts capturing the data simultaneously hence the motions of every module could be measured at the same moment the relative motion of between modules in every moment can be derived by processing data all the data are acquired at a sampling frequency of 50 hz and an acquisition time of 50s the data collecting process starts after a wave front passes the floating system for a short while when the data acquisition in a wave condition had completed and the water had calmed down the test of next wave case can then be conducted in the present experimental investigation the tests under various wave heights and wave periods are conducted for the floating structures with one module up to five modules respectively the detailed wave conditions are listed in table 3 all the tests are investigated under the action of normally incident regular waves since this is a 2d experiment 4 experimental results and analysis the responses of modules are measured for floating structures with single module two modules up to five modules in various wave conditions listed in table 3 the modules are coupled by hinged connectors the study mainly concerns the effect of incident wave period the wave height and the number of modules on the responses and connector loads of floating platforms the numerical results are compared with experimental data to validate the correctness of the computational model the verified model is employed to estimate the connector loads for the effect analysis since the loads are difficult to be measured in experiments 4 1 attenuation experiments attenuation experiments of each floating module are conducted to measure the natural periods and estimate the damping coefficients the attenuation experiment for each degree of freedom motion is repeated more than twice the measured natural periods of floating modules are 1 6s and 1 8s respectively in heave and pitch direction the time histories of free oscillation of heave and pitch motion for module m 1 are shown in fig 8 assuming that the attenuation curve can be expressed in the equation form of a b 1 e b 2 t cos b 3 t b 4 b 5 the experimental data are fitted on the basis of the least square method the data fitting agrees well with the experiment as demonstrated in fig 8 the coefficients b 1 b 2 b 3 b 4 and b 5 thus can be obtained symbol b 3 indicates the damped natural frequency the damping coefficient is the ratio of b 2 to b 3 the time histories of free oscillation for other floating modules are similar with that of module 1 and not presented here the natural periods and damping coefficients of other floating modules can be obtained by the same way which are tabulated in table 4 and table 5 for the free oscillation of heave and pitch the natural periods obtained from the data fitting of the attenuation curve for free oscillation agree well with the measure results mentioned in above paragraph 4 2 response evolution of floating structures for the floating structures with different number of modules the time histories of motions under different wave conditions show regularly periodic motions similar to section 4 1 the least square method is applied to fit the experimental data the response amplitudes obtained from the fitting results is utilized in the following experimental analysis for the tested chain type floating structures from a single module to five modules the raos response amplitude per unit wave amplitude of surge heave and pitch motions are illustrated in fig 9 in the span of wave period and with the incident wave height of 0 03 m firstly the raos of floating platform with a single module are shown in the first column of fig 9 the peak values of heave motion and pitch motion occur in the wave period of 1 7s which is induced by the resonance as the incident wave period is close to the natural period of modules that means the natural periods along heave and pitch direction are about 1 7s which are close to the value obtained from the attenuation experiments the minor difference might be because the module was constrained by mooring lines in the experiment the curve of surge motion for the single floating module m 1 demonstrates that the natural period along x direction is in the range of 0 7s 2s the raos of floating structures with two three four and five modules couple by hinged connectors are demonstrated in the second third fourth and fifth column in fig 9 respectively the first row of fig 9 shows the raos of surge motions versus incident wave period for floating systems with different number of modules similarly the second and third rows respectively are the raos of heave and pitch motion with the increasing wave period every module is indicated by a solid line with a special color and marker as illustrated in fig 9 it should be noted that the modules are deployed in order from largest to smallest module number in the wave propagation direction which has been showed in fig 6 a for example in the two module floating platform the module m 3 is in the bow and the module m 2 is in the stern the modules of four modular floating system are arranged in order of m 4 m 3 m 2 and m 1 for the raos of surge motion of coupled modules the responses of modules have the similar trend for the floating structures with two modules three modules and four modules but not for the five modules the surge motion generally increases as the wave period increases in a particular wave period all the modules in a coupled system have the similar response amplitude although there are minor differences and the oscillation of modules may have different phases differently for the floating structure with five modules the module responses diversify from each other especially in the wave period from 0 9s to 1 8s it shows that the modules m 5 and m 1 in the bow and stern oscillate back and forth more than interior modules and the middle module m 3 oscillates the least in overview of all floating structures the maximum raos of surge motion is about 1 9 for the single module 1 7 for the two modules 1 3 for the three modules 0 9 for the four modules and 0 6 for the five modules the experiment reveals an important dynamic feature that the maximum surge response is significantly decreased as increasing number of modules is attached to the chain type floating system it should be noted that our experimental results are obtained in head wave for the wave height of 0 05 m the experiment also demonstrates the same feature as well not displayed here as attaching additional module onto the main structure in longitudinal direction the floating platform becomes more stable in terms of surge motion for all wave periods for the raos of heave motion of coupled modules shown in the second row of fig 9 the responses of modules generally increase as the wave period increases the heave motions of modules are quite similar for the two module system for the systems with three four and five modules the heave responses are bit diversified among modules and the module in the stern usually involves more oscillation than others when the wave period is above 1 4s this phenomenon is particularly obvious for the five module system where module m 1 in the stern oscillates much more than others and the interior modules oscillate at the same level in the large wave period of 2s it can be seen that the modules in the bow and stern always fluctuate more than the interior modules do the whole structure looks like outspread wings of eagle the middle section consisting of interior modules remain relatively stable and the modules at the two ends flap up and down in overview of all coupled systems the maximum heave responses of modules remain within 1 5 where the heave response level does not change as additional modules are attached to the floating platform it means that extending platform scale by adding modules in longitudinal direction does not evidently increase or decrease the level of heave motions this dynamic feature is different from that of the surge motion for the raos of pitch motion of coupled modules shown in the third row of fig 9 the varying trend of the pitch response curves looks like inverted u shape in the span of wave period the pitch motion increases rapidly in the wave period range from 0 8s to 0 9s then maintains a relatively high level in the wave period range from 0 9s to 1 2s and shows a downward trend when the wave period exceeds 1 2s close to the two ends of wave period interval the pitch motion of floating bodies is relatively small for the motion modes it is interesting to note that the pitch curves are almost overlapped for all coupled floating systems as the wave period is lower than 1s within this range of wave periods all the pitch motions among the modules are identical with a phase angle difference of π which means that if module m i rotates in clockwise with a pitch angle its adjacent module rotates in anticlockwise with the same pitch angle the modules oscillate regularly in a harmonic mode as the wave period is greater than 1s the pitch responses among the modules are diversified the module in the stern of all coupled systems has relatively larger pitch motion than other modules which is very similar to the case in the heave motion and closely related discrepancy in pitch motions is mainly induced by the hydrodynamic interference over all the pitch response remains in the same level for all coupled systems which means that additional modules attached to the floating platform do not evidently affect the pitch response level in fact the pitch motion is much more dependent on the wave period rather than the scale of floating structures to clearly view the influence of attaching more modules onto a chain type floating structure on the different types of responses the mean raos of all modules in the wave period are displayed in fig 10 where the symbol n denotes the total number of modules for the tested floating system the mean raos reflect the overall level of responses for different scale of chained floating systems for the surge motion as shown in fig 10 a the divergence of the mean surge motion is small in low wave period region while it becomes large as wave period exceeds 1s the plot shows the curve pattern lowers down a grade when n increases it reveals the dynamic feature found previously that the mean rao of surge response significantly reduces as the number of modules in a floating platform increases the plot also shows the curve patterns become flattened in the left hand side as n increases it reveals another important feature that the mean rao of surge response is more insensitive to the lower wave period as number of modules increases for example as n 5 the curve of the mean rao of surge response is almost flattened which implies that the platform with five modules has much smaller mean surge motion and more insensitive to the change of wave period limited by the number of modules used in experiment the dynamic evolution law of larger scale of chain type floating platform is unable to observe nevertheless numerical computations not reported here indicate that the stability of surge motion for hinge connected floating structure can be effectively improved and the surge motion appears less dependent on the wave period by adding more modules onto the main structure fig 10 b shows the mean raos of heave motions for floating systems with one to five modules in a range of wave period in general the mean raos of heave responses rise as the wave period increases the plot shows that the discrepancy among the curves of coupled systems except n 1 is limited and the curve for n 5 in general lays in the lowest level it tells the fact that the level of heave motion mainly depends on the wave period and the heave response can be slightly improved by attaching more modules onto the chain platform for the mean raos of pitch response in fig 10 c the variation tendencies for multi modular floating structures are similar except for the single floating module in the span of wave period the curve for n 5 in general lays in the lowest level it indicates that the level of pitch motion is insensitive to the quantity of modules in the floating structure and the stability of the multi modular system can be slightly improved by adding more modules 4 3 validation of numerical model with experimental data this experimental study aims to understand the dynamic characteristic change when adding more modules onto a chain type floating platform newman 1998 numerically studied the change of shear loads of hinges for an articulated barge in regular waves with increasing number of modules from two to eight we wish to confirm the newman s important conclusions experimentally but the shear forces of hinges in our experiment are hard to measure thus the numerical model elaborated in section 2 will be employed by using the data from experimental tests in order to assess the shear loads of hinges of the experimental floating systems to this purpose the numerical model needs to be firstly validated by experimental results note that the rmfc method is employed in modeling since the aspect ratio length height for the semi submersible module is 5 25 the structure is quite rigid as semi submersible module can greatly reduce the wave effect in comparison with the traditional pontoon type module the hydroelastic effect is ignored moreover the riggs et al 2000 s works showed that the rmfc model can predict the response very well as finite element method which can be used for conceptual and preliminary design in numerical calculations the rmfc model will be utilized to compare with the experimental data for model verification substituting the measured mass properties the damping coefficients the stiffness of mooring lines and the connector stiffness obtained by finite element method into the numerical model the numerical simulations are carried out on the basis of the frequency domain approach the comparison between numerical results and experimental tests is conducted on the surge heave and pitch responses of floating systems with single module two to five modules coupled by hinges due to the space limitation only the comparisons of three modular and five modular floating structure are presented in this section fig 11 demonstrates the numerical responses in unit wave amplitude and the raos in wave height of 0 03 m for hinge connected floating platform with three modules the first row of fig 11 shows the surge responses of each module the numerical results are coincident very well with the experimental results in all tested wave period interval the second row of fig 11 demonstrates the comparison between the numerical and experimental results for raos of heave motion the tendency of numerical analysis and experimental results generally match well in the wave period domain for the module m 1 the numerical results at the period of 1 4s and 1 8s are smaller than the experimental results for the module m 2 the numerical result has a deep valley in the period range from 1 7s but the experimental result remains a weak concave change the heave response of m 3 between numerical and experimental results agrees very well except the period at 2 0s the third row of fig 11 shows pitch motions for the three modules it can be observed that the numerical results coincide with the experimental data in general trend for the pitch motion of module m 1 the numerical results are a bit smaller than the tested data as wave period is greater than 0 9s this is probably because the artificial damping utilized in the numerical model is greater than the actual viscous damping of fluid in experiments similarly for the module m 2 the experimental results are a bit larger than the numerical ones but the tendency is the same for the module m 3 the numerical and experimental results agree well for the wave period smaller than 1 2s afterwards the experimental results are obviously smaller than numerical ones fig 12 illustrates the numerical results and the experimental data for the raos of five modular floating structure contrasting with the surge raos for the three modular structure the variation of surge responses for the five modular system is more complex in the span of wave period even so as shown in the first row of fig 12 the numerical results of each module generally match well with the experimental data in the tested wave period region in the second row of fig 12 for the heave responses of the modules m 2 m 4 and m 5 the experimental values almost overlap with the numerical values the experimental heave responses of the module m 1 are generally larger than the numerical ones but the trend is similar for the module m 3 the variation tendency of experimental data is coincident with that of numerical curve though the numerical values have some discrepancies with the tested values the pitch raos of modules in the third row of fig 12 show that the variation tendency of the numerical results generally agrees well with that of the experimental data in the span of wave period range the divergence between the numerical and the experimental values are small based on the above analysis it can be concluded that both the case of three modular system and the case of five modular system show the consistency between numerical calculations and experiments for the motions of surge heave and pitch in addition the comparisons between the numerical results and the experimental data for single module two modular and four modular floating structures are also conducted not presented here the results based on the numerical method in general agree well with the tested results although there are some minor differences the rmfc numerical model is feasible for the forecast of dynamical responses for chain type floating structures in the next section this numerical model fed by experimental data will be used to estimate the loads of hinges for multi modular floating structures in order to reveal the evolution of connector loads with the increasing number of modules and validate the main conclusion made by newman in his numerical studies newman 1998 4 4 connector loads evolution of floating structures as the responses obtained by numerical calculation coincide well with that of the test results we thus trust with confidence that this numerical model could be used to assess the hinge loads which are difficult to be measured in experiments there are two hinge connectors between two adjacent modules with the excitation of head wave the loads of two connectors are basically the same under the same parameter setting hence the loads of connector in one side of the floating system are presented in fig 13 where the symbol c i j denotes the connector between the module m i and m j for the floating platforms with two up to five modules the connector loads raos in longitudinal direction are demonstrated in the first row of fig 13 it can be observed that the peak value of the longitudinal connector load is doubled as the modular number increases from two modules up to five modules the longitudinal connector load increases significantly until with four modules afterwards the load increases very slow and tends to be constant in addition the maximum load along longitudinal direction appears slightly shifting towards the lower wave period while the number of modules increases the maximum longitudinal connector load of four modular and five modular floating system occurs on the interior connectors not on the connector nearest two ends for floating structures with three four or five modules the longitudinal loads of connectors nearest the bow and the stern have the same variation pattern as the wave period varies the longitudinal load of connector nearest the bow is always greater than that nearest the stern in low wave period region and the differences gradually become small and finally disappear with the increasing wave period for the five modular floating platform there is some discrepancy in the variation patterns of the longitudinal load between the interior connectors and the connectors nearest the two ends in the span of the wave period which can also be found in the longitudinal connector load of the four modular system the peak values of the longitudinal loads for interior connectors are greater than that for the connectors in the bow and the stern it is because that the modules in the two ends are connected by the mooring line with small stiffness while the interior modules are connected by hinge in both sides resulting in much stronger constrained forces the second row of fig 13 shows the vertical shear loads of hinge connectors for multi modular floating system the maximum vertical shear load of connectors increases slightly as the number of modules increases from two to five the level of vertical shear load mainly depends on the wave period rather than the number of modules in the floating platform for the floating platforms with three four or five modules the divergence between the vertical shear loads of different connectors mainly appear in the low wave period region the curves for the vertical shear loads of different connectors are clustered together in a wide range of wave period which means the vertical connector loads tend to the same among hinges as wave period increases the highest vertical load occurs on the connector nearest the bow the peak value of the vertical shear load is reduced gradually as the connector is farther from the bow that is the peak value of the vertical loads for the connector nearest the stern is smaller than that for other connectors this feature was first noticed by newman in his numerical study newman 1998 and validated in this study comparing with the longitudinal connector load in the first row of fig 13 it can be found that the vertical shear loads of hinge connector are large than or close to the longitudinal connector load in low wave period whereas as the period increases the connector loads in vertical direction are much less than the longitudinal loads that is to say the hinge connectors suffer both the longitudinal and shear loads in small wave period and mainly suffer the longitudinal load under the excitation of large wave period these remarks are made according to the experimental prototypes under study as the dimension size of module prototype changes the particular suffering wave period could be different 5 conclusions in this paper a 2d experiment in a wave flume is conducted to investigate the characteristic evolution of a scale extendable modularized chain type floating system by adding more modules onto the main structure the floating structure consists of semi submersible modules serially connected by hinge connectors the semi submersible modules are fabricated and their physical parameters are measured in experiments in the wave flume in the experimental study the effects of the number of modules the wave period and the wave height on the dynamic responses of floating platforms are investigated in addition the numerical analysis is validated by the experimental results and numerical assessment on the connector loads of hinge connected floating platform is carried out the main conclusions of this experimental study are as follows 1 the surge motion can be significantly reduced and the stability in longitudinal direction can be improved as the number of modules increases 2 the surge response is less sensitive to the effect of lower wave period as number of modules increases 3 extending platform scale by adding modules in longitudinal direction does not evidently affect the amplitude of heave motion which is mainly affected by the wave period 4 the increase of modules in a chain type floating platform does not evidently affect the level of pitch response which is mainly affected by the wave period 5 the connector load in longitudinal direction increases significantly until the number of modules exceeds four and the load increases very slow that is insensitive to the further addition of modules 6 the maximum load along longitudinal direction appears slightly shifting towards the lower wave period while the number of modules increases the maximum load usually occurs on the interior connectors not on the connectors near the bow and stern 7 the level of vertical shear load mainly depends on the wave period rather than the quantity of modules in the floating platform 8 the vertical connector loads tend to the same among hinges as wave period increases 9 the hinge connectors suffer both the longitudinal and shear loads in small wave period and mainly suffer the longitudinal load under the excitation of large wave period credit authorship contribution statement r ding conceptualization software data curation validation writing original draft

actuators keywords unmanned surface vehicle underactuated system t s fuzzy controller event triggered scheme networked control system 1 introduction benefited by the advancement of information technology and network technology intelligent marine vehicles become the mainstream trend in the current and future unmanned driving and intelligent control of marine vehicles are important foundations for realizing ship intelligence fossen 2011 unmanned surface vehicle usv is an unmanned autonomous marine robot system and in general it is featured by low cost small size high speed stealthy hull and high intelligence due to the above advantages it plays a great application role in generous of fields including hydrographic survey marine environmental monitoring marine search and rescue exploration modern military fields etc ma et al 2018b there is no denying that usv is attracting more and more attention from scholars and engineers all over the world to guarantee high accuracy and reliability in practical applications generous issues on the motion control of usv are thoroughly elucidated in detail including global stabilization and dynamic positioning pettersen et al 2004 wu et al 2016 path following and planning ma et al 2018a zhao et al 2020a trajectory tracking dong et al 2015 huang et al 2019 and maneuverability of usvs peng et al 2017c zhuang et al 2019 peng et al 2019 tan et al 2020 from the economic convenient and practical perspectives most of the researched and reported usvs belong to the underactuated system being lack of side thruster to provide both surge force and yaw moment it is significant that two independent main thrusters should be equipped at the center line of the underactuated usv referring to the control problem of the underactuated usv it is imperative to conceive a control law that can stabilize the system state pettersen et al 2004 lv et al 2019 xie and ma 2013 or even fulfill the tasks of the path following and trajectory tracking zhang et al 2015 dong et al 2015 huang et al 2019 lu et al 2017 by utilizing only the two available thrusters according to xie and ma 2013 the global asymptotic stability is the most difficult issue should be resolved owing to the underactuated usv is neither linear controllable nor satisfying the brockett s condition reyhanoglu 1997 in general traditional controllers and time invariant feedback controllers have no effect on the underactuated system in ghommam et al 2006 a novel time invariant control law is presented to ensure global stabilization of the system based on the backstepping design approach the controller consists of an adaptive sliding mode and backstepping method is proposed to solve the underactuated problem in ding et al 2013 generally lots of existing control laws are proposed for the underactuated usv based on a backstepping method however controllers illustrated above still cannot solve the inherent limitations of the underactuated usv quite well including nonlinear strong coupling and network bandwidth limitation following that considerable attention has been paid to the nonlinear control problem of underactuated usv in fan et al 2018 an integrated nonlinear feedback course keeping controller is proposed to strengthen the robustness of motion control a error driven based nonlinear feedback recursive design for surface ships with input saturation is proposed in ma et al 2019 wherein the nonlinear factors of the system are probed in depth it is noteworthy that the t s fuzzy controller design for unmanned marine vehicles was developed in wang et al 2018 with high quality by employing the linear system model t s fuzzy control can depict the local states of each fuzzy rule tanaka and wang 2001 however t s fuzzy method remarkably augments the state error of the nonlinear system increases the design difficulty and enlarges the computational burden of the corresponding local system controller to overcome the effect of modeling error between nonlinear time delay system and t s fuzzy model a t s fuzzy controller via observer based approach is proposed in lin et al 2008 in contrast to earlier models the novel t s fuzzy model considered contains two additive time varying delays and has strong application background in networked control system ncs zhao et al 2019 stabilization conditions of the studied system are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequality lmi which are easily solved using the numerical software to adopt fewer fuzzy rules and simplify calculation significantly a new t s fuzzy control scheme with local nonlinear feedback is proposed in dong et al 2009 compared to lmi based condition of the t s fuzzy controller khooban et al 2018 proposes a new polynomial based fuzzy controller for velocity and position control of the underactuated usv there is no denying that the system of the underactuated usv is a complex nonlinear system it is an attempt to establish a reasonable model and design matching t s fuzzy control scheme for improving the system performance which is one of the motivations of the current study when the usv encounters complex and adverse navigation environment such as strong winds and heavy waves it is rather difficult for the usv to make an optimal decision by only employing its sensor and actuator units independently under the above similar emergency and dangerous conditions referring to the power of control of the usv it should be transferred to the land based center or control station ma et al 2020b zhao et al 2020b in practical engineering to guarantee the stability and reliability of the usv it is significant that each usv is remotely manipulated by the land based center in network environments by executing the dynamic control signal sent from the above land based centers the usv can complete the corresponding designated tasks in time following that the usv the land based center and the communication network jointly form a typical ncs to guarantee the autonomous navigation the effective motion controller and the reliable communication network are vital and indispensable for the usv referring to ncs it focuses on the time triggered scheme for the signal transmission between each component including the usv sensor controller and actuator yue et al 2004 time triggered scheme periodically transmits sampling signals in the network channel from the perspective of the usv system when the system state is close to the equilibrium point lots of unnecessary data packets are sent to the network channel which results in an increased communication burden and a waste of network resource su et al 2018 ma et al 2020a following that to handle the network bandwidth limitation problems including severe network congestion and packet dropouts an event triggered scheme ets has been introduced for resolving the above issues su et al 2018 hu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 hu et al 2016 where the attention has been paid to discrete time nonlinear systems consequently for the sake of practical engineering requirements to guarantee the stability and reliability of the usv control system it is imperative and challenging to design a reasonable ets to limit the acting frequency of the actuators and extend the use time of each component in usv system it can be observed that the above elucidated problems and difficulties motivate this study motivated by the aforementioned issues this paper aims to present a controller design and stability analysis for an underactuated usv system when it comes to the underactuated usv in network environment we investigate the model description ets construction and t s fuzzy controller design in sequence firstly the model is elucidated by the t s fuzzy if then rules which represent the nonlinear and underactuated usv system with local linear system then we propose a discrete time ets for resolving communication problems including network bandwidth limitation and poor communication consequently the ets unified t s fuzzy model is introduced naturally based on the above model we develop a model based t s fuzzy controller to compensate each rule of the local system and sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities lmis by using the lyapunov functional approach finally simulation is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy control method the main contributions of this paper are emphasized below a network based t s fuzzy system model is established for a usv wherein the discrete time model is embodied and the network induced delay is stressed this model can solve the global asymptotic stabilization control problem of usv more effectively and conveniently a discrete time event triggered scheme is proposed to save network resources for a usv control system following that the co design of event triggered scheme and the t s fuzzy controller is developed to guarantee the global stability of the system and the event triggered controller is conducive to prolong the life of individual operating devices on usv the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 formulates the usv motion model and the unified networked t s fuzzy system the main results are given in section 3 performance analysis of the usv system is shown in section 4 section 5 concludes this paper notation r and n denote the set of reals and nonnegative integers respectively i and 0 represent identity matrix and zero matrix respectively with appropriate dimension r n is the n dimensional euclidean space

typical networked control system this section aims to establish event triggered t s fuzzy models for the usv in the network environment and the system subjects to communication delay and network bandwidth limitation 2 1 the description model of usv dynamics of a usv in 6 degrees of freedom 6 dof include surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw in general the usv control system merely stresses the normalized model of horizontal motion components in 3 degrees of freedom 3 dof including surge sway and yaw fossen 2011 as shown in fig 1 the body fixed and earth fixed reference frames are concerned where x b and y b denote the longitudinal axis and transverse axis respectively x and y denote earth fixed reference frames the origin of the coordinates is chosen to be at the center line of the usv suppose the usv is not equipped with side thruster and effects of disturbance forces are not stressed in this paper for the sake of simplicity motion equations of the usv in 3 dof can be described as 1 m v c v v d v τ 2 η j ψ v where m d i a g m 11 m 22 m 33 is the matrix of inertia parameters d d i a g d 11 d 22 d 33 is the matrix of hydrodynamic damping parameter η x y ψ t is the position vector of the usv in earth fixed frame v u v r t is the velocity vector of the usv in body fixed frame consisting of the velocities u in surge and v in sway and yaw rate r τ τ 1 0 τ 3 t is the control vector τ 1 and τ 3 are the surge force and the yaw torque input respectively there are no lateral propulsion control and input available c v is the coriolis and centripetal matrix c v 0 0 m 22 v 0 0 m 11 u m 22 v m 11 u 0 the rotation matrix j ψ is given by j ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 equation 1 is obtained assuming that the hull of the usv is symmetrical however for conventional vessels not all of them are completely symmetrical this proves that m 23 m 32 0 in the inertia matrix m and d 23 d 32 0 in the d for the majority of the vessels these off diagonal elements are small relative to the main diagonal elements m i i d i i i 1 2 3 and have little impact on the final performance according to 1 2 the dynamic model of the usv with the sway yaw and roll degrees can be 3 m 11 u m 22 v r d 11 u τ 1 m 22 v m 11 u r d 22 v 0 m 33 r m 22 m 11 u v d 33 r τ 3 x u cos ψ v sin ψ y u sin ψ v cos ψ ψ r as expounded in liu et al 2012 chang et al 2003 we introduce the following global diffeomorphism change of coordinate transformation 4 s 1 x cos ψ y sin ψ s 2 x sin ψ y cos ψ s 3 ψ where the notation s 1 s 2 and s 3 are the mapping poses in the body fixed coordinate combining 3 and 4 together the following equations can be reached 5 u 1 m 11 m 22 v r d 11 u τ 1 v 1 m 22 m 11 u r d 22 v r 1 m 33 m 11 m 22 u v d 33 r τ 3 s 1 u s 2 r s 2 v s 1 r s 3 r then the usv system can be express as 6 x k a 0 x k b 0 u k where x t x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 t u v r s 1 s 2 s 3 t u t u 1 u 2 t τ 1 τ 3 t a 0 d 11 m 11 m 22 m 11 x 3 0000 d 11 m 22 x 3 d 11 m 22 x 3 d 22 m 22 0 0 0 0 m 11 m 22 m 33 x 2 0 d 33 m 33 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 x 3 0 0 1 0 x 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 b 0 1 m 11 0 0 0 0 1 m 33 0 0 0 0 0 0 note that in parameters a 0 and b 0 x 2 and x 3 are nonlinear terms for simplicity it is supposed that sway speed x 2 k 0 5 0 5 and the yaw rate x 3 k 0 2 0 2 then we can employ t s fuzzy model and discretization method to approximate the nonlinear usv system on the basis of tanaka and wang 2001 fuzzy system model utilizes the method that how to determine maximum and minimum values of x 2 k and x 3 k therefore the fuzzy sets can be achieved as below 7 m 1 x 2 k 0 5 x 2 k m 2 x 2 k 0 5 x 2 k n 1 x 3 k 0 5 2 5 x 3 k n 2 x 3 k 0 5 2 5 x 3 k referring to the nonlinear system 6 owing to the violation of the well known brockett s condition it cannot be globally asymptotically stabilized by exploiting any time invariant smooth feedback controller consequently the networked t s fuzzy model is designed to stabilize the nonlinear system at first the t s fuzzy model is employed to approximate 6 where it can be represented by the local linear dynamic systems and discretization method with their general description hu et al 2015 tian et al 2011 the i t h rule of the system can be represented by a t s fuzzy model plant rule 1 if x 2 k is 0 5 and x 3 k is 0 2 then 8 x k 1 a 1 x k b 1 u k plant rule 2 if x 2 k is 0 5 and x 3 k is 0 2 then 9 x k 1 a 2 x k b 2 u k plant rule 3 if x 2 k is 0 5 and x 3 k is 0 2 then 10 x k 1 a 3 x k b 3 u k plant rule 4 if x 2 k is 0 5 and x 3 k is 0 2 then 11 x k 1 a 4 x k b 4 u k then the system 8 11 is formulated in the following compact form 12 x k 1 a x k b u k x k ϰ k k d m 0 where a i 1 r h i x k a i b i 1 r h i x k b i a i b i i s 1 2 r r 4 is the number of if then rules are appropriately dimensioned matrices d m n is a positive integer which represents the maximum bounds of the time delay the membership functions h i x k can be obtained by utilizing the same method demonstrated in tanaka and wang 2001 for convenience i 1 r h i x k in the following description is omitted remark 1 currently the control law proposed for the underactuated usv is based on the continuous model ghommam et al 2006 chang et al 2003 however the networked control system belongs to the discrete time system in practice furthermore without solving complex differential equations in the simulation the state response of the discrete time system can be accessed directly consequently our work would be developed on the foundation of the discrete time system including the focused model and the event triggered controller design 2 2 discrete time event triggering scheme ets network based structure of the usv with discrete time event triggered scheme ets is presented in fig 2 as illustrated in wang et al 2017 the system can transmit rather less data packages in the network if its performance tends to be stable or within the controllable range in the usv control system when stressed the communication delay to reduce data transmissions and save the network bandwidth resources we propose an ets that can determine whether the current sampled states should be transmitted to the controller or not it is supposed that the first event is generated at time instant k 0 0 the updated sampled states are sent out by comparing the latest transmitted states x k t at the triggering instant k t with the current sampled states x k at the current sampling instant k following that the next triggered time can be determined by 13 k t 1 inf k k k t x k x k t t w x k x k t σ x t k t w x k t where w is a symmetric positive definite matrix to be determined later σ 0 1 is a given parameter k t n t n n denotes the subsequent sampling instant 2 3 networked t s fuzzy control with discrete time event generator similar to the ets method in hu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 the set of the transmission point of time of discrete time event generator are denoted by k 1 k 2 as shown in fig 2 the network induced delay τ k c a in the channel from controller to actuator is neglected in this work due to the existence of the network induced delay τ k s c in the channel from sensor to controller system states will arrive the controller side at the instants k 1 τ k 1 k 2 τ k 2 in sequence where τ i denotes the time delay in the network system moreover to apply the t s fuzzy control method the available premise variables for the control rules in the controller side should be defined as θ j k s j s following that the network induced delay and the usv system state responses would shake more intensely the above phenomena is quite common and obvious especially when the sampling time is short and during the period that the usv performs tasks including trajectory tracking and dynamic positioning therefore from the perspective of practical engineering the controller cannot get the same premise variables as the fuzzy system 12 referring to the system 6 as long as its initial condition is given its state response can be calculated correspondingly following that if x k t is available we can compute any x k for k k t τ k t k t 1 τ k t 1 in view of this the premise synchronizer can be utilized to derive the premise θ k in the controller side then on the basis of the ets and network induced delays the j t h control rule can be formulated as below control rules j if θ 1 k is μ 1 j and θ 2 k is μ 2 j and and θ p k is μ p j then 14 u k j 1 r h j θ k k j x k t k k t τ k t k t 1 τ k t 1 where θ g k g 1 2 p represent premise variable μ g j is a fuzzy set h j θ k is the membership function k j is controller gain to be designed later remark 2 it can be found that a different velocity variation scope of sway x 2 and yaw x 3 will lead to different usv system parameters and premise membership function meanwhile the premise membership function structure of the controller is different from the fuzzy system 12 due to the existence of the communication time delay between the usv and the control station following that a less conservative result can be derived by adopting the described technique combining 12 and 14 for k k t τ k t k t 1 τ k t 1 the following closed loop t s fuzzy usv control system with discrete time event generator in network environment can be reached 15 x k 1 i 1 r j 1 r h i x k h j θ k a i x k b i k j x k t in the sequel suppose r k t k t τ k t k t 1 τ k t 1 then the event intervals r k t can be divided into sampling interval like subintervals 16 r k t n 0 n k r n where r n k t n τ k t n k t 1 n 1 τ k t n 1 n 0 1 n k n k k t 1 k t 1 then suppose d k k k t n k r n where d k denotes a time delay that induced by the network and ets when it comes to k r n it is piecewise linear according to the definition of r n in 16 the bounds of the time delay d k can be 17 0 τ k t d k 1 max τ k t τ k t 1 1 τ d m where τ denotes the upper bound of the time delay d m is an upper bound parameter related to time delay τ and sampling time d m is given later in the section of simulation result taking into account of the effect of the ets in deriving system stability and stabilization criterion error vector e k can be 18 e k x k t x k t n k r n then the following can be obtained 19 x k t x k d k e k k r n combining 15 and 19 the usv closed loop event triggering fuzzy system can be 20 x k 1 i 1 r j 1 r h i x k h j θ k a i x k b i k j x k d k b i k j e k k r n x k ϰ k k d m 0 where x k ϰ k k d m 0 is the supplemented initial condition of ϰ k on d m 0 and from the 13 and 18 the error vector e k satisfies 21 e t k w e k σ x t k d k w x k d k remark 3 to guarantee the stability of the usv system the on board sensor system of the usv would communicate with the land based control station effectively including navigation information and control signal in general sensor data is periodically transmitted to the control station there is no denying that some signals are not necessary to be transmitted to the control station to enhance the utilization of network resources a discrete time fuzzy system with time delay is illustrated in 20 furthermore to strengthen the practical application in the underactuated usv control system the proposed discrete time event triggered scheme is highlighted 3 main results in this section a sufficient condition that ensures the asymptotic stability of the usv closed loop system 20 with ets 13 is achieved sufficient conditions for our concerned problem are represented via lmi technique theorem 1 for given positive integer parameter d m and the triggering parameter σ 0 1 the usv closed loop event triggering fuzzy

have δ v k ε x 2 with ε 0 by employing the lyapunov stability theory for discrete time system it can be guaranteed that system 20 with ets 21 is global asymptotically stable this completes the proof remark 4 most of the controller design techniques for global stability analysis of the underactuated usv are based on backstepping method ghommam et al 2006 ding et al 2013 liu et al 2012 in this paper we design a t s fuzzy control law with discrete time ets of the usv in network environment and stress the network induced delay in the demonstrated model all the above considerations are beneficial for better compliance with the actual situation in addition the proposed method can save network resources remarkably and limit the acting of the frequency of actuators based on theorem 1 the robust controller design method for usv control system 20 with ets 21 can be described the criterion of the event triggering parameter w in 21 and the event triggered controller gain matrix k j are derived as shown in theorem 2 theorem 2 for given positive integer parameter d m δ and the triggering parameter σ 0 1 the usv closed loop event triggering fuzzy system 20 is asymptotic stability

utilizing the relations r z 1 δ 2 r z 2 δ x with the given scalars δ it can be inferred that if φ i j 0 then φ i j 0 can be guaranteed this completes the proof remark 5 similar to peng et al 2017a we employ the basic inequality to linearize the nonlinear item the matrix inequalities 22 in theorem 1 are not strict lmi owing to the existence of the nonlinear term r z 1 the sufficient condition of the controller is introduced in theorem 2 gain matrices and trigger parameters can be resolved by through matlab lmi toolbox it should be noted that δ needs to be given before solving the related lmi and suitable parameter values of δ can derive less conservative results remark 6 on the basis of the networked system presented for usv we investigate the problem of networked t s fuzzy controller and discrete time ets coordinated design for the motion process of the usv similar to our previous work peng et al 2017b the proposed design method can be extended to investigate the system 20 against external disturbances such as wind wave and current and the corresponding results are illustrated in section 4 4 simulation result in this section numerical examples are presented to illustrated the

utilization of network resources two simulation cases with σ 0 and σ 0 2 are carried out in sequence restricted by space limitation the controller matrices k j corresponding to the case σ 0 2 are

2 m s 0 m s 0 r a d s 18 m 0 m 1 6 r a d and the simulation time t s 20 s the units of τ 1 and τ 3 are newton n to show the simulation figure clearly we omit the units of all observed states and define them uniformly here without special explanation the units of all observed states are the same from the perspective of engineering application simulation results are the control system stabilization experiment comparison 1 in comparison with the traditional t s fuzzy controllers obtained in chang et al 2003 and khooban et al 2018 without considering the time delay or bandwidth limitation in network based usv system the control gain matrices k j are obtained based on proposed method in khooban et al 2018 simulation results show that the designed controller stabilize the usv to the equilibrium origin and heading 0 m 0 m 0 r a d when the usv remains in the braking state 0 m s 0 m s 0 r a d s the state responses of velocities and positions are given in figs 3 and 4 as it can be seen all of these states have large fluctuations and the state of y t is not converged to the desired equilibrium point in fig 4 in addition the control input signals of the usv system are depicted in fig 5 it reflects the process that the usv actuator executes the control signal from the land based center in sense the traditional t s fuzzy controller fails to solve the stabilization problem for the usv control system considering the time delay comparison 2 in comparison with the adaptive output feedback stabilization controllers in the network based usv system the controller parameters are obtained based on the proposed method in lin et al 2018 state responses are given in figs 6 and 7 and control input signals are depicted in fig 8 to achieve better system performance and cope with various abnormal situations the method of networked t s fuzzy controller and discrete time ets codesign is proposed in this paper and the corresponding results are shown in figs 9 17 referring to case 1 with σ 0 the simulation results are presented in figs 9 11 it is shown that the usv control system are asymptotically stable and the states converge to the desired equilibrium point moreover it proves that the control problem of the usv nonlinear network based system considering the time delay can be solved by the proposed t s fuzzy control method referring to case 2 with σ 0 2 figs 12 15 illustrate the corresponding results it can be found from the above two group figures case 2 has longer response time regardless of velocity position and control inputs and the state responses shake more obviously in case 2 than the time triggering in case 1 the control performance is declining in essence from case 1 to case 2 fig 15 shows the corresponding release instants and intervals of case 2 the above two cases verify that our proposed ets can both guarantee usv control system stability and save the network resources meanwhile it can be concluded that by employing the event triggered scheme there is a trade off between the usv control system performance and the amount of packet transmission table 1 shows partial results with different trigger parameter σ by utilizing our proposed ets it can be found that with the increasing of σ the values of the amount of total transmitted packets n the maximum time delay d m and the packet transmission rate p are declining consistently whereas the average transmission period h shows an increasing tendency with the growth of h it means that the frequency of data transmission is reduced and the network resource can be released however if the trigger parameter σ is too large the stability of the usv control system cannot be guaranteed to consolidate the above assertions position state responses x t and y t with the varying of σ are compared in fig 16 it is demonstrated that with the increasing of σ the average trigger period increasing and the control system performance is decreasing according to remark 6 define ω τ ω 1 τ ω 2 τ ω 3 t denote environmental disturbances act on the usv environmental disturbances are taken as forces and moment τ ω 1 300 50 sin π t 3 τ ω 2 20 exp 0 1 t 1 2 τ ω 1 5 2 cos π t 3 and the state responses are given in fig 17 it is shown that in the usv system even in the presence of disturbance all velocity states are convergent to zero asymptotically consequently referring to the network based usv control system there exists a trade off between the network resource utilization and system performance one can see from the above figures and table that the studied system is well controlled with occupying few communication resources and the acting frequency of the actuator is reduced 5 conclusions and future work this paper establishes a discrete time t s fuzzy system for the underactuated usv considering the time delay in network based usv system the event triggered scheme and t s fuzzy controller coordinated design method are developed compared with the existing results our method not only can guarantee the global stability of the system which against the external disturbances it can also save the network resources effectively and lower the acting frequency

21667,this paper proposes a takagi sugeno t s fuzzy controller for an underactuated unmanned surface vehicle usv based on an event triggered scheme ets in a network environment firstly a discrete time

numerical simulation it is demonstrated that the presented main results not only can guarantee the performance but also reduce the occupation of network bandwidth and the acting frequency of the actuators keywords unmanned surface vehicle underactuated system t s fuzzy controller event triggered scheme networked control system 1 introduction benefited by the advancement of information technology and network technology intelligent marine vehicles become the mainstream trend in the current and future unmanned driving and intelligent control of marine vehicles are important foundations for realizing ship intelligence fossen 2011 unmanned surface vehicle usv is an unmanned autonomous marine robot system and in general it is featured by low cost small size high speed stealthy hull and high intelligence due to the above advantages it plays a great application role in generous of fields including hydrographic survey marine environmental monitoring marine search and rescue exploration modern military fields etc ma et al 2018b there is no denying that usv is attracting more and more attention from scholars and engineers all over the world to guarantee high accuracy and reliability in practical applications generous issues on the motion control of usv are thoroughly elucidated in detail including global stabilization and dynamic positioning pettersen et al 2004 wu et al 2016 path following and planning ma et al 2018a zhao et al 2020a trajectory tracking dong et al 2015 huang et al 2019 and maneuverability of usvs peng et al 2017c zhuang et al 2019 peng et al 2019 tan et al 2020 from the economic convenient and practical perspectives most of the researched and reported usvs belong to the underactuated system being lack of side thruster to provide both surge force and yaw moment it is significant that two independent main thrusters should be equipped at the center line of the underactuated usv referring to the control problem of the underactuated usv it is imperative to conceive a control law that can stabilize the system state pettersen et al 2004 lv et al 2019 xie and ma 2013 or even fulfill the tasks of the path following and trajectory tracking zhang et al 2015 dong et al 2015 huang et al 2019 lu et al 2017 by utilizing only the two available thrusters according to xie and ma 2013 the global asymptotic stability is the most difficult issue should be resolved owing to the underactuated usv is neither linear controllable nor satisfying the brockett s condition reyhanoglu 1997 in general traditional controllers and time invariant feedback controllers have no effect on the underactuated system in ghommam et al 2006 a novel time invariant control law is presented to ensure global stabilization of the system based on the backstepping design approach the controller consists of an adaptive sliding mode and backstepping method is proposed to solve the underactuated problem in ding et al 2013 generally lots of existing control laws are proposed for the underactuated usv based on a backstepping method however controllers illustrated above still cannot solve the inherent limitations of the underactuated usv quite well including nonlinear strong coupling and network bandwidth limitation following that considerable attention has been paid to the nonlinear control problem of underactuated usv in fan et al 2018 an integrated nonlinear feedback course keeping controller is proposed to strengthen the robustness of motion control a error driven based nonlinear feedback recursive design for surface ships with input saturation is proposed in ma et al 2019 wherein the nonlinear factors of the system are probed in depth it is noteworthy that the t s fuzzy controller design for unmanned marine vehicles was developed in wang et al 2018 with high quality by employing the linear system model t s fuzzy control can depict the local states of each fuzzy rule tanaka and wang 2001 however t s fuzzy method remarkably augments the state error of the nonlinear system increases the design difficulty and enlarges the computational burden of the corresponding local system controller to overcome the effect of modeling error between nonlinear time delay system and t s fuzzy model a t s fuzzy controller via observer based approach is proposed in lin et al 2008 in contrast to earlier models the novel t s fuzzy model considered contains two additive time varying delays and has strong application background in networked control system ncs zhao et al 2019 stabilization conditions of the studied system are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequality lmi which are easily solved using the numerical software to adopt fewer fuzzy rules and simplify calculation significantly a new t s fuzzy control scheme with local nonlinear feedback is proposed in dong et al 2009 compared to lmi based condition of the t s fuzzy controller khooban et al 2018 proposes a new polynomial based fuzzy controller for velocity and position control of the underactuated usv there is no denying that the system of the underactuated usv is a complex nonlinear system it is an attempt to establish a reasonable model and design matching t s fuzzy control scheme for improving the system performance which is one of the motivations of the current study when the usv encounters complex and adverse navigation environment such as strong winds and heavy waves it is rather difficult for the usv to make an optimal decision by only employing its sensor and actuator units independently under the above similar emergency and dangerous conditions referring to the power of control of the usv it should be transferred to the land based center or control station ma et al 2020b zhao et al 2020b in practical engineering to guarantee the stability and reliability of the usv it is significant that each usv is remotely manipulated by the land based center in network environments by executing the dynamic control signal sent from the above land based centers the usv can complete the corresponding designated tasks in time following that the usv the land based center and the communication network jointly form a typical ncs to guarantee the autonomous navigation the effective motion controller and the reliable communication network are vital and indispensable for the usv referring to ncs it focuses on the time triggered scheme for the signal transmission between each component including the usv sensor controller and actuator yue et al 2004 time triggered scheme periodically transmits sampling signals in the network channel from the perspective of the usv system when the system state is close to the equilibrium point lots of unnecessary data packets are sent to the network channel which results in an increased communication burden and a waste of network resource su et al 2018 ma et al 2020a following that to handle the network bandwidth limitation problems including severe network congestion and packet dropouts an event triggered scheme ets has been introduced for resolving the above issues su et al 2018 hu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 hu et al 2016 where the attention has been paid to discrete time nonlinear systems consequently for the sake of practical engineering requirements to guarantee the stability and reliability of the usv control system it is imperative and challenging to design a reasonable ets to limit the acting frequency of the actuators and extend the use time of each component in usv system it can be observed that the above elucidated problems and difficulties motivate this study motivated by the aforementioned issues this paper aims to present a controller design and stability analysis for an underactuated usv system when it comes to the underactuated usv in network environment we investigate the model description ets construction and t s fuzzy controller design in sequence firstly the model is elucidated by the t s fuzzy if then rules which represent the nonlinear and underactuated usv system with local linear system then we propose a discrete time ets for resolving communication problems including network bandwidth limitation and poor communication consequently the ets unified t s fuzzy model is introduced naturally based on the above model we develop a model based t s fuzzy controller to compensate each rule of the local system and sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities lmis by using the lyapunov functional approach finally simulation is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy control method the main contributions of this paper are emphasized below a network based t s fuzzy system model is established for a usv wherein the discrete time model is embodied and the network induced delay is stressed this model can solve the global asymptotic stabilization control problem of usv more effectively and conveniently a discrete time event triggered scheme is proposed to save network resources for a usv control system following that the co design of event triggered scheme and the t s fuzzy controller is developed to guarantee the global stability of the system and the event triggered controller is conducive to prolong the life of individual operating devices on usv the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 formulates the usv motion model and the unified networked t s fuzzy system the main results are given in section 3 performance analysis of the usv system is shown in section 4 section 5 concludes this paper notation

typical networked control system this section aims to establish event triggered t s fuzzy models for the usv in the network environment and the system subjects to communication delay and network bandwidth limitation 2 1 the description model of usv dynamics of a usv in 6 degrees of freedom 6 dof include surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw in general the usv control system merely stresses the normalized model of horizontal motion components in 3 degrees of freedom 3 dof including surge sway and yaw fossen 2011 as shown in fig 1 the body fixed and earth fixed reference frames are concerned where x b and y b denote the longitudinal axis and transverse axis respectively x and y denote earth fixed reference frames the origin of the coordinates is chosen to be at the center line of the usv suppose the usv is not equipped with side thruster and effects of disturbance forces are not stressed in this paper for the sake of simplicity motion equations of the usv in 3 dof can be described as 1 m v c v v d v τ 2 η j ψ v where m d i a g m 11 m 22 m 33 is the matrix of inertia parameters d d i a g d 11 d 22 d 33 is the matrix of hydrodynamic damping parameter η x y ψ t is the position vector of the usv in earth fixed frame v u v r t is the velocity vector of the usv in body fixed frame consisting of the velocities u in surge and v in sway and yaw rate r τ τ 1 0 τ 3 t is the control vector τ 1 and τ 3 are the surge force and the yaw torque input respectively there are no lateral propulsion control and input available c v is the coriolis and centripetal matrix c v 0 0 m 22 v 0 0 m 11 u m 22 v m 11 u 0 the rotation matrix j ψ is given by j ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 equation 1 is obtained assuming that the hull of the usv is symmetrical however for conventional vessels not all of them are completely symmetrical this proves that m 23 m 32 0 in the inertia matrix m and d 23 d 32 0 in the d for the majority of the vessels these off diagonal elements are small relative to the main diagonal elements m i i d i i i 1 2 3 and have little impact on the final performance according to 1 2 the dynamic model of the usv with the sway yaw and roll degrees can be 3 m 11 u m 22 v r d 11 u τ 1 m 22 v m 11 u r d 22 v 0 m 33 r m 22 m 11 u v d 33 r τ 3 x u cos ψ v sin ψ y u sin ψ v cos ψ ψ r as expounded in liu et al 2012 chang et al 2003 we introduce the following global diffeomorphism change of coordinate transformation 4 s 1 x cos ψ y sin ψ s 2 x sin ψ y cos ψ s 3 ψ where the notation s 1 s 2 and s 3 are the mapping poses in the body fixed coordinate combining 3 and 4 together the following equations can be reached 5 u 1 m 11 m 22 v r d 11 u τ 1 v 1 m 22 m 11 u r d 22 v r 1 m 33 m 11 m 22 u v d 33 r τ 3 s 1 u s 2 r s 2 v s 1 r s 3 r then the usv system can be express as 6 x k a 0 x k b 0 u k where x t x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 t u v r s 1 s 2 s 3 t u t u 1 u 2 t τ 1 τ 3 t a 0 d 11 m 11 m 22 m 11 x 3 0000 d 11 m 22 x 3 d 11 m 22 x 3 d 22 m 22 0 0 0 0 m 11 m 22 m 33 x 2 0 d 33 m 33 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 x 3 0 0 1 0 x 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 b 0 1 m 11 0 0 0 0 1 m 33 0 0 0 0 0 0 note that in parameters a 0 and b 0 x 2 and x 3 are nonlinear terms for simplicity it is supposed that sway speed x 2 k 0 5 0 5 and the yaw rate x 3 k 0 2 0 2 then we can employ t s fuzzy model and discretization method to approximate the nonlinear usv system on the basis of tanaka and wang 2001 fuzzy system model utilizes the method that how to determine maximum and minimum values of x 2 k and x 3 k therefore the fuzzy sets can be achieved as below 7 m 1 x 2 k 0 5 x 2 k m 2 x 2 k 0 5 x 2 k n 1 x 3 k 0 5 2 5 x 3 k n 2 x 3 k 0 5 2 5 x 3 k referring to the nonlinear system 6 owing to the violation of the well known brockett s condition it cannot be globally asymptotically stabilized by exploiting any time invariant smooth feedback controller consequently the networked t s fuzzy model is designed to stabilize the nonlinear system at first the t s fuzzy model is employed to approximate 6 where it can be represented by the local linear dynamic systems and discretization method with their general description hu et al 2015 tian et al 2011 the i t h rule of the system can be represented by a t s fuzzy model plant rule 1 if x 2 k is 0 5 and x 3 k is 0 2 then 8 x k 1 a 1 x k b 1 u k plant rule 2 if x 2 k is 0 5 and x 3 k is 0 2 then 9 x k 1 a 2 x k b 2 u k plant rule 3 if x 2 k is 0 5 and x 3 k is 0 2 then 10 x k 1 a 3 x k b 3 u k plant rule 4 if x 2 k is 0 5 and x 3 k is 0 2 then 11 x k 1 a 4 x k b 4 u k then the system 8 11 is formulated in the following compact form 12 x k 1 a x k b u k x k ϰ k k d m 0 where a i 1 r h i x k a i b i 1 r h i x k b i a i b i i s 1 2 r r 4 is the number of if then rules are appropriately dimensioned matrices d m n is a positive integer which represents the maximum bounds of the time delay the membership functions h i x k can be obtained by utilizing the same method demonstrated in tanaka and wang 2001 for convenience i 1 r h i x k in the following description is omitted remark 1 currently the control law proposed for the underactuated usv is based on the continuous model ghommam et al 2006 chang et al 2003 however the networked control system belongs to the discrete time system in practice furthermore without solving complex differential equations in the simulation the state response of the discrete time system can be accessed directly consequently our work would be developed on the foundation of the discrete time system including the focused model and the event triggered controller design 2 2 discrete time event triggering scheme ets network based structure of the usv with discrete time event triggered scheme ets is presented in fig 2 as illustrated in wang et al 2017 the system can transmit rather less data packages in the network if its performance tends to be stable or within the controllable range in the usv control system when stressed the communication delay to reduce data transmissions and save the network bandwidth resources we propose an ets that can determine whether the current sampled states should be transmitted to the controller or not it is supposed that the first event is generated at time instant k 0 0 the updated sampled states are sent out by comparing the latest transmitted states x k t at the triggering instant k t with the current sampled states x k at the current sampling instant k following that the next triggered time can be determined by 13 k t 1 inf k k k t x k x k t t w x k x k t σ x t k t w x k t where w is a symmetric positive definite matrix to be determined later σ 0 1 is a given parameter k t n t n n denotes the subsequent sampling instant 2 3 networked t s fuzzy control with discrete time event generator similar to the ets method in hu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 the set of the transmission point of time of discrete time event generator are denoted by k 1 k 2 as shown in fig 2 the network induced delay τ k c a in the channel from controller to actuator is neglected in this work due to the existence of the network induced delay τ k s c in the channel from sensor to controller system states will arrive the controller side at the instants k 1 τ k 1 k 2 τ k 2 in sequence where τ i denotes the time delay in the network system moreover to apply the t s fuzzy control method the available premise variables for the control rules in the controller side should be defined as θ j k s j s following that the network induced delay and the usv system state responses would shake more intensely the above phenomena is quite common and obvious especially when the sampling time is short and during the period that the usv performs tasks including trajectory tracking and dynamic positioning therefore from the perspective of practical engineering the controller cannot get the same premise variables as the fuzzy system 12 referring to the system 6 as long as its initial condition is given its state response can be calculated correspondingly following that if x k t is available we can compute any x k for k k t τ k t k t 1 τ k t 1 in view of this the premise synchronizer can be utilized to derive the premise θ k in the controller side then on the basis of the ets and network induced delays the j t h control rule can be formulated as below control rules j if θ 1 k is μ 1 j and θ 2 k is μ 2 j and and θ p k is μ p j then 14 u k j 1 r h j θ k k j x k t k k t τ k t k t 1 τ k t 1 where θ g k g 1 2 p represent premise variable μ g j is a fuzzy set h j θ k is the membership function k j is controller gain to be designed later remark 2 it can be found that a different velocity variation scope of sway x 2 and yaw x 3 will lead to different usv system parameters and premise membership function meanwhile the premise membership function structure of the controller is different from the fuzzy system 12 due to the existence of the communication time delay between the usv and the control station following that a less conservative result can be derived by adopting the described technique combining 12 and 14 for k k t τ k t k t 1 τ k t 1 the following closed loop t s fuzzy usv control system with discrete time event generator in network environment can be reached 15 x k 1 i 1 r j 1 r h i x k h j θ k a i x k b i k j x k t in the sequel suppose r k t k t τ k t k t 1 τ k t 1 then the event intervals r k t can be divided into sampling interval like subintervals 16 r k t n 0 n k r n where r n k t n τ k t n k t 1 n 1 τ k t n 1 n 0 1 n k n k k t 1 k t 1 then suppose d k k k t n k r n where d k denotes a time delay that induced by the network and ets when it comes to k r n it is piecewise linear according to the definition of r n in 16 the bounds of the time delay d k can be 17 0 τ k t d k 1 max τ k t τ k t 1 1 τ d m where τ denotes the upper bound of the time delay d m is an upper bound parameter related to time delay τ and sampling time d m is given later in the section of simulation result taking into account of the effect of the ets in deriving system stability and stabilization criterion error vector e k can be 18 e k x k t x k t n k r n then the following can be obtained 19 x k t x k d k e k k r n combining 15 and 19 the usv closed loop event triggering fuzzy system can be 20 x k 1 i 1 r j 1 r h i x k h j θ k a i x k b i k j x k d k b i k j e k k r n x k ϰ k

stability of the usv system the on board sensor system of the usv would communicate with the land based control station effectively including navigation information and control signal in general sensor data is periodically transmitted to the control station there is no denying that some signals are not necessary to be transmitted to the control station to enhance the utilization of network resources a discrete time fuzzy system with time delay is illustrated in 20 furthermore to strengthen the practical application in the underactuated usv control system the proposed discrete time event

have δ v k ε x 2 with ε 0 by employing the lyapunov stability theory for discrete time system it can be guaranteed that system 20 with ets 21 is global asymptotically stable this completes the proof remark 4 most of the controller design techniques for global stability analysis of the underactuated usv are based on backstepping method ghommam et al 2006 ding et al 2013 liu et al 2012 in this paper we design a t s fuzzy control law with discrete time ets of the usv in network environment and stress the network induced delay in the demonstrated model all the above considerations are beneficial for better compliance with the actual situation in addition the proposed method can save network resources remarkably and limit the acting of the frequency of actuators based on theorem 1 the robust controller design method for usv control system 20 with ets 21 can be described the criterion of the event triggering parameter w in 21 and the event triggered controller gain matrix k j are derived as shown in theorem 2 theorem 2 for given positive integer parameter d m δ and the triggering parameter σ 0 1 the usv closed loop event triggering fuzzy system 20 is asymptotic stability if there existing a set of symmetric matrices w 0 x 0 q 0 r 0 z 0 and matrices m i j n i j and s i j i j s with appropriate dimensions that the following lmis are satisfied 27 φ i j φ j i 0 i j where

utilizing the relations r z 1 δ 2 r z 2 δ x with the given scalars δ it can be inferred that if φ i j 0 then φ i j 0 can be guaranteed this completes the proof remark 5 similar to peng et al 2017a we employ the basic inequality to linearize the nonlinear item the matrix inequalities 22 in theorem 1 are not strict lmi owing to the existence of the nonlinear term r z 1 the sufficient condition of the controller is introduced in theorem 2 gain matrices and trigger parameters can be resolved by through matlab lmi toolbox it should be noted that δ needs to be given before solving the related lmi and suitable parameter values of δ can derive less conservative results remark 6 on the basis of the networked system presented for usv we investigate the problem of networked t s fuzzy controller and discrete time ets coordinated design for the motion process of the usv similar to our previous work peng et al 2017b the proposed design method can be extended to investigate the system 20 against external disturbances such as wind wave and current and the corresponding results are illustrated in section 4 4 simulation result in this section numerical examples are presented to illustrated the

utilization of network resources two simulation cases with σ 0 and σ 0 2 are carried out in sequence restricted by space limitation the controller matrices k j corresponding to the case σ 0 2 are

2 m s 0 m s 0 r a d s 18 m 0 m 1 6 r a d and the simulation time t s 20 s the units of τ 1 and τ 3 are newton n to show the simulation figure clearly we omit the units of all observed states and define them uniformly here without special explanation the units of all observed states are the same from the perspective of engineering application simulation results are the control system stabilization experiment comparison 1 in comparison with the traditional t s fuzzy controllers obtained in chang et al 2003 and khooban et al 2018 without considering the time delay or bandwidth limitation in network based usv system the control gain matrices k j are obtained based on proposed method in khooban et al 2018 simulation results show that the designed controller stabilize the usv to the equilibrium origin and heading 0 m 0 m 0 r a d when the usv remains in the braking state 0 m s 0 m s 0 r a d s the state responses of velocities and positions are given in figs 3 and 4 as it can be seen all of these states have large fluctuations and the state of y t is not converged to the desired equilibrium point in fig 4 in addition the control input signals of the usv system are depicted in fig 5 it reflects the process that the usv actuator executes the control signal from the land based center in sense the traditional t s fuzzy controller fails to solve the stabilization problem for the usv control system considering the time delay comparison 2 in comparison with the adaptive output feedback stabilization controllers in the network based usv system the controller parameters are obtained based on the proposed method in lin et al 2018 state responses are given in figs 6 and 7 and control input signals are depicted in fig 8 to achieve better system performance and cope with various abnormal situations the method of networked t s fuzzy controller and discrete time ets codesign is proposed in this paper and the corresponding results are shown in figs 9 17 referring to case 1 with σ 0 the simulation results are presented in figs 9 11 it is shown that the usv control system are asymptotically stable and the states converge to the desired equilibrium point moreover it proves that the control problem of the usv nonlinear network based system considering the time delay can be solved by the proposed t s fuzzy control method referring to case 2 with σ 0 2 figs 12 15 illustrate the corresponding results it can be found from the above two group figures case 2 has longer response time regardless of velocity position and control inputs and the state responses shake more obviously in case 2 than the time triggering in case 1 the control performance is declining in essence from case 1 to case 2 fig 15 shows the corresponding release instants and intervals of case 2 the above two cases verify that our proposed ets can both guarantee usv control system stability and save the network resources meanwhile it can be concluded that by employing the event triggered scheme there is a trade off between the usv control system performance and the amount of packet transmission table 1 shows partial results with different trigger parameter σ by utilizing our proposed ets it can be found that with the increasing of σ the values of the amount of total transmitted packets n the maximum time delay d m and the packet transmission rate p are declining consistently whereas the average transmission period h shows an increasing tendency with the growth of h it means that the frequency of data transmission is reduced and the network resource can be released however if the trigger parameter σ is too large the stability of the usv control system cannot be guaranteed to consolidate the above assertions position state responses x t and y t with the varying of σ are compared in fig 16 it is demonstrated that with the increasing of σ the average trigger period increasing and the control system performance is decreasing according to remark 6 define ω τ ω 1 τ ω 2 τ ω 3 t denote environmental disturbances act on the usv environmental disturbances are taken as forces and moment τ ω 1 300 50 sin π t 3 τ ω 2 20 exp 0 1 t 1 2 τ ω 1 5 2 cos π t 3 and the state responses are given in fig 17 it is shown that in the usv system even in the presence of disturbance all velocity states are convergent to zero asymptotically consequently referring to the network based usv control system there exists a trade off between the network resource utilization and system performance one can see from the above figures and table that the studied system is well controlled with occupying few communication resources and the acting frequency of the actuator is reduced 5 conclusions and future work this paper establishes a discrete time t s fuzzy system for the underactuated usv considering the time delay in network based usv system the event triggered scheme and t s fuzzy controller coordinated design method are developed compared with the existing results our method not only can guarantee the global stability of the system which against the external disturbances it can also save the network resources effectively and lower the acting frequency of actuators performance analysis verify the effectiveness of our proposed technique in the future we will consider the actuator fault in the studied system and give field test for verification it is

conceptualization national maritime research institute 6 38 1 shinkawa mitaka tokyo japan national maritime research institute 6 38 1 shinkawa mitaka tokyo japan national maritime research institute 6 38 1 shinkawa mitaka tokyo japan a new approach for handling body motion by combining the grid deformation and the overset grids methods is proposed the present approach can completely avoid the computational load of the dynamic overset grids method the regions where the overset relations are composed move with the body motion maintaining the geometrical relation to determine for the weight of the overset interpolation the present approach is applied to the cases with 2d single and multiple cylinders with motion the scaled jacobian before and after the grid deformation is examined the values of the scaled jacobian maintain at least 0 35 after the grid deformation and the velocity and vorticity contour lines are smoothly connected on the computational grids thus the effectiveness of the present approach is revealed additionally the verification using the computational grids with three different resolutions is performed on the case with the single cylinder the present method which combines the grid deformation and overset grids methods succeeds to reduce the cpu time approximately from 40 to 65 of the time using the dynamic overset grids method next the present approach is applied to the computation of the flow around a ship with an appendage including ship motion in regular head waves with a high reynolds number condition the present method reproduces the impact pressure when points on the hull surface enter the water and the difference in the peak values of the pressure at different positions the present method succeeds in reducing the cpu time to 40 of the case using the dynamic overset grids method at the case with the ship motions in the regular waves keywords grid deformation overset grids method rans 1 introduction the arbitrary lagrangian and eulerian ale method hirt and amsden 1972 is the primary way to compute fluid structure interactions including a body motion in general the body motions are accounted for by a grid deformation the computational grids are deformed using the spring analogy blom 2000 and additional torsional springs are examined for the two dimensional case in farhat et al 1998 and for the three dimensional case in degand and farhat 2002 leroyer and visonneau 2005 applied the spring analogy with additional torsional springs to the simulation of a self propelled fish like body the fish like body is deformed by the imposed form and the computational grids are deformed by the spring analogy with the additional torsional springs the body motion is fully solved based on the motion equations with the hydrodynamic forces schulz and kallinderis 1998 computed the flows around the cylinders including the vortex induced vibrations on the unstructured hybrid grids using a simple grid deformation method based on the distance from the cylinder center wang et al 2014 treated the cylinder displacement using the grid deformation based on the laplace related algorithm masud et al 2007 and the control parameter the deformation method was applied to the flow past two unequal sized circular cylinders while the upstream cylinder is stational condition han et al 2018 extended the approach to the two square cylinders while the downstream square is in the 2 dof condition ding et al 2013 computed the flow induced motions of the two circular cylinders using the dynamic mesh technique based on the moving grid technique and sliding interface approach sen et al 2017 developed the hybrid grid deformation method based on the inverse distance weighting and transfinite interpolations to get the compromise between the grid quality achieved and the computational effort required and applied to the flows around the rectangular cylinder with the flexible splitter plate and the flexible membranous hemisphere the ale method is the powerful tool to handle body motions even if the ale method has some limitation for the large displacements of body motions and could treat motions in most cases which are found in the engineering field recently the immersed boundary method peskin 1972 1977 has been applied to the computation of flows around moving bodies mittal and iaccarino 2005 yang et al applied the immersed boundary method to the flows around single and multiple cylinders with motion the immersed boundary method is quite flexible with respect to a body motion however new methods are needed to overcome these issues for application to flows with high reynolds number conditions the dynamic overset grids method is another approach to deal with moving boundaries the computational grids consist of an ensemble of an arbitrary number of independent grids and the variables are interpolated using the weight values which are determined by the geometrical relations of the independent grids on the overset grids method the overset grids method also can cope with complex geometries and treat many variations of the configurations in a shorter time on a design process just replacing the grid of the appendages and updating the overset information the computational grid that contains the bodies moves with the body motions and the weight for the overset interpolation is updated the suggar code noack 2005 is often utilized for the overset grids method and coupled as the dynamic overset grids method e g carrica et al 2007 mofidi et al 2018 li and carrica 2018 developed the approach to simulate the flows with an incompressible liquid and compressible bubbles extended on the overset grids method for the complex 3d geometry zhao and chen 2017 developed the coupled level set and volume of fluid on the moving overset grid system and simulated the interactions between the moving body and free surface the dynamic overset grids method has flexibility because the method is free from the limitation of grid deformation however the additional computational cost concerning for the update the overset relations is not negligible the method combining the ale and dynamic overset grids methods can be found in the previous researches hierholz and wagner 1998 computed the elastic deformation of the helicopter rotor by using the ale method coupling with fe analysis gamnitzer and wall 2016 computed the motion of the small cylinder with the deformable beam using the ale chimera method the prescribed motions of the small cylinder and the deformable beam are accounted for by the ale method and the rigid motions xiao et al 2016 applied the ale and dynamic over grids methods to the computations of the complex shapes which include the flexible airfoils and the dragonfly model the prescribed deformations of the flexible airfoils and the wings of the dragonfly model are accounted for by the grid deformation freitas and runnels 1999 computed the flows around the two dimensional rectangular cylinder using the patched overset grids miller et al 2014 tested the pure ale method and the combination of the ale and overset grids methods the mesh qualities are examined and the averaged wall time is compared the additional computational cost concerning the processes for the update of the weight value for the overset interpolation more or less exists even in the previous researches which are based on the combination of the ale and overset grids methods a new approach for handling body motion by combining the grid deformation and the overset grids methods is proposed the present approach has the best of the both methods the ale deformation and overset grids methods and can completely avoid the computational load of the dynamic overset grids method the region where the overset relations are composed deforms with body motion to maintain the geometrical relation for the weight of the overset interpolation then the amount of deformation decreases based on the function using the distances from the body surfaces finally the amount becomes zero inside of the computational domain therefore the weight for the overset interpolation at the initial computational grids can be used even in the case where the grids deform with body motion the additional computational load caused by the dynamic overset grids method can be completely ignored in the present approach the present approach with the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans solver is examined for several test cases first the present approach is examined for the case of a two dimensional 2d single cylinder with motion at a low reynolds number with laminar flow additionally the order of the taylor expansion for the velocity which is derived from the motion equation is examined next the computation of 2d multiple cylinders with motion using the present approach is performed the 17 computational grids overlap and the present method combining the grid deformation and overset grids is examined finally the present approach is applied to the flows around a ship with motion in regular head waves the computational grids are deformed in the three dimensional directions while maintaining the region where the overset relations are composed the amplitudes of the ship motion and the added resistance caused by the incoming waves and ship motions are compared with the measured results additionally a comparison of the time history of the pressure on the hull surface is performed 2 computational method 2 1 base solver the governing equations are the 3d rans equations for

accurate a temporal step is discretized by a second order two step backward scheme and a pseudo time step is discretized by the first order euler implicit scheme the grid velocities are derived from the volume where an each cell face sweeps in the second order accuracy which is same accuracy as the physical time discretization the linear equation system is solved by the symmetric gauss seidel method a multigrid method and local time step are employed to achieve fast convergence for free surface treatment an interface capturing method with a single phase level set approach is employed incoming regular head sea waves are generated at the region inside of the computational domain ohashi et al 2019 body motions are obtained by solving the equations of motion and shown in a later section and motions are taken into account by a moving grid technique with the grid deforming methodology the boundary condition on a body is given as the velocities of the body motion 2 2 overset grids method the weight values for the overset grid interpolation are determined by an in house system kobayashi and kodama 2016 details about the system can be found on kobayashi and kodama 2016 and major steps are described using the typical example of the airfoil case step 1 two layers of cells on a higher priority grid and that face the outer boundary are set as receptor cells to satisfy the third order discretization of the ns solver the top of fig 1 and the basis function of the ferguson spline interpolation is constructed step 2 hole cutting is carried out the cells of a higher priority grid that are inside of a body in other grids are identified as shown at the top of fig 1 called the in wall cell herein the cells of a lower priority grid while are inside of a body are also identified in the middle of fig 1 additionally two layers of cells that neighbor the in wall cells are set as receptor cells to satisfy the third order discretization of the ns solver cells of a lower priority grid which are inside the domain of a higher priority grid are set as the receptor cells the bottom of fig 1 the donor cell for the receptor cell p t a r g e t in fig 2 is sought at the local spline coordinate ξ η step 3 the weight values for the overset interpolation are then determined via ferguson spline interpolation the flow variables of the receptor cell are updated when the boundary condition is set the overset grids method is extended to the dynamic overset grids method by implementing the overset program as the numerical library to the ns solver schematic diagram for a dynamic overset approach is shown in fig 3 the overset information is updated at the beginning of each temporal step after the computational grid is transformed with the motions the additional computational cost concerning for the processes of the dynamic overset grids method cannot be negligible a new approach combining the grid deformation and the overset grids methods which is able to pass the

approximated as h n 1 h n δ t then the eq 6 becomes 7 h n 1 h n δ t h n 1 1 2 h n 1 h n δ t the accuracy of eq 7 is examined in the case of a single cylinder in a later section the displacement of a predictor step is calculated using the third order adams bashforth scheme and in a strong coupling which means that the displacement is updated in pseudo time steps the displacement is calculated using the third order adams moulton scheme ohashi et al 2019 2 4 combined grid deformation and overset grids methods the body motions are accounted for by the grid deformation method the computational grids at a set amount of distance from the body surface are deformed with the body motions then the deformation becomes zero as a function of the power of the s i n function fig 4 shows the regions for the grid deformation the region where the overset relations are composed moves with the body motions to maintain the geometric relation to determine the weight of the overset interpolation and to avoid the use of the dynamic overset grids method fig 3 consequently the additional computational load which arises from the use of the dynamic overset grids method can be ignored in the present approach the outer regions which are outside of the regions where the overset relation are composed deform with decreasing amount of deformation d f based on the power of the s i n function using the distance d from the region where the computational grids move with the body motions and the distance d 0 in fig 4 then the amount of deformation becomes zero at the boundary of the region as following equation 8 d f s i n 2 π 2 d d 0 d 0 3 computational results the present method is applied to computation of the flow around single and multiple two dimensional cylinders yang et al 2008 at a low reynolds number laminar flow as well as a flow around a ship at high reynolds number with a ship motion in regular head waves and the results are examined the motion equation for the case with the cylinder is given as follows 9 h 2 ζ 2 π u h 2 π u 2 h 2 π m c f o r c e where h is the displacement in each direction ζ is the dumping coefficient and m is the mass ratio which is defined as follows 10 m m m f m ρ 0 π d 2 4 l c where d is the diameter of the cylinder and l c is the height of the cylinder u u 0 f n d is the reduced velocity with f n being the natural frequency c f o r c e f f o r c e 1 2 ρ d l c u 0 2 is non dimensionalized hydrodynamic force 3 1 single cylinder case first computation of the motions of a 2d single cylinder in laminar flow using the overset grids method where the cylinder and rectangular grids overlap is performed and the time history of the cylinder motion at the cylinder center is compared with the reference result yang et al 2008 the mass ratio m is 1 07 u is set as 5 0 the reynolds number is r 200 and the dumping coefficient is ζ 0 01 the temporal time step δ t is 0 01 the top of fig 5 shows the global view of the computational grids and the middle shows grids near the cylinder the bottom of fig 5 shows the weight values for the grid deformations and scaled jacobian knupp 2003 table 1 shows the division number of computational grids in each direction the domain of the rectangular grid is set as 10 0 x d 30 0 and 10 0 y d 10 0 the grid points of the rectangular grid near the cylinder where the center of the cylinder is x d and y d 0 0 are gathered to fit the cylinder grid for the overset grids interpolation the division number of the longitudinal direction im is changed from 85 to 171 and the division number of the lateral direction jm is varied from 65 to 133 with the ratio approximately 2 to apply the uncertainty analysis wilson et al 2001 xing and stern 2010 the division number of the cylinder surface im are varied from 113 to 225 the distance from the cylinder surface to the boundary of the grids is 0 25d for the cylinder grid divided into 28 40 56 cells on the three grids and the minimum spacing on the surface is 1 0 1 0 4 the grid points within the distance 1 0d from the cylinder surface deform with the displacement of the cylinder motions consequently the weight value is 1 0 in this region then the amount of the deformation decreases based on the s i n function using the distance from the body surface therefore the weight values decrease in accordance with the amount of deformation finally the weight values become zero to follow the original grid lines the scaled jacobian is maintained the value which is greater than 0 8 in the initial grids fig 6 shows the weight values and scaled jacobian of the coarse medium and fine grids after the grid deformation the grid lines within the distance 1 0d from the cylinder surface move with the cylinder motion then the lines away from the cylinder are distorted due to the deformation control although the values of the scaled jacobian drop from those of the initial grids the values maintain at least 0 35 fig 7 shows the axial velocity distribution near the moving cylinder of the medium grid flow variables are interpolated at the overlap region using the weight values of the initial grids and the velocity contour lines are connected smoothly in the two grids which are separated by a red line in the figure thus the present approach combining the overset grids and grid deformation methods works well the flow has a feature such that the flow separation occurs periodically just behind the cylinder fig 8 shows the time history of the cylinder motion at the cylinder center of the three grids g 3 g 2 g 1 the present results draw a figure eight and the displacements are quite similar with the reference result yang et al 2008 the difference between the 1st and 2nd orders in eq 7 is small thus the order of eq 7 is determined to be the 1st order hereafter the verification based on the generalized richardson extrapolation methods wilson et al 2001 xing and stern 2010 are performed using the three grids g 3 g 2 and g 1 the displacement of x d x and y d y directions of the cylinder motion at the maximum y position circles in fig 8 are analyzed in table 2 the solution changes ϵ 32 and ϵ 21 are relatively small and the uncertainty u g f s based on the method xing and stern 2010 is resulted approximately 0 2 of the solutions of the fine grid in this case fig 9 shows the comparison of the cpu time consuming on the major processes at the one temporal step the present method which combines the grid deformation and overset grids methods can skip the all processes which are concerned with the steps of the dynamic overset grids method fig 3 therefore the computational load can be reduced to approximately 65 of the case using the dynamic overset grids method because the load of the dynamic overset grids method comprises approximately 60 of the time consumption of the base solver blue bars in fig 9 3 2 case with multiple cylinders next the computation of flows around 2d multiple cylinders with motion is performed sixteen cylinders and the rectangular grids are overlapped the motions of each cylinder are obtained by solving the motion equations individually the mass ratio m is 12 73 and u is set as 5 0 the reynolds number based on the average flow velocity at the inflow boundary and the diameter of the cylinder is r 200 and the dumping coefficient is ζ 0 03 fig 10 shows the arrangement of the cylinders and the cyclic condition is imposed on the boundary of the rectangular grid the three grid sets the coarse grid g 3 the medium grid g 2 the fine grid g 1 are utilized and table 3 shows the division number of computational grids in each direction the grid for the cylinders is the same as the case for the single cylinder the domain of the rectangular grids are set as 14 0 x d 14 0 and 14 0 y d 14 0 and equally divided in both directions the top of fig 11 shows the initial computational grids and the weight values for grid deformation and the bottom shows the grids and weight value near the left corner cylinder the grid points within the distance of 0 3d from the cylinder surface deform with cylinder motions including the region where the overset relations are composed therefore the weight values in this region are 1 0 then the amount of deformation decreases with the decay of the weight values finally the weight value becomes zero at the distance 0 9d from the cylinder surface to resume the original grid lines the top of fig 12 shows the grids and weight values after the grid deformation and the middle shows the grids and weight values near the left corner cylinder the bottom of and fig 12 shows scaled jacobian near the left corner cylinder the weight values within the distance 0 3d from the cylinder surfaces maintain the initial value 1 0 and the grid lines move with the cylinder motions the scaled jacobian is maintained the value which is greater than 0 8 and the value of the scaled jacobian improves with the increase of the grid resolution fig 13 shows the vorticity distribution of the medium grid in the plane the vortices which come from the flow separations on the cylinder surfaces interact with the other vortices and cylinders and the vortices affect the cylinder motions the vorticity contour lines connect smoothly in all grids thus the present approach also works well for the case of multiple cylinders with motions fig 14 shows the trajectories of the center of each cylinder the cylinders move individually based on their own motion equations fig 15 shows the trajectory of the left corner cylinder in fig 14 the trajectories of the three grids show similar motions in particular the difference between the medium and fine grids is slightly small fig 16 shows the comparison of the cpu time consuming on the major processes at the one temporal step for the multiple cylinder case the processes which are concerned with the steps of the overset grids method fig 3 consume more than 60 of the total cpu time therefore the present method which can pass the steps which are related to the overset grids method succeeds in reducing the computational time to 40 of the case using the dynamic overset grids method 3 3 ship with motion in regular head waves the present approach is applied to the computation of the high reynolds number flows around a ship equipped with a rudder and navigating with dynamic motions in regular head waves the flow variables as well as the level set function for the free surface treatment and the kinematic eddy viscosity the turbulence kinetic energy and the specific dissipation rate of the k ω sst turbulence model are interpolated in the region where the overset relations are composed a previously utilized hull form tsujimoto et al 2017 is selected the model ship length l is l 7 0 m and the wave length ratio of the incoming wave is λ l 0 4 and 1 1 the wave height ratio is h l 0 0107 and 0 0143 the reynolds number is r 7 46 1 0 6 the froude number is 0 14 and the temporal time step δ t is 0 005 table 4 shows the division number of computational grids in each direction and fig 17 shows the global view of the grids and the grids near the aft part of the hull the computational grids consist of the rudder grid the refined rectangular grid to resolve flows behind the ship hull the ship hull and rectangular grids im means the spanwise direction jm is the chord direction and km is the division number in the normal direction from the rudder surface for the rudder grid for the rectangular grids im means the ship length direction jm is the width direction and km is the division number in the direction along the depth for the ship hull grid im means the ship length direction jm is the girth direction and km is the division number in the normal direction from the hull surface the wall function ohashi and hino 2012 is applied to the body surfaces the two rectangular grids are chosen in accordance with the wave length the grids are tabled in the order of priority of the overset grid method in table 4 im is determined to resolve the incoming wave length with at least 50 divisions over one wave length the rectangular grid for the shorter wave length λ l 0 4 has a division number im 337 to resolve the short wave length the division number im decreases with the wave length at λ l 1 1 the grids except for the rectangular grids are maintained and the overset information is generated by replacing the rectangular grids the boundary conditions on the rectangular grid are also shown in fig 17 the ship is free to heave and pitch motions the motion equations of the heave and pitch are solved similarly to that in section 2 3 except that the dumping and spring terms are eliminated based on the experimental conditions the non dimensionalized mass m ρ l 3 is 8 42 1 0 3 and the inertia i 5 262 1 0 4 fig 18 shows the weight values for the grid deformation on the global view and the slice at the midship of the ship hull the weight values change in the three dimensional directions in this case the weight values within the distance 0 6 l from the body surfaces including the region where the overset relations are composed is 1 0 which means that the grid points deform with the ship motion the weight values decrease in accordance with the distance from the body surface then the weight values become zero at the distance 0 9 l from the body surface in the x y z directions fig 19 shows the free surface which refers to the zero level set function around the body surfaces including the incoming waves at wave height h l 0 0143 the contours based on the height from the water plane z 0 smoothly connect in the rectangular and hull grids and the disturbed waves caused by the interaction between the incoming waves and the ship hull are propagated behind the ship consequently the level set functions are correctly interpolated by the present approach combining the grid deformation and overset grids methods fig 20 shows a comparison of the added resistance coefficient at wave height h l 0 0107 the added resistance coefficient is introduced by subtracting the resistance associated with a calm water condition from the resistance in waves in other words the added resistance coefficient indicates an increase in resistance from the calm water condition the added resistance coefficient is non dimensionalized by 4 ρ g ζ 2 b 2 l where ζ is the wave height which is obtained by the fourier analysis for the time history of the wave height and b is the beam length of the ship the present results are in good agreement with the measured results fig 21 shows comparisons of the amplitudes of the motions at wave height h l 0 0107 the amplitudes of the motions are also obtained by the fourier analysis of the time history of the motions and the amplitudes of the 1st harmonic component are compared with the measured results the heave amplitude is non dimensionalized by the wave height ζ and the pitch amplitude is non dimensionalized by k ζ where k is the wave number although the amplitudes of the motions are smaller than the measured result at λ l 1 1 the present results capture basic aspects in which the amplitudes of the motions at λ l 1 1 become large while the amplitudes at λ l 0 4 are relatively small because of the short wave length finally the time history of the pressure on the hull surface at wave height h l 0 0143 are analyzed in fig 23 the positions of the pressure measurement are depicted in fig 22 the point p 1 is x l 0 4875 and z l 0 01339 and the point p 2 is x l 0 4875 and z l 0 02678 where x l 0 is the midship of the hull and z l 0 is the static water plane the two points p 1 and p 2 have the same x l position and only the height is different once point p 1 enters the water the impact pressure arises instantaneously the pressure at p 2 also arises instantaneously and the increase in the amount of pressure is relatively smaller than the increase at point p 1 because p 2 is in the higher position with respect to the z coordinate than p 1 then the pressure at both p 1 and p 2 decreases in a short time when the two positions leave the water the time history of the pressure of the experiment decreases slowly in contrast to the computation although the reason for this difference is not clear it seems that air flow plays a certain role on the water films which remain on the pressure sensor during the experiment additionally the pressures of the two positions could not return to the zero level in the experiment it appears that the temperature correction of the pressure sensor disturbed the measured value either way the present result traces the aspects of the time history of the pressure on the hull surface and the difference in the peak value of the pressure caused by the position fig 24 shows the comparison of the cpu time consuming on the major processes at the one temporal step the processes which are concerned with the dynamic overset grids method fig 3 account for approximately 70 of the total elapsed time thus the present approach which combines the grid deformation and overset grids methods succeeds in reducing the computational time to approximately 30 and has the great advantage over using of the dynamic overset grids method 4 conclusions a new approach for handling body motion by combining the grid deformation and overset grids methods to avoid computational load resulting from the dynamic overset grids method is developed the structured urans solver with the overset grids method is utilized and the body motions are obtained by solving the motion equations the regions where the overset relations are composed deform with the body motions to maintain the geometric relation to determine the weight of the overset interpolation so that the weight value of the initial computational grids can be used completely avoiding the use of the dynamic overset grids method then the amount of grid deformation decreases with the distance from the solid surface that is used for the motion equation first the present approach is examined for the case with a 2d single cylinder with a motion using the cylinder and rectangular grids for the overset grids method and the division number of the grids are varied to perform the uncertainty analysis the reynolds number is 200 with laminar flow the amount of grid deformation varied with the distance from the cylinder surface maintaining the geometric relation for the overset interpolation the scaled jacobian is examined on the initial and deformed grids although the values of the scaled jacobian drop comparing with the initial grids the values maintain at least 0 35 consequently the velocity contour line are smoothly connected on the two computational grids the trajectory of the motion of the single cylinder is compared with the reference result and the present result is quite similar with the reference data additionally the order of the taylor expansion for the velocity which is derived from the motion equation was examined the difference in the trajectory caused by the order of the taylor expansion is relatively small consequently the order of the taylor expansion for the velocity of the motion is selected to be the first order the verification concerning the displacement of the cylinder motions are performed the solution changes are relatively small based on the present three grids and uncertainty is resulted approximately 0 2 of the solutions of the fine grid the present method which combines the grid deformation and overset grids methods succeeds to reduce the cpu time approximately 35 of the time using the dynamic overset grids method second the present approach is tested for the case with 2d multiple cylinders with motion similar to the case of the single cylinder the reynolds number is 200 with laminar flow the seventeen computational grids overlapped and the amount of grid deformation is defined on each cylinder maintaining the overset relation the division numbers of the computational grids are also changed to examine the effect of the grid resolution the motions of the cylinders are obtained by solving the individual motion equations and the motions are reflected in the ns equation using the grid velocities the vortices which come from the flow separation on the cylinder surface interacted with the other vortices and cylinders and the vortices affected the cylinder motion the values of the scaled jacobian on the deformed grids are maintained the value which is greater than 0 8 therefore the vorticity contour lines connected smoothly in all computational grids the cpu time is examined on the 2d multiple cylinder case and the present method reduce computational time to 40 of the case using the dynamic overset grids method finally the present approach is applied to computation of the flow around a ship an appendage including the ship motion in regular head waves under the high reynolds number conditions the single phase level set approach is employed for the free surface treatment the four computational grids overlapped and the level set function and two variables of the turbulence model in addition to the flow variable are interpolated using the overset grids method the grids are deformed with the ship motion maintaining the overset relation the amount of grid deformation varied with the distance from the body surfaces in the 3d directions the free surface which is derived from the zero value of the level set function is visualized and the free surface is found to be smoothly connected on the rectangular and hull grids and the disturbed waves caused by the interaction between the incoming waves and the ship hull propagated behind the ship the added resistance coefficient which reflects an increase in the resistance from the calm water condition because of the incoming waves and the ship motions are compared with experimental data and the present results show agreement with the measured results the time history of the pressure on the hull surface is obtained and compared with the measured result although the experimental data has a few problems regarding measurement the present method reproduces aspects that include the impact pressure when the points on the hull surface enter the water and the difference in the peak value of the pressure which comes from the difference in the heights of the measurement positions the present method succeeds in reducing the cpu time to 40 of the case using the dynamic overset grids method credit authorship contribution

case using the dynamic overset grids method at the case with the ship motions in the regular waves keywords grid deformation overset grids method rans 1 introduction the arbitrary lagrangian and eulerian ale method hirt and amsden 1972 is the primary way to compute fluid structure interactions including a body motion in general the body motions are accounted for by a grid deformation the computational grids are deformed using the spring analogy blom 2000 and additional torsional springs are examined for the two dimensional case in farhat et al 1998 and for the three dimensional case in degand and farhat 2002 leroyer and visonneau 2005 applied the spring analogy with additional torsional springs to the simulation of a self propelled fish like body the fish like body is deformed by the imposed form and the computational grids are deformed by the spring analogy with the additional torsional springs the body motion is fully solved based on the motion equations with the hydrodynamic forces schulz and kallinderis 1998 computed the flows around the cylinders including the vortex induced vibrations on the unstructured hybrid grids using a simple grid deformation method based on the distance from the cylinder center wang et al 2014 treated the cylinder displacement using the grid deformation based on the laplace related algorithm masud et al 2007 and the control parameter the deformation method was applied to the flow past two unequal sized circular cylinders while the upstream cylinder is stational condition han et al 2018 extended the approach to the two square cylinders while the downstream square is in the 2 dof condition ding et al 2013 computed the flow induced motions of the two circular cylinders using the dynamic mesh technique based on the moving grid technique and sliding interface approach sen et al 2017 developed the hybrid grid deformation method based on the inverse distance weighting and transfinite interpolations to get the compromise between the grid quality achieved and the computational effort required and applied to the flows around the rectangular cylinder with the flexible splitter plate and the flexible membranous hemisphere the ale method is the powerful tool to handle body motions even if the ale method has some limitation for the large displacements of body motions and could treat motions in most cases which are found in the engineering field recently the immersed boundary method peskin 1972 1977 has been applied to the computation of flows around moving bodies mittal and iaccarino 2005 yang et al applied the immersed boundary method to the flows around single and multiple cylinders with motion the immersed boundary method is quite flexible with respect to a body motion however new methods are needed to overcome these issues for application to flows with high reynolds number conditions the dynamic overset grids method is another approach to deal with moving boundaries the computational grids consist of an ensemble of an arbitrary number of independent grids and the variables are interpolated using the weight values which are determined by the geometrical relations of the independent grids on the overset grids method the overset grids method also can cope with complex geometries and treat many variations of the configurations in a shorter time on a design process just replacing the grid of the appendages and updating the overset information the computational grid that contains the bodies moves with the body motions and the weight for the overset interpolation is updated the suggar code noack 2005 is often utilized for the overset grids method and coupled as the dynamic overset grids method e g carrica et al 2007 mofidi et al 2018 li and carrica 2018 developed the approach to simulate the flows with an incompressible liquid and compressible bubbles extended on the overset grids method for the complex 3d geometry zhao and chen 2017 developed the coupled level set and volume of fluid on the moving overset grid system and simulated the interactions between the moving body and free surface the dynamic overset grids method has flexibility because the method is free from the limitation of grid deformation however the additional computational cost concerning for the update the overset relations is not negligible the method combining the ale and dynamic overset grids methods can be found in the previous researches hierholz and wagner 1998 computed the elastic deformation of the helicopter rotor by using the ale method coupling with fe analysis gamnitzer and wall 2016 computed the motion of the small cylinder with the deformable beam using the ale chimera method the prescribed motions of the small cylinder and the deformable beam are accounted for by the ale method and the rigid motions xiao et al 2016 applied the ale and dynamic over grids methods to the computations of the complex shapes which include the flexible airfoils and the dragonfly model the prescribed deformations of the flexible airfoils and the wings of the dragonfly model are accounted for by the grid deformation freitas and runnels 1999 computed the flows around the two dimensional rectangular cylinder using the patched overset grids miller et al 2014 tested the pure ale method and the combination of the ale and overset grids methods the mesh qualities are examined and the averaged wall time is compared the additional computational cost concerning the processes for the update of the weight value for the overset interpolation more or less exists even in the previous researches which are based on the combination of the ale and overset grids methods a new approach for handling body motion by combining the grid deformation and the overset grids methods is proposed the present approach has the best of the both methods the ale deformation and overset grids methods and can completely avoid the computational load of the dynamic overset grids method the region where the overset relations are composed deforms with body motion to maintain the geometrical relation for the weight of the overset interpolation then the amount of deformation decreases based on the function using the distances from the body surfaces finally the amount becomes zero inside of the computational domain therefore the weight for the overset interpolation at the initial computational grids can be used even in the case where the grids deform with body motion the additional computational load caused by the dynamic overset grids method can be completely ignored in the present approach the present approach with the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans solver is examined for several test cases first the present approach is examined for the case of a two dimensional 2d single cylinder with motion at a low reynolds number with laminar flow additionally the order of the taylor expansion for the velocity which is derived from the motion equation is examined next the computation of 2d multiple cylinders with motion using the present approach is performed the 17 computational grids overlap and the present method combining the grid deformation and overset grids is examined finally the present approach is applied to the flows around a ship with motion in regular head waves the computational grids are deformed in the three dimensional directions while maintaining the region where the overset relations are composed the amplitudes of the ship motion and the added resistance caused by the incoming waves and ship motions are compared with the measured results

incoming regular head sea waves are generated at the region inside of the computational domain ohashi et al 2019 body motions are obtained by solving the equations of motion and shown in a later section and motions are taken into account by a moving grid technique with the grid deforming methodology the boundary condition on a body is given as the velocities of the body motion 2 2 overset grids method the weight values for the overset grid interpolation are determined by an in house system kobayashi and kodama 2016 details about the system can be found on kobayashi and kodama 2016 and major steps are described using the typical example of the airfoil case step 1 two layers of cells on a higher priority grid and that face the outer boundary are set as receptor cells to satisfy the third order discretization of the ns solver the top of fig 1 and the basis function of the ferguson spline interpolation is constructed step 2 hole cutting is carried out the cells of a higher priority grid that are inside of a body in other grids are identified as shown at the top of fig 1 called the in wall cell herein the cells of a lower priority grid while are inside of a body are also identified in the middle of fig 1 additionally two layers of cells that neighbor the in wall cells are set as receptor cells to satisfy the third order discretization of the ns solver cells of a lower

overset approach is shown in fig 3 the overset information is updated at the beginning of each temporal step after the computational grid is transformed with the motions the additional computational cost concerning for the processes of the dynamic overset grids method cannot be negligible a new approach combining the grid deformation and the overset grids methods which is able to pass the processes of the dynamic overset grids method is introduced in the later section 2 3 body motion the body motions are obtained by solving the motion equations the general form of motion equation is given as follows 5 h c h k h c f o r c e m where h is the displacement c is the damping coefficient k is the constant of proportionality c f o r c e is the hydrodynamic force and m is the mass of the system rotational motions are also obtained by solving the equation replacing the mass of the system m with the moments of inertia i and c f o r c e with the hydrodynamic moment the acceleration of motion is computed using eq 5 and the velocity of motion is obtained based on the taylor expansion up to the second order as follows 6 h n 1 h n δ t h n 1 1 2 d h d t δ t 2 where d h d t is approximated as h n 1 h n δ t then the eq 6 becomes 7 h n 1 h n δ t h n 1 1 2 h n 1 h n δ t the accuracy of eq 7 is examined in the case of a single cylinder in a later section the displacement of a predictor step is calculated using the third order adams bashforth scheme and in a strong coupling which means that the displacement is updated in pseudo time steps the displacement is calculated using the third order adams moulton scheme ohashi et al 2019 2 4 combined grid deformation and overset grids methods the body motions are accounted for by the grid deformation method the computational grids at a set amount of distance from the body surface are deformed with the body motions then the deformation becomes zero as a function of the power of the s i n function fig 4 shows the regions for the grid deformation the region where the overset relations are composed moves with the body motions to maintain the geometric relation to determine the weight of the overset interpolation and to avoid the use of the dynamic overset grids method fig 3 consequently the additional computational load which arises from the use of the dynamic overset grids method can be ignored in the present approach the outer regions which are outside of the regions where the overset relation are composed deform with decreasing amount of deformation d f based on the power of the s i n function using the distance d from the region where the computational grids move with the body motions and the distance d 0 in fig 4 then the amount of deformation becomes zero at the boundary of the region as following equation 8 d f s i n 2 π 2 d d 0 d 0 3 computational results the present method is applied to computation of the flow around single and multiple two dimensional cylinders yang et al 2008 at a low reynolds number laminar flow as well as a flow around a ship at high reynolds number with a ship motion in regular head waves and the results are examined the motion equation for the case with the cylinder is given as follows 9 h 2 ζ 2 π u h 2 π u 2 h 2 π m c f o r c e where h is the displacement in each direction ζ is the dumping coefficient and m is the mass ratio which is defined as follows 10 m m m f m ρ 0 π d 2 4 l c where d is the diameter of the cylinder and l c is the height of the cylinder u u 0 f n d is the reduced velocity with f n being the natural frequency c f o r c e f f o r c e 1 2 ρ d l c u 0 2 is non dimensionalized hydrodynamic force 3 1 single cylinder case first computation of the motions of a 2d single cylinder in laminar flow using the overset grids method where the cylinder and rectangular grids overlap is performed and the time history of the cylinder motion at the cylinder center is compared with the reference result yang et al 2008 the mass ratio m is 1 07 u is set as 5 0 the reynolds number is r 200 and the dumping coefficient is ζ 0 01 the temporal time step δ t is 0 01 the top of fig 5 shows the global view of the computational grids and the middle shows grids near the cylinder the bottom of fig 5 shows the weight values for the grid deformations and scaled jacobian knupp 2003 table 1 shows the division number of computational grids in each direction the domain of the rectangular grid is set as 10 0 x d 30 0 and 10 0 y d 10 0 the grid points of the rectangular grid near the cylinder where the center of the cylinder is x d and y d 0 0 are gathered to fit the cylinder grid for the overset grids interpolation the division number of the longitudinal direction im is changed from 85 to 171 and the division number of the lateral direction jm is varied from 65 to 133 with the ratio approximately 2 to apply the uncertainty analysis wilson et al 2001 xing and stern 2010 the division number of the cylinder surface im are varied from 113 to 225 the distance from the cylinder surface to the boundary of the grids is 0 25d for the cylinder grid divided into 28 40 56 cells on the three grids and the minimum spacing on the surface is 1 0 1 0 4 the grid points within the distance 1 0d from the cylinder surface deform with the displacement of the cylinder motions consequently the weight value is 1 0 in this region then the amount of the deformation decreases based on the s i n function using the distance from the body surface therefore the weight values decrease in accordance with the amount of deformation finally the weight values become zero to follow the original grid lines the scaled jacobian is maintained the value which is greater than 0 8 in the initial grids fig 6 shows the weight values and scaled jacobian of the coarse medium and fine grids after the grid deformation the grid lines within the distance 1 0d from the cylinder surface move with the cylinder motion then the lines away from the cylinder are distorted due to the deformation control although the values of the scaled jacobian drop from those of the initial grids the values maintain at least 0 35 fig 7 shows the axial velocity distribution near the moving cylinder of the medium grid flow variables are interpolated at the overlap region using the weight values of the initial grids and the velocity contour lines are connected smoothly in the two grids which are separated by a red line in the figure thus the present approach combining the overset grids and grid deformation methods works well the flow has a feature such that the flow separation occurs periodically just behind the cylinder fig 8 shows the time history of the cylinder motion at the cylinder center of the three grids g 3 g 2 g 1 the present results draw a figure eight and the displacements are quite similar with the reference result yang et al 2008 the difference between the 1st and 2nd orders in eq 7 is small thus the order of eq 7 is determined to be the 1st order hereafter the verification based on the generalized richardson extrapolation methods wilson et al 2001 xing and stern 2010 are performed using the three grids g 3 g 2 and g 1 the displacement of x d x and y d y directions of the cylinder motion at the maximum y position circles in fig 8 are analyzed in table 2 the solution changes ϵ 32 and ϵ 21 are relatively small and the uncertainty u g f s based on the method xing and stern 2010 is resulted approximately 0 2 of the solutions of the fine grid in this case fig 9 shows the comparison of the cpu time consuming on the major processes at the one temporal step the present method which combines the grid deformation and overset grids methods can skip the all processes which are concerned with the steps of the dynamic overset grids method fig 3 therefore the computational load can be reduced to approximately 65 of the case using the dynamic overset grids method because the load of the dynamic overset grids method comprises approximately 60 of the time consumption of the base solver blue bars in fig 9 3 2 case with multiple cylinders next the computation of flows around 2d multiple cylinders with motion is performed sixteen cylinders and the rectangular grids are overlapped the motions of each cylinder are obtained by solving the motion equations individually the mass ratio m is 12 73 and u is set as 5 0 the reynolds number based on the average flow velocity at the inflow boundary and the diameter of the cylinder is r 200 and the dumping coefficient is ζ 0 03 fig 10 shows the arrangement of the cylinders and the cyclic condition is imposed on the boundary of the rectangular grid the three grid sets the coarse grid g 3 the medium grid g 2 the fine grid g 1 are utilized and table 3 shows the division number of computational grids in each direction the grid for the cylinders is the same as the case for the single cylinder the domain of the rectangular grids are set as 14 0 x d 14 0 and 14 0 y d 14 0 and equally divided in both directions the top of fig 11 shows the initial computational grids and the weight values for grid deformation and the bottom shows the grids and weight value near the left corner cylinder the grid points within the distance of 0 3d from the cylinder surface deform with cylinder motions including the region where the overset relations are composed therefore the weight values in this region are 1 0 then the amount of deformation decreases with the decay of the weight values finally the weight value becomes zero at the distance 0 9d from the cylinder surface to resume the original grid lines the top of fig 12 shows the grids and weight values after the grid deformation and the middle shows the grids and weight values near the left corner cylinder the bottom of and fig 12 shows scaled jacobian near the left corner cylinder the weight values within the distance 0 3d from the cylinder surfaces maintain the initial value 1 0 and the grid lines move with the cylinder motions the scaled jacobian is maintained the value which is greater than 0 8 and the value of the scaled jacobian improves with the increase of the grid resolution fig 13 shows the vorticity distribution of the medium grid in the plane the vortices which come from the flow separations on the cylinder surfaces interact with the other vortices and cylinders and the vortices affect the cylinder motions the vorticity contour lines connect smoothly in all grids thus the present approach also works well for the case of multiple cylinders with motions fig 14 shows the trajectories of the center of each cylinder the cylinders move individually based on their own motion equations fig 15 shows the trajectory of the left corner cylinder in fig 14 the trajectories of the three grids show similar motions in particular the difference between the medium and fine grids is slightly small fig 16 shows the comparison of the cpu time consuming on the major processes at the one temporal step for the multiple cylinder case the processes which are concerned with the steps of the overset grids method fig 3 consume more than 60 of the total cpu time therefore the present method which can pass the steps which are related to the overset grids method succeeds in reducing the computational time to 40 of the case using the dynamic overset grids method 3 3 ship with motion in regular head waves the present approach is applied to the computation of the high reynolds number flows around a ship equipped with a rudder and navigating with dynamic motions in regular head waves the flow variables as well as the level set function for the free surface treatment and the kinematic eddy viscosity the turbulence kinetic energy and the specific dissipation rate of the k ω sst turbulence model are interpolated in the region where the overset relations are composed a previously utilized hull form tsujimoto et al 2017 is selected the model ship length l is l 7 0 m and the wave length ratio of the incoming wave is λ l 0 4 and 1 1 the wave height ratio is h l 0 0107 and 0 0143 the reynolds number is r 7 46 1 0 6 the froude number is 0 14 and the temporal time step δ t is 0 005 table 4 shows the division number of computational grids in each direction and fig 17 shows the global view of the grids and the grids near the aft part of the hull the computational grids consist of the rudder grid the refined rectangular grid to resolve flows behind the ship hull the ship hull and rectangular grids im means the spanwise direction jm is the chord direction and km is the division number in the normal direction from the rudder surface for the rudder grid for the rectangular grids im means the ship length direction jm is the width direction and km is the division number in the direction along the depth for the ship hull grid im means the ship length direction jm is the girth direction and km is the division number in the normal direction from the hull surface the wall function ohashi and hino 2012 is applied to the body surfaces the two rectangular grids are chosen in accordance with the wave length the grids are tabled in the order of priority of the overset grid method in table 4 im is determined to resolve the incoming wave length with at least 50 divisions over one wave length the rectangular grid for the shorter wave length λ l 0 4 has a division number im 337 to resolve the short wave length the division number im decreases with the wave length at λ l 1 1 the grids except for the rectangular grids are maintained and the overset information is generated by replacing the rectangular grids the boundary conditions on the rectangular grid are also shown in fig 17 the ship is free to heave and pitch motions the motion equations of the heave and pitch are solved similarly to that in section 2 3 except that the dumping and spring terms are eliminated based on the experimental conditions the non dimensionalized mass m ρ l 3 is 8 42 1 0 3 and the inertia i 5 262 1 0 4 fig 18 shows the weight values for the grid deformation on the global view and the slice at the midship of the ship hull the weight values change in the three dimensional directions in this case the weight values within the distance 0 6 l from the body surfaces including the region where the overset relations are composed is 1 0 which means that the grid points deform with the ship motion the weight values decrease in accordance with the distance from the body surface then the weight values become zero at the distance 0 9 l from the body surface in the x y z directions fig 19 shows the free surface which refers to the zero level set function around the body surfaces including the incoming waves at wave height h l 0 0143 the contours based on the height from the water plane z 0 smoothly connect in the rectangular and hull grids and the disturbed waves caused by the interaction between the incoming waves and the ship hull are propagated behind the ship consequently the level set functions are correctly interpolated by the present approach combining the grid deformation and overset grids methods fig 20 shows a comparison of the added resistance coefficient at wave height h l 0 0107 the added resistance coefficient is introduced by subtracting the resistance associated with a calm water condition from the resistance in waves in other words the added resistance coefficient indicates an increase in resistance from the calm water condition the added resistance coefficient is non dimensionalized by 4 ρ g ζ 2 b 2 l where ζ is the wave height which is obtained by the fourier analysis for the time history of the wave height and b is the beam length of the ship the present results are in good agreement with the measured results fig 21 shows comparisons of the amplitudes of the motions at wave height h l 0 0107 the amplitudes of the motions are also obtained by the fourier analysis of the time history of the motions and the amplitudes of the 1st harmonic component are compared with the measured results the heave amplitude is non dimensionalized by the wave height ζ and the pitch amplitude is non dimensionalized by k ζ where k is the wave number although the amplitudes of the motions are smaller than the measured result at λ l 1 1 the present results capture basic aspects in which the amplitudes of the motions at λ l 1 1 become large while the amplitudes at λ l 0 4 are relatively small because of the short wave length finally the time history of the pressure on the hull surface at wave height h l 0 0143 are analyzed in fig 23 the positions of the pressure measurement are depicted in fig 22 the point p 1 is x l 0 4875 and z l 0 01339 and the point p 2 is x l 0 4875 and z l 0 02678 where x l 0 is the midship of the hull and z l 0 is the static water plane the two points p 1 and p 2 have the same x l position and only the height is different once point p 1 enters the water the impact pressure arises instantaneously the pressure at p 2 also arises instantaneously and the increase in the amount of pressure is relatively smaller than the increase at point p 1 because p 2 is in the higher position with respect to the z coordinate than p 1 then the pressure at both p 1 and p 2 decreases in a short time when the two positions leave the water the time history of the pressure of the experiment decreases slowly in contrast to the computation although the reason for this difference is not clear it seems that air flow plays a certain role on the water films which remain on the pressure sensor during the experiment additionally the pressures of the two positions could not return to the zero level in the experiment it appears that the temperature correction of the pressure sensor disturbed the measured value either way the present result traces the aspects of the time history of the pressure on the hull surface and the difference in the peak value of the pressure caused by the position fig 24 shows the comparison of the cpu time consuming on the major processes at the one temporal step the processes which are concerned with the dynamic overset grids method fig 3 account for approximately 70 of the total elapsed time thus the present approach which combines the grid deformation and overset grids methods succeeds in reducing the computational time to approximately 30 and has the great advantage over using of the dynamic overset grids method 4 conclusions a new approach for handling body motion by combining the grid deformation and overset grids methods to avoid computational load resulting from the dynamic overset grids method is developed the structured urans solver with the overset grids method is utilized and the body motions are obtained by solving the motion equations the regions where the overset relations are composed deform with the body motions to maintain the geometric relation to determine the weight of the overset interpolation so that the weight value of the initial computational grids can be used completely avoiding the use of the dynamic overset grids method then the amount of grid deformation decreases with the distance from the solid surface that is used for the motion equation first the present approach is examined for the case with a 2d single cylinder with a motion using the cylinder and rectangular grids for the overset grids method and the division number of the grids are varied to perform the uncertainty analysis the reynolds number is 200 with laminar flow the amount of grid deformation varied with the distance from the cylinder surface maintaining the geometric relation for the overset interpolation the scaled jacobian is examined on the initial and deformed grids although the values of the scaled jacobian drop comparing with the initial grids the values maintain at least 0 35 consequently the velocity contour line are smoothly connected on the two computational grids the trajectory of the motion of the single cylinder is compared with the reference result and the present result is quite similar with the reference data additionally the order of the taylor expansion for the velocity which is derived from the motion equation was examined the difference in the trajectory caused by the order of the taylor expansion is relatively small consequently the order of the taylor expansion for the velocity of the motion is selected to be the first order the verification concerning the displacement of the cylinder motions are performed the solution changes are relatively small based on the present three grids and uncertainty is resulted approximately 0 2 of the solutions of the fine grid the present method which combines the grid deformation and overset grids methods succeeds to reduce the cpu time approximately 35 of the time using the dynamic overset grids method second the present approach is tested for the case with 2d multiple cylinders with motion similar to the case of the single cylinder the reynolds number is 200 with laminar flow the seventeen computational grids overlapped and the amount of grid deformation is defined on each cylinder maintaining the overset relation the division numbers of the computational grids are also changed to examine the effect of the grid resolution the motions of the cylinders are obtained by solving the individual motion equations and the motions are reflected in the ns equation using the grid velocities the vortices which come from the flow separation on the cylinder surface interacted with the other vortices and cylinders and the vortices affected the cylinder motion the values of the scaled jacobian on the deformed grids are maintained the value which is greater than 0 8 therefore the vorticity contour lines connected smoothly in all computational grids the cpu time is examined on the 2d multiple cylinder case and the present method reduce computational time to 40 of the case using the dynamic overset grids method finally the present approach is applied to computation of the flow around a ship an appendage including the ship motion in regular head waves under the high reynolds number conditions the single phase level set approach is employed for the free surface treatment the four computational grids overlapped and the level set function and two variables of the turbulence model in addition to the flow variable are interpolated using the overset grids method the grids are deformed with the ship motion maintaining the overset relation the amount of grid deformation varied with the distance from the body surfaces in the 3d directions the free surface which is derived from the zero value of the level set function is visualized and the free surface is found to be smoothly connected on the rectangular and hull grids and the disturbed waves caused by the interaction between the incoming waves and the ship hull propagated behind the ship the added resistance coefficient which reflects an increase in the resistance from the calm water condition because of the incoming waves and the ship motions are compared with experimental data and the present results show agreement with the measured results the time history of the pressure on the hull surface is obtained and compared with the measured result although the experimental data has a few problems regarding measurement the present method reproduces aspects that include the impact pressure when the points on the hull surface enter the water and the difference in the peak value of the pressure which comes from the difference in the heights of the measurement positions the present method succeeds in reducing the cpu time to 40 of the case using the dynamic overset grids method credit authorship contribution

21669,biofouling of netting adversely impacts aquaculture operations and the structural safety of fish cages in this study the effects of the hydroids on the hydrodynamic performance of a plane net in waves were determined experimentally a series of plane nets with various levels of biofouling was obtained via field sampling from a fish farm the hydrodynamic force and motion response of both clean and biofouled nettings in waves were measured in a wave current tank the corresponding drag and inertia coefficients of the nettings were then calculated in the studied waves the wave force acting on the biofouled netting was as high as 3 88 times that acting on the clean netting the maximum amplitude of the horizontal motion for the most severely biofouled netting was 3 84 times that for the clean netting for various wave conditions the biofouled netting drag coefficients and inertia coefficients were 3 30 7 72 and 5 04 10 83 respectively the results indicated that netting biofouling by hydroids increases the drag force more substantially than it increases the inertial force keywords fish cage hydroid fouling wave force hydrodynamic coefficient laboratory experiment 1 introduction aquaculture is a globally important industry that provides essential food for a growing world population and has a vital role in providing protein to countries with inadequate food supplies currently fish cages are essential structures for offshore aquaculture the hydrodynamic characteristics of the fish cage are critical to ensuring its safe design in recent years many scholars have conducted systematic studies on the load and motion responses of fish cages in waves and currents balash et al 2009 bi et al 2014 cheng et al 2020 decew et al 2005 dong et al 2010 huang et al 2006 klebert et al 2013 liu et al 2019 qin et al 2020 tang et al 2017 tsukrov et al 2011 the characteristics of waves and flow fields inside and around fish cages have also been analyzed bi et al 2013 2015 chen and christensen 2017 klebert and su 2020 martin et al 2020 patursson et al 2010 studies have also focused on engineering analyses of the structural strength of fish cages drach et al 2016 kim et al 2014 and on determining the hydrodynamic characteristics of net type structures floating in breakwaters dong et al 2008 guo et al 2020 an offshore fish cage especially its net structure is vulnerable to fouling by marine organisms as it remains submerged in seawater for long durations braithwaite et al 2007 fitridge et al 2012 algae shellfish hydroids and marine mollusks attach to the cage netting and can cause rapid occlusion of the net mesh potentially leading to a significant decrease in the aperture ratio of the netting the adverse effects of biofouling are primarily manifested in i a reduction in the water exchange in the fish cage which detrimentally affects the water quality impacting fish welfare and behavior and potentially resulting in economic losses and ii an increase in the load on the fish cage which can threaten the stability of the cage structure and reduce the service life of the mooring lines bloecher et al 2013 hodson et al 1997 swift et al 2006 therefore addressing biofouling issues is crucial to normal aquaculture operations and the structural safety of the fish cage in recent years scholars have used several approaches to investigate this problem swift et al 2006 conducted field measurements of nine net panels subjected to different antifouling treatments and concluded that the drag coefficients of the biofouled netting generally increased with solidity and volume of growth greene and grizzle 2007 investigated the successional development of fouling communities on open ocean aquaculture fish cages in the western gulf of maine and proposed that migration could be a key factor influencing community development bloecher et al 2013 conducted a one year field study at a commercial salmon farm to investigate the effects of the immersion period sampling time and mesh size on the biomass species richness and community composition of the biofouling gansel et al 2015 evaluated the effect of hydroids on the forces acting on net panels and the relationship between solidity and drag force was described for clean and fouled nets lader et al 2015 investigated the growth characteristics of hydroid fouling on netting through field tests they studied the hydrodynamic drag on the fouled twines in a towing tank by employing fabricated models of net twines with artificial hydroid fouling gansel et al 2017 investigated drag on nets fouled with blue mussels mytilus edulis and sugar kelp saccharina latissima and discussed the effects of the different quantities and sizes of the fouling organisms bi et al 2018 obtained hydroid fouled net panels through field sampling and then measured the hydrodynamic coefficients of the biofouled nets using a laboratory flume test pica et al 2019 investigated the development composition and variation in a biofouling community on a finfish farm and found that the immersion time season and depth could influence the biofouling succession and recruitment in summary previous studies have focused on the growth characteristics of biofouling organisms and the effects of biofouling on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the netting further the studies on the hydrodynamic effects of biofouling have primarily considered the netting structure in a current the hydrodynamic characteristics of biofouled netting under wave loads have not been studied however offshore net cages and particularly their netting near the water surface are frequently subjected to wave loads a previous study revealed that the netting near the surface is more susceptible to biofouling bi et al 2018 therefore studying the hydrodynamic characteristics of biofouled netting in waves would benefit practical engineering in this study the hydrodynamic characteristics including the wave force and motion responses of nettings with different levels of biofouling were examined through a physical model test the hydrodynamic coefficients of the biofouled netting in waves were also analyzed in this experimental study the netting could experience motion under the waves with linear damping which was intended to simulate a piece of biofouled netting on a fish cage in the open sea 2 experimental procedures first field sampling was performed to obtain plane nets with various levels of biofouling then laboratory experiments were conducted to study the hydrodynamic performance of plane nets fouled by hydroids in waves two load cells were used to measure the hydrodynamic forces acting on the plane nets an optical measurement system was developed to determine the motion response of the nets the hydrodynamic coefficients of the biofouled netting were analyzed finally the effects of biofouling on the hydrodynamic forces acting on and the motion responses of the plane net were examined and discussed 2 1 field sampling as described in our previous study bi et al 2018 a plane net assembly was designed to determine the accumulation of biofouling at various depths the plane net assembly comprised three plane nets with a center to center distance of 1 m between two adjacent nets the top of the plane net assembly was fixed to a floating platform at a fish farm located near guanglu island dalian china three plane net assemblies totaling nine plane nets were constructed and deployed the first assembly was deployed on july 25 2016 and the other two assemblies were deployed every two weeks thereafter different levels of biofouling were expected to be observed on the nets which were submerged for different periods all the plane nets were recovered and transported to the laboratory on october 18 2016 see fig 1 the netting used in this study was a 0 4 m 0 4 m knotted polyamide net with 16 and 11 meshes in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively see fig 2 the twine diameter was 1 6 mm the mesh bar length was 20 6 mm and the knot diameter was 5 2 mm when mounted as diamond meshes the nets had a solidity ratio of 0 151 calculated using the empirical formulae bi et al 2013 the plane net was stretched onto a 6 mm diameter square steel frame to inhibit net deformation 2 2 laboratory setup the laboratory experiments were conducted in a two dimensional wave current tank at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering slcoe dalian university of technology dalian china the tank was 22 m long 0 45 m wide and 0 6 m deep and the water depth was 0 4 m during the experiment both the bottom and side walls of the tank were made of smooth glass with a negligible frictional drag in this experiment the plane nets with various levels of biofouling were tested in the wave tank one clean net was used as a reference two 0 4 m long vertical bridle lines were arranged to hold the plane net at the equilibrium position without a horizontal force the plane net was mounted with four symmetric 0 43 m bridle lines which were jointed to a load cell on each side the load cell was fixed by a vertical rod with a diameter of 10 mm the horizontal distance between the vertical rod and the plane net was 0 6 m and was considered not to affect the hydrodynamic characteristics of the plane net two elastic cords with stiffness of 31 5 n m were arranged on the horizontal bridle lines on both sides of the plane net to simulate the damping characteristics of the netting the horizontal bridle lines had an initial pre tension of 3 n the setup of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig 3 two diodes were fixed at the middle and bottom of the vertical side of the plane net to monitor the motion response of the plane net in waves a charge coupled device ccd camera recorded the motion trajectories of the diodes the self developed software dut flexsim gui et al 2006 was used to calculate the movement responses of the plane net 2 3 experimental conditions in this study five nettings with different levels of biofouling were chosen for the experiments and one clean net without biofouling was employed as the reference the corresponding solidity and growth amounts weight and volume of the biofouling are presented in table 1 nets n1 n4 and n5 were the hydroid fouled nets submerged for 12 weeks at depths of 3 2 and 1 m respectively nets n2 n3 and n5 were the hydroid fouled nets submerged at a 1 m depth for durations of 8 10 and 12 weeks respectively a total of 11 wave conditions were designed for this experiment see table 2 the wave height was 3 0 9 5 cm and the wave period was 0 67 1 5 s therefore the wave steepness ranged from 0 02 to 0 065 wave cases 3 8 had the same wave period and wave length and the other wave cases had wave steepnesses similar to that of case 6 2 4 data analysis method in the experiments the wave forces acting on both the plane net and the frame were measured the steady state of the data was selected for analysis based on the time series of the wave forces on the plane net the pre tension was subtracted from the raw data and the equilibrium position of each series of wave forces was adjusted to the zero level the mean value of the wave crests of each series was taken as the wave force of the regular wave the wave force acting on each netting was obtained by subtracting the wave force acting on the frame from the corresponding plane net the motion of the plane net was measured using an optical method that is used to acquire continuous images and track the trace points for each measurement a total of 180 images were collected at a frequency of 50 hz the algorithm used for the data analysis was presented in our previous study gui et al 2006 the steady state of the data was selected based on the time history of the plane net motion and the mean value of the crests was taken as the peak value of the motion the horizontal motion of the plane net was the mean value of the results of two trace points each measurement of wave force and motion was performed three times to ensure repeatability the grey correlation method was used to analyze the degree of correlation between the maximum value of the wave force and the motion response of the biofouled plane net with respect to the net solidity weight and volume of the biofouling grey correlation analysis determines whether the relationship among the evaluated data series sets is close based on the degree of similarity of the geometric shape of the referring data series curve and works even with small amounts of irregular data the closer the curves the stronger the correlation between the analyzed data series the degrees of grey correlation were calculated and evaluated as in yeh and chen 2004 finally the degrees of grey correlation were calculated and used to establish the relative degrees of influence of the biofouling factors 2 5 determination of the hydrodynamic coefficients in this study the horizontal wave force acting on the netting and the corresponding wave surface were measured simultaneously the morison equation and the least squares method were used to calculate the drag coefficient c d and inertia coefficient c m of the clean and biofouled nettings in waves assuming that a number of identical slender cylinders connect the netting the force acting on the netting can be expressed as follows 1 f f d f i i 1 n 0 5 ρ c d λ d u u ρ c m λ a c y l u where f is the total force f d is the drag force f i is the inertial force ρ is the fluid density n is the number of the mesh bar of the netting λ d and a cyl are the length diameter and cross sectional area of the mesh bar of the netting respectively u and u are the velocity and acceleration of the water particles respectively the second order stokes wave theory was used for the analysis of the hydrodynamic coefficients thus the velocity magnitude of the water particles around the netting is as follows 2 u π h t cosh k z h sinh k h cos w t 3 4 π h l cosh 2 k z h sinh k h 4 cos 2 w t where k is the wave number w is the angular frequency h is the water depth and t is time setting the measured wave force as f

make q c d q c m 0 thus the solution for c d and c m could be obtained the detailed calculation of the coefficients is provided in our previous studies dong et al 2019 zhao et al 2008 3 results 3 1 hydrodynamic force the horizontal wave forces acting on the nettings under the action of different waves for the various levels of biofouling are shown in fig 4 when the wave period or wave steepness was constant the peak value of the wave force acting on the netting increased with increasing net solidity and when the net solidity reached 0 681 the wave force acting on the netting increased sharply for most wave conditions for netting with or without biofouling increased wave height will cause a significant increase in the wave force acting on the netting a dimensionless analysis of the wave forces under different wave conditions was performed for the netting samples with different levels of biofouling see fig 5 with the influence of biofouling the wave force was up to 3 88 times that of the clean netting for the studied waves the wave conditions corresponding to the maximum load on the biofouled netting were a 3 9 cm wave height a 1 46 s period and a steepness of 0 027 when the net solidity was less than 0 51 the dimensionless wave force increased linearly with increasing solidity however when the net solidity increased to greater than 0 51 the dimensionless wave force increased in a non linear fashion in general the relationship between the dimensionless wave force and the net solidity can be expressed as a linear function f dl 4 695s n 0 170 with a coefficient of determination of 0 990 3 2 motion response the motion response of the biofouled netting varied similarly to the wave force with respect to the net solidity see fig 6 when the wave period or wave steepness was constant the peak value of the horizontal motion of the netting increased with increasing net solidity moreover when the net solidity reached 0 681 the horizontal motion of the netting increased sharply for most wave conditions for a netting with or without biofouling increased wave height will significantly increase the horizontal motion of the netting this phenomenon is consistent with the variation trend observed for the wave force a dimensionless analysis of the horizontal motion of the biofouled netting in waves was performed for various levels of biofouling see fig 7 within the studied range the maximum horizontal motion of the most severely biofouled netting was 3 84 times that of the clean netting the wave conditions corresponding to the maximum horizontal motion increase were a 3 3 cm height a 1 46 s period and a steepness of 0 023 overall the dimensionless horizontal motion of the biofouled netting increased with increasing net solidity in a non linear fashion however the dimensionless horizontal motion could be expressed as the linear function s h 4 394s n 0 179 with a coefficient of determination of 0 983 3 3 hydrodynamic coefficients the hydrodynamic coefficients including the drag coefficient c d and inertia coefficient c m of both the clean and biofouled nettings were calculated to facilitate the dimensionless analysis these coefficients for a plane net in waves are typically considered to be a function of the reynolds number re u max d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the keulegan carpenter number kc u max t d and the frequency parameter β β d 2 tν which is defined as the ratio between re and kc balash et al 2009 dong et al 2019 liu et al 2012 zhao et al 2008 in this study the twine diameter d used for calculating the re and kc of both the clean and biofouled nettings was the twine diameter of the clean netting the hydrodynamic coefficients c d and c m of the clean netting and the severely biofouled netting are presented in figs 8 and 9 overall the presence of biofouling significantly increased the drag force on the netting the biofouling also increased the inertial force on the netting but the effect was less significant in this study the reynolds number ranged between 176 8 and 509 1 and the range of the kc number was 59 0 207 4 thus the range of the β number was 2 05 3 82 the corresponding ranges of c d and c m were 0 76 1 55 and 3 20 6 58 respectively for the clean netting and 3 30 7 72 and 5 04 10 83 respectively for the extremely heavily biofouled netting when the wave period was constant that is β was constant the drag coefficient of both the clean and biofouled nettings generally decreased with increases in the reynolds number or kc number however there was no deterministic relationship between the inertia coefficient and the reynolds number or kc number likewise when the wave steepness was similar the drag coefficient of both the clean and biofouled nettings tended to decrease with increasing reynolds number or kc number furthermore the variation in the inertia coefficient with the reynolds number and kc number was inconsistent 4 discussion the wave force and motion response of the plane nets increased linearly with increasing biofouling level the plane net in the experiment was similar to the fish cage netting used in open seas which can be forced to oscillate under wave action with increasing biofouling levels the solidity of the netting increased gradually thus increasing the wave force acting on the plane net further the increased wave load forced the plane net to produce a larger amplitude of motion in general the wave force and motion of the netting in waves are coupled the correlations of the maximum value of the wave force and the motion response of the biofouled plane net with the net solidity weight and volume of the biofouling were analyzed using the grey correlation analysis method the degrees of correlation between the wave force and the net solidity biofouling weight and biofouling volume were 0 890 0 576 and 0 587 respectively the degrees of correlation between the motion response and the net solidity biofouling weight and biofouling volume were 0 814 0 604 and 0 615 respectively these results demonstrate that the net solidity had the strongest correlation with both the wave force and the motion response of the plane net therefore the net solidity could be an effective index for measuring the degree of net biofouling among the three parameters i e net solidity biofouling weight and biofouling volume the net solidity is closely related to the effective area of the net and therefore primarily affects the drag force acting on the net structure in comparison the volume of the biofouling mainly affects the inertial force acting on the net structure the results of the degree of correlation analyses indicate that the drag force was the dominant component of the wave force acting on the biofouled netting the total horizontal wave force acting on the netting could be divided into a drag force and inertial forces using least squares fitting see fig 10 overall the inertial drag and total wave forces changed periodically with the same period there was a phase difference between the inertial force and the drag force the peak inertial force lagged behind the peak drag force primarily due to the phase difference between the velocity and acceleration of the water particles a net structure could be considered as a system of interconnected cylinders thus the hydrodynamic force on a netting in a wave could be considered as the accumulation of the wave forces acting on a series of cylinders as concluded by sumer and fredsøe 2006 kc 30 is defined as the drag dominated regime for a cylinder in a wave in this study the inertial force was significantly smaller than the drag force for both clean and biofouled nettings see fig 11 which is in the drag dominated regime the ratio of inertial force to drag force in different wave conditions was 0 23 0 89 for the clean netting and 0 08 0 31 for the biofouled netting therefore the drag force of the biofouled netting constituted a relatively large proportion of the total wave force the biofouling had a more significant effect on the drag force and a relatively lesser effect on the inertial force primarily because i with increased biofouling the projection area of the netting increased more than did the volume and ii the biofouling was slender and flexible so it moved with the water particle velocity under the action of waves decreasing its relative acceleration for most wave cases the ratio of the inertial force to the drag force decreased with increasing kc number over the studied range of kc numbers the drag coefficient was 0 76 1 55 for the clean netting and 3 30 7 72 for the extremely heavily biofouled netting the drag coefficient of the netting increased by 4 2 7 4 times under different wave conditions due to the effect of the biofouling in comparison the inertia coefficient increased 1 1 to 3 1 times due to the biofouling indicating that the contribution of the biofouling to the wave force acting on the netting is primarily as drag force the drag coefficient of the biofouled netting tended to decrease with increasing reynolds or kc numbers for waves with the same wave period the trend of variation in the drag coefficient with the reynolds number is precisely the same as that of the kc number because when the wave period is constant both the reynolds number and kc number are proportional to the maximum water particle velocity for waves with the same wave steepness there were some differences between the drag coefficient and the reynolds number and kc number generally however the drag coefficient continued to decrease this trend in the drag coefficient is consistent with previous studies on clean netting balash et al 2009 dong et al 2019 liu et al 2012 by contrast for the studied wave cases the inertia coefficients were scattered in the range of 3 20 6 58 for the clean netting and 5 04 10 83 for the extremely heavily biofouled netting the flow patterns around the netting twines and knots influence each other when the plane net moves because the netting structure is more complex than that of cylinders the motion of the netting in waves also changes the relative oscillation frequency which is a significant determinant of water particle acceleration due to these complex mechanisms the inertia coefficient of the netting tended to be discrete with the variation in the reynolds number and kc number the inertia coefficients obtained in this study were significantly larger than the values in the authors previous study zhao et al 2008 because i the netting could be forced to oscillate which caused relative motion and ii the biofouling increased the mass overall the drag coefficient and inertia coefficient of the netting were observed to be related the netting in this experiment was the same as that used in marine aquaculture engineering the biofouling on the netting also consisted of the most common hydroids in a fish farm net cage therefore the results of this study could directly provide a reference for the hydrodynamic analysis of offshore fish cages in the open sea the fish cage netting can be divided into a series of net panels at different depths because the level of biofouling on the netting varies with the water depth combined with the wave condition and water particle velocity the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients could be assigned to the different net panels to determine the hydrodynamic response of the entire fish cage under the effect of the biofouling 5 conclusions this study experimentally investigated the effects of hydroid fouling on the hydrodynamic performance of a plane net in waves the hydrodynamic force and motion response of both the clean and biofouled nettings in waves were measured and the corresponding drag and inertia coefficients of the nettings were calculated the main conclusions are as follows i the wave force and motion response of the plane net increased linearly with increased biofouling compared with the weight and volume of the biofouling the net solidity had a stronger correlation with both the wave force and motion response of the plane net therefore the net solidity is a suitable index for quantifying the degree of net biofouling in waves ii the peak of the inertial force acting on the hydroid fouled netting lagged behind the peak of the drag force due to the phase difference between the velocity and acceleration of the water particles the drag force acting on the biofouled netting was a higher proportion of the total wave force than it was for the clean netting biofouling had a more significant effect on the drag force and a relatively less significant effect on the inertial force acting on the netting for most wave cases the ratio of the inertial force to the drag force decreased with increasing kc number iii the drag coefficient of the biofouled netting tended to decrease with increasing reynolds or kc numbers in the range of 3 30 7 72 the biofouling could increase the drag coefficient of the netting by 4 2 7 4 times in contrast the inertia coefficient of the biofouled netting was in the range of 5 04 10 83 no deterministic relationship was found between the inertia coefficient and reynolds number or kc number therefore for the calculation of the wave force on a fish cage the appropriate drag and inertia coefficients should be selected based on the dimensional parameters of the netting and the wave parameters credit authorship contribution statement chun wei bi conceptualization methodology writing

21669,biofouling of netting adversely impacts aquaculture operations and the structural safety of fish cages in this study the effects of the hydroids on the hydrodynamic performance of a plane net in waves were determined experimentally a series of plane nets with various levels of biofouling was obtained via field sampling from a fish farm the hydrodynamic force and motion response of both clean and biofouled nettings in waves were measured in a wave current tank the corresponding drag and inertia coefficients of the nettings were then calculated in the studied waves the wave force acting on the biofouled netting was as high as 3 88 times that acting on the clean netting the maximum amplitude of the horizontal motion for the most severely biofouled netting was 3 84 times that for the clean netting for various wave conditions the biofouled netting drag coefficients and inertia coefficients were 3 30 7 72 and 5 04 10 83 respectively the results indicated that netting biofouling by hydroids increases the drag force more substantially than it increases the inertial force keywords fish cage hydroid fouling wave force hydrodynamic coefficient laboratory experiment 1 introduction aquaculture is a globally important industry that provides essential food for a growing world population and has a vital role in providing protein to countries with inadequate food supplies currently fish cages are essential structures for offshore aquaculture the hydrodynamic characteristics of the fish cage are critical to ensuring its safe design in recent years many scholars have conducted systematic studies on the load and motion responses of fish cages in waves and currents balash et al 2009 bi et al 2014 cheng et al 2020 decew et al 2005 dong et al 2010 huang et al 2006 klebert et al 2013 liu et al 2019 qin et al 2020 tang et al 2017 tsukrov et al 2011 the characteristics of waves and flow fields inside and around fish cages have also been analyzed bi et al 2013 2015 chen and christensen 2017 klebert and su 2020 martin et al 2020 patursson et al 2010 studies have also focused on engineering analyses of the structural strength of fish cages drach et al 2016 kim et al 2014 and on determining the hydrodynamic characteristics of net type structures floating in breakwaters dong et al 2008 guo et al 2020 an offshore fish cage especially its net structure is vulnerable to fouling by marine organisms as it remains submerged in seawater for long durations braithwaite et al 2007 fitridge et al 2012 algae shellfish hydroids and marine mollusks attach to the cage netting and can cause rapid occlusion of the net mesh potentially leading to a significant decrease in the aperture ratio of the netting the adverse effects of biofouling are primarily manifested in i a reduction in the water exchange in the fish cage which detrimentally affects the water quality impacting fish welfare and behavior and potentially resulting in economic losses and ii an increase in the load on the fish cage which can threaten the stability of the cage structure and reduce the service life of the mooring lines bloecher et al 2013 hodson et al 1997 swift et al 2006 therefore addressing biofouling issues is crucial to normal aquaculture operations and the structural safety of the fish cage in recent years scholars have used several approaches to investigate this problem swift et al 2006 conducted field measurements of nine net panels subjected to different antifouling treatments and concluded that the drag coefficients of the biofouled netting generally increased with solidity and volume of growth greene and grizzle 2007 investigated the successional development of fouling communities on open ocean aquaculture fish cages in the western gulf of maine and proposed that migration could be a key factor influencing community development bloecher et al 2013 conducted a one year field study at a commercial salmon farm to investigate the effects of the immersion period sampling time and mesh size on the biomass species richness and community composition of the biofouling gansel et al 2015 evaluated the effect of hydroids on the forces acting on net panels and the relationship between solidity and drag force was described for clean and fouled nets lader et al 2015 investigated the growth characteristics of hydroid fouling on netting through field tests they studied the hydrodynamic drag on the fouled twines in a towing tank by employing fabricated models of net twines with artificial hydroid fouling gansel et al 2017 investigated drag on nets fouled with blue mussels mytilus edulis and sugar kelp saccharina latissima and discussed the effects of the different quantities and sizes of the fouling organisms bi et al 2018 obtained hydroid fouled net panels through field sampling and then measured the hydrodynamic coefficients of the biofouled nets using a laboratory flume test pica et al 2019 investigated the development composition and variation in a biofouling community on a finfish farm and found that the immersion time season and depth could influence the biofouling succession and recruitment in summary previous studies have focused on the growth characteristics of biofouling organisms and the effects of biofouling on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the netting further the studies on the hydrodynamic effects of biofouling have primarily considered the netting structure in a current the hydrodynamic characteristics of biofouled netting under wave loads have not been studied however offshore net cages and particularly their netting near the water surface are frequently subjected to wave loads a previous study revealed that the netting near the surface is more susceptible to biofouling bi et al 2018 therefore studying the hydrodynamic characteristics of biofouled netting in waves would benefit practical engineering in this study the hydrodynamic characteristics including the wave force and motion responses of nettings with different levels of biofouling were examined through a physical model test the hydrodynamic coefficients of the biofouled netting in waves were also analyzed in this experimental study the netting could experience motion under the waves with linear damping which was intended to simulate a piece of biofouled netting on a fish cage in the open sea 2 experimental procedures first field sampling was performed to obtain plane nets with various levels of biofouling then laboratory experiments were conducted to study the hydrodynamic performance of plane nets fouled by hydroids in waves two load cells were used to measure the hydrodynamic forces acting on the plane nets an optical measurement system was developed to determine the motion response of the nets the hydrodynamic coefficients of the biofouled netting were analyzed finally the effects of biofouling on the hydrodynamic forces acting on and the motion responses of the plane net were examined and discussed 2 1 field sampling as described in our previous study bi et al 2018 a plane net assembly was designed to determine the accumulation of biofouling at various depths the plane net assembly comprised three plane nets with a center to center distance of 1 m between two adjacent nets the top of the plane net assembly was fixed to a floating platform at a fish farm located near guanglu island dalian china three plane net assemblies totaling nine plane nets were constructed and deployed the first assembly was deployed on july 25 2016 and the other two assemblies were deployed every two weeks thereafter different levels of biofouling were expected to be observed on the nets which were submerged for different periods all the plane nets were recovered and transported to the laboratory on october 18 2016 see fig 1 the netting used in this study was a 0 4 m 0 4 m knotted polyamide net with 16 and 11 meshes in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively see fig 2 the twine diameter was 1 6 mm the mesh bar length was 20 6 mm and the knot diameter was 5 2 mm when mounted as diamond meshes the nets had a solidity ratio of 0 151 calculated using the empirical formulae bi et al 2013 the plane net was stretched onto a 6 mm diameter square steel frame to inhibit net deformation 2 2 laboratory setup the laboratory experiments were conducted in a two dimensional wave current tank at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering slcoe dalian university of technology dalian china the tank was 22 m long 0 45 m wide and 0 6 m deep and the water depth was 0 4 m during the experiment both the bottom and side walls of the tank were made of smooth glass with a negligible frictional drag in this experiment the plane nets with various levels of biofouling were tested in the wave tank one clean net was used as a reference two 0 4 m long vertical bridle lines were arranged to hold the plane net at the equilibrium position without a horizontal force the plane net was mounted with four symmetric 0 43 m bridle lines which were jointed to a load cell on each side the load cell was fixed by a vertical rod with a diameter of 10 mm the horizontal distance between the vertical rod and the plane net was 0 6 m and was considered not to affect the hydrodynamic characteristics of the plane net two elastic cords with stiffness of 31 5 n m were arranged on the horizontal bridle lines on both sides of the plane net to simulate the damping characteristics of the netting the horizontal bridle lines had an initial pre tension of 3 n the setup of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig 3 two diodes were fixed at the middle and bottom of the vertical side of the plane net to monitor the motion response of the plane net in waves a charge coupled device ccd camera recorded the motion trajectories of the diodes the self developed software dut flexsim gui et al 2006 was used to calculate the movement responses of the plane net 2 3 experimental conditions in this study five nettings with different levels of biofouling were chosen for the experiments and one clean net without biofouling was employed as the reference the corresponding solidity and growth amounts weight and volume of the biofouling are presented in table 1 nets n1 n4 and n5 were the hydroid fouled nets submerged for 12 weeks at depths of 3 2 and 1 m respectively nets n2 n3 and n5 were the hydroid fouled nets submerged at a 1 m depth for durations of 8 10 and 12 weeks respectively a total of 11 wave conditions were designed for this experiment see table 2 the wave height was 3 0 9 5 cm and the wave period was 0 67 1 5 s therefore the wave steepness ranged from 0 02 to 0 065 wave cases 3 8 had the same wave period and wave length and the other wave cases had wave steepnesses similar to that of case 6 2 4 data analysis method in the experiments the wave forces acting on both the plane net and the frame were measured the steady state of the data was selected for analysis based on the time series of the wave forces on the plane net the pre tension was subtracted from the raw data and the equilibrium position of each series of wave forces was adjusted to the zero level the mean value of the wave crests of each series was taken as the wave force of the regular wave the wave force acting on each netting was obtained by subtracting the wave force acting on the frame from the corresponding plane net the motion of the plane net was measured using an optical method that is used to acquire continuous images and track the trace points for each measurement a total of 180 images were collected at a frequency of 50 hz the algorithm used for the data analysis was presented in our previous study gui et al 2006 the steady state of the data was selected based on the time history of the plane net motion and the mean value of the crests was taken as the peak value of the motion the horizontal motion of the plane net was the mean value of the results of two trace points each measurement of wave force and motion was performed three times to ensure repeatability the grey correlation method was used to analyze the degree of correlation between the maximum value of the wave force and the motion response of the biofouled plane net with respect to the net solidity weight and volume of the biofouling grey correlation analysis determines whether the relationship among the evaluated data series sets is close based on the degree of similarity of the geometric shape of the referring data series curve and works even with small amounts of irregular data the closer the curves the stronger the correlation between the analyzed data series the degrees of grey correlation were calculated and evaluated as in yeh and chen 2004 finally the degrees of grey correlation were calculated and used to establish the relative degrees of influence of the biofouling factors 2 5 determination of the hydrodynamic coefficients in this study the horizontal wave force acting on the netting and the corresponding wave surface were measured simultaneously the morison equation and the least squares method were used to calculate the drag coefficient c d and inertia coefficient c m of the clean and biofouled nettings in waves assuming that a number of identical slender cylinders connect the netting the force acting on the netting can be expressed as follows 1 f f d f i i 1 n 0 5 ρ c d λ d u u ρ c m λ a c y l u where f is the total force f d is the drag force f i is the inertial force ρ is the fluid density n is the number of the mesh bar of the netting λ d and a cyl are the length diameter and cross sectional area of the mesh bar of the netting respectively u and u are the velocity and acceleration of the water particles respectively the second order stokes wave theory was used for the analysis of the hydrodynamic coefficients thus the velocity magnitude of the water particles around the netting is as follows 2 u π h t cosh k z h sinh k h cos w t 3 4 π h l cosh 2 k z h sinh k h 4 cos 2 w t where k is the wave number w is the angular frequency h is the water depth and t is time setting the measured wave force as f m the sum of the squared relative error between the measured and theoretical values can be expressed as follows 3 q i 1 n f i f m i 2 i 1 n c d x i c m y i f m i 2 using the least squares method to make q c d q c m 0 thus the solution for c d and c m could be obtained the detailed calculation of the coefficients is provided in our previous studies dong et al 2019 zhao et al 2008 3 results 3 1 hydrodynamic force the horizontal wave forces acting on the nettings under the action of different waves for the various levels of biofouling are shown in fig 4 when the wave period or wave steepness was constant the peak value of the wave force acting on the netting increased with increasing net solidity and when the net solidity reached 0 681 the wave force acting on the netting increased sharply for most wave conditions for netting with or without biofouling increased wave height will cause a significant increase in the wave force acting on the netting a dimensionless analysis of the wave forces under different wave conditions was performed for the netting samples with different levels of biofouling see fig 5 with the influence of biofouling the wave force was up to 3 88 times

the net solidity was less than 0 51 the dimensionless wave force increased linearly with increasing solidity however when the net solidity increased to greater than 0 51 the dimensionless wave force increased in a non linear fashion in general the relationship between the dimensionless wave force and the net solidity can be expressed as a linear function f dl 4 695s n 0 170 with a coefficient of determination of 0 990 3 2 motion response the motion response of the biofouled netting varied similarly to the wave force with respect to the net solidity see fig 6 when the wave period or wave

with the variation trend observed for the wave force a dimensionless analysis of the horizontal motion of the biofouled netting in waves was performed for various levels of biofouling see fig 7 within the studied range the maximum horizontal motion of the most severely biofouled netting was 3 84 times that of the clean netting the wave conditions corresponding to the maximum horizontal motion increase were a 3 3 cm height a 1 46 s period and a steepness of 0 023 overall the dimensionless horizontal motion of the biofouled netting increased with increasing net solidity in a non linear fashion however the dimensionless horizontal motion could be expressed as the linear function s h 4 394s n 0 179 with a coefficient of determination of 0 983 3 3 hydrodynamic coefficients the

for calculating the re and kc of both the clean and biofouled nettings was the twine diameter of the clean netting the hydrodynamic coefficients c d and c m of the clean netting and the severely biofouled netting are presented in figs 8 and 9 overall the presence of biofouling significantly increased the drag force on the netting the biofouling also increased the inertial force on the netting but the effect was less significant in this study the reynolds number ranged between 176 8 and 509 1 and the range of the kc number was 59 0 207 4 thus the range of the β number was 2 05 3 82 the corresponding ranges of c d and c m were 0 76 1 55 and 3 20 6 58 respectively for the clean netting and 3 30 7 72 and 5 04 10 83 respectively for the extremely heavily biofouled netting when the wave

the ratio of inertial force to drag force in different wave conditions was 0 23 0 89 for the clean netting and 0 08 0 31 for the biofouled netting therefore the drag force of the biofouled netting constituted a relatively large proportion of the total wave force the biofouling had a more significant effect on the drag force and a relatively lesser effect on the inertial force primarily because i with increased biofouling the projection area of the netting increased more than did the volume and ii the biofouling was slender and flexible so it moved with the water particle velocity under the action of waves decreasing its relative acceleration for most wave cases the ratio of the inertial force to the drag force decreased with increasing kc number over the studied range of kc numbers the drag coefficient was 0 76 1 55 for the clean netting and 3 30 7 72 for the extremely heavily biofouled netting the drag coefficient of the netting increased by 4 2 7 4 times under different wave conditions due to the effect of the biofouling in comparison the inertia coefficient increased 1 1 to 3 1 times due to the biofouling indicating that the contribution of the biofouling to the wave force acting on the netting is primarily as drag force the drag coefficient of the biofouled netting tended to decrease with increasing reynolds or kc numbers for waves with the same wave period the trend of variation in the drag coefficient with the reynolds number is precisely the same as that of the kc number because when the wave period is constant both the reynolds number and kc number are proportional to the maximum water particle velocity for waves with the same wave steepness there were some differences between the drag coefficient and the reynolds number and kc number generally however the drag coefficient continued to decrease this trend in the drag coefficient is consistent with previous studies on clean netting balash et al 2009 dong et al 2019 liu et al 2012 by contrast for the studied wave cases the inertia coefficients were scattered in the range of 3 20 6 58 for the clean netting and 5 04 10 83 for the extremely heavily biofouled netting the flow patterns around the netting twines and knots influence each other when the plane net moves because the netting structure is more complex than that of cylinders the motion of the netting in waves also changes the relative oscillation frequency which is a significant determinant of water particle acceleration due to these complex mechanisms the inertia coefficient of the netting tended to be discrete with the variation in the reynolds number and kc number the inertia coefficients obtained in this study were significantly larger than the values in the authors previous study zhao et al 2008 because i the netting could be forced to oscillate which caused relative motion and ii the biofouling increased the mass overall the drag coefficient and inertia coefficient of the netting were observed to be related the netting in this experiment was the same as that used in marine aquaculture engineering the biofouling on the netting also consisted of the most common hydroids in a fish farm net cage therefore the results of this study could directly provide a reference for the hydrodynamic analysis of offshore fish cages in the open sea the fish cage netting can be divided into a series of net panels at different depths because the level of biofouling on the netting varies with the water depth combined with the wave condition and water particle velocity the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients could be assigned to the different net panels to determine the hydrodynamic response of the entire fish cage under the effect of the biofouling 5 conclusions this study experimentally investigated the effects of hydroid fouling on the hydrodynamic performance of a plane net in waves the hydrodynamic force and motion response of both the clean and biofouled nettings in waves were measured and the corresponding drag and inertia coefficients of the nettings were calculated the main conclusions are as follows i the wave force and motion response of the plane net increased linearly with increased biofouling compared with the weight and volume of the biofouling the net solidity had a stronger correlation with both the wave force and motion response of the plane net therefore the net solidity is a suitable index for quantifying the degree of net biofouling in waves ii the peak of the inertial force acting on the hydroid fouled netting lagged behind the peak of the drag force due to the phase difference between the velocity and acceleration of the water particles the drag force acting on the biofouled netting was a higher proportion of the total wave force than it was for the clean netting biofouling had a more significant effect on the drag force and a relatively less significant effect on the inertial force acting on the netting for most wave cases the ratio of the inertial force to the drag force decreased with increasing kc number iii the drag coefficient of the biofouled netting tended to decrease with increasing reynolds or kc numbers in the range of 3 30 7 72 the biofouling could increase the drag coefficient of the netting by 4 2 7 4 times in contrast the inertia coefficient of the biofouled netting was in the range of 5 04 10 83 no deterministic relationship was found between the inertia coefficient and reynolds number or kc number therefore for the calculation of the wave force on a fish cage the appropriate drag and inertia coefficients should be selected based on the dimensional parameters of the netting and the wave parameters credit authorship contribution statement chun wei bi conceptualization methodology writing
