21260,a theoretical description of fluid motion under mechanically generated nonlinear standing waves in the vicinity of a rigid vertical wall is presented a standing wave system is formed through the interaction of mechanically driven progressive waves and waves reflected at a vertical wall which is located at the far end of the numerical flume an original approach is applied to provide complete information on standing wave field with respect to instantaneous velocities particle paths and pressure the numerical kinematics of standing waves are compared with corresponding linear weakly nonlinear and higher order periodic predictions derived within the framework of the perturbation theory an excellent agreement between the numerical and the fifth order analytical solution results is achieved the magnitude of dynamic pressure exerted on a vertical rigid wall is also confronted with the corresponding values acquired from simplified engineering formulas which are used as widely accepted standards for the evaluation of hydrodynamic loads on coastal and offshore structures an engineering diagram based on the fifth order analytical solution constitutes a practical outcome of the study and it allows hydrodynamic loads exerted on a vertical wall to be more accurately quantified for a wide spectrum of non breaking wave conditions keywords water waves vertical breakwaters standing waves hydrodynamic forces wave flume 1 introduction the safe and economic design of vertical breakwaters relies on a successful assessment of hydrodynamic forces calculated as an integral of pressure exerted on an upright section of a structure incoming waves are reflected at a vertical obstacle and form a system of standing or partially standing oscillations the considered wave problem may be analytically or numerically solved basing on available linear and nonlinear theories of fluid mechanics to eventually give high fidelity information on the characteristics of a wave field in front of a structure and provide accurate estimates of hydrodynamic loads however such a scientific approach requires time and expert knowledge on wave mechanics mathematics and numerical tools that is why simplified engineering methods were developed to facilitate design procedures with respect to the assessment of wave pressure and resulting hydrodynamic forces which reduce the cost of marine investments and workload a brief overview of available scientific and engineering approaches to the problem of standing waves acting on vertical structures is given below recognized engineering wave pressure formulas are those of sainflou 1928 for head on fully reflected waves miche 1944 and rundgren 1958 for head on fully and partially reflected waves withsecond order correction and goda 1974 for irregular waves all the methods are applicable to non breaking waves reflecting at an impermeable wall and assume trapezoidal pressure distribution due to waves the sainflou miche rundgren and goda approaches with their modifications are widely applied in coastal engineering and support the design of vertical marine structures as well as composite breakwaters with an upright seaward face usa 1984 2002 important practical guidelines for the determination of hydrodynamic forces exerted on marine structures with a vertical front which involve more complex engineering cases such as arbitrary geometries of breakwater layouts breaking wave impacts three dimensional effects etc are covered by the shore protection manual usa 1984 and more recently and extensively by the coastal engineering manual usa 2002 see also goda 2000 and romańczyk 2007 for a more comprehensive literature review since the present study concerns regular standing waves formed in the vicinity of a vertical wall without the loss of stability due to breaking wave pressure formulas applicable to loads on a structure from breaking waves are not discussed the generation of standing water waves is a classical problem of fluid structure interaction it may be solved analytically under potential flow assumptions as a simple harmonic oscillation problem within the framework of linear wave theory see e g stoker 1957 dean and dalrymple 1984 and higher order nonlinear perturbation approaches see e g tadjbakhsh and keller 1960 goda 1967 fenton 1985 dalzell 1999 chen et al 2009 sobey 2009 for steeper waves the application of analytical higher order solutions should be however made with caution since the derivation process involves very laborious algebra as a result long and complicated formulas may sometimes suffer from typographical errors and lead to disagreement between available theories see sobey 2009 magda 2012 for a more detailed discussion an alternative solution to the problem of steep standing waves is to use efficient fully nonlinear water wave models based on a spectral method e g dommermuth and yue 1987 west et al 1987 craig and sulem 1993 paprota et al 2018 paprota and sulisz 2019 or other numerical methods for nonlinear waves e g grilli et al 1989 kim and ertekin 2000 with a relevant definition of reflective conditions imposed at lateral boundaries still these approaches require initial conditions provided by analytical solutions on the other hand since standing waves are formed by incoming waves which are completely reflected by a vertical wall dean and dalrymple 1984 it is possible to create a standing wave system in a numerically modeled closed flume filled with water which initially is at rest for instance semi analytical methods based on the spectral collocation approach which constitute an efficient tool for the analysis of various water wave scenarios generated in a closed flume sulisz and paprota 2008 may be used in this context to support wave structure interaction studies the developed consecutive order pseudo spectral wavemaker solutions allow the mechanical generation of waves and associated processes to be investigated in large spatial domains at a relatively low computational cost sulisz and paprota 2008 ducrozet et al 2012 recently a complete fully nonlinear spectral solution to the wavemaker problem was derived by paprota and sulisz 2018 to resolve particle paths and mass transport in the immediate proximity of a wavemaker paddle the semi analytical method of computation was extensively and successfully verified with a significant amount of experimental wave flume data at the subsequent stages of the numerical model development which confirms its accuracy and reliability the following comparisons covered regular waves sulisz and paprota 2008 paprota and sulisz 2018 modulated deepwater wave trains sulisz and paprota 2011 solitons paprota et al 2018 and irregular pseudo random waves paprota and sulisz 2019 thus this method may be used to obtain an accurate prediction of the wave field in a region adjacent to a rigid vertical wall the numerical model provides high quality information on the distribution of pressure exerted on a vertical wall and as such it constitutes a powerful engineering tool for the precise calculation of instantaneous forces acting on a structure in the present paper a pseudo spectral solution to mechanically generated nonlinear water waves in a closed flume paprota and sulisz 2018 is applied to analyze steep standing waves the waves are generated at the wavemaker boundary and reflected at a rigid vertical wall located at the far end of the flume once a steady standing wave system is established spatial and temporal characteristics of the generated wave field are analyzed in the vicinity of a vertical wall the numerically calculated water particle paths velocity and pressure fields are analyzed and compared with the results of linear weakly nonlinear and higher order models as well as classical engineering wave pressure formulas which are typically used to estimate hydrodynamic loads on vertical walls at the design stage of coastal and offshore structures although the study discusses regular waves the model may successfully predict more complicated hydrodynamic systems which involve irregular sea states solitary waves and wave energy focusing scenarios contrary to analytical perturbation techniques the presented method may be directly generalized to three dimensional problems and give reliable predictions of strong incident reflected wave interference in the vicinity of real marine engineering structures admitting the irregularity and directional spread of severe sea states 2 materials and methods 2 1 statement of the problem the fundamentals of the theory and the pseudo spectral method are based on the work by paprota and sulisz 2018 the computational domain corresponds to a closed flume of the length of l which is filled with water of a constant depth of h fig 1 lateral boundaries are defined as rigid impermeable and vertical one is fixed and the other is allowed to move along a longitudinal direction to mimic a piston type wavemaker paddle in the domain which represents a closed flume of a finite uniform depth the irrotational motion of an inviscid and incompressible fluid is then considered the plane wave problem is defined in the cartesian coordinate system with the origin located at an intersection of the still water level and the wavemaker paddle zero position the vertical z axis points upwards while the x axis coincides with wave propagation see fig 1 accordingly the velocity vector field v x z t is expressed in terms of the velocity potential function ϕ x z t as v ϕ the initial boundary value problem is defined as follows 1 2 ϕ 0 h z η 2 η t ϕ x η x ϕ z 0 z η 3 ϕ t 1 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ z 2 g η 0 z η 4 ϕ z 0 z h 5 χ t ϕ x 0 x χ 6 ϕ x 0 x l where g is acceleration due to gravity the laplace continuity formula eq 1 holds for mass conservation in the entire computational domain free surface boundary conditions eqs 2 and 3 are imposed at the moving water surface lateral boundaries are defined as impervious at the piston type wavemaker eq 5 and at the far end of the flume eq 6 since boundary conditions eqs 2 and 3 must be applied at the free surface η which is unknown and is a part of the solution eqs 2 and 3 are expanded in a taylor series about the mean position together with eq 5 7 m 0 η m m m z m η t ϕ x η x ϕ z 0 z 0 8 m 0 η m m m z m ϕ t 1 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ z 2 g η 0 z 0 9 m

conditions and the velocity potential w ϕ is introduced to satisfy the wavemaker kinematic boundary condition paprota and sulisz 2018 thus the solution is sought in the following form 10 η x t n 0 a n

coefficients a n a n and b j paprota and sulisz 2018 2019 the adams bashforth moulton abm time stepping technique press et al 1988 is then applied to advance the solution in time this method secures fourth order accuracy and requires only two evaluations of a given function at each time step longuet higgins and cokelet 1976 initial conditions with respect to the spatial distribution of free surface elevation and velocity potential functions are required to start up the abm predictor corrector procedure since waves are generated starting from rest the initial state corresponds to ϕ x 0 0 0 and η x 0 0 2 3 engineering wave characteristics when the solution coefficients are determined wave velocities particle trajectories and pressure under oscillatory free surface may be efficiently calculated using inverse fast fourier transform formulas the horizontal and vertical components of the velocity field are expressed respectively as 15 u x z t n 0 κ n a n cosh κ n z h cosh κ n h sin κ

paths are determined by the numerical integration of d x d t u x z t and d z d t w x z t for the initial particle location x 0 z 0 at time t t 0 since the bernoulli equation provides a relationship between the total pressure field p x z t and the kinematics of a fluid of density ρ dean and dalrymple 1984 17 ϕ t 1 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ z 2 g z p ρ 0 h z η the total pressure p x z t is derived from eq 17 as 18 p ρ g z ρ ϕ t 1 2 ρ ϕ x 2 ϕ z 2 h z η the time derivative of the velocity potential may be expressed in a form similar to eq 11 as 19 ϕ t x z t n 0 c n cosh κ n z h cosh κ n h cos κ n x consequently the partial derivatives ϕ x ϕ z and ϕ t may be substituted to eq 18 to obtain the total pressure field function 20 p x z t ρ g z ρ n 0 c n cosh κ n z h cosh κ n h cos κ n x 1 2 ρ n 0 κ n

h 2 if the total pressure corresponding to hydrostatic conditions of still water in the absence of waves is defined in the form of a heaviside function as 21 p ρ g z h z 0 0 0 z η the dynamic pressure p x z t defined as an excess of pressure due to wave motion is 22 p p p finally the dynamic force which acts on an upright section of a structure is acquired by integrating the dynamic pressure field within the vertical limits determined by the bottom level and free surface elevation at the position of a wall as 23 f t h η l t p l z t d z h η l t p l z t d z h 0 ρ g z d z since the horizontal

is focused on free surface displacements water particle trajectories as well as velocities pressure and forces corresponding to regular and steep standing waves which are generated mechanically the numerical model is first compared with the results acquired from simple analytical expressions provided by linear and weakly nonlinear theories for standing waves of low to moderate amplitudes and further using a fifth order approach applicable to steeper waves derived by sobey 2009 see appendix a a standing wave force which acts on the wall is then determined by integrating vertical pressure distribution the numerically calculated hydrodynamic loads are compared with the corresponding values of forces estimated by applying engineering pressure formulas of sainflou 1928 miche 1944 rundgren 1958 and goda 1974 see appendix b the accuracy of engineering methods in quantifying wave loads acting on vertical breakwaters and other marine structures with an upright section is investigated in closer detail 3 2 numerical tests standing waves are generated by waves induced by a monochromatic wavemaker motion and waves reflected at a rigid vertical wall at the far end of the numerical flume the study covers deepwater and transitional water cases represented by three ratios of wavelength to water depth l h equal to 2 4 and 8 the effect of wave steepness is studied in a range of relative wave heights selected to cover low amplitude waves waves of moderate steepness and steeper waves the simulated wave runs cover from 50 to 70 wave periods the waves are generated starting from rest a ramp function is applied to the stroke of the wavemaker motion for the first 10 to 15 waves securing a smooth transition between hydrostatic conditions and a fully developed wave motion a longitudinal dimension of a computational domain spans from 15 to 20 wavelengths for a given wave flume length and accepted hydrodynamic parameters a time interval used for the analysis is determined based on group velocities of generated waves and additional spurious free waves schäffer 1996 as it is necessary to eliminate the imprint of undesirable free oscillations on the resulting standing wave field in table 1 a summary of wave and computational domain characteristics is presented in fig 2 hydrodynamic conditions are defined using the diagram which shows ranges of suitability of recognized wave theories le méhauté 1976 it may be seen in fig 2 that the higher order theory is recommended for the steepest analyzed waves mechanically generated oscillations of moderate steepness correspond to the weakly nonlinear theory finally low amplitude undulations may be successfully represented by linear waves the study is limited to non breaking waves it should be noted that the diagram proposed by le méhauté 1976 refers only to progressive waves a comprehensive description of the ranges of applicability of linear and nonlinear theories to standing wave problems is not yet available in this context the presented study provides important information on the accuracy of available standing wave solutions within an analyzed sub range of conditions corresponding to deepwater and transitional water waves 3 3 free surface oscillations the superposition of incident and reflected waves of equal amplitude which propagate at the same speed but in opposing directions leads to the formation of standing waves in the direct vicinity of a vertical wall the undulatory water surface is determined by a system of characteristic points called nodes and anti nodes free surface oscillations reach the highest amplitude at the position of the rigid vertical wall which becomes the first anti node upon increasing the distance from the wall free surface oscillations are consequently reduced leading to a minimum displacement amplitude at the first node the spacing between the nodes and anti nodes equals one quarter of the length of the incident wave in fig 3 a schematic view of a regular standing wave with positions of nodes and anti nodes is presented the numerical wavemaker model is first used to calculate free surface displacement in the vicinity of a vertical wall in figs 4 12 the oscillatory motion of the water surface is presented as a function of time for two particular positions corresponding to the setup of numerical gauges presented in fig 3 the anti node at a vertical wall seaward face x l and the node one quarter of a wavelength away from the wall x l l 4 in figs 4 12 the respective results of fourier analysis are provided for each case to demonstrate a contribution from higher harmonics to free surface kinematics of standing waves the numerical data are compared with the results provided by analytical solutions of linear weakly nonlinear second order and fifth order theories for standing waves in order to obtain consistent comparisons free surface oscillations calculated using the fifth order solution are corrected with respect to the bernoulli constant see dean and dalrymple 1984 sobey 2009 for details in this way the vertical positions of the air water interface defined by both coordinate system conventions corresponding to the x axis position located either at the still water level for the presented nonlinear wavemaker model paprota and sulisz 2018 and the weakly nonlinear solution by dalzell 1999 or at the mean water level for the leading order solution by sobey 2009 are matched it may be seen from figs 4 12 that increasing the amplitude results in a noticeable departure from a sinusoidal profile of the linear standing wave at an anti node the second harmonic grows modifying a standing wave profile which is now characterized by steeper crests and flattened troughs at the node position a sinusoidal oscillation of double the frequency of a primary wave starts to appear when waves become steeper also as a result of a growing second harmonic component the superposition of primary and secondary wave components shifts the maxima and minima of free surface oscillations at anti nodes vertically when compared to a linear standing wave profile a contribution from a secondary wave component grows with the increasing amplitude and wavelength in the case of waves of moderate steepness and steep waves the secondary harmonic component amplitude constitutes 4 and 8 for waves of l h 2 and 2 h h 0 1 and 0 2 s2 and s3 5 and 10 for waves of l h 4 and 2 h h 0 2 and 0 4 s5 and s6 8 and 16 for waves of l h 8 and 2 h h 0 2 and 0 4 s8 and s9 of the primary wave amplitude respectively for the longest wave of the highest amplitude s9 the third harmonic emerges minimally and contributes to the overall harmonic structure as its amplitude is only 2 of the primary wave component fig 12 an important outcome of the analysis constitutes a comparison between fully nonlinear model results and respective values calculated by means of analytical formulas the fifth order solution gives almost perfect agreement with the numerical model at the anti nodes relative differences are less than 0 3 and 0 2 for the first and second harmonic respectively and satisfactory agreement at the nodes up to 9 for the secondary component amplitude of the highest and longest wave case s9 however it may be concluded that both second and fifth order perturbation approaches provide very good predictions of the free surface profile of the analyzed standing waves in fact visible albeit small differences between second and fifth order profiles appear only in fig 12 corresponding to the steepest and longest wave case a minimal advantage of the fifth order solution may be noticed by looking at fourier amplitudes which are slightly overestimated by the second order solution figs 5 6 8 9 11 12 relative differences between primary and secondary component magnitudes are low and may reach up to 2 for the primary wave component amplitude and up to 11 for the secondary harmonic amplitude with respect to the highest values fig 12 although the analysis of analytical results is intentionally limited to the first second and fifth order solutions it is worth noting that the fourth order and the fifth order solutions give very similar results the relative differences are less than 0 5 for the primary wave amplitude while the secondary wave component agrees almost perfectly 0 3 the primary wave amplitude predicted by the third order solution still corresponds to the relative difference of less than 0 5 while the amplitude of the secondary harmonic analytically predicted up to the third order is similar to the second order result 3 4 particle kinematics the analysis of water motion under a standing wave with respect to particle trajectories is a source of important information on the instantaneous redistribution of water elements at the nodes anti nodes and other parts of a region adjacent to a seaward face of a vertical breakwater spatial profiles of a standing wave corresponding to extreme displacements of a free surface shown schematically in fig 3 provide only limited information on the undulatory behavior of air water interface therefore a complete picture of intermediate states of the motion of water particles which either form an upper surface boundary or a water layer below it is derived through a presentation of particle paths in a number of locations occupied by an oscillating water body in figs 13 18 trajectories of water particles under a standing wave are presented for waves of moderate steepness l h 2 and 2 h h 0 1 s2 l h 4 8 and 2 h h 0 2 s5 s8 and steep waves l h 2 and 2 h h 0 2 s3 l h 4 8 and 2 h h 0 4 s6 s9 the graphs are complemented by a spatial representation of a standing wave at two characteristic phase instants corresponding to the trough and the crest occurrence at the wall position determining the maximum range of particle motion in order to better recognize the differences between the numerical model and the second and fifth order solution the predicted particle trajectories in enlarged regions which correspond to the node an intermediate location and the anti node in the direct proximity of a vertical structure are provided in figs 13 18 a characteristic pattern emerges when looking at particle trajectories under a standing wave the particle paths are no longer closed elliptical orbits as in the case of progressive waves but the moving particles form lines which are horizontal at the nodes figs 13b 18b vertically oriented at the anti nodes figs 13d 18d and oblique in between figs 13c 18c contrary to linear waves with increasing steepness and hence wave nonlinearity the horizontal and oblique paths become bended at the nodes and at intermediate locations while the length of a particle trajectory grows with the wavelength and wave amplitude figs 13c 18c on the other hand the anti node particle path remains straight and at the surface its length equals to the height of a standing wave fluid motion becomes weaker with the increasing water depth vertical particle oscillations decrease rapidly until they vanish at the bottom similarly to horizontal particle displacements under deepwater waves l h 2 figs 13 and 14 for larger wavelengths the decrease of the horizontal amplitude of particle oscillations is less pronounced when moving to the deeper parts of a water column at the bottom the horizontal particle trajectory length is reduced by approx 50 to 60 in relation to the corresponding particle trajectory length at the surface for waves of l h 4 2 h h 0 2 s5 and 0 4 s6 respectively figs 15 and 16 for the longest analyzed waves of l h 8 figs 17 and 18 the reduction along with depth reaches approx 8 and 25 of the horizontal amplitude of particle oscillations at the surface for waves of 2 h h 0 2 s8 and 0 4 s9 respectively some practical information on the accuracy of analytical solutions to the standing wave problem may be derived from the comparison between particle trajectories presented in figs 13 18 the second order solution may be recommended for waves of moderate steepness l h 2 2 h h 0 1 l h 4 2 h h 0 2 and l h 8 2 h h 0 2 s2 s5 and s8 as maximum differences with respect to the numerical model do not exceed 2 of the length of particle trajectories at the surface for steeper waves l h 2 2 h h 0 2 l h 4 2 h h 0 4 and l h 8 2 h h 0 4 s3 s6 and s9 respective differences may reach 5 8 within the severe conditions of steep waves the fifth order solution is very accurate and only occasionally differs from the numerical solution by slightly more than 1 the highest difference is identified for the deepwater case s3 at the anti node where the corresponding relative difference is approx 1 5 of the amplitude of particle displacements it should be noted that the analysis is performed for particle paths in the direct vicinity of a structure as the distance from the structure becomes larger the departure of analytically predicted particle paths from respective numerical trajectories increases due to the fact that the fifth order dispersion relation which is used to calculate the periodic parameters of wavemaker paddle oscillation in the numerical flume overestimates the wave period thus the wavelengths of numerical standing waves are larger by 0 5 and 1 8 for waves of l h 2 and 2 h h 0 1 s2 and 0 2 s3 and 0 2 and 0 6 for waves of l h 4 and 2 h h 0 2 s5 and 0 4 s6 the differences may seem small but the resulting mismatch between the analytical and numerical locations which appears as a departure from respective horizontal and vertical trajectories at the nodes and anti nodes becomes noticeable see figs 13a 14a 15a 16a for the longest analyzed waves of l h 8 and 2 h h 0 2 s8 and 0 4 s9 the analytical prediction of wave dispersion exhibits a very good agreement with the derived numerical model this may suggest that for steep standing waves formed in deepwater and at water depths approaching the deepwater limit higher order corrections to dispersion relation are necessary to provide accurate results with respect to particle kinematics far away from the vertical wall 3 5 velocity pressure and forces a complete description of standing wave mechanics requires information on the dynamic features of a wave field in front of a vertical wall the starting point of this part of the analysis is the application of the unsteady bernoulli equation eq 17 which is used to calculate the total pressure field of a standing wave the excess of pressure due to wave motion is then extracted from the total pressure to present the dynamic effects of wave action on a vertical structure the analysis of velocity and pressure fields is of significant importance for marine engineers and scientists as it is directly related to the evaluation of forces exerted on coastal and offshore structures dean and dalrymple 1984 the reference predictions of hydrodynamic pressure and resulting wave forces provided by means of the derived fully nonlinear numerical method are compared with analytical solutions and simplified engineering formulas to test the performance of available approaches to the evaluation of wave loads for a practical design of vertical wall breakwaters in figs 19 21 sequences of hydrodynamic states of regular standing waves at representative phases corresponding to the trough the crest and zero up and down crossings occurring at the position of a vertical wall are depicted for the highest analyzed waves of l h 2 s3 4 s6 and 8 s9 it should be noted here that contour graphs of wave excess pressure span from the bottom to the free surface at the crests and to the still water level at the troughs the way of presentation is related to the accepted definition of hydrodynamic pressure wave pressure is calculated as the total pressure of water under a standing wave reduced by a still water hydrostatic thrust according to eq 22 the presented velocity pressure patterns reveal typical dynamic features of a standing wave starting from the first zero crossing position figs 19a 21a the water rises at the second anti node x l l 2 from the wall and falls at the wall anti node x l while at the nodes the water moves in the direction of the second anti node the pressure distribution exhibits some fluctuations around very small values near the surface for deepwater waves due to first order wave effects l h 2 s3 fig 19a reaching slightly higher values at the anti nodes where the water is pushed down x l and x l l a similar albeit reverse pattern of pressure is observed for the second zero crossing position of the considered deepwater wave fig 19c for the longest analyzed waves at both zero crossing phases l h 8 s9 fig 21a and c the pressure is predominantly driven by second order processes leading to negative pressure at the anti nodes x l l l 2 and l l and some surplus of thrust at the nodes x l l 4 and x l 3 l 4 the analysis of an intermediate wave case l h 4 s6 fig 20a and c indicates that pressure distribution is affected by both first and second order oscillations which leads to a more complicated image due to a superposition of two hydrodynamic states at both stages corresponding to maximal free surface displacements figs 19b 21b and 19d 21d the hydrodynamic pressure reaches highest values at the crests with the maximum located at the still water level lowest and negative values are identified at the troughs with the pressure minimum coinciding with the lowest position of the free surface this is due to the fact that wave pressure is positively correlated with the dominant effect of free surface elevation dean and dalrymple 1984 from the still water level at the crest position pressure maximum up to the surface and from the maximal negative free surface displacement at the trough pressure minimum to the still water level the distribution of pressure is hydrostatic below these levels the values of pressure decrease according to the first order pressure response factor cosh κ z h cosh κ h with increasing depth dean and dalrymple 1984 the decay of absolute pressure is substantial for deepwater waves figs 19b and d leading to the vanishing of the first order hydrodynamic thrust when the depth goes to infinity while for longer waves figs 20b 21b and 20d 21d the hydrodynamic imprint at the bottom becomes significant as the reduction of hydrodynamic pressure with depth decreases with increasing wavelength a mostly qualitative discussion of figs 19 21 is supplemented by a more detailed evaluation of the vertical hydrodynamic pressure distribution at the position of a vertical wall corresponding to the respective crest and trough occurrences presented in figs 22 24 for the standing wave cases of low amplitude at the crests and troughs figs 22a 24a it is clearly seen that the decrease of wave pressure along with the depth depends on the first order response factor the pressure at the bottom constitutes approx 8 40 and 75 of the maximum pressure value at the still water level for low amplitude waves of 2 h h 0 01 l h 2 s1 4 s4 and 8 s7 the analysis reveals some interesting results when the steepness and hence nonlinearity of waves increases a second order shift of the bottom pressure towards negative values appears for both phases figs 22bc 24bc the reduction of pressure at the crest and an increase of negative thrust at the trough is substantial for deepwater waves figs 22b and c leading to negative values at the crest phase for the highest waves of l h 2 and 2 h h 0 2 s3 this non intuitive result was first reported by miche 1944 who pointed out that the second order contribution to the hydrodynamic pressure does not decay exponentially in an infinite depth water limit but leaves a noticeable imprint at the bottom as waves become steeper fenton 1985 it is interesting to note that according to longuet higgins 1950 the second order pressure variation due to deepwater standing waves may lead to microseismic activity of the ocean floor the comparison between the numerical model and the analytical solution indicates that the first order solution is applicable not only to waves of very small amplitudes figs 22a 24a but it also performs reasonably well and gives acceptable overestimation for all analyzed longer wave cases fig 24 the relative differences between the numerical and linear values of bottom pressure are lower than 14 and 5 and for maximum absolute values they are lower than 16 and 11 for the crest and trough phase at the wall respectively the second order solution works satisfactorily well for steeper waves s3 s6 and s9 in which the relative differences are of the order of 10 for maximal positive and negative wave pressure values while the predictions for moderate waves s2 s5 and s8 are good and do not exceed 4 the expected improvement may be achieved by the application of the fifth order solution which exhibits a very good agreement with the numerical values corresponding to relative differences only occasionally exceeding 2 of relative maximal pressure values for the highest waves a valuable indicator of the accuracy of the presented numerical model and leading order analytical solutions is the requirement of the vanishing of the total pressure at the surface according to eq 3 when the dynamic free surface condition is not satisfied the resulting pressure at the crest surface at the wall reaches a finite value while at the trough a discontinuity of pressure at the surface emerges it may be seen in figs 22b 24b and more clearly in figs 22c 24c that the first and second order solutions exhibit positive values of pressure at the crest surface and an apparent discontinuity at the trough the highest erratic values for waves of moderate steepness and steep waves in relation to the standing wave amplitude h are approx 17 s2 and 37 s3 for the first order solution 4 s5 and 18 s6 for the second order solution 0 1 s8 and 1 s9 for the fifth order solution and 0 3 s5 and 2 s6 for numerical results it confirms the accuracy of the numerical model and the fifth order solution and gives almost excellent agreement with this respect the analysis also indicates that the accuracy of the first and second order solutions decreases rapidly with the wave steepness the results presented in figs 22 24 are complemented by characteristic pressure values at the bottom crest and trough phase still water level crest phase and the surface trough phase calculated by means of engineering methods it may be seen that the crude linear estimate of the pressure distribution in relation to analytical and numerical solutions leads to substantial differences at intermediate levels fig 22 the largest discrepancy for deepwater waves is due to the fact that the pressure depth dependency is strongly exponential while for longer waves the pressure response factor approaches unity and the linear assumption of engineering formulas works fairly well fig 24 moreover with increasing wave steepness the second order based miche rundgren method gives a better estimate of the bottom pressure as it properly predicts a nonlinear shift of pressure towards negative values for shorter waves contrary to an incorrectly symmetric pressure profile of the first order based sainflou approach figs 22a b c on the other hand the goda method which is originally derived for irregular waves underestimates the pressure for most analyzed cases but the predictions get closer to accurate results of higher order models when the wave steepness increases the ultimate evaluation of the applicability of the presented solutions to the design of marine structures is carried out with respect to the calculation of hydrodynamic loads acting on a vertical wall in fig 25 analytical solutions and the numerical model results of an instantaneous force predicted at the position of the structure are presented supplementary information on wave loads approximated by engineering formulas are provided as horizontal lines corresponding to the maximum hydrodynamic force magnitudes at the crests and troughs in the range of small to moderate wave heights represented by standing waves of l h 2 and 2 h h 0 01 s1 l h 4 2 h h 0 01 s4 l h 8 2 h h 0 01 0 2 s7 s8 fig 25a d c g h and i the oscillatory hydrodynamic force pattern is sinusoidal the first second and fifth order profiles coincide with the numerical results the differences start to appear with increasing wave steepness in the case of deepwater waves of l h 2 and 2 h h 0 1 s2 and more clearly for 2 h h 0 2 s3 the first order solution becomes less accurate as it fails to predict the second order shift of pressure values for the s3 case the presence of the shift eventually leads to the maximum force occurrence before the wave crest arrives at the wall see also fenton 1985 in the case of increasingly nonlinear longer waves of l h 4 2 h h 0 2 and 0 4 s5 and s6 as well as a standing wave of l h 8 and 2 h h 0 4 s9 the consecutive order solutions give gradually better results converging to the numerical profiles characterized by flattened segments of maximal force neighborhood as the order of perturbation series increases fig 25c f and i the analysis of the engineering evaluations presented in fig 25 indicates that the sainflou and miche rundgren methods overestimate maximum force values and are less accurate for shorter waves as previously stated the pressure values at intermediate depths are larger due to a rough trapezoidal approximation of vertical pressure distribution it is worth noting that the goda method works much better especially for steeper waves engineering results provided by the goda method overpredict an accurate hydrodynamic pressure magnitude for deepwater waves of l h 2 s1 s3 and lower heights of transitional water waves corresponding to l h 4 8 and 2 h h 0 01 0 2 s4 s5 s7 s8 respectively in the case of the highest waves the values are overestimated for waves of l h 4 2 h h 0 4 s6 and slightly underestimated for waves of l h 8 2 h h 0 4 s9 a more in depth analysis is provided in table 2 where the predicted values of hydrodynamic force are presented along with relative differences of absolute force magnitude acting on a vertical wall for analytical numerical and engineering methods the results indicate that for small amplitude waves of 2 h h 0 01 s1 s4 s7 analytical solutions reveal an almost excellent agreement with the reference outcome of the numerical model since the differences are less than 2 the linear solution inability of the second order shift prediction results in a high discrepancy for the steeper deepwater wave of 2 h h 0 1 s2 and 2 h h 0 2 s3 reaching over 40 and 60 of overestimation at the crests and approx 20 and 30 underprediction at the troughs of the hydrodynamic force respectively the first order prediction is however improved with increasing wavelength the second order solution performs best for deepwater waves where the relative differences are of the order of a few percent regardless the wave height while for longer waves the accuracy declines in fact the first order predictions are better than at the second order for the longest analyzed waves of l h 8 s7 s8 s9 the fifth order solution remains still the best choice for evaluation of the hydrodynamics of standing waves for all the presented wave cases as the relative differences between analytical and numerical values reach the maximum of around 3 for the wave case of l h 4 and 2 h h 0 4 s3 and less than approx 2 in all remaining cases in the low amplitude range of wave conditions the engineering formulas of sainflou and miche rundgren overestimate wave loads by approx 70 20 and 5 for relative depths of l h 2 s1 4 s4 and 8 s7 respectively the poor performance of both approaches in a deepwater range for higher amplitudes 2 h h 0 1 s2 and 2 h h 0 2 s3 corresponding to relative differences exceeding by far 100 stays in contrast to the goda method where the inaccuracy is of the order of 50 for the most demanding s3 case however sainflou and miche rundgren may be equally recommended to be applied to longer waves where the linear depth dependency of pressure is more reliable for the longest analyzed waves the relative differences are less than 20 overall the goda method seems to be the most reasonable engineering choice for fast hydrodynamic force evaluation at a vertical wall for the most severe wave conditions in transitional waters as the estimates correspond to relative differences of less than approx 10 an alternative method of a fast evaluation of hydrodynamic forces for the design of coastal and offshore structures with an upright section is to use the successfully verified higher order standing wave solution derived by sobey 2009 and extend the calculations to cover the range of wave conditions relevant from an engineering point of view the results are then depicted in a practical engineering diagram which permits a fast determination of forces preserving high accuracy of the fifth order approximation in fig 26 fifth order hydrodynamic forces of non breaking standing waves of relative heights in a range 0 01 h h 0 6 and relative depths corresponding to a range of the dimensionless parameter h g t 2 between 0 and 0 118 are provided together with the reference prediction of the numerical model for all analyzed wave cases the isolines of equal relative wave height are limited by the occurrence of the fifth order expansion breakdown in a shallow water range 4 π 2 h g t 0 5 and the maximum steepness corresponding to a minimum vertical acceleration at the crest a more stringent condition than the maximum crest elevation an extensive discussion of the fifth order solution validity range is provided by sobey 2009 4 conclusions the problem of nonlinear standing waves formed in front of a vertical wall is solved using a nonlinear pseudo spectral wavemaker model derived under potential flow assumptions an extensive and detailed description of a standing wave field is provided instantaneous velocities particle paths pressure and forces are compared with corresponding values calculated using first second and fifth order periodic perturbation expansion solutions giving an excellent agreement between the numerical and fifth order analytical predictions recognized engineering methods of sainflou miche rundgren and goda are applied to judge their suitability with respect to basic wave scenarios and a wide range of wave conditions the analysis indicates that the sainflou and miche rundgren formulas may be recommended for longer waves which exhibit linear decay of pressure with depth while the goda method is preferable for the most severe wave conditions in transitional waters the analytical and numerical models give much better evaluations of hydrodynamic forces especially in the deepwater range thus the most accurate fifth order analytical approach is used to derive a practical engineering diagram for the precise evaluation of non breaking wave loads exerted on a vertical wall within a range of validity of the leading order perturbation solution although the reliability of the reference numerical wavemaker model has been confirmed by experimental data for a wide range of conditions and various wave regimes still more laboratory tests involving regular standing wave formation at a vertical wall are called for to provide precise measurements of free surface elevation velocity and most importantly pressure and forces for the validation of accuracy of the higher order analytical and numerical approaches moreover in order to identify the limits of the applicability of available theories the experimental investigation should also consider the determination of breaking criteria for steep standing waves declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a analytical solutions to standing wave problem basic parameters and expedient physical quantities of a wave field near the vertical wall may be efficiently acquired from analytical solutions to the standing wave problem accordingly within the framework of potential theory the transient boundary value problem defined by a set of eqs 1 6 is simplified by replacing the wavemaker eq 5 and the no flow condition at the vertical wall eq 6 with a requirement of periodicity at lateral boundaries of a computational domain i e a 1 ϕ x z t ϕ x l z t ϕ x z t t where t and l are the period and length of a regular standing wave respectively further simplification results from the assumption of a sufficiently small amplitude of a considered wave allowing free surface conditions eqs 2 and 3 to be linearized as a 2 η t ϕ z 0 z 0 a 3 ϕ t g η 0 z 0 the process of linearization of free surface boundary conditions is equivalent to expanding eqs 2 and 3 in a taylor series according to eqs 7 and 8 and writing out only the terms up to the first order thus the formulated periodic boundary value problem is linear one of its solutions provides the standing wave potential and free surface displacements in the following forms dean and dalrymple 1984 a 4 1 ϕ x z t h g σ cosh κ z h cosh κ h cos κ x sin σ t a 5 1 η x t h cos κ x cos σ t where h denotes the height of component incident and reflected waves σ 2 π t is the standing wave angular frequency and κ 2 π l represents the standing wave number second order weakly nonlinear formulas are derived by expanding eqs 2 and 3 in a taylor series according to eqs 7 and 8 and retaining the terms up to the second order the free surface boundary conditions become sulisz and paprota 2004 a 6 η t ϕ z ϕ x η x η ϕ z z 0 z 0 a 7 ϕ t 1 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ z 2 η ϕ z t g η 0 z 0 the solution is then derived in a form proposed by dalzell 1999 to give respective weakly nonlinear corrections to the first order standing wave velocity potential eq a 4 and the first order surface elevation function eq a 5 as a 8 2 ϕ x z t h 2 σ 16 3 coth 2 κ h sin 2 σ t 3 h 2 σ

free surface elevation eq a 9 is different from the form proposed by wehausen and laitone 1960 as it includes an additional time independent term i e the first term at the right hand side of eq a 9 which results from the non zero mean elevation convention the description of a standing wave field becomes more complicated when the analytical procedure admits higher order nonlinearities sobey 2009 derived a fifth order solution for standing waves based on a stokes like analytical theory and presented velocity potential and free surface elevation functions in the form of small parameter perturbation expansions sobey formulas correct up to the second order derived under zero mean elevation convention are consistent with wehausen and laitone 1960 moreover since the linear dispersion relation of the form σ 2 g κ tanh κ h is valid only up to the second order the solution procedure requires expansion of angular wave frequency for higher orders consecutive corrections appear at the third and fifth order of the perturbation approach see sobey 2009 for details appendix b engineering wave pressure formulas the wave or dynamic pressure exerted on an upright section of a breakwater may be estimated using engineering formulas assuming a low amplitude of the incident wave and linear pressure distribution at the position of a vertical wall moreover the geometry of the standing wave generation problem and hydrodynamic parameters allow wave breaking and overtopping processes to be excluded from theoretical considerations the simplified standing wave problem was solved for the dynamic pressure at the position of a vertical wall seaward face by sainflou 1928 based on the trochoidal wave theory tsinker 1997 in fig b 27 a schematic diagram of standing wave pressure exerted on a vertical wall for the crest and the trough phase is presented the characteristic values of pressure s p for the sainflou method are sainflou 1928 usa 2002 b 1 s p 1 s p 2 ρ g h h s δ 0 h h s δ 0 b 2

corrections to the method of sainflou allows pressure exerted by steeper waves on a vertical wall to be evaluated more precisely by applying the second order solution derived by miche 1944 the

shore protection manual usa 1984 the second order miche rundgren method is more accurate as compared to sainflou with respect to experimentally measured forces on vertical walls for steeper waves while the sainflou method performance for longer waves of lower steepness appears better another widely applied approach for wave pressure assessment exerted on an upright section of a composite breakwater which admits a relatively small angle of incidence and wave irregularity was derived by goda 1974 based on theoretical principals experimental results and calibration with respect to case studies of prototype breakwaters goda 1974 provided formulas for characteristic pressure values assuming a linear distribution of hydrodynamic pressure below a simplified version of the goda pressure

2 κ h ρ g h b 12 g p 2 g p 1 cosh κ h according to goda 2000 the elevation of water above the still water level for the considered problem equals 1 5 h thus a vertical shift in the wave crest of the goda method is simply b 13 g δ 0 0 5 h eqs b 11 and b 12 give only the values of pressure under a standing wave crest goda 2000 recommends to calculate the pressure under a wave trough using a theoretical solution to the finite amplitude standing wave problem with some modifications supported by experimental data the diagrams covering total and bottom pressure during the trough phase are provided in goda 2000 finally hydrodynamic forces acting on an upright seaward face of a breakwater may be calculated using the presented engineering formulas as an integral of a vertical wave pressure distribution which corresponds to an area enclosed by a triangle and a trapezoid see fig b 27 the hydrodynamic force for the crest occurrence at a vertical wall is b 14 f c 1 2 h δ 0 p 1 p 1

21260,a theoretical description of fluid motion under mechanically generated nonlinear standing waves in the vicinity of a rigid vertical wall is presented a standing wave system is formed through the interaction of mechanically driven progressive waves and waves reflected at a vertical wall which is located at the far end of the numerical flume an original approach is applied to provide complete information on standing wave field with respect to instantaneous velocities particle paths and pressure the numerical kinematics of standing waves are compared with corresponding linear weakly nonlinear and higher order periodic predictions derived within the framework of the perturbation theory an excellent agreement between the numerical and the fifth order analytical solution results is achieved the magnitude of dynamic pressure exerted on a vertical rigid wall is also confronted with the corresponding values acquired from simplified engineering formulas which are used as widely accepted standards for the evaluation of hydrodynamic loads on coastal and offshore structures an engineering diagram based on the fifth order analytical solution constitutes a practical outcome of the study and it allows hydrodynamic loads exerted on a vertical wall to be more accurately quantified for a wide spectrum of non breaking wave conditions keywords water waves vertical breakwaters standing waves hydrodynamic forces wave flume 1 introduction the safe and economic design of vertical breakwaters relies on a successful assessment of hydrodynamic forces calculated as an integral of pressure exerted on an upright section of a structure incoming waves are reflected at a vertical obstacle and form a system of standing or partially standing oscillations the considered wave problem may be analytically or numerically solved basing on available linear and nonlinear theories of fluid mechanics to eventually give high fidelity information on the characteristics of a wave field in front of a structure and provide accurate estimates of hydrodynamic loads however such a scientific approach requires time and expert knowledge on wave mechanics mathematics and numerical tools that is why simplified engineering methods were developed to facilitate design procedures with respect to the assessment of wave pressure and resulting hydrodynamic forces which reduce the cost of marine investments and workload a brief overview of available scientific and engineering approaches to the problem of standing waves acting on vertical structures is given below recognized engineering wave pressure formulas are those of sainflou 1928 for head on fully reflected waves miche 1944 and rundgren 1958 for head on fully and partially reflected waves withsecond order correction and goda 1974 for irregular waves all the methods are applicable to non breaking waves reflecting at an impermeable wall and assume trapezoidal pressure distribution due to waves the sainflou miche rundgren and goda approaches with their modifications are widely applied in coastal engineering and support the design of vertical marine structures as well as composite breakwaters with an upright seaward face usa 1984 2002 important practical guidelines for the determination of hydrodynamic forces exerted on marine structures with a vertical front which involve more complex engineering cases such as arbitrary geometries of breakwater layouts breaking wave impacts three dimensional effects etc are covered by the shore protection manual usa 1984 and more recently and extensively by the coastal engineering manual usa 2002 see also goda 2000 and romańczyk 2007 for a more comprehensive literature review since the present study concerns regular standing waves formed in the vicinity of a vertical wall without the loss of stability due to breaking wave pressure formulas applicable to loads on a structure from breaking waves are not discussed the generation of standing water waves is a classical problem of fluid structure interaction it may be solved analytically under potential flow assumptions as a simple harmonic oscillation problem within the framework of linear wave theory see e g stoker 1957 dean and dalrymple 1984 and higher order nonlinear perturbation approaches see e g tadjbakhsh and keller 1960 goda 1967 fenton 1985 dalzell 1999 chen et al 2009 sobey 2009 for steeper waves the application of analytical higher order solutions should be however made with caution since the derivation process involves very laborious algebra as a result long and complicated formulas may sometimes suffer from typographical errors and lead to disagreement between available theories see sobey 2009 magda 2012 for a more detailed discussion an alternative solution to the problem of steep standing waves is to use efficient fully nonlinear water wave models based on a spectral method e g dommermuth and yue 1987 west et al 1987 craig and sulem 1993 paprota et al 2018 paprota and sulisz 2019 or other numerical methods for nonlinear waves e g grilli et al 1989 kim and ertekin 2000 with a relevant definition of reflective conditions imposed at lateral boundaries still these approaches require initial conditions provided by analytical solutions on the other hand since standing waves are formed by incoming waves which are completely reflected by a vertical wall dean and dalrymple 1984 it is possible to create a standing wave system in a numerically modeled closed flume filled with water which initially is at rest for instance semi analytical methods based on the spectral collocation approach which constitute an efficient tool for the analysis of various water wave scenarios generated in a closed flume sulisz and paprota 2008 may be used in this context to support wave structure interaction studies the developed consecutive order pseudo spectral wavemaker solutions allow the mechanical generation of waves and associated processes to be investigated in large spatial domains at a relatively low computational cost sulisz and paprota 2008 ducrozet et al 2012 recently a complete fully nonlinear spectral solution to the wavemaker problem was derived by paprota and sulisz 2018 to resolve particle paths and mass transport in the immediate proximity of a wavemaker paddle the semi analytical method of computation was extensively and successfully verified with a significant amount of experimental wave flume data at the subsequent stages of the numerical model development which confirms its accuracy and reliability the following comparisons covered regular waves sulisz and paprota 2008 paprota and sulisz 2018 modulated deepwater wave trains sulisz and paprota 2011 solitons paprota et al 2018 and irregular pseudo random waves paprota and sulisz 2019 thus this method may be used to obtain an accurate prediction of the wave field in a region adjacent to a rigid vertical wall the numerical model provides high quality information on the distribution of pressure exerted on a vertical wall and as such it constitutes a powerful engineering tool for the precise calculation of instantaneous forces acting on a structure in the present paper a pseudo spectral solution to mechanically generated nonlinear water waves in a closed flume paprota and sulisz 2018 is applied to analyze steep standing waves the waves are generated at the wavemaker boundary and reflected at a rigid vertical wall located at the far end of the flume once a steady standing wave system is established spatial and temporal characteristics of the generated wave field are analyzed in the vicinity of a vertical wall the numerically calculated water particle paths velocity and pressure fields are analyzed and compared with the results of linear weakly nonlinear and higher order models as well as classical engineering wave pressure formulas which are typically used to estimate hydrodynamic loads on vertical walls at the design stage of coastal and offshore structures although the study discusses regular waves the model may successfully predict more complicated hydrodynamic systems which involve irregular sea states solitary waves and wave energy focusing scenarios contrary to analytical perturbation techniques the presented method may be directly generalized to three dimensional problems and give reliable predictions of strong incident reflected wave interference in the vicinity of real marine engineering structures admitting the irregularity and directional spread of severe sea states 2 materials and methods 2 1 statement of the problem the fundamentals of the theory and the pseudo spectral method are based on the work by paprota and sulisz 2018 the computational domain corresponds to a closed flume of the length of l which is filled with water of a constant depth of h fig 1 lateral boundaries are defined as rigid impermeable and vertical one is fixed and the other is allowed to move along a longitudinal direction to mimic a piston type wavemaker paddle in the domain which represents a closed flume of a finite uniform depth the irrotational motion of an inviscid and incompressible fluid is then considered the plane wave problem is defined in the cartesian coordinate system with the origin located at an intersection of the still water level and the wavemaker paddle zero position the vertical z axis points upwards while the x axis coincides with wave propagation see fig 1 accordingly the velocity vector field v x z t is expressed in terms of the velocity potential function ϕ x z t as v ϕ the initial boundary value problem is defined as follows 1 2 ϕ 0 h z η 2 η t ϕ x η x ϕ z 0 z η 3 ϕ t 1 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ z 2 g η 0 z η 4 ϕ z 0 z h 5 χ t ϕ x 0 x χ 6 ϕ x 0 x l where g is acceleration due to gravity the laplace continuity formula eq 1 holds for mass conservation in the entire computational domain free surface boundary conditions eqs 2 and 3 are imposed at the moving water surface lateral boundaries are defined as impervious at the piston type wavemaker eq 5 and at the far end of the flume eq 6 since boundary conditions eqs 2 and 3 must be applied at the free surface η which is unknown and is a part of the solution eqs 2 and 3 are expanded in a taylor series about the mean position together with eq 5 7 m 0 η m m m z m η t ϕ x η x ϕ z 0 z 0 8 m 0 η m m m z m ϕ t 1 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ z 2 g η 0 z 0 9 m

is focused on free surface displacements water particle trajectories as well as velocities pressure and forces corresponding to regular and steep standing waves which are generated mechanically the numerical model is first compared with the results acquired from simple analytical expressions provided by linear and weakly nonlinear theories for standing waves of low to moderate amplitudes and further using a fifth order approach applicable to steeper waves derived by sobey 2009 see appendix a a standing wave force which acts on the wall is then determined by integrating vertical pressure distribution the numerically calculated hydrodynamic loads are compared with the corresponding values of forces estimated by applying engineering pressure formulas of sainflou 1928 miche 1944 rundgren 1958 and goda 1974 see appendix b the accuracy of engineering methods in quantifying wave loads acting on vertical breakwaters and other marine structures with an upright section is investigated in closer detail 3 2 numerical tests standing waves are generated by waves induced by a monochromatic wavemaker motion and waves reflected at a rigid vertical wall at the far end of the numerical flume the study covers deepwater and transitional water cases represented by three ratios of wavelength to water depth l h equal to 2 4 and 8 the effect of wave steepness is studied in a range of relative wave heights selected to cover low amplitude waves waves of moderate steepness and steeper waves the simulated wave runs cover from 50 to 70 wave periods the waves are generated starting from rest a ramp function is applied to the stroke of the wavemaker motion for the first 10 to 15 waves securing a smooth transition between hydrostatic conditions and a fully developed wave motion a longitudinal dimension of a computational domain spans from 15 to 20 wavelengths for a given wave flume length and accepted hydrodynamic parameters a time interval used for the analysis is determined based on group velocities of generated waves and additional spurious free waves schäffer 1996 as it is necessary to eliminate the imprint of undesirable free oscillations on the resulting standing wave field in table 1 a summary of wave and computational domain characteristics is presented in fig 2 hydrodynamic conditions are defined using the diagram which shows ranges of suitability of recognized wave theories le méhauté 1976 it may be seen in fig 2 that the higher order theory is recommended for the steepest analyzed waves mechanically generated oscillations of moderate steepness correspond to the weakly nonlinear theory finally low amplitude undulations may be successfully represented by linear waves the study is limited to non breaking waves it should be noted that the diagram proposed by le méhauté 1976 refers only to progressive waves a comprehensive description of the ranges of applicability of linear and nonlinear theories to standing wave problems is not yet available in this context the presented study provides important information on the accuracy of available standing wave solutions within an analyzed sub range of conditions corresponding to deepwater and transitional water waves 3 3 free surface oscillations the superposition of incident and reflected waves of equal amplitude which propagate at the same speed but in opposing directions leads to the formation of standing waves in the direct vicinity of a vertical wall the undulatory water surface is determined by a system of characteristic points called nodes and anti nodes free surface oscillations reach the highest amplitude at the position of the rigid vertical wall which becomes the first anti node upon increasing the distance from the wall free surface oscillations are consequently reduced leading to a minimum displacement amplitude at the first node the spacing between the nodes and anti nodes equals one quarter of the length of the incident wave in fig 3 a schematic view of a regular standing wave with positions of nodes and anti nodes is presented the numerical wavemaker model is first used to calculate free surface displacement in the vicinity of a vertical wall in figs 4 12 the oscillatory motion of the water surface is presented as a function of time for two particular positions corresponding to the setup of numerical gauges presented in fig 3 the anti node at a vertical wall seaward face x l and the node one quarter of a wavelength away from the wall x l l 4 in figs 4 12 the respective results of fourier analysis are provided for each case to demonstrate a contribution from higher harmonics to free surface kinematics of standing waves the numerical data are compared with the results provided by analytical solutions of linear weakly nonlinear second order and fifth order theories for standing waves in order to obtain consistent comparisons free surface oscillations calculated using the fifth order solution are corrected with respect to the bernoulli constant see dean and dalrymple 1984 sobey 2009 for details in this way the vertical positions of the air water interface defined by both coordinate system conventions corresponding to the x axis position located either at the still water level for the presented nonlinear wavemaker model paprota and sulisz 2018 and the weakly nonlinear solution by dalzell 1999 or at the mean water level for the leading order solution by sobey 2009 are matched it may be seen from figs 4 12 that increasing the amplitude results in a noticeable departure from a sinusoidal profile of the linear standing wave at an anti node the second harmonic grows modifying a standing wave profile which is now characterized by steeper crests and flattened troughs at the node position a sinusoidal oscillation of double the frequency of a primary wave starts to appear when waves become steeper also as a result of a growing second harmonic component the superposition of primary and secondary wave components shifts the maxima and minima of free surface oscillations at anti nodes vertically when compared to a linear standing wave profile a contribution from a secondary wave component grows with the increasing amplitude and wavelength in the case of waves of moderate steepness and steep waves the secondary harmonic component amplitude constitutes 4 and 8 for waves of l h 2 and 2 h h 0 1 and 0 2 s2 and s3 5 and 10 for waves of l h 4 and 2 h h 0 2 and 0 4 s5 and s6 8 and 16 for waves of l h 8 and 2 h h 0 2 and 0 4 s8 and s9 of the primary wave amplitude respectively for the longest wave of the highest amplitude s9 the third harmonic emerges minimally and contributes to the overall harmonic structure as its amplitude is only 2 of the primary wave component fig 12 an important outcome of the analysis constitutes a comparison between fully nonlinear model results and respective values calculated by means of analytical formulas the fifth order solution gives almost perfect agreement with the numerical model at the anti nodes relative differences are less than 0 3 and 0 2 for the first and second harmonic respectively and satisfactory agreement at the nodes up to 9 for the secondary component amplitude of the highest and longest wave case s9 however it may be concluded that both second and fifth order perturbation approaches provide very good predictions of the free surface profile of the analyzed standing waves in fact visible albeit small differences between second and fifth order profiles appear only in fig 12 corresponding to the steepest and longest wave case a minimal advantage of the fifth order solution may be noticed by looking at fourier amplitudes which are slightly overestimated by the second order solution figs 5 6 8 9 11 12 relative differences between primary and secondary component magnitudes are low and may reach up to 2 for the primary wave component amplitude and up to 11 for the secondary harmonic amplitude with respect to the highest values fig 12 although the analysis of analytical results is intentionally limited to the first second and fifth order solutions it is worth noting that the fourth order and the fifth order solutions give very similar results the relative differences are less than 0 5 for the primary wave amplitude while the secondary wave component agrees almost perfectly 0 3 the primary wave amplitude predicted by the third order solution still corresponds to the relative difference of less than 0 5 while the amplitude of the secondary harmonic analytically predicted up to the third order is similar to the second order result 3 4 particle kinematics the analysis of water motion under a standing wave with respect to particle trajectories is a source of important information on the instantaneous redistribution of water elements at the nodes anti nodes and other parts of a region adjacent to a seaward face of a vertical breakwater spatial profiles of a standing wave corresponding to extreme displacements of a free surface shown schematically in fig 3 provide only limited information on the undulatory behavior of air water interface therefore a complete picture of intermediate states of the motion of water particles which either form an upper surface boundary or a water layer below it is derived through a presentation of particle paths in a number of locations occupied by an oscillating water body in figs 13 18 trajectories of water particles under a standing wave are presented for waves of moderate steepness l h 2 and 2 h h 0 1 s2 l h 4 8 and 2 h h 0 2 s5 s8 and steep waves l h 2 and 2 h h 0 2 s3 l h 4 8 and 2 h h 0 4 s6 s9 the graphs are complemented by a spatial representation of a standing wave at two characteristic phase instants corresponding to the trough and the crest occurrence at the wall position determining the maximum range of particle motion in order to better recognize the differences between the numerical model and the second and fifth order solution the predicted particle trajectories in enlarged regions which correspond to the node an intermediate location and the anti node in the direct proximity of a vertical structure are provided in figs 13 18 a characteristic pattern emerges when looking at particle trajectories under a standing wave the particle paths are no longer closed elliptical orbits as in the case of progressive waves but the moving particles form lines which are horizontal at the nodes figs 13b 18b vertically oriented at the anti nodes figs 13d 18d and oblique in between figs 13c 18c contrary to linear waves with increasing steepness and hence wave nonlinearity the horizontal and oblique paths become bended at the nodes and at intermediate locations while the length of a particle trajectory grows with the wavelength and wave amplitude figs 13c 18c on the other hand the anti node particle path remains straight and at the surface its length equals to the height of a standing wave fluid motion becomes weaker with the increasing water depth vertical particle oscillations decrease rapidly until they vanish at the bottom similarly to horizontal particle displacements under deepwater waves l h 2 figs 13 and 14 for larger wavelengths the decrease of the horizontal amplitude of particle oscillations is less pronounced when moving to the deeper parts of a water column at the bottom the horizontal particle trajectory length is reduced by approx 50 to 60 in relation to the corresponding particle trajectory length at the surface for waves of l h 4 2 h h 0 2 s5 and 0 4 s6 respectively figs 15 and 16 for the longest analyzed waves of l h 8 figs 17 and 18 the reduction along with depth reaches approx 8 and 25 of the horizontal amplitude of particle oscillations at the surface for waves of 2 h h 0 2 s8 and 0 4 s9 respectively some practical information on the accuracy of analytical solutions to the standing wave problem may be derived from the comparison between particle trajectories presented in figs 13 18 the second order solution may be recommended for waves of moderate steepness l h 2 2 h h 0 1 l h 4 2 h h 0 2 and l h 8 2 h h 0 2 s2 s5 and s8 as maximum differences with respect to the numerical model do not exceed 2 of the length of particle trajectories at the surface for steeper waves l h 2 2 h h 0 2 l h 4 2 h h 0 4 and l h 8 2 h h 0 4 s3 s6 and s9 respective differences may reach 5 8 within the severe conditions of steep waves the fifth order solution is very accurate and only occasionally differs from the numerical solution by slightly more than 1 the highest difference is identified for the deepwater case s3 at the anti node where the corresponding relative difference is approx 1 5 of the amplitude of particle displacements it should be noted that the analysis is performed for particle paths in the direct vicinity of a structure as the distance from the structure becomes larger the departure of analytically predicted particle paths from respective numerical trajectories increases due to the fact that the fifth order dispersion relation which is used to calculate the periodic parameters of wavemaker paddle oscillation in the numerical flume overestimates the wave period thus the wavelengths of numerical standing waves are larger by 0 5 and 1 8 for waves of l h 2 and 2 h h 0 1 s2 and 0 2 s3 and 0 2 and 0 6 for waves of l h 4 and 2 h h 0 2 s5 and 0 4 s6 the differences may seem small but the resulting mismatch between the analytical and numerical locations which appears as a departure from respective horizontal and vertical trajectories at the nodes and anti nodes becomes noticeable see figs 13a 14a 15a 16a for the longest analyzed waves of l h 8 and 2 h h 0 2 s8 and 0 4 s9 the analytical prediction of wave dispersion exhibits a very good agreement with the derived numerical model this may suggest that for steep standing waves formed in deepwater and at water depths approaching the deepwater limit higher order corrections to dispersion relation are necessary to provide accurate results with respect to particle kinematics far away from the vertical wall 3 5 velocity pressure and forces a complete description of standing wave mechanics requires information on the dynamic features of a wave field in front of a vertical wall the starting point of this part of the analysis is the application of the unsteady bernoulli equation eq 17 which is used to calculate the total pressure field of a standing wave the excess of pressure due to wave motion is then extracted from the total pressure to present the dynamic effects of wave action on a vertical structure the analysis of velocity and pressure fields is of significant importance for marine engineers and scientists as it is directly related to the evaluation of forces exerted on coastal and offshore structures dean and dalrymple 1984 the reference predictions of hydrodynamic pressure and resulting wave forces provided by means of the derived fully nonlinear numerical method are compared with analytical solutions and simplified engineering formulas to test the performance of available approaches to the evaluation of wave loads for a practical design of vertical wall breakwaters in figs 19 21 sequences of hydrodynamic states of regular standing waves at representative phases corresponding to the trough the crest and zero up and down crossings occurring at the position of a vertical wall are depicted for the highest analyzed waves of l h 2 s3 4 s6 and 8 s9 it should be noted here that contour graphs of wave excess pressure span from the bottom to the free surface at the crests and to the still water level at the troughs the way of presentation is related to the accepted definition of hydrodynamic pressure wave pressure is calculated as the total pressure of water under a standing wave reduced by a still water hydrostatic thrust according to eq 22 the presented velocity pressure patterns reveal typical dynamic features of a standing wave starting from the first zero crossing position figs 19a 21a the water rises at the second anti node x l l 2 from the wall and falls at the wall anti node x l while at the nodes the water moves in the direction of the second anti node the pressure distribution exhibits some fluctuations around very small values near the surface for deepwater waves due to first order wave effects l h 2 s3 fig 19a reaching slightly higher values at the anti nodes where the water is pushed down x l and x l l a similar albeit reverse pattern of pressure is observed for the second zero crossing position of the considered deepwater wave fig 19c for the longest analyzed waves at both zero crossing phases l h 8 s9 fig 21a and c the pressure is predominantly driven by second order processes leading to negative pressure at the anti nodes x l l l 2 and l l and some surplus of thrust at the nodes x l l 4 and x l 3 l 4 the analysis of an intermediate wave case l h 4 s6 fig 20a and c indicates that pressure distribution is affected by both first and second order oscillations which leads to a more complicated image due to a superposition of two hydrodynamic states at both stages corresponding to maximal free surface displacements figs 19b 21b and 19d 21d the hydrodynamic pressure reaches highest values at the crests with the maximum located at the still water level lowest and negative values are identified at the troughs with the pressure minimum coinciding with the lowest position of the free surface this is due to the fact that wave pressure is positively correlated with the dominant effect of free surface elevation dean and dalrymple 1984 from the still water level at the crest position pressure maximum up to the surface and from the maximal negative free surface displacement at the trough pressure minimum to the still water level the distribution of pressure is hydrostatic below these levels the values of pressure decrease according to the first order pressure response factor cosh κ z h cosh κ h with increasing depth dean and dalrymple 1984 the decay of absolute pressure is substantial for deepwater waves figs 19b and d leading to the vanishing of the first order hydrodynamic thrust when the depth goes to infinity while for longer waves figs 20b 21b and 20d 21d the hydrodynamic imprint at the bottom becomes significant as the reduction of hydrodynamic pressure with depth decreases with increasing wavelength a mostly qualitative discussion of figs 19 21 is supplemented by a more detailed evaluation of the vertical hydrodynamic pressure distribution at the position of a vertical wall corresponding to the respective crest and trough occurrences presented in figs 22 24 for the standing wave cases of low amplitude at the crests and troughs figs 22a 24a it is clearly seen that the decrease of wave pressure along with the depth depends on the first order response factor the pressure at the bottom constitutes approx 8 40 and 75 of the maximum pressure value at the still water level for low amplitude waves of 2 h h 0 01 l h 2 s1 4 s4 and 8 s7 the analysis reveals some interesting results when the steepness and hence nonlinearity of waves increases a second order shift of the bottom pressure towards negative values appears for both phases figs 22bc 24bc the reduction of pressure at the crest and an increase of negative thrust at the trough is substantial for deepwater waves figs 22b and c leading to negative values at the crest phase for the highest waves of l h 2 and 2 h h 0 2 s3 this non intuitive result was first reported by miche 1944 who pointed out that the second order contribution to the hydrodynamic pressure does not decay exponentially in an infinite depth water limit but leaves a noticeable imprint at the bottom as waves become steeper fenton 1985 it is interesting to note that according to longuet higgins 1950 the second order pressure variation due to deepwater standing waves may lead to microseismic activity of the ocean floor the comparison between the numerical model and the analytical solution indicates that the first order solution is applicable not only to waves of very small amplitudes figs 22a 24a but it also performs reasonably well and gives acceptable overestimation for all analyzed longer wave cases fig 24 the relative differences between the numerical and linear values of bottom pressure are lower than 14 and 5 and for maximum absolute values they are lower than 16 and 11 for the crest and trough phase at the wall respectively the second order solution works satisfactorily well for steeper waves s3 s6 and s9 in which the relative differences are of the order of 10 for maximal positive and negative wave pressure values while the predictions for moderate waves s2 s5 and s8 are good and do not exceed 4 the expected improvement may be achieved by the application of the fifth order solution which exhibits a very good agreement with the numerical values corresponding to relative differences only occasionally exceeding 2 of relative maximal pressure values for the highest waves a valuable indicator of the accuracy of the presented numerical model and leading order analytical solutions is the requirement of the vanishing of the total pressure at the surface according to eq 3 when the dynamic free surface condition is not satisfied the resulting pressure at the crest surface at the wall reaches a finite value while at the trough a discontinuity of pressure at the surface emerges it may be seen in figs 22b 24b and more clearly in figs 22c 24c that the first and second order solutions exhibit positive values of pressure at the crest surface and an apparent discontinuity at the trough the highest erratic values for waves of moderate steepness and steep waves in relation to the standing wave amplitude h are approx 17 s2 and 37 s3 for the first order solution 4 s5 and 18 s6 for the second order solution 0 1 s8 and 1 s9 for the fifth order solution and 0 3 s5 and 2 s6 for numerical results it confirms the accuracy of the numerical model and the fifth order solution and gives almost excellent agreement with this respect the analysis also indicates that the accuracy of the first and second order solutions decreases rapidly with the wave steepness the results presented in figs 22 24 are complemented by characteristic pressure values at the bottom crest and trough phase still water level crest phase and the surface trough phase calculated by means of engineering methods it may be seen that the crude linear estimate of the pressure distribution in relation to analytical and numerical solutions leads to substantial differences at intermediate levels fig 22 the largest discrepancy for deepwater waves is due to the fact that the pressure depth dependency is strongly exponential while for longer waves the pressure response factor approaches unity and the linear assumption of engineering formulas works fairly well fig 24 moreover with increasing wave steepness the second order based miche rundgren method gives a better estimate of the bottom pressure as it properly predicts a nonlinear shift of pressure towards negative values for shorter waves contrary to an incorrectly symmetric pressure profile of the first order based sainflou approach figs 22a b c on the other hand the goda method which is originally derived for irregular waves underestimates the pressure for most analyzed cases but the predictions get closer to accurate results of higher order models when the wave steepness increases the ultimate evaluation of the applicability of the presented solutions to the design of marine structures is carried out with respect to the calculation of hydrodynamic loads acting on a vertical wall in fig 25 analytical solutions and the numerical model results of an instantaneous force predicted at the position of the structure are presented supplementary information on wave loads approximated by engineering formulas are provided as horizontal lines corresponding to the maximum hydrodynamic force magnitudes at the crests and troughs in the range of small to moderate wave heights represented by standing waves of l h 2 and 2 h h 0 01 s1 l h 4 2 h h 0 01 s4 l h 8 2 h h 0 01 0 2 s7 s8 fig 25a d c g h and i the oscillatory hydrodynamic force pattern is sinusoidal the first second and fifth order profiles coincide with the numerical results the differences start to appear with increasing wave steepness in the case of deepwater waves of l h 2 and 2 h h 0 1 s2 and more clearly for 2 h h 0 2 s3 the first order solution becomes less accurate as it fails to predict the second order shift of pressure values for the s3 case the presence of the shift eventually leads to the maximum force occurrence before the wave crest arrives at the wall see also fenton 1985 in the case of increasingly nonlinear longer waves of l h 4 2 h h 0 2 and 0 4 s5 and s6 as well as a standing wave of l h 8 and 2 h h 0 4 s9 the consecutive order solutions give gradually better results converging to the numerical profiles characterized by flattened segments of maximal force neighborhood as the order of perturbation series increases fig 25c f and i the analysis of the engineering evaluations presented in fig 25 indicates that the sainflou and miche rundgren methods overestimate maximum force values and are less accurate for shorter waves as previously stated the pressure values at intermediate depths are larger due to a rough trapezoidal approximation of vertical pressure distribution it is worth noting that the goda method works much better especially for steeper waves engineering results provided by the goda method overpredict an accurate hydrodynamic pressure magnitude for deepwater waves of l h 2 s1 s3 and lower heights of transitional water waves corresponding to l h 4 8 and 2 h h 0 01 0 2 s4 s5 s7 s8 respectively in the case of the highest waves the values are overestimated for waves of l h 4 2 h h 0 4 s6 and slightly underestimated for waves of l h 8 2 h h 0 4 s9 a more in depth analysis is provided in table 2 where the predicted values of hydrodynamic force are presented along with relative differences of absolute force magnitude acting on a vertical wall for analytical numerical and engineering methods the results indicate that for small amplitude waves of 2 h h 0 01 s1 s4 s7 analytical solutions reveal an almost excellent agreement with the reference outcome of the numerical model since the differences are less than 2 the linear solution inability of the second order shift prediction results in a high discrepancy for the steeper deepwater wave of 2 h h 0 1 s2 and 2 h h 0 2 s3 reaching over 40 and 60 of overestimation at the crests and approx 20 and 30 underprediction at the troughs of the hydrodynamic force respectively the first order prediction is however improved with increasing wavelength the second order solution performs best for deepwater waves where the relative differences are of the order of a few percent regardless the wave height while for longer waves the accuracy declines in fact the first order predictions are better than at the second order for the longest analyzed waves of l h 8 s7 s8 s9 the fifth order solution remains still the best choice for evaluation of the hydrodynamics of standing waves for all the presented wave cases as the relative differences between analytical and numerical values reach the maximum of around 3 for the wave case of l h 4 and 2 h h 0 4 s3 and less than approx 2 in all remaining cases in the low amplitude range of wave conditions the engineering formulas of sainflou and miche rundgren overestimate wave loads by approx 70 20 and 5 for relative depths of l h 2 s1 4 s4 and 8 s7 respectively the poor performance of both approaches in a deepwater range for higher amplitudes 2 h h 0 1 s2 and 2 h h 0 2 s3 corresponding to relative differences exceeding by far 100 stays in contrast to the goda method where the inaccuracy is of the order of 50 for the most demanding s3 case however sainflou and miche rundgren may be equally recommended to be applied to longer waves where the linear depth dependency of pressure is more reliable for the longest analyzed waves the relative differences are less than 20 overall the goda method seems to be the most reasonable engineering choice for fast hydrodynamic force evaluation at a vertical wall for the most severe wave conditions in transitional waters as the estimates correspond to relative differences of less than approx 10 an alternative method of a fast evaluation of hydrodynamic forces for the design of coastal and offshore structures with an upright section is to use the successfully verified higher order standing wave solution derived by sobey 2009 and extend the calculations to cover the range of wave conditions relevant from an engineering point of view the results are then depicted in a practical engineering diagram which permits a fast determination of forces preserving high accuracy of the fifth order approximation in fig 26 fifth order hydrodynamic forces of non breaking standing waves of relative heights in a range 0 01 h h 0 6 and relative depths corresponding to a range of the dimensionless parameter h g t 2 between 0 and 0 118 are provided together with the reference prediction of the numerical model for all analyzed wave cases the isolines of equal relative wave height are limited by the occurrence of the fifth order expansion breakdown in a shallow water range 4 π 2 h g t 0 5 and the maximum steepness corresponding to a minimum vertical acceleration at the crest a more stringent condition than the maximum crest elevation an extensive discussion of the fifth order solution validity range is provided by sobey 2009 4 conclusions the problem of nonlinear standing waves formed in front of a vertical wall is solved using a nonlinear pseudo spectral wavemaker model derived under potential flow assumptions an extensive and detailed description of a standing wave field is provided instantaneous velocities particle paths pressure and forces are compared with corresponding values calculated using first second and fifth order periodic perturbation expansion solutions giving an excellent agreement between the numerical and fifth order analytical predictions recognized engineering methods of sainflou miche rundgren and goda are applied to judge their suitability with respect to basic wave scenarios and a wide range of wave conditions the analysis indicates that the sainflou and miche rundgren formulas may be recommended for longer waves which exhibit linear decay of pressure with depth while the goda method is preferable for the most severe wave conditions in transitional waters the analytical and numerical models give much better evaluations of hydrodynamic forces especially in the deepwater range thus the most accurate fifth order analytical approach is used to derive a practical engineering diagram for the precise evaluation of non breaking wave loads exerted on a vertical wall within a range of validity of the leading order perturbation solution although the reliability of the reference numerical wavemaker model has been confirmed by experimental data for a wide range of conditions and various wave regimes still more laboratory tests involving regular standing wave formation at a vertical wall are called for to provide precise measurements of free surface elevation velocity and most importantly pressure and forces for the validation of accuracy of the higher order analytical and numerical approaches moreover in order to identify the limits of the applicability of available theories the experimental investigation should also consider the determination of breaking criteria for steep standing waves declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a analytical solutions to standing wave problem basic parameters and expedient physical quantities of a wave field near the vertical wall may be efficiently acquired from analytical solutions to the standing wave problem accordingly within the framework of potential theory the transient boundary value problem defined by a set of eqs 1 6 is simplified by replacing the wavemaker eq 5 and the no flow condition at the vertical wall eq 6 with a requirement of periodicity at lateral boundaries of a computational domain i e a 1 ϕ x z t ϕ x l z t ϕ x z t t where t and l are the period and length of a regular standing wave respectively further simplification results from the assumption of a sufficiently small amplitude of a considered wave allowing free surface conditions eqs 2 and 3 to be linearized as a 2 η t ϕ z 0 z 0 a 3 ϕ t g η 0 z 0 the process of linearization of free surface boundary conditions is equivalent to expanding eqs 2 and 3 in a taylor series according to eqs 7 and 8 and writing out only the terms up to the first order thus the formulated periodic boundary value problem is linear one of its solutions provides the standing wave potential and free surface displacements in the following forms dean and dalrymple 1984 a 4 1 ϕ x z t h g σ cosh κ z h cosh κ h cos κ x sin σ t a 5 1 η x t h cos κ x cos σ t where h denotes the height of component incident and reflected waves σ 2 π t is the standing wave angular frequency and κ 2 π l represents the standing wave number second order weakly nonlinear formulas are derived by expanding eqs 2 and 3 in a taylor series according to eqs 7 and 8 and retaining the terms up to the second order the free surface boundary conditions become sulisz and paprota 2004 a 6 η t ϕ z ϕ x η x η ϕ z z 0 z 0 a 7 ϕ t 1 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ z 2 η ϕ z t g η 0 z 0 the solution is then derived in a form proposed by dalzell 1999 to give respective weakly nonlinear corrections to the first order standing wave velocity potential eq a 4 and the first order surface elevation function eq a 5 as a 8 2 ϕ x z t h 2 σ 16 3 coth 2 κ h sin 2 σ t 3 h 2 σ

free surface elevation eq a 9 is different from the form proposed by wehausen and laitone 1960 as it includes an additional time independent term i e the first term at the right hand side of eq a 9 which results from the non zero mean elevation convention the description of a standing wave field becomes more complicated when the analytical procedure admits higher order nonlinearities sobey 2009 derived a fifth order solution for standing waves based on a stokes like analytical theory and presented velocity potential and free surface elevation functions in the form of small parameter perturbation expansions sobey formulas correct up to the second order derived under zero mean elevation convention are consistent with wehausen and laitone 1960 moreover since the linear dispersion relation of the form σ 2 g κ tanh κ h is valid only up to the second order the solution procedure requires expansion of angular wave frequency for higher orders consecutive corrections appear at the third and fifth order of the perturbation approach see sobey 2009 for details appendix b engineering wave pressure formulas the wave or dynamic pressure exerted on an upright section of a breakwater may be estimated using engineering formulas assuming a low amplitude of the incident wave and linear pressure distribution at the position of a vertical wall moreover the geometry of the standing wave generation problem and hydrodynamic parameters allow wave breaking and overtopping processes to be excluded from theoretical considerations the simplified standing wave problem was solved for the dynamic pressure at the position of a vertical wall seaward face by sainflou 1928 based on the trochoidal wave theory tsinker 1997 in fig b 27 a schematic diagram of standing wave pressure exerted on a vertical wall for the crest and the trough phase is presented the characteristic values of pressure s p for the sainflou method are sainflou 1928 usa 2002 b 1 s p 1 s p 2 ρ g h h s δ 0 h h s δ 0 b 2

corrections to the method of sainflou allows pressure exerted by steeper waves on a vertical wall to be evaluated more precisely by applying the second order solution derived by miche 1944 the

shore protection manual usa 1984 the second order miche rundgren method is more accurate as compared to sainflou with respect to experimentally measured forces on vertical walls for steeper waves while the sainflou method performance for longer waves of lower steepness appears better another widely applied approach for wave pressure assessment exerted on an upright section of a composite breakwater which admits a relatively small angle of incidence and wave irregularity was derived by goda 1974 based on theoretical principals experimental results and calibration with respect to case studies of prototype breakwaters goda 1974 provided formulas for characteristic pressure values assuming a linear distribution of hydrodynamic pressure below a simplified version of the goda pressure formulas are provided for the case of regular head on waves reflecting at a vertical wall goda 2000 for the corresponding standing wave problem as presented in fig b 27 b 11 g p 1 0 6 2 κ 2 h 2 sinh 2 2 κ h ρ g h b 12 g p 2 g p 1 cosh κ h according to goda 2000 the elevation of water above the still water level for the considered problem equals 1 5 h thus a vertical shift in the wave crest of the goda method is simply b 13 g δ 0 0 5 h eqs b 11 and b 12 give only the values of pressure under a standing wave crest goda 2000 recommends to calculate the pressure under a wave trough using a theoretical solution to the finite amplitude standing wave problem with some modifications supported by experimental data the diagrams covering total and bottom pressure during the trough phase are provided in goda 2000 finally hydrodynamic forces acting on an upright seaward face of a breakwater may be calculated using the presented engineering formulas as an integral of a vertical wave pressure distribution which corresponds to an area enclosed by a triangle and a trapezoid see fig b 27 the hydrodynamic force for the crest occurrence at a vertical wall is b 14 f c 1 2 h δ 0 p 1 p 1

the numerical and experimental results is observed which demonstrates that the method is suitable for simulating fsi problems in ocean engineering keywords abm method 6dof strong coupling interface capture mesh motion 1 introduction the application of computational fluid dynamics cfd in engineering problems is becoming more and more popular with the rapid development of both theories and computer hardware in the evaluation of the six degrees of freedom 6dof motion of ships zhuang and wan 2017 platforms zhao et al 2020 or wave converters zhao et al 2019 numerical modelling plays an important role due to the high cost and difficulties in performing experiments there have been a substantial number of publications in the past decade aimed at improving the accuracy and efficiency of numerical approaches devolder et al 2015 schmitt and elsaesser 2015 palm et al 2016 ransley et al 2017 one of the most critical issues in fluid structure interaction fsi problems is the solving sequence of the rigid body motion and fluid field depending on the coupling strategy the algorithms are generally classified into two categories monolithic and partitioned campbell 2010 the monolithic algorithm solves the flow and structure equations simultaneously however the difficulty in formulating and solving the coupled matrix equation easily outweighs the benefit of using it seng 2012 on the other hand the partitioned algorithm solves the flow and structure equations separately with their respective solvers in which the result of one solver is transferred to another back and forth compared to the monolithic algorithm the partitioned algorithm is easier to design and embed into cfd programs which leads to it being frequently adopted to solve fsi problems it is necessary to pay attention to the coupling process when using the partitioned algorithm because the flow field affects the force and torque acting on the solid body while the motion of the solid body affects the flow field simultaneously depending on the number of times the two solvers exchange information at each time step the partitioned algorithm is classified into two categories if the message is transferred only once i e the result of the fluid solver is passed on to the motion solver once per time step the method is defined as weak coupling or explicit zhao et al 2014 if the information is iteratively transferred many times the method is called strong coupling or implicit jaiman et al 2016 gatin et al 2017 bruinsma et al 2018 although the weakly coupled method runs faster and provides a relatively good result at most times there is no convergence guarantee at each time step for incompressible flow simulation when the density of fluids is close to that of structures or the time step is tiny the weakly coupled method is highly likely to magnify the reduced stability brought about by the added mass effect causin et al 2005 forster et al 2007 one can refer to seraj et al 2018 for detailed comparisons of these two coupling schemes the approach which switches a weakly coupled method to a strongly coupled one is introducing sub iterations to each time step allowing the information to be exchanged several times until convergence is reached however the strongly coupled method prolongs the computational time since not only the flow and structure equations are solved in each sub iteration but also the corresponding motion of the grid points therefore besides robustness efficiency should be another critical aspect when designing a strongly coupled method for most fsi problems the fluid solver solves the navier stokes equations while the structure solver solves the motion equations of rigid bodies in openfoam such a solving procedure is performed by the pimple algorithm jasak 1996 which is a merged algorithm of the simple patankar and spalding 1972 and piso issa 1986 algorithms the general solving process can be briefly outlined as follows the motion equations are solved first followed by the motion of the grid and then the fluid equations when solving the motion equations two types of methods are often used multistage and multistep the family of runge kutta schemes is an example of the multistage method in which the new solution is treated as a weighting of the solutions at several intermediate sub steps chen et al 2016 used the fifth order runge kutta scheme to simulate the roll motion of a floating rectangular box gatin et al 2017 presented an enhanced coupling strategy in which the motion equations are solved by the fifth order cash karp runge kutta scheme in contrast to the multistage method in which the result of previous time steps is discarded the multistep method reuses the previous solution to calculate the new value it is attractive because it makes full use of the capability of most cfd solvers to store and access the result of previous time steps the adams bashforth moulton abm method also known as the implicit explicit method ascher et al 1995 is a multistep method consists of one explicit predictor and several implicit correctors seng 2012 provided a detailed description of this method and used it to model the response of a flexible hull girder to waves the under relaxation should be adopted in each sub iteration to enhance the stability of solvers according to the value of the under relaxation factor under relaxation schemes can be classified into two categories the first category is the under relaxation scheme with a fixed under relaxation factor it is widely used in many cfd programs including openfoam however determining the value of a fixed under relaxation factor is not easy users have to balance simulation stability and cost the second category is the under relaxation scheme with a variable under relaxation factor among the latter category the aitken s dynamic under relaxation adur scheme kuttler and wall 2008 is a simple and efficient one chow and ng 2016 proposed to use the abm method together with the adur scheme his result revealed that this combination method allows 70 80 percent reduction in the simulation time compared to the one using a fixed under relaxation scheme however the adur scheme is confusing although it has been frequently used this is because in many papers the derivation of this scheme is omitted and only the final expression is presented therefore some paper may confuse the conventional aitken s δ 2 method with the adur scheme in the adur scheme the under relaxation factor is calculated via the recursion relationship derived by kuttler and wall 2008 the recursion relationship requires the values of the two previous sub iterations as well as an initial under relaxation factor in general a fixed initial under relaxation factor is widely used chow and ng 2016 chen and christensen 2018 however the value of the initial under relaxation factor is up to specific problems and using a uniform initial under relaxation factor for the all time steps may be inappropriate therefore in this study we rederive the adur scheme in which a novel method for evaluating the initial under relaxation factor is proposed we combine the abm method with the adur scheme at each time step the evaluation of the initial under relaxation factor is performed at the third sub iteration the second corrector of the abm method after which the under relaxation process is introduced the values obtained from the two previous time steps the predictor and the first corrector are used to calculate the initial under relaxation factor in other words a user determined initial under relaxation factor is no longer needed this combined method is embedded in openfoam and then it is examined with different interface capture schemes as well as mesh motion schemes by simulating several cases of multi dof the recommended iteration stop condition is summarised finally an experiment that investigates the interaction between a dam break flow and a floating box is simulated the good overall agreement between the numerical and experimental results shows that the present method is competent for simulating fsi problems of ocean engineering the article is organised as follows in section 1 the background of the present study is presented in section 2 the methods adopted in this study are described section 3 presents the validation of the present method two benchmark tests of single dof are considered and analysed in section 4 a three dimensional case is calculated the result is compared with the ones calculated from other built in methods of openfoam such as the newmark β method and the symplectic method also known as the leapfrog method dullweber et al 1997 devolder et al 2015 in section 5 the method is utilised to simulate an experiment that investigates the nonlinear fsi interaction between a dam break flow and a floating box section 6 summaries several useful conclusions of this study 2 methodology 2 1 numerical model 2 1 1 flow field equations the built in solver called interfoam is used with the variable time step abm method for the fsi simulation the governing equations of the flow field consist of two equations the mass conservation and momentum conservation equations for an incompressible fluid the mass conservation equation is 1 u 0 where u is the velocity field the momentum conservation equation with a moving mesh is 2 ρ u t ρ u u g u p ρ g h g x ρ μ u u σ κ α wd here u g is the velocity of the grid motion and it is obtained from the space conservation law jasak 2009 g is the gravitational acceleration and x x y z is the position vector p ρ g h p ρ g x is the dynamic pressure when the still water level is at z 0 wd is the source field for wave damping wang et al 2019 the term σ κ α in eq 2 represents the surface tension σ is the surface tension coefficient having a value of 0 07 and κ is the curvature of the interface α is the volume fraction which for a two phase model is also the weighting factor of the combination of the density ρ and viscosity μ as follows 3 ρ α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r 4 ρ α μ w a t e r 1 α μ a i r 2 1 2 rigid body motion equations two reference frames are generally defined for the 6dof motion of a rigid body global and body fixed reference frames the origin of the body fixed reference frames is at the rotation centre of structures the transformation tensor q which is defined by the right hand rule is used to transform variables from the body fixed frame to the global frame 5 φ g q φ b where φ is a variable of which the subscript b or g denotes the body fixed or global frame respectively in the present fsi system the fluid force acting on the rigid body is calculated by integrating the pressure and viscous force along the surface of the rigid body as follows 6 f g s p μ u u d s the torque is calculated as 7 τ g s x x c o m f g d s where x c o m is the position vector of the centre of mass once the global force and torque acting on the rigid body are obtained the linear acceleration and local torque can be calculated as follows 8 u t f g m 9 τ b q 1 τ g the relationship between the local torque and angular velocity ω is given by 10 τ b i ω t ω i ω where i a diagonal tensor is the moment of inertia of the rigid body the linear and angular accelerations can be calculated using eqs 8 and 10 respectively the linear and angular velocities at each time step are subsequently obtained thus the position and rotation of the rigid body can be estimated it should be noted that the surface of the rigid body is also a boundary of the flow field therefore updating the position and rotation of the rigid body affects the flow field instantaneously which makes sub iterations preferable during each time step until convergence to ensure a strong coupling between the fluid and structure solvers 2 1 3 interface capture the volume fraction is governed by the volume of fluid vof equation hirt and nichols 1981 11 α t α u 0 herein we consider two numerical schemes for the vof equation the first one is an algebraic scheme called mules multidimensional universal limiter for explicit solution the mules scheme contains a flux corrected transport algorithm and it has been the built in scheme of openfoam for many years when using the mules scheme eq 11 changes as follows 12 α t α u u r α 1 α 0 the term u r α 1 α is the additional convective term that is only valid in the vicinity of the two phase interface u r is the compression velocity field for more details the study of berberovic et al 2009 may be referred to the second scheme is a geometric scheme called isoadvector roenby et al 2016 this method comprises two steps the first step is interface reconstruction in the first step the cells of ϵ α 1 ϵ are selected where ϵ is the tolerance the isoface inside the cell as well as its motion is then calculated using the isoface the face interface intersection line and its motion on the downwind face can be calculated through these operations the time integral of the submerged area inside the cell can be evaluated making the second step volume fraction advection explicit in other words eq 11 can be directly updated without the use of other solving processes the value of ϵ should be carefully determined this is because the piso algorithm cannot strictly ensure that u 0 for all the cells the actual equation may be u ϵ 1 where ϵ 1 is an extremely small value the existence of ϵ 1 makes the total flux of a cell not strictly equal to zero therefore in the water region beneath the free surface the α updated by eq 11 may be slightly smaller than 1 therefore if one uses an overly small ϵ to search the interface cell the cell beneath the free surface may be selected thus resulting the problem of spurious air bubbles in the water region in openfoam the pressure velocity solving process is controlled by the tolerance of p ρ g h therefore to avoid this problem a feasible solution is to ensure that ϵ is greater than the tolerance of p ρ g h by at least one or two orders of magnitude roenby et al 2016 here we propose the use of an artificial relaxation to further resolve this spurious air bubble problem for the i th cell with 1 α i ϵ the value of α i is slightly adjusted using 13 α i c 0 α i 1 c 0 α t where α t 1 is the target value of the water phase c 0 is the weight calculated as follows 14 c 0 α i α t α i in the present study the tolerance of p ρ g h is set as 1 1 0 8 ϵ is set as 1 1 0 5 for both interface cell searching and artificial relaxation 2 1 4 mesh motion two mesh motion schemes are considered the first scheme is the conventional mesh deformation md scheme without topology change jasak and tuković 2010 in this scheme the velocity of the internal grid points is calculated by solving a laplace equation of which the rigid body surface acts as the boundary condition 15 γ u p 0 u p is the velocity of the grid points γ is the diffusivity parameter the value of which is based on the inverse of the distance from a designated cell to the moving boundary when the value of u p is known the new position of the grid point can be calculated 16 x p x p u p δ t the second scheme is the overset mesh om scheme noack 2005 in this scheme meshes of the background and geometry are separately generated via cell to cell mappings between these disconnected meshes a composite computational domain can be generated the cells are classified into three categories calculated interpolated and holes the governing equations are solved for calculated cells the interpolated cell is employed for information exchange between different mesh regions the holes cell which is always adopted to represent structures is blocked out during the calculation one of the greatest advantages of the om scheme is that the geometry mesh can move freely or as prescribed making it preferable for simulating the problem of the large motion of a rigid body chen and christensen 2018 the details of the hole cutting and donor searching are not present herein because the main focus of the present study is the abm method the work of noack et al 2009 and shen et al 2015 may be referred to for more information 2 2 the abm method with variable time steps the abm method is a multistep method the values of the two previous time steps are used to calculate the value of the current time step this method consists of an explicit predictor and several implicit correctors for solving the 6dof motion in fsi problems the method elaborated by seng 2012 is widely accepted and its structure has been used in the present study in this method the time step ratio ϖ is calculated first 17 ϖ δ t δ t 0 where δ t 0 and δ t are the spans of the previous and current time steps respectively subsequently the linear velocity is updated by the predictor as follows 18 u n p u o δ t 2 2 ϖ a o ϖ a o o and the position of the rigid body is calculated as follows 19 x n p x o δ t 16 ϖ 8 ϖ 1 u n p 7 ϖ 1 u o ϖ u o o it should be noted that for simplicity only the formulas of the linear velocity and position are presented herein because the formulas used for calculating the rotational motion are similar the subscripts n and o denote the new and old values and o o denotes the old old value the superscript p indicates that the variable is calculated via the predictor evidently in the predictor new values are not calculated by solving any governing equations but only from the values at the previous time steps using eq 19 the new position of the rigid body is updated and the boundary condition of the flow field changes accordingly via solving the flow field and then using eqs 6 and 8 the new linear acceleration a n p is obtained which is followed by the iteration process included in the corrector 20 u n n c u o δ t 16 ϖ 8 ϖ 1 a n n 1 c 7 ϖ 1 a o ϖ a o o 21 x n n c x o δ t 16 ϖ 8 ϖ 1 u n n c 7 ϖ 1 u o ϖ u o o here the superscript c indicates that the variable is calculated via the corrector u n n c denotes the new linear velocity calculated from the n th iteration of the corrector and x n n c denotes the new position calculated from the n th iteration of the corrector the new linear acceleration in eq 20 is calculated by solving the flow field of the last iteration and its initial value at the first corrector n 1 is equal to the value calculated from the predictor 22 a n 0 c a n p the above iteration process is continuously looped until convergence is reached which results in a strong coupling when solving fsi problems 2 3 the adur scheme in this section the derivation of the adur scheme is elaborated because it is slightly complicated and may cause confusion as in section 2 2 only the linear acceleration is presented herein for simplicity it should also be noted that scalar variables are used in the derivation and the vector form result is then directly obtained by extending the scalar form result it is because the method has a clear meaning for scalar cases but not for vector cases although it indeed works well for many fsi problems kuttler and wall 2008 let us start from the fixed point iteration in the case of strongly coupled fsi problems the iteration relationship has a general form of 23 a n 1 f a n m f a n here a n is the linear acceleration of the n th iteration f is the total force acting on the rigid body m is the mass of the rigid body we want to find a fixed point a a t a r g e t such that 24 a t a r g e t f a t a r g e t regardless of the under relaxation a series of linear accelerations a n can be calculated using eq 23 25 a n a n 1 a n 2 on considering the under relaxation eq 25 becomes 26 a n a a n 1 b a n 1 a a n 2 b the subscripts a and b represent after relaxation and before relaxation respectively according to the definition of under relaxation we obtain 27 a n 1 a a n a ω n a n 1 b a n a where ω n is the under relaxation factor our objective is to find a particular ω n such that the iteration can be accelerated in a manner of aitken s δ 2 method according to aitken s δ 2 method when n is large eq 24 can be written as follows 28 a n 2 b a t a r g e t a n 1 a a t a r g e t a n 1 b a t a r g e t a n a a t a r g e t on solving eq 28 we obtain 29 a t a r g e t a n 2 b a n a a n 1 b a n 1 a a n 2 b a n a a n 1 b a n 1 a according to eqs 26 and 29 when n is small we can construct the following recurrence relationship to accelerate the iteration 30 a n 2 a a n 2 b a n a a n 1 b a n 1 a a n 2 b a n a a n 1 b a n 1 a as in eq 27 we obtain 31 a n 2 a a n 1 a ω n 1 a n 2 b a n 1 a on solving eqs 30 and 31 the expression of the adur factor can be obtained 32 ω n 1 a n a a n 1 a a n 2 b a n a a n 1 b a n 1 a on substituting eq 27 into eq 32 the recurrence relationship of the under relaxation factor can be obtained 33 ω n 1 ω n a n 1 b a n a a n 2 b a n a a n 1 b a n 1 a if we introduce e r r n which can be described by the expression 34 e r r n a n 1 b a n a eq 33 can be simplified as 35 ω n 1 ω n e r r n e r r n 1 e r r n if e r r n is a vector variable i e err n eq 35 can be written as follows 36 ω n 1 ω n err n err n 1 err n ω n err n err n 1 err n err n 1 err n 2 eq 36 is the vector form recurrence relationship of the under relaxation factor which is identical to that proposed by kuttler and wall 2008 in the case of the initial under relaxation factor ω 0 a fixed value is widely used chen and christensen 2018 chow and ng 2016 herein we propose an alternative approach for evaluating ω 0 from eq 32 it can be concluded that the under relaxation factor is calculated using the four values or equivalently two pairs of values in eq 26 in other words the value of ω 0 can be evaluated after we determine these four previous values when using the abm method the converged values of the two previous time steps are accessible at the first corrector the value calculated by the predictor is also accessible therefore only one extra value is required if we adopt a n 1 c b the following expression of ω 0 can be obtained 37 ω 0 a o o a n p a n 1 c b a n p a o a o o a n 1 c b a n p a o a o o 2 besides as in the under relaxation method the value of the under relaxation factor should be in the range of 0 1 therefore another operation is required after calculating each ω n 38 ω n m a x 0 1 m i n ω n 1 0 it should be noted that the minimum value of ω n cannot be 0 because it will cause the other values of ω n to become 0 eq 35 in the present study the minimum value is set as 0 1 which is the value used by chow and ng 2016 at the first two time steps a o o and a o are unavailable seng 2012 and chow and ng 2016 used the explicit euler s method in our model the newmark β method is adopted 2 4 solving procedure the solving procedure of the numerical model is summarised as follows 1 enter the current time step read the current time step index 2 calculate the force and torque acting on the rigid body 3 update the position and rotation of the rigid body via the methods mentioned below 3 1 if the time step index is either 1 or 2 the newmark β method is used 3 2 if the time step index is 3 or larger the abm method is used 3 2 1 read the number of the current pimple outer loop nouter 3 2 2 if the number is 1 the predictor is used calculate the velocity and position explicitly repeat the same for rotation jump to step 4 3 2 3 if the number is 2 store the new linear acceleration a n p calculated by the predictor without under relaxation here we have three acceleration values and our objective is to have four jump to step 3 2 6 3 2 4 if the number is 3 store the new linear acceleration a n 1 c b as the fourth value use eq 37 to provide an assessment of the initial value of the under relaxation factor conduct the relaxation to calculate the new linear acceleration a n 1 c a repeat the same for rotation jump to step 3 2 6 3 2 5 if the number is larger than 3 store the new linear acceleration a n n 2 c b calculate the under relaxation factor via eq 36 conduct the relaxation to calculate the new linear acceleration a n n 2 c a repeat the same for rotation jump to step 3 2 6 3 2 6 update the velocity and position of the rigid body via eqs 20 and 21 repeat the same for rotation jump to step 4 4 move the grid points according to the position and rotation of the rigid body 5 solve the vof equation conduct the relaxation via eq 13 if the isoadvector is used 6 solve the flow field with the piso loop two or three loops are enough 7 judge whether the stop condition of the pimple outer loop is reached or not if the outer loop stops jump to step 1 for the next time step if the outer loop continues jump to step 2 the whole procedure is illustrated in fig 1 and several things should be clarified first nouter is equal to the corrector number plus one because the predictor is used at the first pimple outer loop second the initial under relaxation factor is evaluated at the second corrector i e the third pimple outer loop in other words the under relaxation is introduced from the second corrector third the position of the n th corrector x n n c is calculated using a n n 1 c a where n 1 for the first corrector and a n 0 c a n p eq 22 other necessary details of the under relaxation factor calculation are listed in table 1 3 validation free decaying motion of single dof in this section the abm method is validated by simulating two benchmark tests of a single dof free decaying translational and rotational motion is considered the simulation is two dimensional and the laminar model is adopted various interface capture and mesh motion schemes are considered the sensitivity of spatial and temporal resolution of the abm method is investigated and optimistic setups of the numerical model are obtained 3 1 decaying heave motion 3 1 1 sensitivity of spatial and temporal resolution the decaying heave motion of a cylinder has been studied for a long time maskell and ursell 1970 and ito 1977 presented their mathematical and physical studies respectively in the case of cfd this typical problem has been reproduced by many researchers gatin et al 2017 ghasemi et al 2014 in the study conducted by gatin et al 2017 the two dimensional computational domain is 60 0 m in length and 30 0 m in height the water depth is 20 0 m and the still water level is at z 0 the centre of the cylinder is located at 30 0 2 3 r where r 1 0 m is the radius of the cylinder the mass of the cylinder is 31 416 kg the left and right parts of the computational domain of 15 0 m each are the wave damping regions for eliminating reflected waves critical simulation parameters for all the cases are listed in table 2 to investigate the sensitivity of the spatial resolution three mesh refinement levels mrls which are referred to as coarse c medium m and refined r are considered the length and height of the most refined cell are 0 2 m and 0 1 m for the coarse mesh 0 1 m and 0 05 m for the medium mesh and 0 05 m and 0 025 m for the refined mesh two different mesh motion schemes are considered the md and om schemes fig 2 displays the coarse meshes used for the md and om schemes respectively two different interface capture schemes are considered the mules and isoadvector schemes we consider three combinations between the mesh motion schemes and interface capture schemes md mules om mules and om isoadvector to investigate the sensitivity of the temporal resolution three maximum courant numbers mcns are considered 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 the time step is set as 0 001 s initially and is adjusted by the mcn while the simulation is running as mentioned in section 2 1 3 the tolerance of p ρ g h is set as 1 10 8 for the piso loop the relative tolerance of p ρ g h ϵ p is adopted to control the pimple outer loop and its value is set as 1 10 4 the maximum number of the pimple outer loop nouter m a x is set as 22 which implies that 20 sub iterations with adur can be performed at most the pimple outer loop stops immediately once the value of ϵ p is less than 1 10 4 or when nouter reaches 22 the sensitivity of the spatial resolution is first investigated the value of the mcn is fixed at 0 5 the cases of different mrls are calculated under the conditions of md mules om mules and om isoadvector the results are listed in fig 3 the motion is normalised by the initial displacement δ 0 2 3 r the time is normalised by t g r 0 5 convergence is reached regardless of which numerical scheme combination is utilised with respect to the cases in which the md scheme is used the use of a coarse mesh should be avoided the sensitivity of the temporal resolution is investigated using different mcns but a uniform mrl the medium mesh is adopted as listed in table 2 three mcns with values of 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 are considered the results are presented in fig 4 from the figure it can be concluded that the time step does not have a significant effect on the simulation regardless of which numerical scheme combination is adopted 3 1 2 iteration stop condition as mentioned in section 3 1 1 two conditions are adopted for controlling the pimple outer loop the first is ϵ p equals to 1 10 4 and the second is nouter m a x equals to 22 in this section discussions on these iteration stop conditions are performed nouter m a x is treated as mutable while ϵ p keeps unchanged this is because the two conditions share an analogous effect on the simulation furthermore we find that ϵ p 1 10 4 is a relatively strict condition for this problem using this value ensures that the corrector can be reached at least two times during each time step two parameters should be introduced before the discussion the first parameter is the average relative error ξ t which is calculated as 39 ξ t 1 k 2 k 3 k a n n k c b a n n k 1 c a a n n k 1 c a the subscript t indicates that the relative error is calculated using the linear acceleration of translational motion similarly we can define ξ r for rotational motion k is the total number of time steps for a finished case the two initial time steps are left out in eq 39 because the newmark β method is used n k denotes the final pimple outer loop index for the k th time step the second parameter is the average iteration number n k which is calculated as 40 n k 1 k 2 k 3 k n k table 3 lists the values of ξ t and n k for all the cases mentioned in section 3 1 1 from the table we can obtain several useful findings for example the use of the om scheme can significantly diminish the number of the pimple outer loop n k is highly related to the mcn when the mrl remains unchanged the second finding indicates that the use of a larger mcn may not shorten the simulation time the reason for this can be briefly explained as follows when the mcn is large the time step is large and the model thus requires a greater number of pimple outer loops to converge when the mcn is small the time step is small and the model thus requires fewer pimple outer loops to converge however the use of smaller time steps also results in an increase in the simulation time therefore concerning the case of mild motion the mcn of 0 5 is preferred to maintain a balance between the time step span and iteration number it can be observed that when using the om scheme the value of n k is much less than that of nouter m a x in other words ϵ p has a dominant effect while nouter m a x is almost invalid some iterations may be redundant for the cases listed in table 3 therefore the cases having an mrl of m and mcn of 0 5 are recalculated with the nouter m a x set as 12 the results are exhibited in fig 5 and table 4 from the figure it can be observed that setting nouter m a x as 12 does not affect the result significantly for the two cases in which the om scheme is used the values of n k decrease the values of ξ t are still acceptable although they increase slightly on the other hand for the case in which the md scheme is used the value of n k is very close to that of nouter m a x which indicates that nouter m a x plays a dominant role this is also the reason why the ξ t value in table 4 is significantly increased generally when the md scheme is used the cells are directly compressed or stretched if the structure has a big movement the mesh quality will become bad which makes the numerical model require more sub iterations to converge in this case the motion is not violent and the spatial and temporal resolution is sufficiently high therefore such an large ξ t does not significantly affect the result 3 1 3 comparison with published results the results of the cases for which the mrl is m and nouter m a x is 12 are compared with other published results these published results comprise the theoretical study conducted by maskell and ursell 1970 the experiment conducted by ito 1977 and the cfd analysis performed by gatin et al 2017 the comparison is exhibited in fig 6 wherein a relatively good overall agreement can be found at the early stage the three newly calculated signals coincide with each other as the simulation proceeds slight deviations appear among these signals the signal calculated under the condition of om isoadvector matches best with the published ones the signal calculated under the condition of om mules shows an undesired uplift when t g r 0 5 15 0 the amplitude of the signal calculated under the condition of md mules is slightly smaller than that under the condition of om isoadvector 3 2 decaying roll motion 3 2 1 sensitivity of spatial and temporal resolution in contrast to translational motion rotational motion is strongly affected by the viscous damping caused by flow separation especially for the blunt shaped floating structure jung et al 2006 using the linear potential theory to calculate this viscous damping may be inadequate because the viscosity of the fluid is ignored therefore it is difficult to precisely reproduce rotation especially for roll motion to validate the abm method a benchmark test of the decaying roll motion of a rectangular box is simulated the experiment was performed by jung et al 2006 and has been reproduced by many researchers chen et al 2016 ghasemi et al 2014 calderer et al 2014 the two dimensional computational domain used is 10 0 m in length and 1 4 m in height the water depth is 0 9 m and the still water level is at z 0 the box is 0 3 m in length and 0 1 m in height the centre of the box is located at 5 0 0 with an initial angle of 15 the left and right parts of the computational domain having a length of 3 0 m each are the wave damping regions for eliminating reflected waves in the experiment the mass of the box is 28 32 kg as in section 3 1 1 three mrls are considered the length and height of the most refined grid are 0 025 m and 0 025 m for the coarse mesh 0 0125 m and 0 0125 m for the medium mesh and 0 00625 m and 0 00625 m for the refined mesh fig 7 displays the coarse meshes used for the md and om schemes respectively the other setups are identical to those listed in section 3 1 1 the sensitivity of the spatial resolution is first investigated the cases of different mrls are simulated under the conditions ofmd mules om mules and om isoadvector nouter m a x is set as 22 the results are presented in fig 8 the time is normalised using t g d 0 5 where d is the water depth from a and b of fig 8 it can be observed that for the case of roll motion achieving convergence with these three meshes appears to be slightly difficult therefore as shown in c of fig 8 we consider an additional case using a further refined fr mesh the length and height of the most refined grid are 0 005 m and 0 005 m for the further refined mesh respectively the result hardly changes with the use of this further refined mesh indicating that convergence has been reached when the refined mesh is adopted it should be noted that only one additional case is calculated for the sake of saving time in the cases under the conditions of md mules and om mules it can be deduced that convergence has been reached when the refined mesh is adopted the sensitivity of the temporal resolution is investigated using different mcns the refined mesh is used for the simulation as listed in table 2 three mcns with values of 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 are considered the results are listed in fig 9 from the figure it can be concluded that the time step does not have a significant effect on the simulation regardless of which numerical scheme combination is adopted this is identical to what has been observed in section 3 1 1 3 2 2 iteration stop condition table 5 lists the values of ξ r and n k for all the cases mentioned in section 3 2 1 from the table several findings can be obtained which are similar to those concluded in section 3 1 2 besides the effect of the interface capture scheme is highlighted n k of the cases with the use of the isoadvector scheme is significantly less than that of the cases with the use of the mules scheme the cases for which the mrl is r and mcn is 0 5 are recalculated with nouter m a x set as 12 the results are exhibited in fig 10 and table 6 similarly from the figure it can be found that setting nouter m a x as 12 does not affect the result significantly 3 2 3 comparison with published results several published results including both the experimental jung et al 2006 and cfd chen et al 2016 ghasemi et al 2014 calderer et al 2014 results are introduced to compare with the calculated result fig 11 it should be indicated that the amplitude of the calculated signal is very sensitive to the damping coefficient calderer et al 2014 it is because the experimental facilities have a friction loss unlike the cfd programs which makes the precise matching of their amplitudes slightly difficult the appropriate value of the damping coefficient for this problem was investigated by calderer et al 2014 using several numerical tests therefore the focus should be on the comparison of the cfd results generally satisfactory agreement is observed between the present and published results in the case of these three newly calculated results the two calculated by the om scheme are almost identical however the signal computed using the md scheme is slightly different from the two obtained using the om scheme both the amplitude and natural frequency are slight greater 4 comparison with weakly coupled methods in this section we simulate a three dimensional case of multi dof for comparing the abm method with the other two openfoam built in methods the leapfrog and newmark β methods the case named floatingobject is an openfoam built in tutorial the two interface capture schemes are considered only the om scheme is considered because according to section 3 the md scheme requires too many sub iterations and cannot handle the case of large motion similar to the last section the laminar model is used for the simulation 4 1 numerical setup the computational domain and its size are presented in fig 12 the computational domain is 1 4 m 1 4 m and 1 2 m in the x direction from x 0 2 m to x 1 2 m y direction from y 0 2 m to y 1 2 m and z direction from z 0 2 m to z 1 0 m respectively a rigid cube is placed at the centre of the computational domain the cube is 0 24 m 0 24 m and 0 4 m in the x y and z directions respectively the mass of the cube is 16 128 kg the cube is constrained to heave only while there is no limit to its rotational motion in other words this is an fsi problem of 4dof the water depth is 0 74 m at a corner of the computational domain there is a cubic water reservoir whose length width and height are 0 3 m 0 3 m and 0 2 m respectively the cubic reservoir collapses immediately when the simulation starts which forces the cube to move the mesh is composed of cubic cells with a side length of 0 02 m only one mrl is considered in this section it is because three dimensional cases are time consuming especially being solved by strongly coupled algorithms furthermore for this case there is no experimental or theoretical data available to validate the calculated result therefore in terms of practical applications it may be more meaningful to investigate the temporal convergence performance of the abm method on a relatively coarse mesh to shorten the simulation time ϵ p is set as 0 and nouter m a x is set as 7 which indicates that a fixed number of the pimple outer loop is adopted it should be pointed that setting nouter m a x as 7 may result in an increase in ξ t and ξ r however this is not important because our focus is on the temporal convergence according to the default setup a probe located at 0 00132 0 0009 0 005 is used to sample the velocity and pressure other setups are listed in table 7 two methods for solving the motion equation are considered the leapfrog and newmark β methods the leapfrog method is explicit and can thus only be used with the weakly coupled strategy in the newmark β method two widely used values of γ 0 5 and β 0 25 are adopted the newmark β method is also used with the weakly coupled strategy the under relaxation factor for these two methods is set as 0 5 4 2 result analysis 4 2 1 result of isoadvector in this section the result calculated with the isoadvector scheme is presented and discussed although there is no experimental or theoretical data available for validation we can approximately evaluate the quality of the outcome because the computational domain is axisymmetric herein we introduce three criteria the sum of the pitch and roll motion should be close to zero and the yaw motion should be close to zero the value of the x directional velocity component should approximately equal to that of the y directional velocity component because the probe is nearly at the symmetry axis the pressure value should fluctuate around the initial value hydrostatic pressure fig 13 displays the result calculated using the leapfrog method in the case of the pressure it can be observed that the convergence is not satisfactory when the mcn is 0 5 an apparent oscillation occurs at approximately t 1 6 s which makes the pitch and yaw motion deviate from the signals calculated with the other mcns in comparison the heave and roll motion as well as the velocity field is not affected by the oscillation fig 14 displays the result calculated using the newmark β method similar to what was observed in fig 13 a pressure oscillation occurs and contaminates the motion state of the cube both the translational and rotational motion is affected wherein the yaw motion is affected most on solving the navier stokes equations the pressure converges in an oscillatory manner due to the elliptic nature of the pressure equation gatin et al 2017 if the weakly coupled scheme is used the unwanted pressure oscillation is likely to occur because there is no convergence guarantee at each time step furthermore the setup of numerical models such as the grid size and interface capture scheme also affects the pressure oscillation problem fig 15 displays the result calculated using the abm method the pressure oscillation problem is resolved owing to the use of the strongly coupled scheme the convergence is relatively satisfactory for both the flow field properties velocity and pressure and motion state it is demonstrated that using a strongly coupled scheme is a feasible approach to avoid the pressure oscillation problem fig 16 displays the comparison of the results obtained using different motion equation solving methods but a uniform mcn 0 1 the results of these three cases are almost identical except in terms of the yaw motion in terms of the yaw motion the only difference between these three curves is the zero position the curve calculated via the abm method is closer to zero while the other two curves show an uplift trend according to the three criteria mentioned above an mcn of 0 1 is considered to be desirable to yield a favourable result 4 2 2 result of mules in this section the result calculated with the mules scheme is presented and discussed fig 17 displays the result calculated using the leapfrog method in contrast to fig 13 the pressure oscillation problem almost disappears and the convergence of yaw motion improves significantly furthermore an analogous phenomenon can be observed from the result calculated using the newmark β method fig 18 it is demonstrated that the interface capture scheme indeed affects the pressure oscillation problem fig 19 displays the result calculated using the abm method compared to the result obtained with weakly coupled schemes the result of the abm method converges faster the result calculated with mcn 0 25 almost coincides with the one calculated with mcn 0 1 which means an mcn of 0 25 may be enough to yield an acceptable result similar to section 4 2 1 the comparison of the results which are calculated using different motion equation solving methods but a uniform mcn 0 1 is listed in fig 20 the three results are almost identical indicating that the convergence is reached with the mcn equals to 0 1 4 2 3 effect of interface capture schemes fig 21 displays the result calculated using the abm method with different interface capture schemes the value of the mcn used is 0 1 the two results listed in fig 21 match well with each other except in terms of the yaw motion the reason is as follows for this case the yaw motion is quite sensitive to the free surface in the vicinity of the cube because of using a relatively coarse mesh the calculated free surface around the structure changes as per the different interface capture schemes adopted making the yaw motion curves have different zero positions we believe that the use of a more refined mesh can improve the result with the use of such a small mcn the pressure oscillation problem disappears regardless of which interface capture schemes is adopted therefore it can be deduced that the effect of interface capture schemes on the pressure oscillation problem attributes to the temporal resolution in other words if the temporal and spatial resolution is sufficiently high the only reason left for the pressure oscillation problem is the coupling strategy however as a result of calculation cost we seldom adopt a sufficiently high temporal and spatial resolution for three dimensional cases therefore the strongly coupled method is preferable to avoid the pressure oscillation problem 5 application interaction between a dam break flow and a floating box in this section the application of the abm method is presented an experiment that investigates the interaction between the dam break flow and a floating box is simulated 5 1 experiment setup the experiment is conducted in a glass wall water tank the length width and height of the water tank are 2 0 m 0 6 m and 0 8 m respectively the configuration of the experiment is presented in fig 22 the glass gate is 0 5 m away from the right wall forming a water reservoir with a water depth of 0 25 m at the left side of the gate there exists an initial water layer with a water depth of 0 15 m a floating box is located on the water layer 0 15 m away from the left wall the floating box is 0 3 m in length 0 1 m in height and 0 595 m in width the experiment is designed to be two dimensional and there is a gap of 0 25 cm in the width direction between the floating box and the water tank wall the mass and moment of inertia of the floating box are 5 35 kg and 0 045 kg m 2 respectively by releasing a weight whose weight is 29 kg the gate can be instantaneously lifted by the rope according to the recommendation of lauber and hager 1998 the non dimensional opening time is defined as 41 t t g h r where h r is the water depth of the reservoir t the actual opening time a sufficiently sudden removal is considered to be realised when t 1 414 in the experiment the value of t is 0 18 s and the corresponding value of t is 0 89 the floating box is allowed to heave and roll freely therefore this is an fsi problem of 2dof at the initial stage the floating box has a draught of 0 03 m two wave gauges and one pressure probe are used to measure the surface elevation and impact pressure respectively the first wave gauge is located at the left wall with the aim of measuring the run up on the left wall the second wave gauge is placed next to the gate 1 3 m away from the left wall with the aim of capturing the initial profile of the dam break wave the pressure probe is located at the air water interface seaside of the floating box the sampling interval of the pressure probe is 0 001 s the experiment is repeated three times and the final result is obtained by averaging those repeated results 5 2 numerical setup the computational domain is two dimensional and the numerical configuration is identical to that of the experiment according to the findings presented in the previous sections the isoadvector scheme is adopted for the interface capture and the om scheme is adopted for the mesh motion ϵ p is set as 1 10 5 and nouter m a x is set as 12 for dam break related problems the fsi process is nonlinear and violent therefore to yield a satisfactory result the temporal and spatial resolution should be sufficiently high the value of the mcn is set as 0 25 to determine the appropriate mesh three mrls are considered the coarse mesh is composed of square cells with a side length of 0 005 m the medium mesh is composed of square cells with a side length of 0 004 m while the refined mesh is composed of square cells with a side length of 0 0025 m furthermore the k epsilon model is used to closure the governing equation 5 3 result fig 23 displays the results calculated using different mrls from the figure it is observed that the result is convergent when the medium mesh is used the result calculated using the medium mesh is almost identical to that obtained using the refined mesh therefore the result of the medium mesh is selected for the comparison with the experimental data it should also be indicated that the pressure oscillation problem occurs when using the coarse mesh because of using the strongly coupled method such a pressure oscillation hardly affects the final result the comparison of the experimental and numerical results is presented in fig 24 the overall agreement is acceptable in the first 5 s and it worsens slightly in the last 5 s the reason for this observation is as follows first the water tank used in the experiment is 0 6 m in width while the numerical simulation is two dimensional compared to the length 2 0 m or height 0 8 m of the water tank its width is actually non negligible especially for a long simulation time second the gate and its sliding rail affect the result from fig 22 it is clear that the sliding rail of the gate is placed inside the water tank causing the actual width there to be less than 0 6 m therefore the surface elevation measured by wg2 which is placed in the vicinity of the gate has a phase difference with that calculated from the numerical model third the experiment facility such as the rotation shaft has a friction loss while it is considered to be smooth in the numerical simulation it is the reason why the calculated roll motion is greater than that of the experiment at approximately t 7 0 s finally this experiment is inherently complicated because it contains both a floating structure and a dam break flow all of which is relatively difficult to simulate the comparison of the experimental and numerical snapshots is presented in fig 25 in the figure the moment of the top snapshot is defined as t 0 according to which the moments of the other snapshots are defined at t t 0 the bore generated by the dam break flow is propagating towards the floating box at t t 0 0 36 s the bore reaches the floating box climbing the seaward of the floating box as a result the floating box turns anticlockwise slightly at t t 0 0 6 s most of the water flows through under the box because of the close distance between the box and the rear wall the leeward water level rises considerably lifting the lower left corner of the box therefore the box is observed to have a clockwise rotation angle and on the seaward a hollow appears between the box and the free surface at t t 0 0 78 s the hollow is filled by the water forming a phenomenon of secondary slamming subsequently the water is reflected by the rear wall and the leeward water level descends as displayed in the snapshots of t t 0 0 96 s and t t 0 1 22 s the overall agreement between the experimental and numerical snapshots is satisfactory which demonstrates that the present method is competent to reproduce complicated fsi processes 6 conclusions in this paper an extended abm method with aitken s dynamic under relaxation is proposed the derivation of aitken s dynamicunder relaxation is elaborated in which a new approach for evaluating the initial under relaxation factor is presented the initial under relaxation factor at every time step is automatically evaluated in the algorithm instead of being defined by the users the algorithm is embedded in openfoam based on the simulation of various cases with different numerical schemes we arrive at the following conclusions the strongly coupled method increase the calculation time therefore it is essential to use appropriate iteration stop conditions in openfoam the relative error of the pressure field ϵ p and the maximum pimple outer loop number nouter m a x can be adopted as iteration stop conditions an appropriate iteration stop condition should ensure aitken s dynamic under relaxation to be conducted approximately 5 10 times during each time step generally a relatively small ϵ p which makes nouter m a x a major role in pimple loop control is preferred temporal and spatial resolution is critical to the simulation of fsi problems when the temporal and spatial resolution is low the use of weakly coupled methods may cause the problem of pressure oscillation in comparison the use of strongly coupled methods avoids this problem compared to the mesh deformation scheme the overset mesh scheme is preferable because it can handle the large motion problem with respect to interface capture schemes the mules and isoadvector schemes have their advantages and disadvantages however both of them can yield excellent results as long as the temporal and spatial resolution used is appropriate the proposed setup of the present method is listed as follows as mentioned above the value of ϵ p should be sufficiently small a value of 1 1 0 4 or smaller is proposed to save calculation time the value of nouter m a x should not be too large we deem that nouter m a x 12 is sufficient for most cases however users can adjust these factors according to their specific problems as well as computing power credit authorship contribution statement dongxu wang conceptualization methodology software validation investigation data

21261,an extended variable time step adams bashforth moulton abm method is presented for obtaining the solution of six degrees of freedom 6dof rigid body motion this second order method involves the use of one predictor and several correctors thus requiring an iteration process during each time step aitken s dynamic under relaxation adur scheme is used to reduce the time to convergence the initial value of the under relaxation factor at each time step is evaluated from the values of the two previous time steps the predictor and the first corrector cooperating with the incompressible two phase flow solver included in openfoam the present method is capable of simulating fluid structure interaction fsi problems in which strong coupling is ensured through the outer loop of the pimple algorithm various interface capture schemes as well as mesh motion schemes are considered several two and three dimensional cases of multi dof are simulated and the recommended iteration stop condition is summarised finally the method is employed to reproduce an experiment that investigates the interaction between a dam break flow and a floating box satisfactory overall agreement between the numerical and experimental results is observed which demonstrates that the method is suitable for simulating fsi problems in ocean engineering keywords abm method 6dof strong coupling interface capture mesh motion 1 introduction the application of computational fluid dynamics cfd in engineering problems is becoming more and more popular with the rapid development of both theories and computer hardware in the evaluation of the six degrees of freedom 6dof motion of ships zhuang and wan 2017 platforms zhao et al 2020 or wave converters zhao et al 2019 numerical modelling plays an important role due to the high cost and difficulties in performing experiments there have been a substantial number of publications in the past decade aimed at improving the accuracy and efficiency of numerical approaches devolder et al 2015 schmitt and elsaesser 2015 palm et al 2016 ransley et al 2017 one of the most critical issues in fluid structure interaction fsi problems is the solving sequence of the rigid body motion and fluid field depending on the coupling strategy the algorithms are generally classified into two categories monolithic and partitioned campbell 2010 the monolithic algorithm solves the flow and structure equations simultaneously however the difficulty in formulating and solving the coupled matrix equation easily outweighs the benefit of using it seng 2012 on the other hand the partitioned algorithm solves the flow and structure equations separately with their respective solvers in which the result of one solver is transferred to another back and forth compared to the monolithic algorithm the partitioned algorithm is easier to design and embed into cfd programs which leads to it being frequently adopted to solve fsi problems it is necessary to pay attention to the coupling process when using the partitioned algorithm because the flow field affects the force and torque acting on the solid body while the motion of the solid body affects the flow field simultaneously depending on the number of times the two solvers exchange information at each time step the partitioned algorithm is classified into two categories if the message is transferred only once i e the result of the fluid solver is passed on to the motion solver once per time step the method is defined as weak coupling or explicit zhao et al 2014 if the information is iteratively transferred many times the method is called strong coupling or implicit jaiman et al 2016 gatin et al 2017 bruinsma et al 2018 although the weakly coupled method runs faster and provides a relatively good result at most times there is no convergence guarantee at each time step for incompressible flow simulation when the density of fluids is close to that of structures or the time step is tiny the weakly coupled method is highly likely to magnify the reduced stability brought about by the added mass effect causin et al 2005 forster et al 2007 one can refer to seraj et al 2018 for detailed comparisons of these two coupling schemes the approach which switches a weakly coupled method to a strongly coupled one is introducing sub iterations to each time step allowing the information to be exchanged several times until convergence is reached however the strongly coupled method prolongs the computational time since not only the flow and structure equations are solved in each sub iteration but also the corresponding motion of the grid points therefore besides robustness efficiency should be another critical aspect when designing a strongly coupled method for most fsi problems the fluid solver solves the navier stokes equations while the structure solver solves the motion equations of rigid bodies in openfoam such a solving procedure is performed by the pimple algorithm jasak 1996 which is a merged algorithm of the simple patankar and spalding 1972 and piso issa 1986 algorithms the general solving process can be briefly outlined as follows the motion equations are solved first followed by the motion of the grid and then the fluid equations when solving the motion equations two types of methods are often used multistage and multistep the family of runge kutta schemes is an example of the multistage method in which the new solution is treated as a weighting of the solutions at several intermediate sub steps chen et al 2016 used the fifth order runge kutta scheme to simulate the roll motion of a floating rectangular box gatin et al 2017 presented an enhanced coupling strategy in which the motion equations are solved by the fifth order cash karp runge kutta scheme in contrast to the multistage method in which the result of previous time steps is discarded the multistep method reuses the previous solution to calculate the new value it is attractive because it makes full use of the capability of most cfd solvers to store and access the result of previous time steps the adams bashforth moulton abm method also known as the implicit explicit method ascher et al 1995 is a multistep method consists of one explicit predictor and several implicit correctors seng 2012 provided a detailed description of this method and used it to model the response of a flexible hull girder to waves the under relaxation should be adopted in each sub iteration to enhance the stability of solvers according to the value of the under relaxation factor under relaxation schemes can be classified into two categories the first category is the under relaxation scheme with a fixed under relaxation factor it is widely used in many cfd programs including openfoam however determining the value of a fixed under relaxation factor is not easy users have to balance simulation stability and cost the second category is the under relaxation scheme with a variable under relaxation factor among the latter category the aitken s dynamic under relaxation adur scheme kuttler and wall 2008 is a simple and efficient one chow and ng 2016 proposed to use the abm method together with the adur scheme his result revealed that this combination method allows 70 80 percent reduction in the simulation time compared to the one using a fixed under relaxation scheme however the adur scheme is confusing although it has been frequently used this is because in many papers the derivation of this scheme is omitted and only the final expression is presented therefore some paper may confuse the conventional aitken s δ 2 method with the adur scheme in the adur scheme the under relaxation factor is calculated via the recursion relationship derived by kuttler and wall 2008 the recursion relationship requires the values of the two previous sub iterations as well as an initial under relaxation factor in general a fixed initial under relaxation factor is widely used chow and ng 2016 chen and christensen 2018 however the value of the initial under relaxation factor is up to specific problems and using a uniform initial under relaxation factor for the all time steps may be inappropriate therefore in this study we rederive the adur scheme in which a novel method for evaluating the initial under relaxation factor is proposed we combine the abm method with the adur scheme at each time step the evaluation of the initial under relaxation factor is performed at the third sub iteration the second corrector of the abm method after which the under relaxation process is introduced the values obtained from the two previous time steps the predictor and the first corrector are used to calculate the initial under relaxation factor in other words a user determined initial under relaxation factor is no longer needed this combined method is embedded in openfoam and then it is examined with different interface capture schemes as well as mesh motion schemes by simulating several cases of multi dof the recommended iteration stop condition is summarised finally an experiment that investigates the interaction between a dam break flow and a floating box is simulated the good overall agreement between the numerical and experimental results shows that the present method is competent for simulating fsi problems of ocean engineering the article is organised as follows in section 1 the background of the present study is presented in section 2 the methods adopted in this study are described section 3 presents the validation of the present method two benchmark tests of single dof are considered and analysed in section 4 a three dimensional case is calculated the result is compared with the ones calculated from other built in methods of openfoam such as the newmark β method and the symplectic method also known as the leapfrog method dullweber et al 1997 devolder et al 2015 in section 5 the method is utilised to simulate an experiment that investigates the nonlinear fsi interaction between a dam break flow and a floating box section 6 summaries several useful conclusions of this study 2 methodology 2 1 numerical model 2 1 1 flow field equations the built in solver called interfoam is used with the variable time step abm method for the fsi simulation the governing equations of the flow field consist of two equations the mass conservation and momentum conservation equations for an incompressible fluid the mass conservation equation is 1 u 0 where u is the velocity field the momentum conservation equation with a moving mesh is 2 ρ u t ρ u u g u p ρ g h g x ρ μ u u σ κ α wd here u g is the velocity of the grid motion and it is obtained from the space conservation law jasak 2009 g is the gravitational acceleration and x x y z is the position vector p ρ g h p ρ g x is the dynamic pressure when the still water level is at z 0 wd is the source field for wave damping wang et al 2019 the term σ κ α in eq 2 represents the surface tension σ is the surface tension coefficient having a value of 0 07 and κ is the curvature of the interface α is the volume fraction which for a two phase model is also the weighting factor of the combination of the density ρ and viscosity μ as follows 3 ρ α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r 4 ρ α μ w a t e r 1 α μ a i r 2 1 2 rigid body motion equations two reference frames are generally defined for the 6dof motion of a rigid body global and body fixed reference frames the origin of the body fixed reference frames is at the rotation centre of structures the transformation tensor q which is defined by the right hand rule is used to transform variables from the body fixed frame to the global frame 5 φ g q φ b where φ is a variable of which the subscript b or g denotes the body fixed or global frame respectively in the present fsi system the fluid force acting on the rigid body is calculated by integrating the pressure and viscous force along the surface of the rigid body as follows 6 f g s p μ u u d s the torque is calculated as 7 τ g s x x c o m f g d s where x c o m is the position vector of the centre of mass once the global force and torque acting on the rigid body are obtained the linear acceleration and local torque can be calculated as follows 8 u t f g m 9 τ b q 1 τ g the relationship between the local torque and angular velocity ω is given by 10 τ b i ω t ω i ω where i a diagonal tensor is the moment of inertia of the rigid body the linear and angular accelerations can be calculated using eqs 8 and 10 respectively the linear and angular velocities at each time step are subsequently obtained thus the position and rotation of the rigid body can be estimated it should be noted that the surface of the rigid body is also a boundary of the flow field therefore updating the position and rotation of the rigid body affects the flow field instantaneously which makes sub iterations preferable during each time step until convergence to ensure a strong coupling between the fluid and structure solvers 2 1 3 interface capture the volume fraction is governed by the volume of fluid vof equation hirt and nichols 1981 11 α t α u 0 herein we consider two numerical schemes for the vof equation the first one is an algebraic scheme called mules multidimensional universal limiter for explicit solution the mules scheme contains a flux corrected transport algorithm and it has been the built in scheme of openfoam for many years when using the mules scheme eq 11 changes as follows 12 α t α u u r α 1 α 0 the term u r α 1 α is the additional convective term that is only valid in the vicinity of the two phase interface u r is the compression velocity field for more details the study of berberovic et al 2009 may be referred to the second scheme is a geometric scheme called isoadvector roenby et al 2016 this method comprises two steps the first step is interface reconstruction in the first step the cells of ϵ α 1 ϵ are selected where ϵ is the tolerance the isoface inside the cell as well as its motion is then calculated using the isoface the face interface intersection line and its motion on the downwind face can be calculated through these operations the time integral of the submerged area inside the cell can be evaluated making the second step volume fraction advection explicit in other words eq 11 can be directly updated without the use of other solving processes the value of ϵ should be carefully determined this is because the piso algorithm cannot strictly ensure that u 0 for all the cells the actual equation may be u ϵ 1 where ϵ 1 is an extremely small value the existence of ϵ 1 makes the total flux of a cell not strictly equal to zero therefore in the water region beneath the free surface the α updated by eq 11 may be slightly smaller than 1 therefore if one uses an overly small ϵ to search the interface cell the cell beneath the free surface may be selected thus resulting the problem of spurious air bubbles in the water region in openfoam the pressure velocity solving process is controlled by the tolerance of p ρ g h therefore to avoid this problem a feasible solution is to ensure that ϵ is greater than the tolerance of p ρ g h by at least one or two orders of magnitude roenby et al 2016 here we propose the use of an artificial relaxation to further resolve this spurious air bubble problem for the i th cell with 1 α i ϵ the value of α i is slightly adjusted using 13 α i c 0 α i 1 c 0 α t where α t 1 is the target value of the water phase c 0 is the weight calculated as follows 14 c 0 α i α t α i in the present study the tolerance of p ρ g h is set as 1 1 0 8 ϵ is set as 1 1 0 5 for both interface cell searching and artificial relaxation 2 1 4 mesh motion two mesh motion schemes are considered the first scheme is the conventional mesh deformation md scheme without topology change jasak and tuković 2010 in this scheme the velocity of the internal grid points is calculated by solving a laplace equation of which the rigid body surface acts as the boundary condition 15 γ u p 0 u p is the velocity of the grid points γ is the diffusivity parameter the value of which is based on the inverse of the distance from a designated cell to the moving boundary when the value of u p is known the new position of the grid point can be calculated 16 x p x p u p δ t the second scheme is the overset mesh om scheme noack 2005 in this scheme meshes of the background and geometry are separately generated via cell to cell mappings between these disconnected meshes a composite computational domain can be generated the cells are classified into three categories calculated interpolated and holes the governing equations are solved for calculated cells the interpolated cell is employed for information exchange between different mesh regions the holes cell which is always adopted to represent structures is blocked out during the calculation one of the greatest advantages of the om scheme is that the geometry mesh can move freely or as prescribed making it preferable for simulating the problem of the large motion of a rigid body chen and christensen 2018 the details of the hole cutting and donor searching are not present herein because the main focus of the present study is the abm method the work of noack et al 2009 and shen et al 2015 may be referred to for more information 2 2 the abm method with variable time steps the abm method is a multistep method the values of the two previous time steps are used to calculate the value of the current time step this method consists of an explicit predictor and several implicit correctors for solving the 6dof motion in fsi problems the method elaborated by seng 2012 is widely accepted and its structure has been used in the present study in this method the time step ratio ϖ is calculated first 17 ϖ δ t δ t 0 where δ t 0 and δ t are the spans of the previous and current time steps respectively subsequently the linear velocity is updated by the predictor as follows 18 u n p u o δ t 2 2 ϖ a o ϖ a o o and the position of the rigid body is calculated as follows 19 x n p x o δ t 16 ϖ 8 ϖ 1 u n p 7 ϖ 1 u o ϖ u o o it should be noted that for simplicity only the formulas of the linear velocity and position are presented herein because the formulas used for calculating the rotational motion are similar the subscripts n and o denote the new and old values and o o denotes the old old value the superscript p indicates that the variable is calculated via the predictor evidently in the predictor new values are not calculated by solving any governing equations but only from the values at the previous time steps using eq 19 the new position of the rigid body is updated and the boundary condition of the flow field changes accordingly via solving the flow field and then using eqs 6 and 8 the new linear acceleration a n p is obtained which is followed by the iteration process included in the corrector 20 u n n c u o δ t 16 ϖ 8 ϖ 1 a n n 1 c 7 ϖ 1 a o ϖ a o o 21 x n n c x o δ t 16 ϖ 8 ϖ 1 u n n c 7 ϖ 1 u o ϖ u o o here the superscript c indicates that the variable is calculated via the corrector u n n c denotes the new linear velocity calculated from the n th iteration of the corrector and x n n c denotes the new position calculated from the n th iteration of the corrector the new linear acceleration in eq 20 is calculated by solving the flow field of the last iteration and its initial value at the first corrector n 1 is equal to the value calculated from the predictor 22 a n 0 c a n p the above iteration process is continuously looped until convergence is reached which results in a strong coupling when solving fsi problems 2 3 the adur scheme in this section the derivation of the adur scheme is elaborated because it is slightly complicated and may cause confusion as in section 2 2 only the linear acceleration is presented herein for simplicity it should also be noted that scalar variables are used in the derivation and the vector form result is then directly obtained by extending the scalar form result it is because the method has a clear meaning for scalar cases but not for vector cases although it indeed works well for many fsi problems kuttler and wall 2008 let us start from the fixed point iteration in the case of strongly coupled fsi problems the iteration relationship has a general form of 23 a n 1 f a n m f a n here a n is the linear acceleration of the n th iteration f is the total force acting on the rigid body m is the mass of the rigid body we want to find a fixed point a a t a r g e t such that 24 a t a r g e t f a t a r g e t regardless of the under relaxation a series of linear accelerations a n can be calculated using eq 23 25 a n a n 1 a n 2 on considering the under relaxation eq 25 becomes 26 a n a a n 1 b a n 1 a a n 2 b the subscripts a and b represent after relaxation and before relaxation respectively according to the definition of under relaxation we obtain 27 a n 1 a a n a ω n a n 1 b a n a where ω n is the under relaxation factor our objective is to find a particular ω n such that the iteration can be accelerated in a manner of aitken s δ 2 method according to aitken s δ 2 method when n is large eq 24 can be written as follows 28 a n 2 b a t a r g e t a n 1 a a t a r g e t a n 1 b a t a r g e t a n a a t a r g e t on solving eq 28 we obtain 29 a t a r g e t a n 2 b a n a a n 1 b a n 1 a a n 2 b a n a a n 1 b a n 1 a according to eqs 26 and 29 when n is small we can construct the following recurrence relationship to accelerate the iteration 30 a n 2 a a n 2 b a n a a n 1 b a n 1 a a n 2 b a n a a n 1 b a n 1 a as in eq 27 we obtain 31 a n 2 a a n 1 a ω n 1 a n 2 b a n 1 a on solving eqs 30 and 31 the expression of the adur factor can be obtained 32 ω n 1 a n a a n 1 a a n 2 b a n a a n 1 b a n 1 a on substituting eq 27 into eq 32 the recurrence relationship of the under relaxation factor can be obtained 33 ω n 1 ω n a n 1 b a n a a n 2 b a n a a n 1 b a n 1 a if we introduce e r r n which can be described by the expression 34 e r r n a n 1 b a n a eq 33 can be simplified as 35 ω n 1 ω n e r r n e r r n 1 e r r n if e r r n is a vector variable i e err n eq 35 can be written as follows 36 ω n 1 ω n err n err n 1 err n ω n err n err n 1 err n err n 1 err n 2 eq 36 is the vector form recurrence relationship of the under relaxation factor which is identical to that proposed by kuttler and wall 2008 in the case of the initial under relaxation factor ω 0 a fixed value is widely used chen and christensen 2018 chow and ng 2016 herein we propose an alternative approach for evaluating ω 0 from eq 32 it can be concluded that the under relaxation factor is calculated using the four values or equivalently two pairs of values in eq 26 in other words the value of ω 0 can be evaluated after we determine these four previous values when using the abm method the converged values of the two previous time steps are accessible at the first corrector the value calculated by the predictor is also accessible therefore only one extra value is required if we adopt a n 1 c b the following expression of ω 0 can be obtained 37 ω 0 a o o a n p a n 1 c b a n p a o a o o a n 1 c b a n p a o a o o 2 besides as in the under relaxation method the value of the under relaxation factor should be in the range of 0 1 therefore another operation is required after calculating each ω n 38 ω n m a x 0 1 m i n ω n 1 0 it should be noted that the minimum value of ω n cannot be 0 because it will cause the other values of ω n to become 0 eq 35 in the present study the minimum value is set as 0 1 which is the value used by chow and ng 2016 at the first two time steps a o o and a o are unavailable seng 2012 and chow and ng 2016 used the explicit euler s method in our model the newmark β method is adopted 2 4 solving procedure the solving procedure of the numerical model is summarised as follows 1 enter the current time step read the current time step index 2 calculate the force and torque acting on the rigid body 3 update the position and rotation of the rigid body via the methods mentioned below 3 1 if the time step index is either 1 or 2 the newmark β method is used 3 2 if the time step index is 3 or larger the abm method is used 3 2 1 read the number of the current pimple outer loop nouter 3 2 2 if the number is 1 the predictor is used calculate the velocity and position explicitly repeat the same for rotation jump to step 4 3 2 3 if the number is 2 store the new linear acceleration a n p calculated by the predictor without under relaxation here we have three acceleration values and our objective is to have four jump to step 3 2 6 3 2 4 if the number is 3 store the new linear acceleration a n 1 c b as the fourth value use eq 37 to provide an assessment of the initial value of the under relaxation factor conduct the relaxation to calculate the new linear acceleration a n 1 c a repeat the same for rotation jump to step 3 2 6 3 2 5 if the number is larger than 3 store the new linear acceleration a n n 2 c b calculate the under relaxation factor via eq 36 conduct the relaxation to calculate the new linear acceleration a n n 2 c a repeat the same for rotation jump to step 3 2 6 3 2 6 update the velocity and position of the rigid body via eqs 20 and 21 repeat the same for rotation jump to step 4 4 move the grid points according to the position and rotation of the rigid body 5 solve the vof equation conduct the relaxation via eq 13 if the isoadvector is used 6 solve the flow field with the piso loop two or three loops are enough 7 judge whether the stop condition of the pimple outer loop is reached or not if the outer loop stops jump to step 1 for the next time step if the outer loop continues jump to step 2 the whole procedure is illustrated in fig 1 and several things should be clarified first nouter is equal to the corrector number plus one because the predictor is used at the first pimple outer loop second the initial under relaxation factor is evaluated at the second corrector i e the third pimple outer loop in other words the under relaxation is introduced from the second corrector third the position of the n th corrector x n n c is calculated using a n n 1 c a where n 1 for the first corrector and a n 0 c a n p eq 22 other necessary details of the under relaxation factor calculation are listed in table 1 3 validation free decaying motion of single dof in this section the abm method is validated by simulating two benchmark tests of a single dof free decaying translational and rotational motion is considered the simulation is two dimensional and the laminar model is adopted various interface capture and mesh motion schemes are considered the sensitivity of spatial and temporal resolution of the abm method is investigated and optimistic setups of the numerical model are obtained 3 1 decaying heave motion 3 1 1 sensitivity of spatial and temporal resolution the decaying heave motion of a cylinder has been studied for a long time maskell and ursell 1970 and ito 1977 presented their mathematical and physical studies respectively in the case of cfd this typical problem has been reproduced by many researchers gatin et al 2017 ghasemi et al 2014 in the study conducted by gatin et al 2017 the two dimensional computational domain is 60 0 m in length and 30 0 m in height the water depth is 20 0 m and the still water level is at z 0 the centre of the cylinder is located at 30 0 2 3 r where r 1 0 m is the radius of the cylinder the mass of the cylinder is 31 416 kg the left and right parts of the computational domain of 15 0 m each are the wave damping regions for eliminating reflected waves critical simulation parameters for all the cases are listed in table 2 to investigate the sensitivity of the spatial resolution three mesh refinement levels mrls which are referred to as coarse c medium m and refined r are considered the length and height of the most refined cell are 0 2 m and 0 1 m for the coarse mesh 0 1 m and 0 05 m for the medium mesh and 0 05 m and 0 025 m for the refined mesh two different mesh motion schemes are considered the md and om schemes fig 2 displays the coarse meshes used for the md and om schemes respectively two different interface capture schemes are considered the mules and isoadvector schemes we consider three combinations between the mesh motion schemes and interface capture schemes md mules om mules and om isoadvector to investigate the sensitivity of the temporal resolution three maximum courant numbers mcns are considered 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 the time step is set as 0 001 s initially and is adjusted by the mcn while the simulation is running as mentioned in section 2 1 3 the tolerance of p ρ g h is set as 1 10 8 for the piso loop the relative tolerance of p ρ g h ϵ p is adopted to control the pimple outer loop and its value is set as 1 10 4 the maximum number of the pimple outer loop nouter m a x is set as 22 which implies that 20 sub iterations with adur can be performed at most the pimple outer loop stops immediately once the value of ϵ p is less than 1 10 4 or when nouter reaches 22 the sensitivity of the spatial resolution is first investigated the value of the mcn is fixed at 0 5 the cases of different mrls are calculated under the conditions of md mules om mules and om isoadvector the results are listed in fig 3 the motion is normalised by the initial displacement δ 0 2 3 r the time is normalised by t g r 0 5 convergence is reached regardless of which numerical scheme combination is utilised with respect to the cases in which the md scheme is used the use of a coarse mesh should be avoided the sensitivity of the temporal resolution is investigated using different mcns but a uniform mrl the medium mesh is adopted as listed in table 2 three mcns with values of 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 are considered the results are presented in fig 4 from the figure it can be concluded that the time step does not have a significant effect on the simulation regardless of which numerical scheme combination is adopted 3 1 2 iteration stop condition as mentioned in section 3 1 1 two conditions are adopted for controlling the pimple outer loop the first is ϵ p equals to 1 10 4 and the second is nouter m a x equals to 22 in this section discussions on these iteration stop conditions are performed nouter m a x is treated as mutable while ϵ p keeps unchanged this is because the two conditions share an analogous effect on the simulation furthermore we find that ϵ p 1 10 4 is a relatively strict condition for this problem using this value ensures that the corrector can be reached at least two times during each time step two parameters should be introduced before the discussion the first parameter is the average relative error ξ t which is calculated as 39 ξ t 1 k 2 k 3 k a n n k c b a n n k 1 c a a n n k 1 c a the subscript t indicates that the relative error is calculated using the linear acceleration of translational motion similarly we can define ξ r for rotational motion k is the total number of time steps for a finished case the two initial time steps are left out in eq 39 because the newmark β method is used n k denotes the final pimple outer loop index for the k th time step the second parameter is the average iteration number n k which is calculated as 40 n k 1 k 2 k 3 k n k table 3 lists the values of ξ t and n k for all the cases mentioned in section 3 1 1 from the table we can obtain several useful findings for example the use of the om scheme can significantly diminish the number of the pimple outer loop n k is highly related to the mcn when the mrl remains unchanged the second finding indicates that the use of a larger mcn may not shorten the simulation time the reason for this can be briefly explained as follows when the mcn is large the time step is large and the model thus requires a greater number of pimple outer loops to converge when the mcn is small the time step is small and the model thus requires fewer pimple outer loops to converge however the use of smaller time steps also results in an increase in the simulation time therefore concerning the case of mild motion the mcn of 0 5 is preferred to maintain a balance between the time step span and iteration number it can be observed that when using the om scheme the value of n k is much less than that of nouter m a x in other words ϵ p has a dominant effect while nouter m a x is almost invalid some iterations may be redundant for the cases listed in table 3 therefore the cases having an mrl of m and mcn of 0 5 are recalculated with the nouter m a x set as 12 the results are exhibited in fig 5 and table 4 from the figure it can be observed that setting nouter m a x as 12 does not affect the result significantly for the two cases in which the om scheme is used the values of n k decrease the values of ξ t are still acceptable although they increase slightly on the other hand for the case in which the md scheme is used the value of n k is very close to that of nouter m a x which indicates that nouter m a x plays a dominant role this is also the reason why the ξ t value in table 4 is significantly increased generally when the md scheme is used the cells are directly compressed or stretched if the structure has a big movement the mesh quality will become bad which makes the numerical model require more sub iterations to converge in this case the motion is not violent and the spatial and temporal resolution is sufficiently high therefore such an large ξ t does not significantly affect the result 3 1 3 comparison with published results the results of the cases for which the mrl is m and nouter m a x is 12 are compared with other published results these published results comprise the theoretical study conducted by maskell and ursell 1970 the experiment conducted by ito 1977 and the cfd analysis performed by gatin et al 2017 the comparison is exhibited in fig 6 wherein a relatively good overall agreement can be found at the early stage the three newly calculated signals coincide with each other as the simulation proceeds slight deviations appear among these signals the signal calculated under the condition of om isoadvector matches best with the published ones the signal calculated under the condition of om mules shows an undesired uplift when t g r 0 5 15 0 the amplitude of the signal calculated under the condition of md mules is slightly smaller than that under the condition of om isoadvector 3 2 decaying roll motion 3 2 1 sensitivity of spatial and temporal resolution in contrast to translational motion rotational motion is strongly affected by the viscous damping caused by flow separation especially for the blunt shaped floating structure jung et al 2006 using the linear potential theory to calculate this viscous damping may be inadequate because the viscosity of the fluid is ignored therefore it is difficult to precisely reproduce rotation especially for roll motion to validate the abm method a benchmark test of the decaying roll motion of a rectangular box is simulated the experiment was performed by jung et al 2006 and has been reproduced by many researchers chen et al 2016 ghasemi et al 2014 calderer et al 2014 the two dimensional computational domain used is 10 0 m in length and 1 4 m in height the water depth is 0 9 m and the still water level is at z 0 the box is 0 3 m in length and 0 1 m in height the centre of the box is located at 5 0 0 with an initial angle of 15 the left and right parts of the computational domain having a length of 3 0 m each are the wave damping regions for eliminating reflected waves in the experiment the mass of the box is 28 32 kg as in section 3 1 1 three mrls are considered the length and height of the most refined grid are 0 025 m and 0 025 m for the coarse mesh 0 0125 m and 0 0125 m for the medium mesh and 0 00625 m and 0 00625 m for the refined mesh fig 7 displays the coarse meshes used for the md and om schemes respectively the other setups are identical to those listed in section 3 1 1 the sensitivity of the spatial resolution is first investigated the cases of different mrls are simulated under the conditions ofmd mules om mules and om isoadvector nouter m a x is set as 22 the results are presented in fig 8 the time is normalised using t g d 0 5 where d is the water depth from a and b of fig 8 it can be observed that for the case of roll motion achieving convergence with these three meshes appears to be slightly difficult therefore as shown in c of fig 8 we consider an additional case using a further refined fr mesh the length and height of the most refined grid are 0 005 m and 0 005 m for the further refined mesh respectively the result hardly changes with the use of this further refined mesh indicating that convergence has been reached when the refined mesh is adopted it should be noted that only one additional case is calculated for the sake of saving time in the cases under the conditions of md mules and om mules it can be deduced that convergence has been reached when the refined mesh is adopted the sensitivity of the temporal resolution is investigated using different mcns the refined mesh is used for the simulation as listed in table 2 three mcns with values of 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 are considered the results are listed in fig 9 from the figure it can be concluded that the time step does not have a significant effect on the simulation regardless of which numerical scheme combination is adopted this is identical to what has been observed in section 3 1 1 3 2 2 iteration stop condition table 5 lists the values of ξ r and n k for all the cases mentioned in section 3 2 1 from the table several findings can be obtained which are similar to those concluded in section 3 1 2 besides the effect of the interface capture scheme is highlighted n k of the cases with the use of the isoadvector scheme is significantly less than that of the cases with the use of the mules scheme the cases for which the mrl is r and mcn is 0 5 are recalculated with nouter m a x set as 12 the results are exhibited in fig 10 and table 6 similarly from the figure it can be found that setting nouter m a x as 12 does not affect the result significantly 3 2 3 comparison with published results several published results including both the experimental jung et al 2006 and cfd chen et al 2016 ghasemi et al 2014 calderer et al 2014 results are introduced to compare with the calculated result fig 11 it should be indicated that the amplitude of the calculated signal is very sensitive to the damping coefficient calderer et al 2014 it is because the experimental facilities have a friction loss unlike the cfd programs which makes the precise matching of their amplitudes slightly difficult the appropriate value of the damping coefficient for this problem was investigated by calderer et al 2014 using several numerical tests therefore the focus should be on the comparison of the cfd results generally satisfactory agreement is observed between the present and published results in the case of these three newly calculated results the two calculated by the om scheme are almost identical however the signal computed using the md scheme is slightly different from the two obtained using the om scheme both the amplitude and natural frequency are slight greater 4 comparison with weakly coupled methods in this section we simulate a three dimensional case of multi dof for comparing the abm method with the other two openfoam built in methods the leapfrog and newmark β methods the case named floatingobject is an openfoam built in tutorial the two interface capture schemes are considered only the om scheme is considered because according to section 3 the md scheme requires too many sub iterations and cannot handle the case of large motion similar to the last section the laminar model is used for the simulation 4 1 numerical setup the computational domain and its size are presented in fig 12 the computational domain is 1 4 m 1 4 m and 1 2 m in the x direction from x 0 2 m to x 1 2 m y direction from y 0 2 m to y 1 2 m and z direction from z 0 2 m to z 1 0 m respectively a rigid cube is placed at the centre of the computational domain the cube is 0 24 m 0 24 m and 0 4 m in the x y and z directions respectively the mass of the cube is 16 128 kg the cube is constrained to heave only while there is no limit to its rotational motion in other words this is an fsi problem of 4dof the water depth is 0 74 m at a corner of the computational domain there is a cubic water reservoir whose length width and height are 0 3 m 0 3 m and 0 2 m respectively the cubic reservoir collapses immediately when the simulation starts which forces the cube to move the mesh is composed of cubic cells with a side length of 0 02 m only one mrl is considered in this section it is because three dimensional cases are time consuming especially being solved by strongly coupled algorithms furthermore for this case there is no experimental or theoretical data available to validate the calculated result therefore in terms of practical applications it may be more meaningful to investigate the temporal convergence performance of the abm method on a relatively coarse mesh to shorten the simulation time ϵ p is set as 0 and nouter m a x is set as 7 which indicates that a fixed number of the pimple outer loop is adopted it should be pointed that setting nouter m a x as 7 may result in an increase in ξ t and ξ r however this is not important because our focus is on the temporal convergence according to the default setup a probe located at 0 00132 0 0009 0 005 is used to sample the velocity and pressure other setups are listed in table 7 two methods for solving the motion equation are considered the leapfrog and newmark β methods the leapfrog method is explicit and can thus only be used with the weakly coupled strategy in the newmark β method two widely used values of γ 0 5 and β 0 25 are adopted the newmark β method is also used with the weakly coupled strategy the under relaxation factor for these two methods is set as 0 5 4 2 result analysis 4 2 1 result of isoadvector in this section the result calculated with the isoadvector scheme is presented and discussed although there is no experimental or theoretical data available for validation we can approximately evaluate the quality of the outcome because the computational domain is axisymmetric herein we introduce three criteria the sum of the pitch and roll motion should be close to zero and the yaw motion should be close to zero the value of the x directional velocity component should approximately equal to that of the y directional velocity component because the probe is nearly at the symmetry axis the pressure value should fluctuate around the initial value hydrostatic pressure fig 13 displays the result calculated using the leapfrog method in the case of the pressure it can be observed that the convergence is not satisfactory when the mcn is 0 5 an apparent oscillation occurs at approximately t 1 6 s which makes the pitch and yaw motion deviate from the signals calculated with the other mcns in comparison the heave and roll motion as well as the velocity field is not affected by the oscillation fig 14 displays the result calculated using the newmark β method similar to what was observed in fig 13 a pressure oscillation occurs and contaminates the motion state of the cube both the translational and rotational motion is affected wherein the yaw motion is affected most on solving the navier stokes equations the pressure converges in an oscillatory manner due to the elliptic nature of the pressure equation gatin et al 2017 if the weakly coupled scheme is used the unwanted pressure oscillation is likely to occur because there is no convergence guarantee at each time step furthermore the setup of numerical models such as the grid size and interface capture scheme also affects the pressure oscillation problem fig 15 displays the result calculated using the abm method the pressure oscillation problem is resolved owing to the use of the strongly coupled scheme the convergence is relatively satisfactory for both the flow field properties velocity and pressure and motion state it is demonstrated that using a strongly coupled scheme is a feasible approach to avoid the pressure oscillation problem fig 16 displays the comparison of the results obtained using different motion equation solving methods but a uniform mcn 0 1 the results of these three cases are almost identical except in terms of the yaw motion in terms of the yaw motion the only difference between these three curves is the zero position the curve calculated via the abm method is closer to zero while the other two curves show an uplift trend according to the three criteria mentioned above an mcn of 0 1 is considered to be desirable to yield a favourable result 4 2 2 result of mules in this section the result calculated with the mules scheme is presented and discussed fig 17 displays the result calculated using the leapfrog method in contrast to fig 13 the pressure oscillation problem almost disappears and the convergence of yaw motion improves significantly furthermore an analogous phenomenon can be observed from the result calculated using the newmark β method fig 18 it is demonstrated that the interface capture scheme indeed affects the pressure oscillation problem fig 19 displays the result calculated using the abm method compared to the result obtained with weakly coupled schemes the result of the abm method converges faster the result calculated with mcn 0 25 almost coincides with the one calculated with mcn 0 1 which means an mcn of 0 25 may be enough to yield an acceptable result similar to section 4 2 1 the comparison of the results which are calculated using different motion equation solving methods but a uniform mcn 0 1 is listed in fig 20 the three results are almost identical indicating that the convergence is reached with the mcn equals to 0 1 4 2 3 effect of interface capture schemes fig 21 displays the result calculated using the abm method with different interface capture schemes the value of the mcn used is 0 1 the two results listed in fig 21 match well with each other except in terms of the yaw motion the reason is as follows for this case the yaw motion is quite sensitive to the free surface in the vicinity of the cube because of using a relatively coarse mesh the calculated free surface around the structure changes as per the different interface capture schemes adopted making the yaw motion curves have different zero positions we believe that the use of a more refined mesh can improve the result with the use of such a small mcn the pressure oscillation problem disappears regardless of which interface capture schemes is adopted therefore it can be deduced that the effect of interface capture schemes on the pressure oscillation problem attributes to the temporal resolution in other words if the temporal and spatial resolution is sufficiently high the only reason left for the pressure oscillation problem is the coupling strategy however as a result of calculation cost we seldom adopt a sufficiently high temporal and spatial resolution for three dimensional cases therefore the strongly coupled method is preferable to avoid the pressure oscillation problem 5 application interaction between a dam break flow and a floating box in this section the application of the abm method is presented an experiment that investigates the interaction between the dam break flow and a floating box is simulated 5 1 experiment setup the experiment is conducted in a glass wall water tank the length width and height of the water tank are 2 0 m 0 6 m and 0 8 m respectively the configuration of the experiment is presented in fig 22 the glass gate is 0 5 m away from the right wall forming a water reservoir with a water depth of 0 25 m at the left side of the gate there exists an initial water layer with a water depth of 0 15 m a floating box is located on the water layer 0 15 m away from the left wall the floating box is 0 3 m in length 0 1 m in height and 0 595 m in width the experiment is designed to be two dimensional and there is a gap of 0 25 cm in the width direction between the floating box and the water tank wall the mass and moment of inertia of the floating box are 5 35 kg and 0 045 kg m 2 respectively by releasing a weight whose weight is 29 kg the gate can be instantaneously lifted by the rope according to the recommendation of lauber and hager 1998 the non dimensional opening time is defined as 41 t t g h r where h r is the water depth of the reservoir t the actual opening time a sufficiently sudden removal is considered to be realised when t 1 414 in the experiment the value of t is 0 18 s and the corresponding value of t is 0 89 the floating box is allowed to heave and roll freely therefore this is an fsi problem of 2dof at the initial stage the floating box has a draught of 0 03 m two wave gauges and one pressure probe are used to measure the surface elevation and impact pressure respectively the first wave gauge is located at the left wall with the aim of measuring the run up on the left wall the second wave gauge is placed next to the gate 1 3 m away from the left wall with the aim of capturing the initial profile of the dam break wave the pressure probe is located at the air water interface seaside of the floating box the sampling interval of the pressure probe is 0 001 s the experiment is repeated three times and the final result is obtained by averaging those repeated results 5 2 numerical setup the computational domain is two dimensional and the numerical configuration is identical to that of the experiment according to the findings presented in the previous sections the isoadvector scheme is adopted for the interface capture and the om scheme is adopted for the mesh motion ϵ p is set as 1 10 5 and nouter m a x is set as 12 for dam break related problems the fsi process is nonlinear and violent therefore to yield a satisfactory result the temporal and spatial resolution should be sufficiently high the value of the mcn is set as 0 25 to determine the appropriate mesh three mrls are considered the coarse mesh is composed of square cells with a side length of 0 005 m the medium mesh is composed of square cells with a side length of 0 004 m while the refined mesh is composed of square cells with a side length of 0 0025 m furthermore the k epsilon model is used to closure the governing equation 5 3 result fig 23 displays the results calculated using different mrls from the figure it is observed that the result is convergent when the medium mesh is used the result calculated using the medium mesh is almost identical to that obtained using the refined mesh therefore the result of the medium mesh is selected for the comparison with the experimental data it should also be indicated that the pressure oscillation problem occurs when using the coarse mesh because of using the strongly coupled method such a pressure oscillation hardly affects the final result the comparison of the experimental and numerical results is presented in fig 24 the overall agreement is acceptable in the first 5 s and it worsens slightly in the last 5 s the reason for this observation is as follows first the water tank used in the experiment is 0 6 m in width while the numerical simulation is two dimensional compared to the length 2 0 m or height 0 8 m of the water tank its width is actually non negligible especially for a long simulation time second the gate and its sliding rail affect the result from fig 22 it is clear that the sliding rail of the gate is placed inside the water tank causing the actual width there to be less than 0 6 m therefore the surface elevation measured by wg2 which is placed in the vicinity of the gate has a phase difference with that calculated from the numerical model third the experiment facility such as the rotation shaft has a friction loss while it is considered to be smooth in the numerical simulation it is the reason why the calculated roll motion is greater than that of the experiment at approximately t 7 0 s finally this experiment is inherently complicated because it contains both a floating structure and a dam break flow all of which is relatively difficult to simulate the comparison of the experimental and numerical snapshots is presented in fig 25 in the figure the moment of the top snapshot is defined as t 0 according to which the moments of the other snapshots are defined at t t 0 the bore generated by the dam break flow is propagating towards the floating box at t t 0 0 36 s the bore reaches the floating box climbing the seaward of the floating box as a result the floating box turns anticlockwise slightly at t t 0 0 6 s most of the water flows through under the box because of the close distance between the box and the rear wall the leeward water level rises considerably lifting the lower left corner of the box therefore the box is observed to have a clockwise rotation angle and on the seaward a hollow appears between the box and the free surface at t t 0 0 78 s the hollow is filled by the water forming a phenomenon of secondary slamming subsequently the water is reflected by the rear wall and the leeward water level descends as displayed in the snapshots of t t 0 0 96 s and t t 0 1 22 s the overall agreement between the experimental and numerical snapshots is satisfactory which demonstrates that the present method is competent to reproduce complicated fsi processes 6 conclusions in this paper an extended abm method with aitken s dynamic under relaxation is proposed the derivation of aitken s dynamicunder relaxation is elaborated in which a new approach for evaluating the initial under relaxation factor is presented the initial under relaxation factor at every time step is automatically evaluated in the algorithm instead of being defined by the users the algorithm is embedded in openfoam based on the simulation of various cases with different numerical schemes we arrive at the following conclusions the strongly coupled method increase the calculation time therefore it is essential to use appropriate iteration stop conditions in openfoam the relative error of the pressure field ϵ p and the maximum pimple outer loop number nouter m a x can be adopted as iteration stop conditions an appropriate iteration stop condition should ensure aitken s dynamic under relaxation to be conducted approximately 5 10 times during each time step generally a relatively small ϵ p which makes nouter m a x a major role in pimple loop control is preferred temporal and spatial resolution is critical to the simulation of fsi problems when the temporal and spatial resolution is low the use of weakly coupled methods may cause the problem of pressure oscillation in comparison the use of strongly coupled methods avoids this problem compared to the mesh deformation scheme the overset mesh scheme is preferable because it can handle the large motion problem with respect to interface capture schemes the mules and isoadvector schemes have their advantages and disadvantages however both of them can yield excellent results as long as the temporal and spatial resolution used is appropriate the proposed setup of the present method is listed as follows as mentioned above the value of ϵ p should be sufficiently small a value of 1 1 0 4 or smaller is proposed to save calculation time the value of nouter m a x should not be too large we deem that nouter m a x 12 is sufficient for most cases however users can adjust these factors according to their specific problems as well as computing power credit authorship contribution statement dongxu wang conceptualization methodology software validation investigation data

21262,this study presents a framework for assessing the seismic performance of a pile supported wharf at different seismic hazard levels a refined three dimensional 3d finite element fe model is conducted using the open source computational platform opensees the modeling strategies of the refined numerical model are given in detail including refined modeling of free field boundaries and soil pile interaction two seismic hazard levels adopted by the design standard for seismic design of piers and wharves asce 2014 are considered namely contingency level earthquake cle and design earthquake de the seismic performance of the wharf ground system is systematically explored in the following two aspects first the evaluation of seismic performance is based on the time history response for cle and de motion second the seismic performance is assessed by averaging maximum response for all 28 de and cle motions the results from this study reveal that i the seismic response of the wharf ground system is larger under a de motion than under a cle motion ii the pile foundation with a short free length is more vulnerable to damage for both seismic hazard levels and iii the fiber strains of piles are significantly lower than the strain limits in the design standard asce 2014 keywords pile wharf seismic response hazard level numerical simulation 1 introduction pile supported wharf systems are extensively used in the construction of port facilities due to its many merits but such a system is very vulnerable to severe damage during major earthquake events the seismic performance of a pile supported wharf system under earthquake events is of great concern especially at different performance earthquake hazard levels asce 2014 chiaramonte et al 2013 erdogan et al 2017 vytiniotis et

infrastructure systems e g buildings and bridges have been extensively investigated under different seismic hazard levels for example mohsenian et al 2019 proposed a novel multilevel approach to consider the seismic hazard levels and predict the seismic demand of non structural components for building samadian et al 2019 evaluated the seismic resilience of school at four hazard levels

time history analysis nltha antonellis and panagiotou 2014 investigated the seismic response of reinforced concrete bridges at two seismic hazard levels with return periods of 975 and 2475 years using three dimensional nltha however limited research has been conducted on finite element fe analysis of seismic performance evaluation of pile supported wharves at different hazard levels to the best of the authors knowledge only the following four studies are available in the literature chiaramonte et al 2013 conducted two dimensional 2d nltha of a pile supported wharf facility using 13 ground motions scaled to three hazard levels corresponding to 2 5 and 10 probabilities of exceedance in 50 years they found that the demands from inertial forces alone were insufficient to cause damage in the wharf facility and the demands from soil deformations were not substantial jaradat et al 2013 performed crane wharf interaction analysis for ole cle and de levels of ground motions and found that the pile displacement demand for the de level is about 27 higher than that of the cle level dickenson et al 2014 evaluated the seismic performance of a pile supported wharf for ole and cle level ground motions using a 2d flac model hur et al 2019 evaluated the seismic performance of a wharf system and seismic damage to a seaport for two earthquake scenarios that represent moderate and strong events along with the previous efforts su et al 2017 a computational framework for evaluating the seismic performance of a pile supported wharf system at different seismic hazard levels is presented in this study specifically the nltha of a pile supported wharf system are conducted at cle and de hazard levels each containing 14 ground motions a refined three dimensional 3d fe was built for nltha based on the port of los angeles berth 100 layout emi 2001 seismic response associated with the wharf ground system for both hazard level events are discussed based on results of the time history response characteristics of the average maximum responses are evaluated in terms of mean and standard deviation this study enables us to have a better understanding of the seismic performance of pile supported wharves at different seismic hazard levels based on the above the main contributions of this study are threefold first a refined 3d fe model of wharf ground system is created considering soil pile interaction and nonlinearity of prestressed reinforced concrete pile second seismic time history response of wharf ground system is investigated thoroughly under the representative cle and de motions and average seismic response of such system is explored systematically subjected to compatible acceleration spectra cle and de motion sets third the computed fiber strains of concrete and prestressing steel are analyzed and compared with strain limits from design standard for seismic design of piers and wharves asce 2014 2 finite element modeling the pile supported structural and ground configuration fig 1 under investigation is a typical port facility in the southwest u s region the wharf structure consists of a reinforced concrete deck supported on six rows of vertical pre cast concrete piles the piles have octagonal shaped cross sections all piles have a length of 42 m except for pile e2 with 18 m in length fig 2 that was included for adding lateral seismic resistance emi 2001 the long piles are embedded 4 5 m deep into the very dense base sand stratum the 3d fe simulation of this wharf ground system was conducted using the objected oriented open source software framework opensees the open system for earthquake engineering it allows users to perform both serial and parallel nonlinear fe analysis for simulating the seismic response of structural and geotechnical systems subjected to earthquake and other hazards http opensees berkeley edu mckenna et al 2000 the fe wharf ground system equations were solved by the newmark integration method newmark 1959 with parameters γ 0 6 and β 0 3025 in the longitudinal direction fig 1a the wharf is composed of a large number of identical 3d slices each of which is 6 1 m thick therefore a representative 3d slice is selected for the seismic response analysis of the wharf ground system fig 2 shows the idealization of the representative 3d slice the seismic excitation response was investigated only in the transverse landside waterside direction and the free field boundary conditions at both longitudinal ends fig 1a are implicitly assumed to have a relatively minor influence this 3d fe model is essentially similar to a 2d plane strain analysis approach but the former enables more accurate simulation of the actual 3d geometric pile layout and the associated pile ground pile interaction as such a refined fe model of the wharf ground system is created and computed through the parallel opensees i e openseessp in this model there are 30 248 brickup elements 2895 linear elastic beam column elements 502 nonlinear fiber section beam column elements and 5765 zero length elements the fe modeling details are presented below 2 1 modeling of soil layers the fe ground model is 230 m long and 6 1 m wide figs 2 and 3 the soil layers are 33 5 m deep at the waterside the right end side and 53 8 m deep at the landside the left end side the soil domain is idealized into 4 units fig 3 including 9 sub layers as well as the dike structure table 1 the topmost soil unit i is represented by vertical nodal forces that also account for container stacking and handling loads soil unit ii is divided into 3 sub layers upper loose to medium dense silty sand iia middle dense to very dense sand and silty sand iib and lower medium dense silty sand clayey sand interbedded with layers of silt and clay iic soil unit iii is split into 3 cohesive sub layers with stiffness and strength increase as a function of depth soil unit iv is composed of 2 sub layers upper dense sand clayey sand iva and lower very dense silty sand ivb the water table is at the top of sub layer iia fig 3 additional detailed information about the soil layers is presented in an emi report 2001 the soil domain is modeled by 8 node effective stress solid fluid fully coupled brick elements the maximum height of the brick element at the bottom of the fe model is 2 333 m the modeling of soil layers employs the pressuredependmultiyield pdmy and pressureindependmultiyield pimy soil models parra 1996 yang 2000 yang et al 2003 elgamal et al 2003 2009 khosravifar et al 2018 in opensees based on multi yield surface plasticity theory prevost 1978 1985 the pdmy soil model is used to characterize the nonlinear behavior of sand during cyclic loading to be specific the yield function of the pdmy model follows the classical plasticity convention it is assumed that the elasticity of material is linear and isotropic and the plasticity of material is nonlinear and anisotropic the yield function forms a conical surface in the stress space with its apex on the hydrostatic axis several similar yield surfaces with a common apex and different size form the hardening zone and the outermost surface is the envelope of peak shear strength the flow rule of the pdmy model defines the direction of plastic strain increments using the normality rule the soil contractive dilative behavior is handled by a non associative flow rule correspondingly the pimy soil model is used to capture the shear behavior of clay under cyclic loading which is independent of confinement 2 2 modeling of the pile supported wharf the prestressed reinforced concrete piles are modeled using 3d fiber section nonlinear force based beam column elements whose maximum length is 2 035 m the pile cross section is shown in fig 4 a and its discretization into concrete and prestressing steel fibers is shown in fig 4 b in this fiber section the core and cover concrete are modeled with the concrete01 material in opensees with degraded linear unloading reloading stiffness and the prestressing steel is modeled using the steel02 material in opensees with an imposed initial strain to model the prestressing the parameters of the concrete and prestressing steel constitutive models are given in table 2 the moment curvature response of the prestressed pile cross section against different axial forces is shown in fig 4 c which reveals that the moment capacity is enhanced with the increase of the compressive axial force rigid beam column links fig 2 which are normal to the pile longitudinal axis are used to represent the geometric space of piles elgamal et al 2008 two types of zero length elements i e zerolength and zerolengthsection elements in opensees are used to model the soil pile interface the zerolength elements aim to axially connect the rigid link elements to the corresponding soil nodes along the soil pile interface the zerolengthsection elements provide the skin friction yield shear force to simulate the interface slip such yield shear force depends on the length and depth of pile elements as well as soil properties i e friction angle and cohesion note that the end nodes of rigid link elements near soil elements have the same coordinates i e soil nodes as the nodes of zero length elements the inertia of the pile is simulated by defining a density parameter associated with the pile more details regarding the soil pile interface modeling is referred to su et al 2017 the applied deck weight is 5340 kn which is estimated based on the deck self weight the acting live load and the crane load the deck is assumed to linear elastic and thus modeled through elastic beam column elements the rigid link is employed for modeling pile deck connection for simplification the locations of landside and waterside lateral boundaries are away from the pile supported wharf structure figs 2 and 3 out of plane motion is not allowed along the transverse symmetry planes fig 1 in other words the out of plane effects are ignored the loading conditions are implemented in a staged manner more details about modeling of the wharf ground system are referred to su et al 2017 and 2019 2 3 ground motions the ground motions were selected based on the report of emi 2006 and 2012 which conducted a port wide ground motion study of port of los angeles california in these reports 7 earthquake records table 3 are selected based on two criteria moment magnitude from 6 5 to 7 5 and stations with distances of 0 10 km the fault normal fn and fault parallel fp components of the selected records are modified to match the uniform hazard spectrum uhs using the rspmatch program abrahamson 1998 the resulting acceleration time histories were then scaled to cle and de levels a total of 28 ground motion time histories are created including 7 fn type motions and 7 fp type motions for the cle level and 7 fn type motions and 7 fp type motions for the de level fig 5 shows the generated ground motions the peak ground acceleration pga of a cle motion is around 0 22 g and the pga of a de motion is about 0 30 g for demonstration convenience the first motion of the cle fn motion set is marked by cle fn 1 and similar for other motions the acceleration response spectra of these 28 ground motions with 5 damping are shown in fig 6 emi 2006 and 2010 which reveals that ground motions for each hazard level i e cle and de almost present identical acceleration response spectra 3 seismic response for representative ground motions according to the report of emi 2006 and 2012 the cle fn 6 and de fn 6 motions i e 1940 imperial valley earthquake el centro station record shown in table 3 produce the largest lateral displacement as such the time history response of the wharf ground system subjected to the representative cle fn 6 and de fn 6 motions fig 5 are investigated here the analysis results are detailed below 3 1 soil and deck response fig 7 shows the shear stress strain and displacement response of soil deposit at location p see fig 3 as well as the deck displacement and acceleration response subjected to cle fn 6 and de fn 6 motions peak and permanent soil displacements at 33 1 m elevation for the de motion fig 7b are greater than those for the cle motion fig 7a the permanent soil displacement is around 0 025 m and 0 13 m for the cle and de motions respectively compared to the cle motion fig 7a the de motion fig 7b produces permanent shear deformation in the low strength clay layer at 33 1 m elevation layer iiia in fig 3 the large shear strain excursion corresponds to the observed jump in permanent displacement as shown in fig 7 b the deck permanent displacement is about 0 2 m and 0 4 m for the cle and de motions respectively fig 7 this is mainly because the amplitude of a de motion is larger than that of a cle motion as such the greater soil deformation and inertial force are produced by de motion which will result in larger deck displacement compared to the soil displacement the wharf deck permanent displacement is relatively large the displacement and acceleration of the wharf deck for a de motion is greater than that for a cle motion in view of above it may be concluded that the wharf ground system is more vulnerable to damage when subjected to a de motion 3 2 pile moment curvature response fig 8 shows the pile curvature response profiles at the end of shaking for the cle fn 6 and de fn 6 motions overall for cle and de motions the pile curvature response profile at the end of shaking present a similar pattern and larger pile curvatures mainly occur in the weak layer iiia ground surface the interface between layers ivb and iiib2 and the top of piles e and f fig 3 these locations of large curvatures on piles are consistent with post earthquake damage investigation of a pile supported wharf green et al 2011 werner et al 2011 the de motion causes larger pile curvature than the cle motion maximum pile curvatures are labeled with blue circles the maximum curvature on piles e1 and f1 occurs at the pile top for de motions which is related to free length of pile the locations of maximum curvatures for pile are similar for cle and de motions for comparison with design standard requirements asce 2014 shown in table 4 the computed response of the pile top and pile in ground i e pile shaft will be evaluated in the following analysis the pile shaft refers to the entire pile length excluding the pile top in this study fig 9 shows the bending moment curvature response bending moment and curvature response time histories at the pile top the pile top moment curvature response exhibits weak nonlinearity under the cle motion except for piles e1 and f1 for the de motion the evident nonlinear behavior that yield bending moment is reached is observed for piles e1 and f1 such a response pattern is well in accordance with the moment curvature response of the pile cross section fig 4c piles a1 d1 essentially remains a low level of nonlinearity for de motions fig 9b the bending moment curvature response bending moment and curvature response time histories for the pile shaft are shown in fig 10 in which the maximum curvature occurred at the end of shaking for the cle motions nonlinear behavior at the pile shaft fig 10a is similar to the pile top fig 9a for the de motions the yield bending moment is reached fig 10b for piles d1 f1 and significant nonlinearity is observed for piles a1 c1 from figs 9 and 10 overall the nonlinear behavior of the pile moment curvature response is more noticeable for the cle motions than the de motions time histories of pile bending moment and curvature present a similar response pattern for both cle and de motions the pile top is more susceptible to severe damage because of the induced excessive deformation 3 3 fiber strain response to further study the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the prestressed concrete piles the prestressing steel and concrete i e core and cover strain response of the outmost fibers see fig 4b are explored figs 11 and 12 show the core and cover concrete and prestressing steel fiber strain time histories at the pile top corresponding to the maximum curvature at the end of shaking see fig 8 note that strain is positive if pile is in compression and is negative if pile is in tension from fig 11 the concrete is in compression and prestressing steel is in tension at the left edge of cross section at the pile top before shaking during shaking the concrete strain decreases with the increase of prestressing steel strain and vice versa this shows transformation between concrete and prestressing steel strains on the pile cross section obviously the cover concrete fiber strain is greater than the core fiber strain which indicates that the damage of pile foundation will occur initially at the cover concrete fiber strain response for a de motion is larger than that for a cle motion the fluctuation of strain response on the top of piles e1 and f1 is more evident than that on the top of piles a1 d1 this can be illustrated by the fact that the significant nonlinearity is presented for the moment curvature response on the top of piles e1 and f1 the similar observations can be made for pile top right edge fig 12 in general the only difference is that the pile left edge is in compression while the pile right edge is in tension and thus the fiber strain for pile left and right edges display the inverse trend figs 11 and 12 in summary the fiber strain response is consistent with the moment curvature response for pile cross section since the fiber strain is an indicator of curvature on pile the larger fiber strain on pile is presented for the de motion compared to the cle motion this also shows that the piles are more vulnerable under the de motion 4 average seismic response for multiple ground motions according to design standard asce 2014 the response used in analysis and design shall be taken as the average response when seven or more input earthquake motions are used thus the average response of the wharf ground system subjected to multiple ground motions are also studied nonlinear time history analysis of the wharf ground system is performed repeatedly for each of cle and de motion sets the analysis results are collected and then the statistical characteristics of the response are evaluated 4 1 lateral deformation the averages of maximum lateral displacement response under the cle and de motions are displayed in fig 13 overall the average maximum displacement response for the de motions are larger than those for the cle motions for the dike the average maximum displacement occurs in the middle of slope and the smallest displacement occurs in the dike toe fig 3 under the de motions the average of maximum deck displacement about 0 22 m is larger than that of maximum dike crest displacement about 0 19 m in general the average of maximum displacement on pile is greater than that of slope displacement which shows that the pile has slightly larger displacement than the slope in particular the standard deviation of the displacement under the de motions is larger than that under the cle motions this indicates that the displacement response shows larger variation for the de motions 4 2 shear force and bending moment figs 14 and 15 show the average of maximum shear force and bending moment of the pile top and shaft for the cle and de motions apparently the average of maximum shear force at the pile shaft is larger than that at pile top for both cle and de hazard levels fig 14 this may be related to the larger lateral deformation in weak layer iiia with lower shear modulus the average of maximum shear force for the de motions is higher than that for the cle motions especially for pile shaft piles e1 and f1 present greater axial force compared to other piles for both cle and de hazard levels such response is consistent with the moment curvature response fig 9 under the de and cle motions the average of maximum axial force presents a decreasing trend with growth of free pile length regardless of pile top and shaft this suggests that free pile length has a significant influence on the average of maximum shear force on pile since the shorter free pile length has the larger lateral stiffness the shorter free pile length will produce larger shear force under the same displacement of pile top this indicates that damage of the pile top for a short free pile length is more likely to occur during an earthquake in addition the standard deviation of shear force on the pile top is smaller than that on pile shaft in general the similar response pattern occurs for the average of maximum bending moment fig 15 4 3 axial force fig 16 shows the average of maximum compressive axial forces of pile top and pile shaft under the cle and de motions it can be seen that the average of maximum compressive axial forces at pile top which are mainly caused by the deck self weight do not change much for both hazard levels compared to the pile top the pile shaft experiences larger compressive axial force the pile shaft compressive axial force seems to be proportional to the pile embedded length which demonstrates that the axial force on the pile is influenced by soil pile interaction similarly the average of maximum compressive axial forces of pile top and shaft at the de level are greater than that of the cle level especially for pile shaft fig 17 demonstrates the average of minimum compressive axial force for pile top and the average of maximum tensile axial force for cle and de motions from fig 17 a the average of axial force on the pile top is negative i e compression for all piles under the de and cle motions this is because the axial force is mainly caused by the deck self weight the average of tensile axial forces are observed at the pile shafts of all piles and pile b1 has a maximum value of 700 kn fig 17b which may be related to pile configuration of the wharf structure the average of tensile axial force on the pile shaft are slightly larger for the de motions compared to the cle motions fig 17b and the average of compressive axial force on the pile top are lower for the de motions compared to the cle motions fig 17a 4 4 fiber strain figs 18 and 19 show the concrete compressive strains respectively at pile top and shaft under the cle and de motions larger strains are observed for the de motions compared to the cle motions figs 18 and 19 overall the cover concrete strains are greater than the core concrete strains for pile top and shaft under both de and cle motions figs 18 and 19 the larger concrete strain and standard deviation occur on the top of piles e1 and f1 the maximum concrete strain on pile shaft occurs on pile b1 for de motions the prestressing steel tensile strains at pile top and shaft are shown in fig 20 obviously in contrast to cle motions the prestressing steel tensile strain is larger under the de motions especially for piles e1 and f1 there is small standard deviation for piles a1 c1 for both de and cle motions this indicates that piles e1 and f1 bear stronger seismic response for de and cle motions 5 discussion on strain limit the concrete and prestressing steel fiber strains are recorded and the resulting maximum values table 4 are compared to the strain limited defined in design standard for seismic design of piers and wharves asce 2014 note that the computed average maximum strains for in ground concrete and prestressing steel are associated with the whole embedded pile length for both cle and de motions the concrete and prestressing steel strains are below the strain limits table 4 defined by design standard herein the strain limit is calculated based on asce 2014 and geometrical and mechanical properties of pile section although the moment curvature on pile top presents the significant nonlinearity fig 9 which causes the larger the curvature the fiber strain is still below the strain limits for the de and cle motions frandsen and nguyen 2019 reported that the computed strain limits are much lower than the current strain limits for piles typically used for pile wharf design furthermore to investigate such response characteristic related to larger curvature and smaller fiber strain a moment curvature analysis on pile sections according to fig 4 is conducted fig 21 shows the moment curvature response and fiber strain i e concrete and prestressing steel under various axial forces for comparison all the responses are demonstrated in the same figure from fig 21 generally the curvature values on piles is about 5 8 times larger than the concrete fiber strain for the same bending moment under the compressive axial force of 1500 kn a similar comment can be made for other axial forces fig 21 this is a preliminary investigation on the difference between computed average strain and strain limit from asce 2014 a comprehensive investigation is still needed for further study 6 summary and conclusions this study presents a framework for evaluating the seismic performance of a pile supported wharf system at two seismic hazard levels i e cle and de adopted by the design standard asce 2014 for seismic design of piers and wharves for that purpose nonlinear time history analyses with 28 ground motions at cle and de hazard levels 14 motions for each hazard level were conducted through a refined 3d fe pile supported wharf model based on the port of los angeles berth 100 layout the wharf system and the corresponding numerical analysis details are provided the seismic performance of the pile supported wharf system under single representative and multiple ground motions is comprehensively evaluated the main conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 the larger time history response displacement acceleration strain stress moment curvature and fiber strain of the wharf ground system are observed under the de motions compared to the cle motions this indicated that such a system is more vulnerable when subjected to the de motions 2 piles e1 and f1 exhibit apparently larger response than piles a1 d1 for both cle and de motions this observation demonstrates that soil pile interaction and free pile length have a significant impact on pile response as such the seismic performance of a pile foundation with a short free length should be enhanced in the actual design 3 average of maximum response for the wharf ground system is larger for the de motion than the cle motion including soil pile and deck displacement as well as shear force bending moment shear force and fiber strain on pile again this reveals that such a system is more susceptible to damage when subjected to the de motions 4 results of computed fiber strain show the strain demands are substantially below the strain limits required by the current design standard asce 2014 credit authorship contribution statement

are extensively used in the construction of port facilities due to its many merits but such a system is very vulnerable to severe damage during major earthquake events the seismic performance of a pile supported wharf system under earthquake events is of great concern especially at different performance earthquake hazard levels asce 2014 chiaramonte et al 2013 erdogan et al 2017 vytiniotis et al 2019 nagao and lu 2020 many modern earthquake design guidelines recognize the importance of nonlinear response history analysis with multiple ground motions at different hazard performance levels

infrastructure systems e g buildings and bridges have been extensively investigated under different seismic hazard levels for example mohsenian et al 2019 proposed a novel multilevel approach to consider the seismic hazard levels and predict the seismic demand of non structural components for building samadian et al 2019 evaluated the seismic resilience of school at four hazard levels

time history analysis nltha antonellis and panagiotou 2014 investigated the seismic response of reinforced concrete bridges at two seismic hazard levels with return periods of 975 and 2475 years using three dimensional nltha however limited research has been conducted on finite element fe analysis of seismic performance evaluation of pile supported wharves at different hazard levels to the best of the authors knowledge only the following four studies are available in the literature chiaramonte et al 2013 conducted two dimensional 2d nltha of a pile supported wharf facility using 13 ground motions scaled to three hazard levels corresponding to 2 5 and 10 probabilities of exceedance in 50 years they found that the demands from inertial forces alone were insufficient to cause damage in the wharf facility and the demands from soil deformations were not substantial jaradat et al 2013 performed crane wharf interaction analysis for ole cle and de levels of ground motions and found that the pile displacement demand for the de level is about 27 higher than that of the cle level dickenson et al 2014 evaluated the seismic performance of a pile supported wharf for ole and cle level ground motions using a 2d flac model hur et al 2019 evaluated the seismic performance of a wharf system and seismic damage to a seaport for two earthquake scenarios that represent moderate and strong events along with the previous efforts su et al 2017 a computational framework for evaluating the seismic performance of a pile supported wharf system at different seismic hazard levels is presented in this study specifically the nltha of a pile supported wharf system are conducted at cle and de hazard levels each containing 14 ground motions a refined three dimensional 3d fe was built for nltha based on the port of los angeles berth 100 layout emi 2001 seismic response associated with the wharf ground system for both hazard level events are discussed based on results of the time history response characteristics of the average maximum responses are evaluated in terms of mean and standard deviation this study enables us to have a better understanding of the seismic performance of pile supported wharves at different seismic hazard levels based on the above the main contributions of this study are threefold first a refined 3d fe model of wharf ground system is created considering soil pile interaction and nonlinearity of prestressed reinforced concrete pile second seismic time history response of wharf ground system is investigated thoroughly under the representative cle and de motions and average seismic response of such system is explored systematically subjected to compatible acceleration spectra cle and de motion sets third the computed fiber strains of concrete and prestressing steel are analyzed and compared with strain limits from design standard for seismic design of piers and wharves asce 2014 2 finite element modeling the pile supported structural and ground configuration fig 1 under investigation is a typical port facility in the southwest u s region the wharf structure consists of a reinforced concrete deck supported on six rows of vertical pre cast concrete piles the piles have octagonal shaped cross sections all piles have a length of 42 m except for pile e2 with 18 m in length fig 2 that was included for adding lateral seismic resistance emi 2001 the long piles are embedded 4 5 m deep into the very dense base sand stratum the 3d fe simulation of this wharf ground system was conducted using the objected oriented open source software framework opensees the open system for earthquake engineering it allows users to perform both serial and parallel nonlinear fe analysis for simulating the seismic response of structural and geotechnical systems subjected to earthquake and other hazards http opensees berkeley edu mckenna et al 2000 the fe wharf ground system equations were solved by the newmark integration method newmark 1959 with parameters γ 0 6 and β 0 3025 in the longitudinal direction fig 1a the wharf is composed of a large number of identical 3d slices each of which is 6 1 m thick therefore a representative 3d slice is selected for the seismic response analysis of the wharf ground system fig 2 shows the idealization of the representative 3d slice the seismic excitation response was investigated only in the transverse landside waterside direction and the free field boundary conditions at both longitudinal ends fig 1a are implicitly assumed to have a relatively minor influence this 3d fe model is essentially similar to a 2d plane strain analysis approach but the former enables more accurate simulation of the actual 3d geometric pile layout and the associated pile ground pile interaction as such a refined fe model of the wharf ground system is created and computed through the parallel opensees i e openseessp in this model there are 30 248 brickup elements 2895 linear elastic beam column elements 502 nonlinear fiber section beam column elements and 5765 zero length elements the fe modeling details are presented below 2 1 modeling of soil layers the fe ground model is 230 m long and 6 1 m wide figs 2 and 3 the soil layers are 33 5 m deep at the waterside the right end side and 53 8 m deep at the landside the left end side the soil domain is idealized into 4 units fig 3 including 9 sub layers as well as the dike structure table 1 the topmost soil unit i is represented by vertical nodal forces that also account for container stacking and handling loads soil unit ii is divided into 3 sub layers upper loose to medium dense silty sand iia middle dense to very dense sand and silty sand iib and lower medium dense silty sand clayey sand interbedded with layers of silt and clay iic soil unit iii is split into 3 cohesive sub layers with stiffness and strength increase as a function of depth soil unit iv is composed of 2 sub layers upper dense sand clayey sand iva and lower very dense silty sand ivb the water table is at the top of sub layer iia fig 3 additional detailed information about the soil layers is presented in an emi report 2001 the soil domain is modeled by 8 node effective stress solid fluid fully coupled brick elements the maximum height of the brick element at the bottom of the fe model is 2 333 m the modeling of soil layers employs the pressuredependmultiyield pdmy and pressureindependmultiyield pimy soil models parra 1996 yang 2000 yang et al 2003 elgamal et al 2003 2009 khosravifar et al 2018 in opensees based on multi yield surface plasticity theory prevost 1978 1985 the pdmy soil model is used to characterize the nonlinear behavior of sand during cyclic loading to be specific the yield function of the pdmy model follows the classical plasticity convention it is assumed that the elasticity of material is linear and isotropic and the plasticity of material is nonlinear and anisotropic the yield function forms a conical surface in the stress space with its apex on the hydrostatic axis several similar yield surfaces with a common apex and different size form the hardening zone and the outermost surface is the envelope of peak shear strength the flow rule of the pdmy model defines the direction of plastic strain increments using the normality rule the soil contractive dilative behavior is handled by a non associative flow rule correspondingly the pimy soil model is used to capture the shear behavior of clay under cyclic loading which is independent of confinement 2 2 modeling of the pile supported wharf the prestressed reinforced concrete piles are modeled using 3d fiber section nonlinear force based beam column elements whose maximum length is 2 035 m the pile cross section is shown in fig 4 a and its discretization into concrete and prestressing steel fibers is shown in fig 4 b in this fiber section the core and cover concrete are modeled with the concrete01 material in opensees with degraded linear unloading reloading stiffness and the prestressing steel is modeled using the steel02 material in opensees with an imposed initial strain to model the prestressing the parameters of the concrete and prestressing steel constitutive models are given in table 2 the moment curvature response of the prestressed pile cross section against different axial forces is shown in fig 4 c which reveals that the moment capacity is enhanced with the increase of the compressive axial force rigid beam column links fig 2 which are normal to the pile longitudinal axis are used to represent the geometric space of piles elgamal et al 2008 two types of zero length elements i e zerolength and zerolengthsection elements in opensees are used to model the soil pile interface the zerolength elements aim to axially connect the rigid link elements to the corresponding soil nodes along the soil pile interface the zerolengthsection elements provide the skin friction yield shear force to simulate the interface slip such yield shear force depends on the length and depth of pile elements as well as soil properties i e friction angle and cohesion note that the end nodes of rigid link elements near soil elements have the same coordinates i e soil nodes as the nodes of zero length elements the inertia of the pile is simulated by defining a density parameter associated with the pile more details regarding the soil pile interface modeling is referred to su et al 2017 the applied deck weight is 5340 kn which is estimated based on the deck self weight the acting live load and the crane load the deck is assumed to linear elastic and thus modeled through elastic beam column elements the rigid link is employed for modeling pile deck connection for simplification the locations of landside and waterside lateral boundaries are away from the pile supported wharf structure figs 2 and 3 out of plane motion is not allowed along the transverse symmetry planes fig 1 in other words the out of plane effects are ignored the loading conditions are implemented in a staged manner more details about modeling of the wharf ground system are referred to su et al 2017 and 2019 2 3 ground motions the ground motions were selected based on the report of emi 2006 and 2012 which conducted a port wide ground motion study of port of los angeles california in these reports 7 earthquake records table 3 are selected based on two criteria moment magnitude from 6 5 to 7 5 and stations with distances of 0 10 km the fault normal fn and fault parallel fp components of the selected records are modified to match the uniform hazard spectrum uhs using the rspmatch program abrahamson 1998 the resulting acceleration time histories were then scaled to cle and de levels a total of 28 ground motion time histories are created including 7 fn type motions and 7 fp type motions for the cle level and 7 fn type motions and 7 fp type motions for the de level fig 5 shows the generated ground motions the peak ground acceleration pga of a cle motion is around 0 22 g and the pga of a de motion is about 0 30 g for demonstration convenience the first motion of the cle fn motion set is marked by cle fn 1 and similar for other motions the acceleration response spectra of these 28 ground motions with 5 damping are shown in fig 6 emi 2006 and 2010 which reveals that ground motions for each hazard level i e cle and de almost present identical acceleration response spectra 3 seismic response for representative ground motions according to the report of emi 2006 and 2012 the cle fn 6 and de fn 6 motions i e 1940 imperial valley earthquake el centro station record shown in table 3 produce the largest lateral displacement as such the time history response of the wharf ground system subjected to the representative cle fn 6 and de fn 6 motions fig 5 are investigated here the analysis results are detailed below 3 1 soil and deck response fig 7 shows the shear stress strain and displacement response of soil deposit at location p see fig 3 as well as the deck displacement and acceleration response subjected to cle fn 6 and de fn 6 motions peak and permanent soil displacements at 33 1 m elevation for the de motion fig 7b are greater than those for the cle motion fig 7a the permanent soil displacement is around 0 025 m and 0 13 m for the cle and de motions respectively compared to the cle motion fig 7a the de motion fig 7b produces permanent shear deformation in the low strength clay layer at 33 1 m elevation layer iiia in fig 3 the large shear strain excursion corresponds to the observed jump in permanent displacement as shown in fig 7 b the deck permanent displacement is about 0 2 m and 0 4 m for the cle and de motions respectively fig 7 this is mainly because the amplitude of a de motion is larger than that of a cle motion as such the greater soil deformation and inertial force are produced by de motion which will result in larger deck displacement compared to the soil displacement the wharf deck permanent displacement is relatively large the displacement and acceleration of the wharf deck for a de motion is greater than that for a cle motion in view of above it may be concluded that the wharf ground system is more vulnerable to damage when subjected to a de motion 3 2 pile moment curvature response fig 8 shows the pile curvature response profiles at the end of shaking for the cle fn 6 and de fn 6 motions overall for cle and de motions the pile curvature response profile at the end of shaking present a similar pattern and larger pile curvatures mainly occur in the weak layer iiia ground surface the interface between layers ivb and iiib2 and the top of piles e and f fig 3 these locations of large curvatures on piles are consistent with post earthquake damage investigation of a pile supported wharf green et al 2011 werner et al 2011 the de motion causes larger pile curvature than the cle motion maximum pile curvatures are labeled with blue circles the maximum curvature on piles e1 and f1 occurs at the pile top for de motions which is related to free length of pile the locations of maximum curvatures for pile are similar for cle and de motions for comparison with design standard requirements asce 2014 shown in table 4 the computed response of the pile top and pile in ground i e pile shaft will be evaluated in the following analysis the pile shaft refers to the entire pile length excluding the pile top in this study fig 9 shows the bending moment curvature response bending moment and curvature response time histories at the pile top the pile top moment curvature response exhibits weak nonlinearity under the cle motion except for piles e1 and f1 for the de motion the evident nonlinear behavior that yield bending moment is reached is observed for piles e1 and f1 such a response pattern is well in accordance with the moment curvature response of the pile cross section fig 4c piles a1 d1 essentially remains a low level of nonlinearity for de motions fig 9b the bending moment curvature response bending moment and curvature response time histories for the pile shaft are shown in fig 10 in which the maximum curvature occurred at the end of shaking for the cle motions nonlinear behavior at the pile shaft fig 10a is similar to the pile top fig 9a for the de motions the yield bending moment is reached fig 10b for piles d1 f1 and significant nonlinearity is observed for piles a1 c1 from figs 9 and 10 overall the nonlinear behavior of the pile moment curvature response is more noticeable for the cle motions than the de motions time histories of pile bending moment and curvature present a similar response pattern for both cle and de motions the pile top is more susceptible to severe damage because of the induced excessive deformation 3 3 fiber strain response to further study the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the prestressed concrete piles the prestressing steel and concrete i e core and cover strain response of the outmost fibers see fig 4b are explored figs 11 and 12 show the core and cover concrete and prestressing steel fiber strain time histories at the pile top corresponding to the maximum curvature at the end of shaking see fig 8 note that strain is positive if pile is in compression and is negative if pile is in tension from fig 11 the concrete is in compression and prestressing steel is in tension at the left edge of cross section at the pile top before shaking during shaking the concrete strain decreases with the increase of prestressing steel strain and vice versa this shows transformation between concrete and prestressing steel strains on the pile cross section obviously the cover concrete fiber strain is greater than the core fiber strain which indicates that the damage of pile foundation will occur initially at the cover concrete fiber strain response for a de motion is larger than that for a cle motion the fluctuation of strain response on the top of piles e1 and f1 is more evident than that on the top of piles a1 d1 this can be illustrated by the fact that the significant nonlinearity is presented for the moment curvature response on the top of piles e1 and f1 the similar observations can be made for pile top right edge fig 12 in general the only difference is that the pile left edge is in compression while the pile right edge is in tension and thus the fiber strain for pile left and right edges display the inverse trend figs 11 and 12 in summary the fiber strain response is consistent with the moment curvature response for pile cross section since the fiber strain is an indicator of curvature on pile the larger fiber strain on pile is presented for the de motion compared to the cle motion this also shows that the piles are more vulnerable under the de motion 4 average seismic response for multiple ground motions according to design standard asce 2014 the response used in analysis and design shall be taken as the average response when seven or more input earthquake motions are used thus the average response of the wharf ground system subjected to multiple ground motions are also studied nonlinear time history analysis of the wharf ground system is performed repeatedly for each of cle and de motion sets the analysis results are collected and then the statistical characteristics of the response are evaluated 4 1 lateral deformation the averages of maximum lateral displacement response under the cle and de motions are displayed in fig 13 overall the average maximum displacement response for the de motions are larger than those for the cle motions for the dike the average maximum displacement occurs in the middle of slope and the smallest displacement occurs in the dike toe fig 3 under the de motions the average of maximum deck displacement about 0 22 m is larger than that of maximum dike crest displacement about 0 19 m in general the average of maximum displacement on pile is greater than that of slope displacement which shows that the pile has slightly larger displacement than the slope in particular the standard deviation of the displacement under the de motions is larger than that under the cle motions this indicates that the displacement response shows larger variation for the de motions 4 2 shear force and bending moment figs 14 and 15 show the average of maximum shear force and bending moment of the pile top and shaft for the cle and de motions apparently the average of maximum shear force at the pile shaft is larger than that at pile top for both cle and de hazard levels fig 14 this may be related to the larger lateral deformation in weak layer iiia with lower shear modulus the average of maximum shear force for the de motions is higher than that for the cle motions especially for pile shaft piles e1 and f1 present greater axial force compared to other piles for both cle and de hazard levels such response is consistent with the moment curvature response fig 9 under the de and cle motions the average of maximum axial force presents a decreasing trend with growth of free pile length regardless of pile top and shaft this suggests that free pile length has a significant influence on the average of maximum shear force on pile since the shorter free pile length has the larger lateral stiffness the shorter free pile length will produce larger shear force under the same displacement of pile top this indicates that damage of the pile top for a short free pile length is more likely to occur during an earthquake in addition the standard deviation of shear force on the pile top is smaller than that on pile shaft in general the similar response pattern occurs for the average of maximum bending moment fig 15 4 3 axial force fig 16 shows the average of maximum compressive axial forces of pile top and pile shaft under the cle and de motions it can be seen that the average of maximum compressive axial forces at pile top which are mainly caused by the deck self weight do not change much for both hazard levels compared to the pile top the pile shaft experiences larger compressive axial force the pile shaft compressive axial force seems to be proportional to the pile embedded length which demonstrates that the axial force on the pile is influenced by soil pile interaction similarly the average of maximum compressive axial forces of pile top and shaft at the de level are greater than that of the cle level especially for pile shaft fig 17 demonstrates the average of minimum compressive axial force for pile top and the average of maximum tensile axial force for cle and de motions from fig 17 a the average of axial force on the pile top is negative i e compression for all piles under the de and cle motions this is because the axial force is mainly caused by the deck self weight the average of tensile axial forces are observed at the pile shafts of all piles and pile b1 has a maximum value of 700 kn fig 17b which may be related to pile configuration of the wharf structure the average of tensile axial force on the pile shaft are slightly larger for the de motions compared to the cle motions fig 17b and the average of compressive axial force on the pile top are lower for the de motions compared to the cle motions fig 17a 4 4 fiber strain figs 18 and 19 show the concrete compressive strains respectively at pile top and shaft under the cle and de motions larger strains are observed for the de motions compared to the cle motions figs 18 and 19 overall the cover concrete strains are greater than the core concrete strains for pile top and shaft under both de and cle motions figs 18 and 19 the larger concrete strain and standard deviation occur on the top of piles e1 and f1 the maximum concrete strain on pile shaft occurs on pile b1 for de motions the prestressing steel tensile strains at pile top and shaft are shown in fig 20 obviously in contrast to cle motions the prestressing steel tensile strain is larger under the de motions especially for piles e1 and f1 there is small standard deviation for piles a1 c1 for both de and cle motions this indicates that piles e1 and f1 bear stronger seismic response for de and cle motions 5 discussion on strain limit the concrete and prestressing steel fiber strains are recorded and the resulting maximum values table 4 are compared to the strain limited defined in design standard for seismic design of piers and wharves asce 2014 note that the computed average maximum strains for in ground concrete and prestressing steel are associated with the whole embedded pile length for both cle and de motions the concrete and prestressing steel strains are below the strain limits table 4 defined by design standard herein the strain limit is calculated based on asce 2014 and geometrical and mechanical properties of pile section although the moment curvature on pile top presents the significant nonlinearity fig 9 which causes the larger the curvature the fiber strain is still below the strain limits for the de and cle motions frandsen and nguyen 2019 reported that the computed strain limits are much lower than the current strain limits for piles typically used for pile wharf design furthermore to investigate such response characteristic related to larger curvature and smaller fiber strain a moment curvature analysis on pile sections according to fig 4 is conducted fig 21 shows the moment curvature response and fiber strain i e concrete and prestressing steel under various axial forces for comparison all the responses are demonstrated in the same figure from fig 21 generally the curvature values on piles is about 5 8 times larger than the concrete fiber strain for the same bending moment under the compressive axial force of 1500 kn a similar comment can be made for other axial forces fig 21 this is a preliminary investigation on the difference between computed average strain and strain limit from asce 2014 a comprehensive investigation is still needed for further study 6 summary and conclusions this study presents a framework for evaluating the seismic performance of a pile supported wharf system at two seismic hazard levels i e cle and de adopted by the design standard asce 2014 for seismic design of piers and wharves for that purpose nonlinear time history analyses with 28 ground motions at cle and de hazard levels 14 motions for each hazard level were conducted through a refined 3d fe pile supported wharf model based on the port of los angeles berth 100 layout the wharf system and the corresponding numerical analysis details are provided the seismic performance of the pile supported wharf system under single representative and multiple ground motions is comprehensively evaluated the main conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 the larger time history response displacement acceleration strain stress moment curvature and fiber strain of the wharf ground system are observed under the de motions compared to the cle motions this indicated that such a system is more vulnerable when subjected to the de motions 2 piles e1 and f1 exhibit apparently larger response than piles a1 d1 for both cle and de motions this observation demonstrates that soil pile interaction and free pile length have a significant impact on pile response as such the seismic performance of a pile foundation with a short free length should be enhanced in the actual design 3 average of maximum response for the wharf ground system is larger for the de motion than the cle motion including soil pile and deck displacement as well as shear force bending moment shear force and fiber strain on pile again this reveals that such a system is more susceptible to damage when subjected to the de motions 4 results of computed fiber strain show the strain demands are substantially below the strain limits required by the current design standard asce 2014 credit authorship contribution statement

21263,this paper presents the results of an experimental study in which for the first time the progressive inelastic deformation of high strength steel pressurized pipes with plain and gouged dents was analyzed the effect of some key loading and geometrical parameters such as initial pre strain ε mon dent depth ratio δ d and the presence of the gouge was studied local dents with a hemispherical shape and gouges with different dimensions were introduced on the surface of the specimens specimens with plain or gouged dents were first internally pressurized axially compressed to an initial pre strain then subjected to cyclic nonlinear stressing the mechanical defects were found to drastically degrade the inelastic cyclic response of the pressurized steel pipes the presence of a dent even with small amounts of initial pre strains made the pressurized pipes vulnerable to ratcheting failure furthermore the ratcheting responses of the gouged dented specimens significantly differed from those for the corresponding specimens with plain dents in fact the combination of a dent and gouge was the severest form of the defect and demonstrated the lowest number of cycles before failure the degradation effects of gouge were strongly dependent upon the gouge geometry dent depth and initial pre strain level keywords strain ratcheting failure asymmetric inelastic cycling pressurized steel pipes api 5l x80 gouged dent plain dent 1 introduction cyclic plastic stressing with nonzero mean stress causes a progressive accumulation of strain in the direction of mean stress with increase in the number of cycles ohno 1997 this kind of strain accumulation is called ratcheting or cyclic creep by some researchers the ratcheting deformation may accumulate incrementally until the plastic failure of the structure occurs due to the material damage caused by the ratcheting phenomenon the fatigue life of a structural component can be reduced xia et al 1996 the ratcheting has been considered in several design codes such as boiler et al 2007 en13445 2002 rcc mr 2007 r5 1990 and the most design codes proposed provisions as a ratcheting limit based on the bree diagram bree 1967 according to the codes when structure stays below the defined ratcheting limit the ratcheting can be considered tolerable however the proposed ratcheting limits can be too conservative in some cases or non conservative in other cases thus cannot accurately portray the ratcheting failure potentials due to the complex nature of the problem chen et al 2013 ratcheting phenomenon can be divided into material and structural ratcheting with respect to its origin material ratcheting occurs if the stress is distributed homogenously i e the multiaxial state of stress and the level of stress are the same at each location of the structure structures such as tension bars are usually used by other researchers as test specimens to examine material ratcheting purely hübel 1996 material ratcheting behavior can be affected by several parameters such as the stress amplitude mean stress maximum stress loading regime loading frequency and material characteristics chen et al 2006 chiou et al 2011 kang et al 2005 paul et al 2010 yaguchi and takahashi 2005 yang et al 2003 yoshida et al 1989 it was concluded that as the stress amplitude and maximum stress increases the ratcheting strain rate increases this is while the material ratcheting strain amplitude decreases with an increase in the stress rate furthermore structural ratcheting requires an in homogeneous distribution of stress and can occur even if there is no material ratcheting also the ratcheting behavior of structural components such as pressurized piping elements e g straight pipes elbows tees and etc has extensively been investigated previously the submarine pipelines tend to expand and contract due to frequent start ups shut downs and changes in operation conditions during their life time in these processes the frictional resistance of the seabed soil develops and consequently cyclic axial compressive tension forces are built up in the pipelines paquette and kyriakides 2006 chen et al 2013 presented an overview of recent progresses in experimental investigation and finite element analysis of ratcheting behavior of pressurized piping here only a few of the notable studies and results conducted in this field have been mentioned one of the earliest studies on the ratcheting behavior of pressurized tubes under cyclic axial loads was carried out by yoshida et al 1984 they indicated that the ratchet strain in the pipes was governed by maximum stress and stress ratio kulkarni et al investigated ratcheting behavior of straight pipe under cyclic bending the results revealed that the ratcheting strain occurred mainly in the circumferential direction kulkarni et al 2003 2004 it was also seen that moment controlled cyclic bending led to the ovalization of the pipe cross section with the ratcheting response of the straight pipes bae et al 2016 chang and pan 2009 jiao and kyriakides 2011a 2011b presented experimental tests and numerical simulations in which pressurized tubes were axially cycled under stress control scheme they showed that axial cycling led to the growth of wrinkles amplitude which eventually causes localized collapse the ratcheting behavior of elbows under constant internal pressure and reversed bending was also investigated experimentally chen and chen 2016 liu et al 2019 the results demonstrated that the hoop ratcheting strain occurred at both of the flanks and also intrados extrados and midway between extrados and flanks however the ratcheting strain at flanks was much greater as compared to those at other positions on the other hand the submarine pipeline may suffer a form of defect due to the deterioration e g corrosion and external interference e g dents and gouges which can lead to reduction of structural capacity błachut and iflefel 2007 cai et al 2018 chen and chen 2016 cho et al 2017 choi and bomba 2003 cosham and hopkins 2004 drumond et al 2018 ghazijahani et al 2014 2015 limam et al 2012 macdonald et al 2005 zeinoddini and parke 2011 arabzadeh zeinoddini 2013 zeinoddini et al 2015 dents may arise during manufacturing shipping installation or in service operation of an offshore pipeline in service dents are of most concern as these are usually caused by heavy accidental loads such as trawl gears anchors rock moving or other drop objects a dent without other mechanical damages is called a plain dent gouges are characterized by local thickness loss and may occur on the pipe surface during welding arc gouge by dragging a foreign sharp hard object over a pipe such as rock by scraping the pipe with the tooth or similar parts of excavation equipment or by corrosion a dent can be accompanied by one or more gouges this is often referred to as a gouged dent naghipour et al 2018 mo tamedi et al 2018 talebi et al 2018 hence the owners and operators must be able to detect and assess the severity of pipeline defects so as to ensure pipeline integrity cosham and hopkins 2001 while a plain dent having no gouge defect commonly does not pose a threat to pipeline integrity in a static environment it can reduce the life of a pipeline in cyclic pressure conditions alexander et al 1999 a gouge defect also reduces the burst strength and fatigue strength of the pipe cosham and hopkins 2001 cosham and hopkins 2004 moreover the research efforts which conducted for the european pipeline research group eprg american gas association aga and international corrosion supervisory committee prc indicated that the fatigue life of plain dented pipes is significantly greater than those for gouged dented tubes alexander et al 1999 despite the studies mentioned the effect of defect e g dent gouge and corrosion on the cyclic responses of pressurized tubes has received less attention by researchers for example the effects of plain dent on the uniaxial strain ratcheting behavior of un pressurized tubular steel member were experimentally investigated by zeinoddini et al 2014 they showed that dent defects have considerably more drastic effects on the ratcheting response of dented tubes as compared to their monotonic response azadeh and taheri also investigated the ratcheting response of locally dented steel pipes under cyclic loading through experimental tests and nonlinear fe simulations azadeh and taheri 2014 2015 it should be mentioned that only plain dent in the absence of internal pressure was considered in their work they indicated that the dent exerted a very pronounced effect on the ratcheting response of the pipes the results of an experimental study on the response and failure of the defective circular steel tubes under monotonic and cyclic loading were presented by zeinoddini et al zeinoddini et al 2016 zeinoddini et al 2017 it was noticed that under inelastic cyclic bending the ratcheting strain rate increases and the number of cycles to failure markedly decreases in the defective specimens as compared to those in the perfect ones the ratcheting deformation of straight pipe with local wall thinning subjected to constant internal pressure and reversed bending was studied using finite element analysis the results demonstrated that ratcheting strain was increased with the increasing of depth length and circumferential angle of local wall thinning chen and chen 2016 the influence of corrosion defects on the ratcheting response of steel pipes was also investigated it has been found that the strain rate in the damaged part of the tubes is significantly greater than that in the perfect part zeinoddini et al 2015 aforementioned literature review reveals that the effect of mechanical defects on the uniaxial ratcheting and failure problem of pressurized steel pipes has not previously been studied in the current study the inelastic cyclic response of steel pipelines containing dent and gouge under constant internal pressure and axial loading was experimentally examined the study provides some preliminary data concerning the ratcheting behavior of defected pressurized steel pipes moreover the obtained results will be helpful to assess the integrity of plain and gouged dented pipelines 2 experimental setup and procedures 2 1 specimen characteristics and type the as received seamless api 5l x80 steel pipes with nominal outer diameter d of 50 mm and wall thickness t of 5 mm were used in the current experiments according to standard test methods for tension testing of metallic material astm 2016 a number of dog bone shaped specimens were prepared by wire cut machine from axial direction of the steel pipes main mechanical properties of steel were then established through uniaxial tensile testing the tensile test was repeated three times and the average measured of yield stress f y of 640 mpa ultimate stress f u of 740 mpa and elasticity modulus e of 225 gpa the tubular test specimens were prepared by milling machining from as received api 5l x80 steel pipes the overall dimensions of the specimens were chosen close to those utilized in previous works by other researchers jiao and kyriakides 2011a zeinoddini et al 2015a zeinoddini et al 2015b and azadeh and taheri 2014 preceding researches showed that axial plastic buckling is influenced by geometric imperfections as well as by stress concentrations such as those generated by clamped or other end constraints kyriakides and corona 2007 for example lee presented the results of an experimental program on inelastic buckling behavior of soft aluminum shells subjected to axial compression he demonstrated that the stress distribution at the clamped end edges of the specimens was not uniform and the localized stress concentrations introduced by grips at both ends resulted in the early development of edge bulges lee 1962 based on the saint venant principle in a very short distance from the ends the stress is evenly distributed uniformly lower 2014 eventually using advanced finite element simulations the test specimens were designed and constructed in the way that the effects of boundary conditions and the thickness discontinuities to be minimized the geometry specifications of the final test specimens are shown in fig 1 as it can be seen two thicker parts at far ends of the specimens length 50 mm uniform thickness 5 mm are connected to the gauge section located in the middle of the specimen length 70 mm uniform thickness 2 mm by two linear taper segments length 60 mm un uniform wall thickness varies between 5 mm and 2 mm the ratio of diameter to thickness d t in the gauge section of the specimens was also chosen based on avoiding local elastic shell buckling under axial compressive loading in which collapse is sudden and catastrophic to evaluate the amount of geometric imperfections caused by machining procedure the outer surface of the middle section of the specimens was analyzed through a 3d scanner device fig 2 shows a 3d view of the errors resulted from machining procedures in this figure the discrepancies were mostly ranged within 0 02 mm which are shown in green the data provided by 3d scanning of specimens after finishing the machining work and before conducting the mechanical testing were analyzed to quantify the extent of possible imperfections in the specimens table 1 summarizes the nominal and measured values of the outer diameter d wall thickness t out of roundness d max d min d max and out of straightness δ o l out of 36 circumferential and 16 longitudinal sections over the gauge length of one specimen 2 2 pressurization system an independent pressurization system with a capacity of 300 bar was used to apply internal pressure at first the discharge pressure of the oil hydraulic pump thus the internal pressure in the specimen was increased to the desired level and kept then constant an accumulator was also used to mitigate any pressure fluctuations inside the system during the experiments the accumulator was connected to the hydraulic oil pump and specimen to compensate any changes in the pressure see fig 3 when the system was faced with an increase or lack of internal pressure the pressure control device regulated the internal pressure by storing some of the oil into the oil chamber of accumulator or injecting some of the stored oil into the system respectively to apply internal pressure into the test specimens two steel caps with two embedded holes one as the inlet of oil and the other as a place for installing pressure gauge were also fixed at the specimen s both ends to fix any relative movement between the caps they were screwed into the thicker parts of the specimens and then welded to the pipe body see fig 1 in all tests indentation process and cyclic loading was applied at a constant internal pressure level of p in 0 31p y where p y 640 bar which the yield pressure was calculated through p y f y t r r is internal radios 20 mm pipeline failure is a risk that a designer must take into account many codes set a design factor df which prevents the pipeline from operating above certain stress levels pds of 0 5 and 0 72 were suggested regarding the hoop stress by asme code 2004 for the risers and platform piping and submarine pipelines respectively in the current experiments a value of 0 31p y was considered for the internal pressure this was somehow smaller than the aforesaid pds because the specimens were due to also experience axial stressing and denting on top of the hoop stress it also falls in between values of 0 163 0 326 and 0 489p y in the karamanos and eleftheriadis 2004 study who conducted laboratory experiments on collapse of pressurized steel tubes under lateral loads 2 3 indentation and gouge defect as aforementioned this study deals with the strain ratcheting behavior of steel tubular members containing plain and gouged dents under uniaxial cyclic stressing for the plain dented specimens the intact specimens without any surface damage gouge were dented by an indenter under internal pressure whereas for the gouged dented specimens a gouge was first machined onto the exterior surface of the specimen before applying internal pressure and the indentation process was then applied under presence of the internal pressure for the gouged specimens a single rectangular gouge along the pipe axis and at the center of anticipated dent was introduced using an electrical discharge machine spark machine as shown in fig 4 the depth length and width of a gouge are denoted by e l and w respectively in the current study to examine the effect of gouge dimensions two different geometrical characteristics were considered see table 2 in this table the gouge depth e and width w were normalized with respect to the wall thickness of the specimen in the gauge section t 2 mm whereas the gouge length l was normalized with external diameter of the gauge section d 44 mm during indentation process the gouged non gouged specimens were placed on a saddle shaped steel bed with length of 70 mm and a dent was then introduced at the midsection of the specimens by a hemi spherical indenter with a diameter of 20 mm see fig 5 both of the indenter and bed were made from ck45 steel and they were designed in the way that they can be considered as a rigid body as compared to the test specimens therefore their size and shape were not changed during the denting process the indenter was pushed down until a pre described dent depth was created and subsequently was pulled back to be detached from the test specimen completely in all experimental tests the denting speed was kept enough slow so that the indentation process was considered as a quasi static deformation extra details on the denting process and its results were previously reported in a separate paper and a summary is presented here naghipour et al 2018 exploring the difference between the quasi static and dynamic denting is not the aim of the current study because the subject was already studied by a number of researchers e g the quasi static denting by zeinoddini et al 1998 1999 2000 2013 and dynamic denting by zeinoddini et al 2002 2008 in fact the current paper focuses on a post event subject it deals with a pipe which is already damaged in a denting event dynamic or static and is now subject to strain ratcheting due to combined actions of internal pressure and axial inelastic cycling the latter subject has not already been addressed by previous researchers 2 4 cyclic loading an instron 8502 testing machine that can be operated in displacement or load control manner was used to apply the axial loading the experimental setup is shown in fig 6 the two ends of the caps were gripped by the machine clamps at the beginning of the test the specimen was pressurized up to the required level with an oil hydraulic pump and the pressure was kept constant during the test process using an accumulator the specimen was then subjected to displacement control monotonic axial compression until the axial strain reached a desired pre strain of ε mon the specimen was then subjected to axial cyclic loading under a load control mode the cyclic loading protocol was asymmetric see fig 7 with a constant stress amplitude of σ a and a compressive mean stress of σ m it is noted that ε mon was defined as the ratio of the overall axial shortening of the gauge length to its initial length δ a x i a l l it is clear that the local strain might vary from ε mon and may develop non uniformly along the specimen and circumferentially because of denting and bowing of the specimen accordingly the axial strain during the cyclic loading was defined as the ratio of the axial deformation of the gauge length to its initial length the loading frequency for the current cyclic tests was 0 01 hz this gives a maximum axial strain rate of around ε 75 10 6 s under stress cycling the cowper symonds equation cowper and symonds 1957 can be used to estimate the ratio of the yield stress under such a loading rate σ y d relative the static yield stress σ y st σ y d σ y s t 1 ε d r 1 p where d r and p are the cowper symonds constant material rate parameters the specimens were made from high tensile steels which are commonly regarded to have a low strain rate sensitivity considering d 5946 s and q 1 75 xu et al 2017 for high strength steel materials the ratio between the σ y d and σ y st would be 1 000031 indicating on a negligible strain rate effect during the cyclic tests it should be noted that all specimens used in this study were similar in terms of material and geometric dimensions to study the effect of main parameters such as initial pre strain ε mon the ratio of dent depth δ d and the presence of the gouge a total number of 19 experiments were considered in this study in summary four intact specimens with different initial pre strain values seven non gouged dented specimens with various dent depths and finally eight gouged dented specimens with different dent depths and also dissimilar gouge dimensions were subjected to cyclic axial loading under internal pressure table 3 provides a summary of the characteristics of each experiment in the current study below abbreviated forms of the definitions are used to describe each of the experiment characteristics ic intact specimen examined under cyclic axial loading dc dented specimen with no surface damage gouge examined under cyclic axial loading gdc gouged specimen which was then dented and examined under cyclic axial loading 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 intact specimens in this section the results of the strain ratcheting tests on intact tubes are presented and discussed the axial load displacement responses observed were very similar to those reported by previous researchers jiao and kyriakides 2011a 2011b under axial inelastic compression the intact steel specimens initially shortened linearly beyond the initial elastic region at a critical strain level ε c axisymmetric wrinkling initiated as the axial shortening increased the wrinkle amplitude gradually increased extra wrinkles were formed and the axial rigidity of the tubes decreased under persistent axial compression the wrinkles growth led to localization of one wrinkle accompanied by an adjacent kinking eventually resulted to instability at a limit stress σ l or a limit strain ε l zeinoddini et al 2015a kyriakides and corona 2007 in most previous studies on the ratcheting behavior of the steel tubes the initial pre strain chosen for the cyclic loading protocol ε mon was somewhat greater than the critical strain ε c where the wrinkling initiated in the tube wall however a question is raised as to whether the strain ratcheting behavior can occur with initial pre strain levels less than the critical strain in the current paper the critical strain ε c and the limit strain ε l values for intact specimens were defined by monotonic axial compression tests the specimens had an internal pressure level of 0 31p y the results indicated that the wrinkling was initiated around an average axial strain of ε c 0 6 and the limit stress σ l occurred around ε l 3 1 therefore four intact pressurized specimens with different initial pre strain level were subjected to cyclic axial loading and the obtained results are presented under inelastic axial compression both straining of the material and wrinkling of the tube wall contribute to the overall axial shortening of the specimen δ a x i a l therefore δ a x i a l cannot be directly defined using strain gauges placed on the specimen for instance the strain gauge readings vary if a wrinkle develops at the gauge location or not in this study the history of the axial load and the overall shortening over the gauge length of the specimen l were thus recorded by the load cell embedded in the testing machine and extensometers respectively the axial strain is thus defined as δ a x i a l l however strain gauges were also placed on some specimens to record the local strains in the axial and circumferential directions in these tests the initial pre strain ε mon varied from 0 35 beginning of the plastic region where no wrinkles were yet formed to 1 where the wrinkling was apparent other loading parameters such as the stress amplitude and the internal pressure were kept constant during the cyclic tests the stress strain responses obtained from ic1 ic2 ic3 and ic4 specimens fig 8 indicated that the axial strain was ratcheting by increase in the number of cycles this proves that in the presence of internal pressure the ratcheting may occur even when ε mon is smaller than ε c with all experiments the stress cycling was stopped after 240th cycle it can be noticed in fig 8 that as the initial pre strain increased the total ratchet strain accumulated over 240 cycles tested increased fig 9 presents the accumulated axial strain ratcheting against number of loading cycles for intact specimens ic1 ic2 ic3 and ic4 with all four specimens ratcheting strain rate non linearly decreased in the early cycles of loading referred as the transient region part 1 the ratcheting strain rate remained then almost constant referred as the steady rate region part 2 the results indicated that the first region elongated and the second region became steeper as the initial pre strain increased for example in specimen ic1 ε mon 0 35 the onset of the steady rate zone part 2 occurred after 14 cycles with specimen ic4 ε mon 1 the onset of the steady rate zone appeared after 53 cycles furthermore with specimen ic1 the slope of the steady rate zone remains very close to zero a zero slope indicates on a shake down type of response in which no net accumulation of plastic deformation arises in a ratcheting type of response the steady rate zone will have a positive slope which shows the net plastic strain is accumulating in each load cycle for better understanding of the ratcheting mechanism in the specimens their deformations were monitored during the monotonic and cyclic tests using 3d optical scanners fig 10 compares the reconstructed deformed shapes of the ic1 ic2 and ic3 specimens after completion of the initial monotonic pre strain and after applying 240 axial load cycles the figure shows that the ic1 specimen exhibited no sign of wrinkling after applying the initial monotonic pre strain and even after 240 inelastic load cycles in this case the cyclic plastic strain accumulation seems to have been originated only from the material ratcheting absence of structural ratcheting appears to be the main reason that the slope of the steady rate zone in the ic1 specimen fig 9 remained very close to zero the ic2 specimen also showed no sign of wrinkling after applying the initial monotonic pre strain however small amplitude wrinkles were formed over its gauge section after the cyclic loading in this case the cyclic plastic strain accumulation appears to have been initially originated from the material ratcheting later on both the material and structural ratcheting contributed to the response in other words the strain ratcheting was reflecting partly accumulation of material strain and partly the shortening caused by the incremental growth in the wrinkles amplitude jiao and kyriakides 2011a with ic3 specimen three axisymmetric wrinkles were formed along the gauge section after applying the initial monotonic pre strain fig 10 shows that the number and the location of the wrinkles remained the same during the initial monotonic stage and the cyclic loading but the wrinkles amplitudes were almost doubled it can be noticed that the amplitudes of the three wrinkles formed in the initial monotonic pre strain were different the wrinkles amplitudes after the cyclic loading followed the suit fig 10 shows that the final total number of the wrinkles in the specimens ic2 and ic3 remained the same but their amplitudes and locations varied it can therefore be said that the initial pre strain had no bearing on the final number of the wrinkles but was radically affecting the wrinkles amplitudes the location of the wrinkles appeared to be mostly dependent on the geometry of the initial fabrication imperfections in the specimens see section 2 1 the above discussion reveals that even when the cycling was commenced before the formation of the wrinkling ic2 the strain ratcheting may still occur initially the material ratcheting dominates but later on both the material and structural ratcheting contribute to the accumulation of the plastic strain under constant amplitude axial stressing of the specimens the summary result of the last four described tests on the pressurized intact specimens is presented in table 4 in this table the ratcheting strain rate ε r is defined as the total axial ratcheting strain ε r t o t divided by the total number of load cycles n the table also provides the number of load cycles to the failure n f the ratcheting failure reportedly occurs when the total axial ratcheting strain ε r t o t reaches the limit axial strain ε l under monotonic compression jiao and kyriakides 2011a zeinoddini et al 2014 the number of load cycles to the failure was thus approximated as n f ε l ε r it can be concluded that when the initial pre strain level was relatively low less than 0 45 the amplitude of the plastic wrinkles in the specimens remained considerably small thus the structural ratcheting was not triggered during the tests with higher initial pre strains greater than 1 the ratcheting strain significantly accelerated and the number of cycles to failure noticeably dropped n f 755 which could threaten the pipeline safety during its lifetime in general the initial pre strain had an important role on the overall ratcheting response of the pressurized intact tubes two strain gauges on the surface of specimen ic2 were used due to record the longitudinal and hoop strains see fig 11 fig 12 illustrates the longitudinal and hoop strain history versus the number of the load cycles the figure shows that the strain ratcheting took place in both longitudinal and hoop directions the presence of internal pressure thus resulted in biaxial ratcheting in the specimen at these measuring points the strain rate in the longitudinal direction was nearly twice that in the hoop direction it should be noted that the strain gauges were registering the temporal variation of the local strains it means that the recorded strains could vary greatly depending on whereabouts of the wrinkles kinks relative to the gauge location fig 12 shows that by introducing the monotonic compression to the specimen a compressive strain was detected by the longitudinal strain gauge when the axial cycling started the mean strain gradually decreased relative to the initial compressive axial strain this was because the strain gauge position experienced wrinkling during the cyclic loading as the wrinkle amplitude increased tensile longitudinal strains were developed in the exterior surface of the wrinkle the longitudinal tensile local strain gradually ratcheted up essentially due to the structural ratcheting but caused the mean strain to gradually reduce relative to the initial compressive strain by introducing the monotonic compression a tensile hoop strain was initially recorded increase in the amplitude of the wrinkle brought in extra tensile hoop strains in the exterior surface of the wrinkle as a result the mean strain gradually increased relative to that for the initial local compressive strain it also ratcheted up by the gradual increase in the wrinkle amplitude the ratcheting strain rate in the hoop direction was however considerably smaller than that in the longitudinal direction 3 2 dented specimens this section examines the effects of dent shaped defects on the ratcheting response of pressurized steel tubes the specimens were initially laterally dented after reaching a pre described dent depth the indenter was slowly removed specimens with the dent depth ratios δ d of 11 and 15 were produced they remained free of gouge type defects before the indentation process an internal pressure of 0 31p y was applied to the specimen and maintained thereafter the pressurized dented specimens were then monotonically compressed up to axial pre strain values of ε mon 0 35 0 45 0 66 and 1 the specimens were then tested under nonlinear axial cyclic loading with an amplitude loading of σ a 380 mpa for comparison purposes the initial pre strain ε mon stress amplitude σ a and the internal pressure with the dented specimens were chosen similar to those with the intact specimens see section 3 1 the loading conditions and the specimens id are listed in table 5 the dent depth ratios δ d r presented in this table correspond to the residual dent depths after removing the indenter fig 13 presents the axial stress strain history of the dented specimens dc1 to dc7 the figure shows that even when the initial pre strain level was relatively low ε mon 0 35 in dc1 or 0 45 in dc3 the dented pressurized specimens began to distinctly ratchet under axial stress cycling a summary of the ratcheting tests results including the mean ratcheting strain rate ε r and the number of cycles to failure n f are reported in table 5 the ratio between the ε r in a dented specimen and in the corresponding intact specimen with the same loading conditions is also reported the results show that by increase in the dent depth ε r dramatically increased and n f remarkably decreased in comparison to those with the intact specimens the dent depth effects were exacerbated with increase in the initial pre strain ε mon as an example ε r in dc1 specimen with δ d 15 and ε mon 0 35 accelerated by 500 relative to that in the corresponding intact specimen ic1 whereas ε r in dc4 specimen with δ d 15 and ε mon 0 66 accelerated by 816 relative to that in the corresponding intact specimen ic3 similar to that with the intact specimens the stress cycling was stopped after 240 cycles ratcheting failures were experienced by dc4 dc6 and dc7 specimens at 200 70 and 170 cycles respectively no sign of failure was demonstrated by other dented specimens up to 240 cycles fig 14 presents the accumulated axial strain ratcheting data against number of loading cycles for dented specimens dc1 to dc7 the results are grouped based on the axial pre strain values ε mon 0 35 0 66 and 1 in the specimens the test data for the corresponding intact specimen is also provided in each case in general dented specimens showed longer transient regions in terms of the load cycle number relative to that with the corresponding intact specimen the linear region in the dented specimens grew also steeper than that in the corresponding intact specimen when the initial compression was relatively high 1 ratcheting strain rates ε r in the dented specimens dc5 and dc6 were noticeably high thus the accumulated ratchet strain surpassed the linear zone accelerated exponentially and led eventually to failure in the few last cycles in contrast the intact specimen ic4 stayed still in the linear zone up to the 240 cycles see fig 14 fig 14 also shows that the ratcheting response of the specimens was dramatically affected by the dent depth during its life time an offshore pipeline is expected to experience several hundreds of inelastic load cycles jiao and kyriakides 2011a the results of the current study showed that a dent with δ d 11 may put a pressurized steel pipe at ratcheting failure risk even when the initial pre strain is relatively low e g 0 66 due to record the longitudinal and hoop strains of dc3 specimen see fig 15 two strain gauges were fixed at the flanks of the dent dented part and two others similarly on the opposite side of the dented region intact part the local longitudinal and hoop strains of the dented and intact parts of dc3 specimen are presented in fig 16 the results demonstrated that the strain ratcheting in the dented and intact parts were distinctly different although the intact part was experiencing axial compressive strains tensile strains were being recorded in the dented part it can be concluded that while the global applied cyclic stressing on the tube still remained uniaxial the local uniaxial stressing in the dented part was turned to a multiaxial stressing the axial strains in the intact part had higher amplitudes and higher ratcheting rate moreover the axial strains in the dented part had lower amplitude which remained almost constant with the cyclic stressing this was the opposite for hoop direction however on both sides of the specimen the axial and hoop ratcheting strains took place and were growing up by loading it is clear that the indentation process leaves behind a gross disturbance in the initial curvature of the tube wall therefore local bending stresses were also being produced at the dent place during the axial stressing higher initial strains at the dented zone were thus produced by the local stresses as compared to those in the intact parts of the specimens see fig 16 furthermore similar to the intact specimens both the material and structural ratcheting contributed to the cyclic response of dented specimens in other words some key parameters such as contribution of the structural ratcheting and the presence of local multiaxial stressing in the dented specimens were found to drastically degrade the cyclic response and these degradation effects were exacerbated with an increase in the dent depth in order to study the failure mode of the plain dented specimens the deformed shape of specimen dc4 after 190 load cycles only a few cycles to failure of the specimen is given in fig 17 unlike the intact specimen due to the higher axial strain rate in the intact part non axisymmetric wrinkles were formed opposite to the indented part at the far ends of the gauge section the wrinkles amplitude was increasing by each load cycle and growing longer toward the dented part the formation of the non axisymmetric wrinkles propagation and growth of the dent shape and wrinkles were also monitored by 3d measuring scan see fig 18 the results showed that as the load cycles increased the dent depth increased under persistent nonlinear stress cycling the initial hemispherical geometry of the dent gradually turned to an oblate hemispheroid this was essentially due to simultaneous ratcheting of the tensile hoop strain and compressive axial strain around the dented area the major axis of the hemispheroid was oriented in the circumferential direction and the minor axis in the longitudinal direction this indicated that the cyclic response of the dented pressurized specimens was dominated by structural rather than material ratcheting the current experiments can be divided in two separate phases i lateral indentation of the steel pipe and ii post denting axial cyclic testing of the pipe it is acknowledged that in the course of lateral indentation different types of permanent damages may occur in a steel pipe they include overall bowing zeinoddini et al 1998 local denting zeinoddini et al 1999 cross sectional deformation ovalization zeinoddini et al 2000 wall tearing zeinoddini et al 2002 axial shortening zeinoddini et al 2008 etc the extends of these damages also vary depending on the end and bedding boundary conditions of the pipe the aforementioned damages each may play detrimental roles on the post event load bearing and strength of the steel pipe the overall bending bowing type of damage is intentionally avoided in the first phase of the current experiments as much as possible to give emphasis to the local denting damages the aim is not to undermine the importance of other types of permanent damages on the post event behavior of the steel pipe but to limit the number of parameters involved and the number of tests required the present study covers three different dent depths δ d 0 11 and 15 two different dent types plain or gouged four different initial inelastic strains and two different gouge geometries the number of the specimens tests will drastically increase and turns the experiments unfeasible if other types of permanent deformations are also considered it is admitted that aforementioned damages and their combinations with denting have important effects on the ratcheting response of steel pipes and these have to be considered in future works nevertheless no attempt is made to restrict overall bending of the specimens in the second phase of the experiments as an example fig 19 compares the final longitudinal post denting profiles of the specimen with δ d of 15 with those obtained after axial cyclic load testing the data are acquired from 3d optical scanning of the specimen after completion of the first and second phases of the experiment the abscissa presents the normalized gauge length of the specimen the ordinate provides deflection of the specimen face towards the center line of the tube while minus values are for deflections towards the center line during the second phase of the experiment the front dented face of the tube experiences extra radial deflections towards the center line fig 19 both inward and outward bending deflections along the gauge length can be noticed underneath of the specimen outward radial deflections bowing appear over the side faces of the specimen fig 19 fig 20 shows the evolution of the hysteresis loops for specimen dc7 similar to the tertiary ratcheting paths the evolution of the cycles can be divided into three parts with respect to the hysteresis loops dimensions in part 1 up to early 50 cycles transient part the area of the hysteresis loops decreased progressively by about 50 from the 50th cycle afterward linear part the dimensions of the hysteresis loops remained almost constant up to the 149th cycle the area of the hysteresis loops again increased about 50 as compared to the corresponding area of the 140th cycle in this part exponential part the peaks of the cycles became also rounder according to the results obtained in this section it can be stated that the dimensions of the hysteresis loops changed proportional to the ratcheting response paths 3 3 gouged dented specimens in this section ratcheting behavior of pressurized steel tubes with dent and gouge type defects is examined as aforementioned longitudinal oriented local wall thinning was introduced on the surface of the specimens as a gouge the gouge was located on outside surface of the center of the gauge section the gouged specimens were then dented by a hemispherical indenter at the center of the gouge length table 6 provides summary results and the characteristics of each test to examine the effect of the local wall thinning dimensions two different geometries were considered see table 2 in this study with both gouge geometries the gouge depth and total loss area were kept constant and only the gouge length and gouge width were changed the introduced gouge length in geometry no 1 was two times longer than that for geometry no 2 while its width was half for comparison purposes the loading parameters such as initial pre strain ε mon stress amplitude σ a internal pressure level p p y and also shape and depth of dent with the gouged dented specimens were chosen similar to those with plain dented specimens see section 3 2 the ratio between the ε r in a gouged dented specimen and in the corresponding plain dented specimen with the same loading conditions is also reported in table 6 the results showed that the ratcheting performance of the gouged dented specimens was significantly degraded in comparison to those for the corresponding plain dented specimens for example plain dented specimen dc1 δ d 15 ε mon 0 35 could withstand 876 cycles before failure whereas with the presence of a gouge specimen gdc1 δ d 15 ε mon 0 35 and gouge geometry no 1 could withstand against failure up to the 410th cycle on the other hand the degradation effects of the gouge were strongly dependent upon the gouge geometry dent depth and initial pre strain level the gouge effects became more pronounced when the gouge was wider whereas its length was shorter it can be concluded that the effects of the gouge length on the ratcheting response of the pressurized tubes were less significant than its width furthermore the results showed that the adverse gouge effects were noticeably exacerbated with the increase in the dent depth for example specimen gdc6 δ d 11 ε mon 0 66 and gouge no 2 could withstand 250 cycles before failure whereas by an increase around 4 in the dent depth specimen gdc4 failed after 80 cycles this is due to the fact that during indentation process some residual stresses and strains were certainly produced in the gouge area these local stresses and strains increased as the dent depth increased it means that the local stress amplitude and initial pre strain might be increased in the gouge area with these specimens the ratcheting failure was occurred due to the localization of the ratchet strain and formation of cracks in the gouge area the deformed shape of specimen gdc3 is also presented in fig 21 similar to the plain dented specimens see fig 19 as the load cycles increased the dented region spread wider and non axisymmetric wrinkles were initiated and developed however with the gouged specimen the growth of the dent area was more localized than non gouged ones this is due to the reduction of local stiffness in the dented area which causes the ratcheting strain to be accumulated in the gouge area it can be stated that the presence of a gouge at dent depths δ d greater than 15 even for small initial pre strain ε mon 0 35 has a radical influence on the strain ratcheting response of the pressurized dented steel tubes however these effects decreased as the initial pre strain increased as presented in the previous section when the initial pre strain increased the dented area spread circumferentially over the tube wall therefore the adverse gouge effects dramatically decreased as compared to adverse dent effects in other words the ratcheting behavior of the pressurized tubes was governed by dent and gouge respectively fig 22 represents the accumulated axial strain ratcheting data against number of cycles for gouged dented specimens gdc1 to gdc 8 the results grouped based on the axial pre strain ε mon 0 35 0 66 and 1 and dent depth values δ d 11 and 15 the test data for the corresponding plain dented and intact specimen is also provided in each case the results showed that the presence of a gouge had profound effects on the accumulation of the ratchet strain and these effects were reflected in the tertiary path for example with specimen gdc7 δ d 11 ε mon 1 and gouge no 1 the exponential zone was commenced after 113 cycles whereas plain dented specimen dc7 δ d 11 and ε mon 1 stayed still in the linear zone up to the 150 cycles once again the presence of the gouge exacerbated the adverse effects on the ratcheting response of the pressurized dented specimens 4 conclusions in this study 19 steel tubular specimens with diameter to thickness ratio d t of 22 were tested under axial cyclic stressing a local plain dent with hemispherical shape and dents with a gouge of varying geometry were introduced on the specimen surface the effects of the initial pre strain local dent depth and gouge dimension on the strain ratcheting behavior of the pressurized steel pipes were evaluated the following conclusions may be made 4 1 pressurized intact tubes with the pressurized tubes the strain ratcheting occurs even when the stress cycling commences before the formation of the wrinkling the presence of internal pressure results in biaxial ratcheting of the steel pipe the ratcheting rate in the longitudinal direction is noticeably higher than that in the hoop direction 4 2 pressurized tubes with a plain dent presence of a shallow dent say δ d 11 radically reduces the number of load cycles to failure in a pressurized tube the ratcheting rate significantly increases and the total number of load cycles to failure remarkably decreases as the dent depth increases these adverse effects are exacerbated by increase in the initial pre strain the dent presence and the dent depth strongly affect the ratcheting strain cycle number response unlike intact tubes non axisymmetric wrinkles may also appear in the pressurized dented tubes the dent gradually deepens widens and its initial hemispherical geometry turns to an oblate hemispheroid as the load cycle number increases the inelastic cyclic response of dented pressurized steel tubes is dominated by structural rather than material ratcheting 4 3 pressurized tubes with a gouged dent the ratcheting rate in a gouged dented steel tube is significantly higher than that in the corresponding plain dented tube the gouge width plays a greater role on the ratcheting response of pressurized tubes than the gouge length the gouge effect on the strain ratcheting rate noticeably increases as the dent depth increases presence of a gouge in a deep dent e g δ d 15 radically accelerates the strain ratcheting rate of a pressurized steel tube however the effects magnitude reduces as the initial pre strain increased with a gouged steel tube the growth of the dent area is more localized than that in the corresponding plain dent credit author statement m

21263,this paper presents the results of an experimental study in which for the first time the progressive inelastic deformation of high strength steel pressurized pipes with plain and gouged dents was analyzed the effect of some key loading and geometrical parameters such as initial pre strain ε mon dent depth ratio δ d and the presence of the gouge was studied local dents with a hemispherical shape and gouges with different dimensions were introduced on the surface of the specimens specimens with plain or gouged dents were first internally pressurized axially compressed to an initial pre strain then subjected to cyclic nonlinear stressing the mechanical defects were found to drastically degrade the inelastic cyclic response of the pressurized steel pipes the presence of a dent even with small amounts of initial pre strains made the pressurized pipes vulnerable to ratcheting failure furthermore the ratcheting responses of the gouged dented specimens significantly differed from those for the corresponding specimens with plain dents in fact the combination of a dent and gouge was the severest form of the defect and demonstrated the lowest number of cycles before failure the degradation effects of gouge were strongly dependent upon the gouge geometry dent depth and initial pre strain level keywords strain ratcheting failure asymmetric inelastic cycling pressurized steel pipes api 5l x80 gouged dent plain dent 1 introduction cyclic plastic stressing with nonzero mean stress causes a progressive accumulation of strain in the direction of mean stress with increase in the number of cycles ohno 1997 this kind of strain accumulation is called ratcheting or cyclic creep by some researchers the ratcheting deformation may accumulate incrementally until the plastic failure of the structure occurs due to the material damage caused by the ratcheting phenomenon the fatigue life of a structural component can be reduced xia et al 1996 the ratcheting has been considered in several design codes such as boiler et al 2007 en13445 2002 rcc mr 2007 r5 1990 and the most design codes proposed provisions as a ratcheting limit based on the bree diagram bree 1967 according to the codes when structure stays below the defined ratcheting limit the ratcheting can be considered tolerable however the proposed ratcheting limits can be too conservative in some cases or non conservative in other cases thus cannot accurately portray the ratcheting failure potentials due to the complex nature of the problem chen et al 2013 ratcheting phenomenon can be divided into material and structural ratcheting with respect to its origin material ratcheting occurs if the stress is distributed homogenously i e the multiaxial state of stress and the level of stress are the same at each location of the structure structures such as tension bars are usually used by other researchers as test specimens to examine material ratcheting purely hübel 1996 material ratcheting behavior can be affected by several parameters such as the stress amplitude mean stress maximum stress loading regime loading frequency and material characteristics chen et al 2006 chiou et al 2011 kang et al 2005 paul et al 2010 yaguchi and takahashi 2005 yang et al 2003 yoshida et al 1989 it was concluded that as the stress amplitude and maximum stress increases the ratcheting strain rate increases this is while the material ratcheting strain amplitude decreases with an increase in the stress rate furthermore structural ratcheting requires an in homogeneous distribution of stress and can occur even if there is no material ratcheting also the ratcheting behavior of structural components such as pressurized piping elements e g straight pipes elbows tees and etc has extensively been investigated previously the submarine pipelines tend to expand and contract due to frequent start ups shut downs and changes in operation conditions during their life time in these processes the frictional resistance of the seabed soil develops and consequently cyclic axial compressive tension forces are built up in the pipelines paquette and kyriakides 2006 chen et al 2013 presented an overview of recent progresses in experimental investigation and finite element analysis of ratcheting behavior of pressurized piping here only a few of the notable studies and results conducted in this field have been mentioned one of the earliest studies on the ratcheting behavior of pressurized tubes under cyclic axial loads was carried out by yoshida et al 1984 they indicated that the ratchet strain in the pipes was governed by maximum stress and stress ratio kulkarni et al investigated ratcheting behavior of straight pipe under cyclic bending the results revealed that the ratcheting strain occurred mainly in the circumferential direction kulkarni et al 2003 2004 it was also seen that moment controlled cyclic bending led to the ovalization of the pipe cross section with the ratcheting response of the straight pipes bae et al 2016 chang and pan 2009 jiao and kyriakides 2011a 2011b presented experimental tests and numerical simulations in which pressurized tubes were axially cycled under stress control scheme they showed that axial cycling led to the growth of wrinkles amplitude which eventually causes localized collapse the ratcheting behavior of elbows under constant internal pressure and reversed bending was also investigated experimentally chen and chen 2016 liu et al 2019 the results demonstrated that the hoop ratcheting strain occurred at both of the flanks and also intrados extrados and midway between extrados and flanks however the ratcheting strain at flanks was much greater as compared to those at other positions on the other hand the submarine pipeline may suffer a form of defect due to the deterioration e g corrosion and external interference e g dents and gouges which can lead to reduction of structural capacity błachut and iflefel 2007 cai et al 2018 chen and chen 2016 cho et al 2017 choi and bomba 2003 cosham and hopkins 2004 drumond et al 2018 ghazijahani et al 2014 2015 limam et al 2012 macdonald et al 2005 zeinoddini and parke 2011 arabzadeh zeinoddini 2013 zeinoddini et al 2015 dents may arise during manufacturing shipping installation or in service operation of an offshore pipeline in service dents are of most concern as these are usually caused by heavy accidental loads such as trawl gears anchors rock moving or other drop objects a dent without other mechanical damages is called a plain dent gouges are characterized by local thickness loss and may occur on the pipe surface during welding arc gouge by dragging a foreign sharp hard object over a pipe such as rock by scraping the pipe with the tooth or similar parts of excavation equipment or by corrosion a dent can be accompanied by one or more gouges this is often referred to as a gouged dent naghipour et al 2018 mo tamedi et al 2018 talebi et al 2018 hence the owners and operators must be able to detect and assess the severity of pipeline defects so as to ensure pipeline integrity cosham and hopkins 2001 while a plain dent having no gouge defect commonly does not pose a threat to pipeline integrity in a static environment it can reduce the life of a pipeline in cyclic pressure conditions alexander et al 1999 a gouge defect also reduces the burst strength and fatigue strength of the pipe cosham and hopkins 2001 cosham and hopkins 2004 moreover the research efforts which conducted for the european pipeline research group eprg american gas association aga and international corrosion supervisory committee prc indicated that the fatigue life of plain dented pipes is significantly greater than those for gouged dented tubes alexander et al 1999 despite the studies mentioned the effect of defect e g dent gouge and corrosion on the cyclic responses of pressurized tubes has received less attention by researchers for example the effects of plain dent on the uniaxial strain ratcheting behavior of un pressurized tubular steel member were experimentally investigated by zeinoddini et al 2014 they showed that dent defects have considerably more drastic effects on the ratcheting response of dented tubes as compared to their monotonic response azadeh and taheri also investigated the ratcheting response of locally dented steel pipes under cyclic loading through experimental tests and nonlinear fe simulations azadeh and taheri 2014 2015 it should be mentioned that only plain dent in the absence of internal pressure was considered in their work they indicated that the dent exerted a very pronounced effect on the ratcheting response of the pipes the results of an experimental study on the response and failure of the defective circular steel tubes under monotonic and cyclic loading were presented by zeinoddini et al zeinoddini et al 2016 zeinoddini et al 2017 it was noticed that under inelastic cyclic bending the ratcheting strain rate increases and the number of cycles to failure markedly decreases in the defective specimens as compared to those in the perfect ones the ratcheting deformation of straight pipe with local wall thinning subjected to constant internal pressure and reversed bending was studied using finite element analysis the results demonstrated that ratcheting strain was increased with the increasing of depth length and circumferential angle of local wall thinning chen and chen 2016 the influence of corrosion defects on the ratcheting response of steel pipes was also investigated it has been found that the strain rate in the damaged part of the tubes is significantly greater than that in the perfect part zeinoddini et al 2015 aforementioned literature review reveals that the effect of mechanical defects on the uniaxial ratcheting and failure problem of pressurized steel pipes has not previously been studied in the current study the inelastic cyclic response of steel pipelines containing dent and gouge under constant internal pressure and axial loading was experimentally examined the study provides some preliminary data concerning the ratcheting behavior of defected pressurized steel pipes moreover the obtained results will be helpful to assess the integrity of plain and gouged dented pipelines 2 experimental setup and procedures 2 1 specimen characteristics and type the as received seamless api 5l x80 steel pipes with nominal outer diameter d of 50 mm and wall thickness t of 5 mm were used in the current experiments according to standard test methods for tension testing of metallic material astm 2016 a number of dog bone shaped specimens were prepared by wire cut machine from axial direction of the steel pipes main mechanical properties of steel were then established through uniaxial tensile testing the tensile test was repeated three times and the average measured of yield stress f y of 640 mpa ultimate stress f u of 740 mpa and elasticity modulus e of 225 gpa the tubular test specimens were prepared by milling machining from as received api 5l x80 steel pipes the overall dimensions of the specimens were chosen close to those utilized in previous works by other researchers jiao and kyriakides 2011a zeinoddini et al 2015a zeinoddini et al 2015b and azadeh and taheri 2014 preceding researches showed that axial plastic buckling is influenced by geometric imperfections as well as by stress concentrations such as those generated by clamped or other end constraints kyriakides and corona 2007 for example lee presented the results of an experimental program on inelastic buckling behavior of soft aluminum shells subjected to axial compression he demonstrated that the stress distribution at the clamped end edges of the specimens was not uniform and the localized stress concentrations introduced by grips at both ends resulted in the early development of edge bulges lee 1962 based on the saint venant principle in a very short distance from the ends the stress is evenly distributed uniformly lower 2014 eventually using advanced finite element simulations the test specimens were designed and constructed in the way that the effects of boundary conditions and the thickness discontinuities to be minimized the geometry specifications of the final test specimens are shown in fig 1 as it can be seen two thicker parts at far ends of the specimens length 50 mm uniform thickness 5 mm are connected to the gauge section located in the middle of the specimen length 70 mm uniform thickness 2 mm by two linear taper segments length 60 mm un uniform wall thickness varies between 5 mm and 2 mm the ratio of diameter to thickness d t in the gauge section of the specimens was also chosen based on avoiding local elastic shell buckling under axial compressive loading in which collapse is sudden and catastrophic to evaluate the amount of geometric imperfections caused by machining procedure the outer surface of the middle section of the specimens was analyzed through a 3d scanner device fig 2 shows a 3d view of the errors resulted from machining procedures in this figure the discrepancies were mostly ranged within 0 02 mm which are shown in green the data provided by 3d scanning of specimens after finishing the machining work and before conducting the mechanical testing were analyzed to quantify the extent of possible imperfections in the specimens table 1 summarizes the nominal and measured values of the outer diameter d wall thickness t out of roundness d max d min d max and out of straightness δ o l out of 36 circumferential and 16 longitudinal sections over the gauge length of one specimen 2 2 pressurization system an independent pressurization system with a capacity of 300 bar was used to apply internal pressure at first the discharge pressure of the oil hydraulic pump thus the internal pressure in the specimen was increased to the desired level and kept then constant an accumulator was also used to mitigate any pressure fluctuations inside the system during the experiments the accumulator was connected to the hydraulic oil pump and specimen to compensate any changes in the pressure see fig 3 when the system was faced with an increase or lack of internal pressure the pressure control device regulated the internal pressure by storing some of the oil into the oil chamber of accumulator or injecting some of the stored oil into the system respectively to apply internal pressure into the test specimens two steel caps with two embedded holes one as the inlet of oil and the other as a place for installing pressure gauge were also fixed at the specimen s both ends to fix any relative movement between the caps they were screwed into the thicker parts of the specimens and then welded to the pipe body see fig 1 in all tests indentation process and cyclic loading was applied at a constant internal pressure level of p in 0 31p y where p y 640 bar which the yield pressure was calculated through p y f y t r r is internal radios 20 mm pipeline failure is a risk that a designer must take into account many codes set a design factor df which prevents the pipeline from operating above certain stress levels pds of 0 5 and 0 72 were suggested regarding the hoop stress by asme code 2004 for the risers and platform piping and submarine pipelines respectively in the current experiments a value of 0 31p y was considered for the internal pressure this was somehow smaller than the aforesaid pds because the specimens were due to also experience axial stressing and denting on top of the hoop stress it also falls in between values of 0 163 0 326 and 0 489p y in the karamanos and eleftheriadis 2004 study who conducted laboratory experiments on collapse of pressurized steel tubes under lateral loads 2 3 indentation and gouge defect as aforementioned this study deals with the strain ratcheting behavior of steel tubular members containing plain and gouged dents under uniaxial cyclic stressing for the plain dented specimens the intact specimens without any surface damage gouge were dented by an indenter under internal pressure whereas for the gouged dented specimens a gouge was first machined onto the exterior surface of the specimen before applying internal pressure and the indentation process was then applied under presence of the internal pressure for the gouged specimens a single rectangular gouge along the pipe axis and at the center of anticipated dent was introduced using an electrical discharge machine spark machine as shown in fig 4 the depth length and width of a gouge are denoted by e l and w respectively in the current study to examine the effect of gouge dimensions two different geometrical characteristics were considered see table 2 in this table the gouge depth e and width w were normalized with respect to the wall thickness of the specimen in the gauge section t 2 mm whereas the gouge length l was normalized with external diameter of the gauge section d 44 mm during indentation process the gouged non gouged specimens were placed on a saddle shaped steel bed with length of 70 mm and a dent was then introduced at the midsection of the specimens by a hemi spherical indenter with a diameter of 20 mm see fig 5 both of the indenter and bed were made from ck45 steel and they were designed in the way that they can be considered as a rigid body as compared to the test specimens therefore their size and shape were not changed during the denting process the indenter was pushed down until a pre described dent depth was created and subsequently was pulled back to be detached from the test specimen completely in all experimental tests the denting speed was kept enough slow so that the indentation process was considered as a quasi static deformation extra details on the denting process and its results were previously reported in a separate paper and a summary is presented here naghipour et al 2018 exploring the difference between the quasi static and dynamic denting is not the aim of the current study because the subject was already studied by a number of researchers e g the quasi static denting by zeinoddini et al 1998 1999 2000 2013 and dynamic denting by zeinoddini et al 2002 2008 in fact the current paper focuses on a post event subject it deals with a pipe which is already damaged in a denting event dynamic or static and is now subject to strain ratcheting due to combined actions of internal pressure and axial inelastic cycling the latter subject has not already been addressed by previous researchers 2 4 cyclic loading an instron 8502 testing machine that can be operated in displacement or load control manner was used to apply the axial loading the experimental setup is shown in fig 6 the two ends of the caps were gripped by the machine clamps at the beginning of the test the specimen was pressurized up to the required level with an oil hydraulic pump and the pressure was kept constant during the test process using an accumulator the specimen was then subjected to displacement control monotonic axial compression until the axial strain reached a desired pre strain of ε mon the specimen was then subjected to axial cyclic loading under a load control mode the cyclic loading protocol was asymmetric see fig 7 with a constant stress amplitude of σ a and a compressive mean stress of σ m it is noted that ε mon was defined as the ratio of the overall axial shortening of the gauge length to its initial length δ a x i a l l it is clear that the local strain might vary from ε mon and may develop non uniformly along the specimen and circumferentially because of denting and bowing of the specimen accordingly the axial strain during the cyclic loading was defined as the ratio of the axial deformation of the gauge length to its initial length the loading frequency for the current cyclic tests was 0 01 hz this gives a maximum axial strain rate of around ε 75 10 6 s under stress cycling the cowper symonds equation cowper and symonds 1957 can be used to estimate the ratio of the yield stress under such a loading rate σ y d relative the static yield stress σ y st σ y d σ y s t 1 ε d r 1 p where d r and p are the cowper symonds constant material rate parameters the specimens were made from high tensile steels which are commonly regarded to have a low strain rate sensitivity considering d 5946 s and q 1 75 xu et al 2017 for high strength steel materials the ratio between the σ y d and σ y st would be 1 000031 indicating on a negligible strain rate effect during the cyclic tests it should be noted that all specimens used in this study were similar in terms of material and geometric dimensions to study the effect of main parameters such as initial pre strain ε mon the ratio of dent depth δ d and the presence of the gouge a total number of 19 experiments were considered in this study in summary four intact specimens with different initial pre strain values seven non gouged dented specimens with various dent depths and finally eight gouged dented specimens with different dent depths and also dissimilar gouge dimensions were subjected to cyclic axial loading under internal pressure table 3 provides a summary of the characteristics of each experiment in the current study below abbreviated forms of the definitions are used to describe each of the experiment characteristics ic intact specimen examined under cyclic axial loading dc dented specimen with no surface damage gouge examined under cyclic axial loading gdc gouged specimen which was then dented and examined under cyclic axial loading 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 intact specimens in this section the results of the strain ratcheting tests on intact tubes are presented and discussed the axial load displacement responses observed were very similar to those reported by previous researchers jiao and kyriakides 2011a 2011b under axial inelastic compression the intact steel specimens initially shortened linearly beyond the initial elastic region at a critical strain level ε c axisymmetric wrinkling initiated as the axial shortening increased the wrinkle amplitude gradually increased extra wrinkles were formed and the axial rigidity of the tubes decreased under persistent axial compression the wrinkles growth led to localization of one wrinkle accompanied by an adjacent kinking eventually resulted to instability at a limit stress σ l or a limit strain ε l zeinoddini et al 2015a kyriakides and corona 2007 in most previous studies on the ratcheting behavior of the steel tubes the initial pre strain chosen for the cyclic loading protocol ε mon was somewhat greater than the critical strain ε c where the wrinkling initiated in the tube wall however a question is raised as to whether the strain ratcheting behavior can occur with initial pre strain levels less than the critical strain in the current paper the critical strain ε c and the limit strain ε l values for intact specimens were defined by monotonic axial compression tests the specimens had an internal pressure level of 0 31p y the results indicated that the wrinkling was initiated around an average axial strain of ε c 0 6 and the limit stress σ l occurred around ε l 3 1 therefore four intact pressurized specimens with different initial pre strain level were subjected to cyclic axial loading and the obtained results are presented under inelastic axial compression both straining of the material and wrinkling of the tube wall contribute to the overall axial shortening of the specimen δ a x i a l therefore δ a x i a l cannot be directly defined using strain gauges placed on the specimen for instance the strain gauge readings vary if a wrinkle develops at the gauge location or not in this study the history of the axial load and the overall shortening over the gauge length of the specimen l were thus recorded by the load cell embedded in the testing machine and extensometers respectively the axial strain is thus defined as δ a x i a l l however strain gauges were also placed on some specimens to record the local strains in the axial and circumferential directions in these tests the initial pre strain ε mon varied from 0 35 beginning of the plastic region where no wrinkles were yet formed to 1 where the wrinkling was apparent other loading parameters such as the stress amplitude and the internal pressure were kept constant during the cyclic tests the stress strain responses obtained from ic1 ic2 ic3 and ic4 specimens fig 8 indicated that the axial strain was ratcheting by increase in the number of cycles this proves that in the presence of internal pressure the ratcheting may occur even when ε mon is smaller than ε c with all experiments the stress cycling was stopped after 240th cycle it can be noticed in fig 8 that as the initial pre strain increased the total ratchet strain accumulated over 240 cycles tested increased fig 9 presents the accumulated axial strain ratcheting against number of loading cycles for intact specimens ic1 ic2 ic3 and ic4 with all four specimens ratcheting strain rate non linearly decreased in the early cycles of loading referred as the transient region part 1 the ratcheting strain rate remained then almost constant referred as the steady rate region part 2 the results indicated that the first region elongated and the second region became steeper as the initial pre strain increased for example in specimen ic1 ε mon 0 35 the onset of the steady rate zone part 2 occurred after 14 cycles with specimen ic4 ε mon 1 the onset of the steady rate zone appeared after 53 cycles furthermore with specimen ic1 the slope of the steady rate zone remains very close to zero a zero slope indicates on a shake down type of response in which no net accumulation of plastic deformation arises in a ratcheting type of response the steady rate zone will have a positive slope which shows the net plastic strain is accumulating in each load cycle for better understanding of the ratcheting mechanism in the specimens their deformations were monitored during the monotonic and cyclic tests using 3d optical scanners fig 10 compares the reconstructed deformed shapes of the ic1 ic2 and ic3 specimens after completion of the initial monotonic pre strain and after applying 240 axial load cycles the figure shows that the ic1 specimen exhibited no sign of wrinkling after applying the initial monotonic pre strain and even after 240 inelastic load cycles in this case the cyclic plastic strain accumulation seems to have been originated only from the material ratcheting absence of structural ratcheting appears to be the main reason that the slope of the steady rate zone in the ic1 specimen fig 9 remained very close to zero the ic2 specimen also showed no sign of wrinkling after applying the initial monotonic pre strain however small amplitude wrinkles were formed over its gauge section after the cyclic loading in this case the cyclic plastic strain accumulation appears to have been initially originated from the material ratcheting later on both the material and structural ratcheting contributed to the response in other words the strain ratcheting was reflecting partly accumulation of material strain and partly the shortening caused by the incremental growth in the wrinkles amplitude jiao and kyriakides 2011a with ic3 specimen three axisymmetric wrinkles were formed along the gauge section after applying the initial monotonic pre strain fig 10 shows that the number and the location of the wrinkles remained the same during the initial monotonic stage and the cyclic loading but the wrinkles amplitudes were almost doubled it can be noticed that the amplitudes of the three wrinkles formed in the initial monotonic pre strain were different the wrinkles amplitudes after the cyclic loading followed the suit fig 10 shows that the final total number of the wrinkles in the specimens ic2 and ic3 remained the same but their amplitudes and locations varied it can therefore be said that the initial pre strain had no bearing on the final number of the wrinkles but was radically affecting the wrinkles amplitudes the location of the wrinkles appeared to be mostly dependent on the geometry of the initial fabrication imperfections in the specimens see section 2 1 the above discussion reveals that even when the cycling was commenced before the formation of the wrinkling ic2 the strain ratcheting may still occur initially the material ratcheting dominates but later on both the material and structural ratcheting contribute to the accumulation of the plastic strain under constant amplitude axial stressing of the specimens the summary result of the last four described tests on the pressurized intact specimens is presented in table 4 in this table the ratcheting strain rate ε r is defined as the total axial ratcheting strain ε r t o t divided by the total number of load cycles n the table also provides the number of load cycles to the failure n f the ratcheting failure reportedly occurs when the total axial ratcheting strain ε r t o t reaches the limit axial strain ε l under monotonic compression jiao and kyriakides 2011a zeinoddini et al 2014 the number of load cycles to the failure was thus approximated as n f ε l ε r it can be concluded that when the initial pre strain level was relatively low less than 0 45 the amplitude of the plastic wrinkles in the specimens remained considerably small thus the structural ratcheting was not triggered during the tests with higher initial pre strains greater than 1 the ratcheting strain significantly accelerated and the number of cycles to failure noticeably dropped n f 755 which could threaten the pipeline safety during its lifetime in general the initial pre strain had an important role on the overall ratcheting response of the pressurized intact tubes two strain gauges on the surface of specimen ic2 were used due to record the longitudinal and hoop strains see fig 11 fig 12 illustrates the longitudinal and hoop strain history versus the number of the load cycles the figure shows that the strain ratcheting took place in both longitudinal and hoop directions the presence of internal pressure thus resulted in biaxial ratcheting in the specimen at these measuring points the strain rate in the longitudinal direction was nearly twice that in the hoop direction it should be noted that the strain gauges were registering the temporal variation of the local strains it means that the recorded strains could vary greatly depending on whereabouts of the wrinkles kinks relative to the gauge location fig 12 shows that by introducing the monotonic compression to the specimen a compressive strain was detected by the longitudinal strain gauge when the axial cycling started the mean strain gradually decreased relative to the initial compressive axial strain this was because the strain gauge position experienced wrinkling during the cyclic loading as the wrinkle amplitude increased tensile longitudinal strains were developed in the exterior surface of the wrinkle the longitudinal tensile local strain gradually ratcheted up essentially due to the structural ratcheting but caused the mean strain to gradually reduce relative to the initial compressive strain by introducing the monotonic compression a tensile hoop strain was initially recorded increase in the amplitude of the wrinkle brought in extra tensile hoop strains in the exterior surface of the wrinkle as a result the mean strain gradually increased relative to that for the initial local compressive strain it also ratcheted up by the gradual increase in the wrinkle amplitude the ratcheting strain rate in the hoop direction was however considerably smaller than that in the longitudinal direction 3 2 dented specimens this section examines the effects of dent shaped defects on the ratcheting response of pressurized steel tubes the specimens were initially laterally dented after reaching a pre described dent depth the indenter was slowly removed specimens with the dent depth ratios δ d of 11 and 15 were produced they remained free of gouge type defects before the indentation process an internal pressure of 0 31p y was applied to the specimen and maintained thereafter the pressurized dented specimens were then monotonically compressed up to axial pre strain values of ε mon 0 35 0 45 0 66 and 1 the specimens were then tested under nonlinear axial cyclic loading with an amplitude loading of σ a 380 mpa for comparison purposes the initial pre strain ε mon stress amplitude σ a and the internal pressure with the dented specimens were chosen similar to those with the intact specimens see section 3 1 the loading conditions and the specimens id are listed in table 5 the dent depth ratios δ d r presented in this table correspond to the residual dent depths after removing the indenter fig 13 presents the axial stress strain history of the dented specimens dc1 to dc7 the figure shows that even when the initial pre strain level was relatively low ε mon 0 35 in dc1 or 0 45 in dc3 the dented pressurized specimens began to distinctly ratchet under axial stress cycling a summary of the ratcheting tests results including the mean ratcheting strain rate ε r and the number of cycles to failure n f are reported in table 5 the ratio between the ε r in a dented specimen and in the corresponding intact specimen with the same loading conditions is also reported the results show that by increase in the dent depth ε r dramatically increased and n f remarkably decreased in comparison to those with the intact specimens the dent depth effects were exacerbated with increase in the initial pre strain ε mon as an example ε r in dc1 specimen with δ d 15 and ε mon 0 35 accelerated by 500 relative to that in the corresponding intact specimen ic1 whereas ε r in dc4 specimen with δ d 15 and ε mon 0 66 accelerated by 816 relative to that in the corresponding intact specimen ic3 similar to that with the intact specimens the stress cycling was stopped after 240 cycles ratcheting failures were experienced by dc4 dc6 and dc7 specimens at 200 70 and 170 cycles respectively no sign of failure was demonstrated by other dented specimens up to 240 cycles fig 14 presents the accumulated axial strain ratcheting data against number of loading cycles for dented specimens dc1 to dc7 the results are grouped based on the axial pre strain values ε mon 0 35 0 66 and 1 in the specimens the test data for the corresponding intact specimen is also provided in each case in general dented specimens showed longer transient regions in terms of the load cycle number relative to that with the corresponding intact specimen the linear region in the dented specimens grew also steeper than that in the corresponding intact specimen when the initial compression was relatively high 1 ratcheting strain rates ε r in the dented specimens dc5 and dc6 were noticeably high thus the accumulated ratchet strain surpassed the linear zone accelerated exponentially and led eventually to failure in the few last cycles in contrast the intact specimen ic4 stayed still in the linear zone up to the 240 cycles see fig 14 fig 14 also shows that the ratcheting response of the specimens was dramatically affected by the dent depth during its life time an offshore pipeline is expected to experience several hundreds of inelastic load cycles jiao and kyriakides 2011a the results of the current study showed that a dent with δ d 11 may put a pressurized steel pipe at ratcheting failure risk even when the initial pre strain is relatively low e g 0 66 due to record the longitudinal and hoop strains of dc3 specimen see fig 15 two strain gauges were fixed at the flanks of the dent dented part and two others similarly on the opposite side of the dented region intact part the local longitudinal and hoop strains of the dented and intact parts of dc3 specimen are presented in fig 16 the results demonstrated that the strain ratcheting in the dented and intact parts were distinctly different although the intact part was experiencing axial compressive strains tensile strains were being recorded in the dented part it can be concluded that while the global applied cyclic stressing on the tube still remained uniaxial the local uniaxial stressing in the dented part was turned to a multiaxial stressing the axial strains in the intact part had higher amplitudes and higher ratcheting rate moreover the axial strains in the dented part had lower amplitude which remained almost constant with the cyclic stressing this was the opposite for hoop direction however on both sides of the specimen the axial and hoop ratcheting strains took place and were growing up by loading it is clear that the indentation process leaves behind a gross disturbance in the initial curvature of the tube wall therefore local bending stresses were also being produced at the dent place during the axial stressing higher initial strains at the dented zone were thus produced by the local stresses as compared to those in the intact parts of the specimens see fig 16 furthermore similar to the intact specimens both the material and structural ratcheting contributed to the cyclic response of dented specimens in other words some key parameters such as contribution of the structural ratcheting and the presence of local multiaxial stressing in the dented specimens were found to drastically degrade the cyclic response and these degradation effects were exacerbated with an increase in the dent depth in order to study the failure mode of the plain dented specimens the deformed shape of specimen dc4 after 190 load cycles only a few cycles to failure of the specimen is given in fig 17 unlike the intact specimen due to the higher axial strain rate in the intact part non axisymmetric wrinkles were formed opposite to the indented part at the far ends of the gauge section the wrinkles amplitude was increasing by each load cycle and growing longer toward the dented part the formation of the non axisymmetric wrinkles propagation and growth of the dent shape and wrinkles were also monitored by 3d measuring scan see fig 18 the results showed that as the load cycles increased the dent depth increased under persistent nonlinear stress cycling the initial hemispherical geometry of the dent gradually turned to an oblate hemispheroid this was essentially due to simultaneous ratcheting of the tensile hoop strain and compressive axial strain around the dented area the major axis of the hemispheroid was oriented in the circumferential direction and the minor axis in the longitudinal direction this indicated that the cyclic response of the dented pressurized specimens was dominated by structural rather than material ratcheting the current experiments can be divided in two separate phases i lateral indentation of the steel pipe and ii post denting axial cyclic testing of the pipe it is acknowledged that in the course of lateral indentation different types of permanent damages may occur in a steel pipe they include overall bowing zeinoddini et al 1998 local denting zeinoddini et al 1999 cross sectional deformation ovalization zeinoddini et al 2000 wall tearing zeinoddini et al 2002 axial shortening zeinoddini et al 2008 etc the extends of these damages also vary depending on the end and bedding boundary conditions of the pipe the aforementioned damages each may play detrimental roles on the post event load bearing and strength of the steel pipe the overall bending bowing type of damage is intentionally avoided in the first phase of the current experiments as much as possible to give emphasis to the local denting damages the aim is not to undermine the importance of other types of permanent damages on the post event behavior of the steel pipe but to limit the number of parameters involved and the number of tests required the present study covers three different dent depths δ d 0 11 and 15 two different dent types plain or gouged four different initial inelastic strains and two different gouge geometries the number of the specimens tests will drastically increase and turns the experiments unfeasible if other types of permanent deformations are also considered it is admitted that aforementioned damages and their combinations with denting have important effects on the ratcheting response of steel pipes and these have to be considered in future works nevertheless no attempt is made to restrict overall bending of the specimens in the second phase of the experiments as an example fig 19 compares the final longitudinal post denting profiles of the specimen with δ d of 15 with those obtained after axial cyclic load testing the data are acquired from 3d optical scanning of the specimen after completion of the first and second phases of the experiment the abscissa presents the normalized gauge length of the specimen the ordinate provides deflection of the specimen face towards the center line of the tube while minus values are for deflections towards the center line during the second phase of the experiment the front dented face of the tube experiences extra radial deflections towards the center line fig 19 both inward and outward bending deflections along the gauge length can be noticed underneath of the specimen outward radial deflections bowing appear over the side faces of the specimen fig 19 fig 20 shows the evolution of the hysteresis loops for specimen dc7 similar to the tertiary ratcheting paths the evolution of the cycles can be divided into three parts with respect to the hysteresis loops dimensions in part 1 up to early 50 cycles transient part the area of the hysteresis loops decreased progressively by about 50 from the 50th cycle afterward linear part the dimensions of the hysteresis loops remained almost constant up to the 149th cycle the area of the hysteresis loops again increased about 50 as compared to the corresponding area of the 140th cycle in this part exponential part the peaks of the cycles became also rounder according to the results obtained in this section it can be stated that the dimensions of the hysteresis loops changed proportional to the ratcheting response paths 3 3 gouged dented specimens in this section ratcheting behavior of pressurized steel tubes with dent and gouge type defects is examined as aforementioned longitudinal oriented local wall thinning was introduced on the surface of the specimens as a gouge the gouge was located on outside surface of the center of the gauge section the gouged specimens were then dented by a hemispherical indenter at the center of the gouge length table 6 provides summary results and the characteristics of each test to examine the effect of the local wall thinning dimensions two different geometries were considered see table 2 in this study with both gouge geometries the gouge depth and total loss area were kept constant and only the gouge length and gouge width were changed the introduced gouge length in geometry no 1 was two times longer than that for geometry no 2 while its width was half for comparison purposes the loading parameters such as initial pre strain ε mon stress amplitude σ a internal pressure level p p y and also shape and depth of dent with the gouged dented specimens were chosen similar to those with plain dented specimens see section 3 2 the ratio between the ε r in a gouged dented specimen and in the corresponding plain dented specimen with the same loading conditions is also reported in table 6 the results showed that the ratcheting performance of the gouged dented specimens was significantly degraded in comparison to those for the corresponding plain dented specimens for example plain dented specimen dc1 δ d 15 ε mon 0 35 could withstand 876 cycles before failure whereas with the presence of a gouge specimen gdc1 δ d 15 ε mon 0 35 and gouge geometry no 1 could withstand against failure up to the 410th cycle on the other hand the degradation effects of the gouge were strongly dependent upon the gouge geometry dent depth and initial pre strain level the gouge effects became more pronounced when the gouge was wider whereas its length was shorter it can be concluded that the effects of the gouge length on the ratcheting response of the pressurized tubes were less significant than its width furthermore the results showed that the adverse gouge effects were noticeably exacerbated with the increase in the dent depth for example specimen gdc6 δ d 11 ε mon 0 66 and gouge no 2 could withstand 250 cycles before failure whereas by an increase around 4 in the dent depth specimen gdc4 failed after 80 cycles this is due to the fact that during indentation process some residual stresses and strains were certainly produced in the gouge area these local stresses and strains increased as the dent depth increased it means that the local stress amplitude and initial pre strain might be increased in the gouge area with these specimens the ratcheting failure was occurred due to the localization of the ratchet strain and formation of cracks in the gouge area the deformed shape of specimen gdc3 is also presented in fig 21 similar to the plain dented specimens see fig 19 as the load cycles increased the dented region spread wider and non axisymmetric wrinkles were initiated and developed however with the gouged specimen the growth of the dent area was more localized than non gouged ones this is due to the reduction of local stiffness in the dented area which causes the ratcheting strain to be accumulated in the gouge area it can be stated that the presence of a gouge at dent depths δ d greater than 15 even for small initial pre strain ε mon 0 35 has a radical influence on the strain ratcheting response of the pressurized dented steel tubes however these effects decreased as the initial pre strain increased as presented in the previous section when the initial pre strain increased the dented area spread circumferentially over the tube wall therefore the adverse gouge effects dramatically decreased as compared to adverse dent effects in other words the ratcheting behavior of the pressurized tubes was governed by dent and gouge respectively fig 22 represents the accumulated axial strain ratcheting data against number of cycles for gouged dented specimens gdc1 to gdc 8 the results grouped based on the axial pre strain ε mon 0 35 0 66 and 1 and dent depth values δ d 11 and 15 the test data for the corresponding plain dented and intact specimen is also provided in each case the results showed that the presence of a gouge had profound effects on the accumulation of the ratchet strain and these effects were reflected in the tertiary path for example with specimen gdc7 δ d 11 ε mon 1 and gouge no 1 the exponential zone was commenced after 113 cycles whereas plain dented specimen dc7 δ d 11 and ε mon 1 stayed still in the linear zone up to the 150 cycles once again the presence of the gouge exacerbated the adverse effects on the ratcheting response of the pressurized dented specimens 4 conclusions in this study 19 steel tubular specimens with diameter to thickness ratio d t of 22 were tested under axial cyclic stressing a local plain dent with hemispherical shape and dents with a gouge of varying geometry were introduced on the specimen surface the effects of the initial pre strain local dent depth and gouge dimension on the strain ratcheting behavior of the pressurized steel pipes were evaluated the following conclusions may be made 4 1 pressurized intact tubes with the pressurized tubes the strain ratcheting occurs even when the stress cycling commences before the formation of the wrinkling the presence of internal pressure results in biaxial ratcheting of the steel pipe the ratcheting rate in the longitudinal direction is noticeably higher than that in the hoop direction 4 2 pressurized tubes with a plain dent presence of a shallow dent say δ d 11 radically reduces the number of load cycles to failure in a pressurized tube the ratcheting rate significantly increases and the total number of load cycles to failure remarkably decreases as the dent depth increases these adverse effects are exacerbated by increase in the initial pre strain the dent presence and the dent depth strongly affect the ratcheting strain cycle number response unlike intact tubes non axisymmetric wrinkles may also appear in the pressurized dented tubes the dent gradually deepens widens and its initial hemispherical geometry turns to an oblate hemispheroid as the load cycle number increases the inelastic cyclic response of dented pressurized steel tubes is dominated by structural rather than material ratcheting 4 3 pressurized tubes with a gouged dent the ratcheting rate in a gouged dented steel tube is significantly higher than that in the corresponding plain dented tube the gouge width plays a greater role on the ratcheting response of pressurized tubes than the gouge length the gouge effect on the strain ratcheting rate noticeably increases as the dent depth increases presence of a gouge in a deep dent e g δ d 15 radically accelerates the strain ratcheting rate of a pressurized steel tube however the effects magnitude reduces as the initial pre strain increased with a gouged steel tube the growth of the dent area is more localized than that in the corresponding plain dent credit author statement m

21264,offshore structures usually are implemented in harsh environmental conditions which make the structures disposed to different failures negligible failures may lead to catastrophic ones to prevent potential catastrophic failure development of robust damage detection methods for offshore structures is necessary damages change structure s dynamic characteristics among different dynamic characteristics modal frequencies and mode shapes are utilized more often due to various problems regarding damage detection methods for offshore structures such as sensor installation and data acquisition in water damage detection methods using limited sensors seems very vital in this paper a novel method called improved modal strain energy decomposition method imsedm is developed to detect structural damage of jacket type offshore platforms using a limited number of sensors just above the water the proposed method has two main contributions the first is simultaneous use of both modal frequencies and mode shapes which make damage detection more accurate the second is decomposition of modal strain energy into axial and bending imsedm locates damaged elements by considering the impacts of the damage on axial and bending modal strain energy the method is evaluated using an experimental jacket type offshore platform the results confirm that imsedm can effectively detect damages with incomplete data keywords damage detection jacket type offshore platform limited data modal properties modal strain energy 1 introduction the damages of steel jacket type offshore platforms are caused by harsh sea environmental conditions during platform service life structural damages change structural dynamic characteristics and usually decrease the structural capacity early detection of damage helps to prevent catastrophic failure of important structures a general classification of damage detection techniques refers to the type of data among numerous structural damage detection techniques the vibration based damage detection techniques have been used widely in structures monitoring the vibration based methods can be classified into two main categories modal and signal analyses the modal analysis methods such as natural frequency based methods mode shape based methods mac comac and mode shape curvature damping based methods and modal strain energy methods msems are based on changes in the structure characteristic after damage the signal analysis based methods such as fourier transform wavelet analysis and hilbert transform are based on changes in measurement signals a typical modal based damage localization method can be divided into two parts the modal identification algorithm to estimate modal properties the damage localization algorithm to diagnose damage using the estimated modal properties regarding the damage localization methods various damage indicators have been proposed the results of a comparative study on modal analysis methods show that modal strain energy mse based methods have good sensitivity to local damages and are proposed as a stable method regarding the noisy signals doebling et al 1996 1998 alvandi and cremona 2006 kim and stubbs 2002 in stubbs et al 1995 a damage sensitive feature utilizing mse is suggested in shi et al 1998 mse before and after damages are calculated to localize the damage in the structure which requires a large number of modes in most of the recently published damage detection methods experimental and theoretical techniques are used to estimate structural damage despite incomplete information and uncertainties in wang and xu 2019 a summary review of mse based damage identification methods has been provided comparative studies based on a numerical and two experimental models were conducted using sdi msed msecr and cmse methods which help implement available mse based damage identification algorithms msem has been developed and combined with different methods in recent years to improve its robustness and accuracy for damage detection when a limited number of sensors should be employed or it is very difficult to measure rotational degrees of freedom dof in complicated structures a method in which the expansion based method has been used to complete limited measured modes has been presented in law et al 1998 in wang et al 2015 an optimal fitting method is used to complete the mode shapes as an interpolation mode expansion technique in shi et al 2000 the sensitivity of elemental mse has been used for local damages by using a sufficient number of modes severity of the damage can be achieved with more stability frequency based methods have various advantages compared to mode shapes such as availability of modal frequencies from only one sensor higher accuracy and robustness however information extracted from only one sensor is not sufficient to detect the local damage the modal frequency is a global structure property therefore changes of frequency due to local damages may not be reflected in it especially for large scale structures such as offshore platforms wang 2013 ciambella and vestroni 2015 in li et al 2016 improved modal strain energy method imsem has been proposed which uses the frequency data for damage detection in jacket type offshore platform structures in li et al 2006 an approach is proposed to identified damaged individual members in 3d frame structures it defines two damage indicators an axial damage indicator and a bending damage indicator for each member modal strain energy decomposition method is used to detect jacket type offshore platforms structural damage liu et al 2017 offshore platforms components are mainly affected by the axial force and bending moment in the modal analysis the master dof of waling and diagonal bracing is axial and the master dof of legs is bending li et al 2006 the decomposition methods separate the participation effect of axial and bending modal strain energy to improve damage detection the other developed methods have been proposed to improve the accuracy of damage detection using the msem without undamaged structure the baseline free approach has been proposed to use the fitted curvatures instead of curvatures from the healthy structure to avoid the need of a baseline modal and to exploit the benefits of the msem baneen and kausar 2018 two stage methods are proposed to reach higher levels of damage detection a mse based index is proposed in seyedpoor 2012 the index is utilized to locate the structural damage and then severity of the damage is determined by a particle swarm optimization modal frequencies and mode shapes derivatives are used as an input of neural network in tan et al 2017 in this paper improved modal strain energy decomposition method imsedm is proposed to detect damages in a jacket type offshore platform using data from a limited number of sensors using modal frequencies and considering the impacts of damage on the axial and bending mse in damaged elements des are two main contributions of the proposed method experimental modal data of scaled fixed base jacket type offshore platform have been expanded using a numerical model in abaqus to consider the difficultly of underwater measurement situations in offshore structures data from two 2 directional sensors that have been placed at the top levels of the experimental jacket type offshore platform is considered the results show the damages can be accurately detected using a limited number of sensors and the first two orders of mode shapes in the following model description and damage scenarios have been described the sensors signals have been processed and expanded the proposed imsedm has been used to detect damage and the results have been compared with two other mse based methods 2 methodology the modal parameters of the structure e g frequencies and mode shapes change with modifications of physical properties liu et al 2018a 2018b so when a structure is damaged the stiffness of the damaged region decreases which is caused to change the modal characteristics of the intact structure kim et al 2019 mse is a function of mode shape and stiffness matrix therefore the experimental mode shapes and frequencies have been needed as mentioned because of the difficulties in offshore structures data acquisition minimizing the number of utilized sensors is vital however a limited number of sensors cause the modal data to be incomplete therefore experimental dofs should be expanded using model expansion methods to match with the full set of dofs of the analytical model in this paper the system equivalent reduction expansion process serep is employed as an expansion process which is proposed in o callahan 1989 after expanding mode shapes by the serep method the proposed imsed index which is based on the mse decomposition method is used for damage localization here frequencies and mode shapes are taken into account simultaneously in the following the expansion method is described then the proposed method and its basics are detailed 2 1 the mode shapes expansion method an expansion method should be utilized to estimate the experimental mode shapes at the deleted dof and complete the unmeasured dof using the finite element model as a high order polynomial curve fitter let s define ϕ a b a f e b m u as mode shape matrix in which various subscripts and superscripts indicate different conditions of the matrix first subscript a shows the analysis type f is for finite element fe and e is for experimental analysis the second subscript b shows that whether the matrix is measured or not by m and u respectively also letter d as the superscript could be used to indicate the damaged structure for example ϕ e is total experimental mode shapes matrix ϕ f m is fe mode shape matrix at measured dofs and ϕ e m d is measured experimental damaged mode shape matrix the serep is a simple fast and efficient expansion technique avitabile 2005 in the proposed method the serep is used to expand experimentally measured mode shapes over all the finite element dofs in other words serep is utilized to calculate ϕ e from ϕ e m and ϕ e d from ϕ e m d using a transformation matrix t t relates ϕ f and ϕ f m as shown in eq 1 t can be calculated using ϕ f and ϕ f m as shown in eq 2 and eq 3 t can be used to expand measured mode shapes in all finite element dofs in undamaged and damaged structure 1 ϕ f t ϕ f m t ϕ f ϕ f m t ϕ f m 1 ϕ f m t 2 ϕ e t ϕ e m 3 ϕ e d t ϕ e m d 2 2 the modal strain energy decomposition method msedm jacket type offshore platforms are mainly made by welding tabular members the members could be affected by an axial force and bending moment in the local coordinate system the stiffness matrix of the jth element can be expressed as eq 4 4 k j e l 3 a l 2 0 0 0 0 0 a l 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 12 i z 0 0 0 6 i z l 0 12 i z 0 0 0 6 i z l 0 0 12 i y 0 6 i y l 0 0 0 12 i y 0 6 i y l 0 0 0 0 g j l 2 e 0 0 0 0 0 g j l 2 e 0 0

modulus a is cross section i z i y and j are moments of inertia g is shear modulus and l is the length of the jth element in eq 4 the first and seventh columns are axial tension compression stiffness k j a the second third eighth and ninth columns are bending stiffness k j t the fourth and tenth columns are torsion stiffness k j t and the fifth sixth eleventh and twelfth columns are rotational stiffness k j r so the stiffness matrix of the jth element can be decomposed into eq 5 5 k j k j a k j t k j t k j r the ith order of axial mse of the jth element before and after the damage is expressed in eq 6 the superscript d denotes damaged states 6 ε i j a ϕ e i t k j a ϕ e i ε i j a ϕ e i d t k j a d ϕ e i d where k j a and k j a d are the undamaged and damaged axial stiffness of the jth element in the global coordinate system ϕ e i and ϕ e i d are the ith order experimental undamaged and damaged mode shapes of the jth element obtained from the expansion method assume the damage is limited to stiffness reduction then k j a and k j a d can be expressed before and after damage as follows 7 k j a e j k j 0 a k j a d e j d k j 0 a where e j and e j d are the undamaged and damaged modulus of elasticity and k j 0 a is a proportional quantity of jth element related to geometric property also the ith order of axial tension compression mse ε i a before and after the damage is 8 ε i a ϕ e i t k a ϕ e i ε i a d ϕ e i d t k a d ϕ e i d where k a and k a d are an axial stiffness matrix of all the elements on undamaged and damaged structures the modal sensitivity is defined as a ratio of mse of each element to the total mse of the structure it is expressed in eq 9 for before and after the damage respectively 9 f i j a ε i j a ε i a f i j a d ε i j a d ε i a d for ith order mode j 1 n e f i j a 1 and j 1 n e f i j a d 1 where ne is the number of elements in large structures the energy share of each element is much lower than the total energy of the structure therefore it can be hypothesized that 10 1 f i j a 1 f i j a d 1 substitute eq 9 in eq 10 then the following equation can be concluded 11 ε i j a d ε i a d ε i j a ε i a ε i a ε i a d 1 all the members of the undamaged structure will have the same modulus of elasticity i e e j e for j 1 2 ne if the material is uniform the axial modal strain energy decomposition index msedi β j a can be defined as a ratio of e j and e j d substitute it into eq 11 for ne modes 12 β j a 1 n i 1 n m ϕ e i d t k j 0 a ϕ e i d ϕ e i d t k 0 a ϕ e i d ϕ e i t k 0 a ϕ e i ϕ e i t k j 0 a ϕ e i ϕ e i t k 0 a ϕ e i ϕ e i d t k

can be identified more precisely than mode shapes this concept is introduced into the modal strain energy index msei in ciambella and vestroni 2015 in this paper modal frequency is integrated into msedi to improve damage detection in the following the proposed method is described mathematically the differential equations of free vibration can be written as eq 14 for a linear undamaged and undamped structure with n e elements and n nodes 14 m x k x 0 where k is global stiffness m is the structure mass matrix x and x denote the acceleration vector and displacement vector respectively the eigenanalysis for undamaged and damaged structures can be written as 15 k ϕ e i ω i 2 m ϕ e i k d ϕ e i d ω i d 2 m d ϕ e i d where ω i is the ith order modal frequency the superscript d denotes damage states generally local damage will cause loss of structural stiffness rather than mass therefore m m d multiplying eq 15 by ϕ e i and ϕ e i t gives 16 ε i ϕ e i t k ϕ e i ω i 2 ϕ e i t m ϕ e i ε i d ϕ e i d t k d ϕ e i d ω i d 2 ϕ e i d t m ϕ e i d when only local damage occurs an approximate relationship ϕ e i d t k d ϕ e i d ϕ e i d t k ϕ e i d exists if the numerator and denominator of eqs 12 and 13 multiplied by e and then eq 16 substituted in eqs 12 and 13 the axial and bending improved modal strain energy decomposition index imsedi β can be approximately written as 17 β j a i 1 n

of the first several orders of the modal is used to calculate imsedi as following 19 z j a β j a β a σ β a z j t β j t β t σ β t if the values of z j a and z j t are more than a threshold the des could be recognized therefore des can be detected using eq 19 damage threshold t is proportional to the variance distribution of imsedis that can be calculated as eq 20 20 t σ 2 ln i where i is the total number of data points janeliukstis et al 2017 although the element with imsedi higher than the threshold should be considered as de however an undamaged element which is positioned near a de might have imsedi higher than the threshold too this means that in some situations a simple comparison with the threshold is not enough to detect the de the impact of the damage on the axial and bending mse at each suspicious element should be considered to ensure a correct damage detection 3 damage detection 3 1 case study the proposed method has been verified using the results of an experimental study on k n toosi benchmark platform which is a scaled model of a newly installed jacket type offshore platform in the persian gulf the geometric scale is 1 15 this jacket has six legged horizontal and vertical braces which are steel welded and three level deck a numerical model has been created using abaqus software the legs diameter and thickness are 48 mm and 3 mm the external horizontal and vertical braces diameter and thickness are 34 mm and 3 mm and internal horizontal brace diameter and thickness are 27 2 mm and 3 mm intersectional beams with box section 60 40 3 mm are used in the deck to simulate rigid diaphragm action and deck mass a plate with 15 mm thickness is welded to deck beam the thickness of the legs is increased up to 5 mm to consider joint cans in the jacket eight skirt sleeves are connected to legs 88 9 mm diameter and 5 mm thickness the experimental results of the hinged base condition have been used in this study two 2 directional accelerometers in the upper level of the jacket have been used to measure and record dynamic responses accelerations have been recorded by two 2 directional accelerometers in the upper level of the jacket to convert analog to digital and prevent the occurrence of frequency reflection assuming a sampling rate of 100 hz during the experiment a six orders butterworth filter with cutoff frequency 50 hz was used more details are presented in asgarian et al 2012 2016 see fig 1 3 2 simulation scenarios four damage scenarios have been studied each scenario is performed to evaluate the proposed method when different damages occurred the modal frequencies of the undamaged and damaged structure are given in table 1 elements numbers and the sensors locations have been shown in fig 2 3 it should be mentioned that low order modes can be measured practically 3 3 damage detection results the acceleration is measured in the time domain in each location using signal processing the modal characteristics of the experimental model such as natural frequencies and mode shapes are estimated two mode shapes in y direction of the undamaged structure have been compared in fig 4 the mode expansion diagram shows the expanded mode shape which is achieved by expanding data of two 2 directional sensors in two upper levels of the jacket the experimental diagram shows the mode shape of reference asgarian et al 2012 which is achieved using additional sensors in the undamaged structure as shown in fig 4 the mode expansion diagram is more adjusted to the experimental diagram because dofs are located near sensors in the upper level also the modal data has been extracted from the modal analysis results of the numerical model in abaqus under various damage scenarios after expanding mode shapes by eqs 2 and 3 matlab program has been used to calculate the imsed by eq 19 the results have been compared with imsei li et al 2016 and msei shi et al 1998 finally damage locations are detected 3 3 1 damage scenario 1 in scenario 1 the damage was suffered by a leg at element 77 this scenario is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in case of single damage to the structure the first two modes in the y direction have been used for damage detection that the frequency reduction of the first mode is 0 4 and the second mode is 0 05 figs 5 8 show the results of msei imsei and imsedi for each element respectively according to figs 5 and 6 in the msem and imsem there are some elements indices which are higher than the damage threshold line therefore they are probably damaged the column 77 which has a higher indicator can be detected as a de but it cannot be proved certainly according to figs 7 and 8 in imsedm column 77 has a high bending msei several connected elements like 277 278 349 and 350 have changed in their axial and bending mseis since in this method the impact of damage in axial and bending mse are decomposed column 77 with higher bending damage indicator can be proved as a de therefore imsedm is more precise for detecting the single damage scenario 3 3 2 damage scenario 2 in scenario 2 the diameter of braces 201 202 229 230 325 326 353 and 354 have been reduced from 34 mm to 27 6 mm this scenario is performed to show the robustness of imsedi in case of multiple damages to the structure in which the damages are located near the sensors the first two modes in x and y direction have been used for damage detection with 1 9 and 0 18 frequency loss at the first two modes in the x direction and 2 1 and 0 15 frequency loss at the first two modes in the y direction figs 9 12 show the results of msem imsem and imsedm for each element respectively in this multiple damages scenario msem and imsem have the same precision according to figs 9 and 10 in the mse and imsem braces 201 202 229 230 325 326 353 and 354 which have higher indices than the damage threshold can be introduced as des in imsedm as shown in figs 11 and 12 members 201 202 229 230 325 326 353 and 354 have higher axial and bending indicators several elements such as columns 13 45 63 and 95 connected to des can be recognized according to the geometric relation of elements and relationship between change rates of axial and bending mses some connected elements such as 26 76 204 231 324 with high bending mse are unknown as des because of their small axial mseis these elements are proof of damage of braces 201 202 229 230 325 326 353 and 354 therefore imsedm is more helpful for damage detection when damage locations are near the location of the sensors 3 3 3 damage scenario 3 in this scenario the damage was suffered at elements 311 313 314 339 341 and 342 in comparison with scenario 2 this scenario is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of imsedi in case of multiple damages in which damages have occurred far from sensors figs 13 16 show damage detection results of msem imsem and imsedm for each element the first two modes in the x direction are approximately without frequency loss and the first two modes in the y direction are 25 and 55 frequency losses according to figs 13 and 14 in this multiple damages scenario in msem and imsem the indices of braces 311 314 339 and 342 are higher than the threshold therefore they are detected as des but the msem can t detect braces 313 and 341 also their indices are lower than the threshold in imsem therefore they can t be identified using msem and imsem in imsedm as mentioned the axial mse impact is more helpful to identify damage at braces as shown in figs 15 and 16 braces 311 314 339 and 342 are introduced as des because of higher axial damage indicator than the threshold and changes in their bending indices although the braces 313 and 341 do not reach the threshold in imsed these braces have a higher index in comparison with the msem and imsem furthermore their connected elements with high bending mseis such as 11 23 43 61 73 93 have small axial msei then they cannot be detected as des but the position relations of elements and the relationships between change rates of two modal strain energies prove that there are damages on braces 311 313 314 339 341 and 342 compared to the two other methods imsedm is more precise when damage locations are far from the location of the sensors the detection error is due to the distance between the utilized sensors and the braces 313 and 341 3 3 4 damage scenario 4 in scenario 4 the damage was suffered by braces 201 202 229 230 325 326 353 354 and columns 13 27 45 63 77 95 resulting in 2 84 and 2 37 frequency losses at the first two modes in the x direction 2 7 frequency loss at first mode and 2 3 frequency gain at the second mode in the y direction this scenario is performed to show the decomposition effect of imsed when at least one leg and one brace are damaged damage detection results of msem imsem and imsedm are shown in figs 17 20 for each element in this multiple damages scenario elements with higher change rates of both axial and bending mse must be examined carefully according to figs 17 and 18 in msem and imsem elements with indices higher than the threshold can be detected as des however there may be some errors in msem and imsem detections in this scenario according to figs 19 and 20 in imsedm braces 201 202 229 230 325 326 353 and 354 have higher axial indices than threshold and change in their bending indices columns 13 27 45 63 77 and 95 have high bending indices and their axial indices change the axial damage index is more helpful to identify damage occurring at braces and the bending damage index is more useful to identify damage at legs also the index of connected elements to a de would change therefore in this scenario too imsedm is more precise than msem and imsem to detect damaged elements the high precision of the proposed method is due to the analysis of the effect of damage on axial and bending mse when the damage occurred simultaneously in legs and braces 4 conclusion in this paper the imsedm is proposed which is an improved and robust damage detection method based on the mse index in jacket type offshore platform structures imsedm utilizes mode shapes and frequency data simultaneously which is more accurate than conventional mode shapes based methods the proposed method considers the impact of damage to axial and bending modal strain energy experimental studies with a limited number of sensors in four different damage scenarios on a steel jacket type offshore platform structure were conducted the analytical model is used to achieve all dofs modal information by expansion method the results confirm effectiveness of the method imsedi correctly identified single and multiple damages when the damage locations are near or far from the sensors the proposed index

21264,offshore structures usually are implemented in harsh environmental conditions which make the structures disposed to different failures negligible failures may lead to catastrophic ones to prevent potential catastrophic failure development of robust damage detection methods for offshore structures is necessary damages change structure s dynamic characteristics among different dynamic characteristics modal frequencies and mode shapes are utilized more often due to various problems regarding damage detection methods for offshore structures such as sensor installation and data acquisition in water damage detection methods using limited sensors seems very vital in this paper a novel method called improved modal strain energy decomposition method imsedm is developed to detect structural damage of jacket type offshore platforms using a limited number of sensors just above the water the proposed method has two main contributions the first is simultaneous use of both modal frequencies and mode shapes which make damage detection more accurate the second is decomposition of modal strain energy into axial and bending imsedm locates damaged elements by considering the impacts of the damage on axial and bending modal strain energy the method is evaluated using an experimental jacket type offshore platform the results confirm that imsedm can effectively detect damages with incomplete data keywords damage detection jacket type offshore platform limited data modal properties modal strain energy 1 introduction the damages of steel jacket type offshore platforms are caused by harsh sea environmental conditions during platform service life structural damages change structural dynamic characteristics and usually decrease the structural capacity early detection of damage helps to prevent catastrophic failure of important structures a general classification of damage detection techniques refers to the type of data among numerous structural damage detection techniques the vibration based damage detection techniques have been used widely in structures monitoring the vibration based methods can be classified into two main categories modal and signal analyses the modal analysis methods such as natural frequency based methods mode shape based methods mac comac and mode shape curvature damping based methods and modal strain energy methods msems are based on changes in the structure characteristic after damage the signal analysis based methods such as fourier transform wavelet analysis and hilbert transform are based on changes in measurement signals a typical modal based damage localization method can be divided into two parts the modal identification algorithm to estimate modal properties the damage localization algorithm to diagnose damage using the estimated modal properties regarding the damage localization methods various damage indicators have been proposed the results of a comparative study on modal analysis methods show that modal strain energy mse based methods have good sensitivity to local damages and are proposed as a stable method regarding the noisy signals doebling et al 1996 1998 alvandi and cremona 2006 kim and stubbs 2002 in stubbs et al 1995 a damage sensitive feature utilizing mse is suggested in shi et al 1998 mse before and after damages are calculated to localize the damage in the structure which requires a large number of modes in most of the recently published damage detection methods experimental and theoretical techniques are used to estimate structural damage despite incomplete information and uncertainties in wang and xu 2019 a summary review of mse based damage identification methods has been provided comparative studies based on a numerical and two experimental models were conducted using sdi msed msecr and cmse methods which help implement available mse based damage identification algorithms msem has been developed and combined with different methods in recent years to improve its robustness and accuracy for damage detection when a limited number of sensors should be employed or it is very difficult to measure rotational degrees of freedom dof in complicated structures a method in which the expansion based method has been used to complete limited measured modes has been presented in law et al 1998 in wang et al 2015 an optimal fitting method is used to complete the mode shapes as an interpolation mode expansion technique in shi et al 2000 the sensitivity of elemental mse has been used for local damages by using a sufficient number of modes severity of the damage can be achieved with more stability frequency based methods have various advantages compared to mode shapes such as availability of modal frequencies from only one sensor higher accuracy and robustness however information extracted from only one sensor is not sufficient to detect the local damage the modal frequency is a global structure property therefore changes of frequency due to local damages may not be reflected in it especially for large scale structures such as offshore platforms wang 2013 ciambella and vestroni 2015 in li et al 2016 improved modal strain energy method imsem has been proposed which uses the frequency data for damage detection in jacket type offshore platform structures in li et al 2006 an approach is proposed to identified damaged individual members in 3d frame structures it defines two damage indicators an axial damage indicator and a bending damage indicator for each member modal strain energy decomposition method is used to detect jacket type offshore platforms structural damage liu et al 2017 offshore platforms components are mainly affected by the axial force and bending moment in the modal analysis the master dof of waling and diagonal bracing is axial and the master dof of legs is bending li et al 2006 the decomposition methods separate the participation effect of axial and bending modal strain energy to improve damage detection the other developed methods have been proposed to improve the accuracy of damage detection using the msem without undamaged structure the baseline free approach has been proposed to use the fitted curvatures instead of curvatures from the healthy structure to avoid the need of a baseline modal and to exploit the benefits of the msem baneen and kausar 2018 two stage methods are proposed to reach higher levels of damage detection a mse based index is proposed in seyedpoor 2012 the index is utilized to locate the structural damage and then severity of the damage is determined by a particle swarm optimization modal frequencies and mode shapes derivatives are used as an input of neural network in tan et al 2017 in this paper improved modal strain energy decomposition method imsedm is proposed to detect damages in a jacket type offshore platform using data from a limited number of sensors using modal frequencies and considering the impacts of damage on the axial and bending mse in damaged elements des are two main contributions of the proposed method experimental modal data of scaled fixed base jacket type offshore platform have been expanded using a numerical model in abaqus to consider the difficultly of underwater measurement situations in offshore structures data from two 2 directional sensors that have been placed at the top levels of the experimental jacket type offshore platform is considered the results show the damages can be accurately detected using a limited number of sensors and the first two orders of mode shapes in the following model description and damage scenarios have been described the sensors signals have been processed and expanded the proposed imsedm has been used to detect damage and the results have been compared with two other mse based methods 2 methodology the modal parameters of the structure e g frequencies and mode shapes change with modifications of physical properties liu et al 2018a 2018b so when a structure is damaged the stiffness of the damaged region decreases which is caused to change the modal characteristics of the intact structure kim et al 2019 mse is a function of mode shape and stiffness matrix therefore the experimental mode shapes and frequencies have been needed as mentioned because of the difficulties in offshore structures data acquisition minimizing the number of utilized sensors is vital however a limited number of sensors cause the modal data to be incomplete therefore experimental dofs should be expanded using model expansion methods to match with the full set of dofs of the analytical model in this paper the system equivalent reduction expansion process serep is employed as an expansion process which is proposed in o callahan 1989 after expanding mode shapes by the serep method the proposed imsed index which is based on the mse decomposition method is used for damage localization here frequencies and mode shapes are taken into account simultaneously in the following the expansion method is described then the proposed method and its basics are detailed 2 1 the mode shapes expansion method an expansion method should be utilized to estimate the experimental mode shapes at the deleted dof and complete the unmeasured dof using the finite element model as a high order polynomial curve fitter let s define ϕ a b a f e b m u as mode shape matrix in which various subscripts and superscripts indicate different conditions of the matrix first subscript a shows the analysis type f is for finite element fe and e is for experimental analysis the second subscript b shows that whether the matrix is measured or not by m and u respectively also letter d as the superscript could be used to indicate the damaged structure for example ϕ e is total experimental mode shapes matrix ϕ f m is fe mode shape matrix at measured dofs and ϕ e m d is measured experimental damaged mode shape matrix the serep is a simple fast and efficient expansion technique avitabile 2005 in the proposed method the serep is used to expand experimentally measured mode shapes over all the finite element dofs in other words serep is utilized to calculate ϕ e from ϕ e m and ϕ e d from ϕ e m d using a transformation matrix t t relates ϕ f and ϕ f m as shown in eq 1 t can be calculated using ϕ f and ϕ f m as shown in eq 2 and eq 3 t can be used to expand measured mode shapes in all finite element dofs in undamaged and damaged structure 1 ϕ f t ϕ f m t ϕ f ϕ f m t ϕ f m 1 ϕ f m t 2 ϕ e t ϕ e m 3 ϕ e d t ϕ e m d 2 2 the modal strain energy decomposition method msedm jacket type offshore platforms are mainly made by welding tabular members the members could be affected by an axial force and bending moment in the local coordinate system the stiffness matrix of the jth element can be expressed as eq 4 4 k j e l 3 a l 2 0 0 0 0 0 a l 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 12 i z 0 0 0 6 i z l 0 12 i z 0 0 0 6 i z l 0 0 12 i y 0 6 i y l 0 0 0 12 i y 0 6 i y l 0 0 0 0 g j l 2 e 0 0 0 0 0 g j l 2 e 0 0

modulus a is cross section i z i y and j are moments of inertia g is shear modulus and l is the length of the jth element in eq 4 the first and seventh columns are axial tension compression stiffness k j a the second third eighth and ninth columns are bending stiffness k j t the fourth and tenth columns are torsion stiffness k j t and the fifth sixth eleventh and twelfth columns are rotational stiffness k j r so the stiffness matrix of the jth element can be decomposed into eq 5 5 k j k j a k j t k j t k j r the ith order of axial mse of the jth element before and after the damage is expressed in eq 6 the superscript d denotes damaged states 6 ε i j a ϕ e i t k j a ϕ e i ε i j a ϕ e i d t k j a d ϕ e i d where k j a and k j a d are the undamaged and damaged axial stiffness of the jth element in the global coordinate system ϕ e i and ϕ e i d are the ith order experimental undamaged and damaged mode shapes of the jth element obtained from the expansion method assume the damage is limited to stiffness reduction then k j a and k j a d can be expressed before and after damage as follows 7 k j a e j k j 0 a k j a d e j d k j 0 a where e j and e j d are the undamaged and damaged modulus of elasticity and k j 0 a is a proportional quantity of jth element related to geometric property also the ith order of axial tension compression mse ε i a before and after the damage is 8 ε i a ϕ e i t k a ϕ e i ε i a d ϕ e i d t k a d ϕ e i d where k a and k a d are an axial stiffness matrix of all the elements on undamaged and damaged structures the modal sensitivity is defined as a ratio of mse of each element to the total mse of the structure it is expressed in eq 9 for before and after the damage respectively 9 f i j a ε i j a ε i a f i j a d ε i j a d ε i a d for ith order mode j 1 n e f i j a 1 and j 1 n e f i j a d 1 where ne is the number of elements in large structures the energy share of each element is much lower than the total energy of the structure therefore it can be hypothesized that 10 1 f i j a 1 f i j a d 1 substitute eq 9 in eq 10 then the following equation can be concluded 11 ε i j a d ε i a d ε i j a ε i a ε i a ε i a d 1 all the members of the undamaged structure will have the same modulus of elasticity i e e j e for j 1 2 ne if the material is uniform the axial modal strain energy decomposition index msedi β j a can be defined as a ratio of e j and e j d substitute it into eq 11 for ne modes 12 β j a 1 n i 1 n m ϕ e i d t k j 0 a ϕ e i d ϕ e i d t k 0 a ϕ e i d ϕ e i t k 0 a ϕ e i ϕ e i t k j 0 a ϕ e i ϕ e i t k 0 a ϕ e i ϕ e i d t k 0 a ϕ e i d where k 0 a is a proportional quantity associated with the geometric properties similarly for bending msedi β j t can be shown as eq 13 13 β j t i 1 n m ϕ e i d t k j 0 t ϕ e i d ϕ e i d t k 0 t ϕ e i d ϕ e i t k 0 t ϕ e i i 1 n m ϕ e i t k j 0 t ϕ e i ϕ e i t k 0 t ϕ e i ϕ e i d t k 0 t ϕ e i d 2 3 the proposed improved modal strain energy decomposition imsed method modal frequencies can be identified more precisely than mode shapes this concept is introduced into the modal strain energy index msei in ciambella and vestroni 2015 in this paper modal frequency is integrated into msedi to improve damage detection in the following the proposed method is described mathematically the differential equations of free vibration can be written as eq 14 for a linear undamaged and undamped structure with n e elements and n nodes 14 m x k x 0 where k is global stiffness m is the structure mass matrix x and x denote the acceleration vector and displacement vector respectively the eigenanalysis for undamaged and damaged structures can be written as 15 k ϕ e i ω i 2 m ϕ e i k d ϕ e i d ω i d 2 m d ϕ e i d where ω i is the ith order modal frequency the superscript d denotes damage states generally local damage will cause loss of structural stiffness rather than mass therefore m m d multiplying eq 15 by ϕ e i and ϕ e i t gives 16 ε i ϕ e i t k ϕ e i ω i 2 ϕ e i t m ϕ e i ε i d ϕ e i d t k d ϕ e i d ω i d 2 ϕ e i d t m ϕ e i d when only local damage occurs an approximate relationship ϕ e i d t k d ϕ e i d ϕ e i d t k ϕ e i d exists if the numerator and denominator of eqs 12 and 13 multiplied by e and then eq 16 substituted in eqs 12 and 13 the axial and bending improved modal strain energy decomposition index imsedi β can be approximately written as 17 β j a i 1 n m ϕ e i d t k j a ϕ e i d ω i d 2 ϕ e i d t m a ϕ e i d ω i 2 ϕ e i t m a ϕ e i i 1 n m ϕ e i t k j a ϕ e i ω i 2 ϕ e i t m a ϕ e i ω i d 2 ϕ e i d t m a ϕ e i d 18 β j t i 1 n m ϕ e i d t k j t ϕ e i

of the first several orders of the modal is used to calculate imsedi as following 19 z j a β j a β a σ β a z j t β j t β t σ β t if the values of z j a and z j t are more than a threshold the des could be recognized therefore des can be detected using eq 19 damage threshold t is proportional to the variance distribution of imsedis that can be calculated as eq 20 20 t σ 2 ln i where i is the total number of data points janeliukstis et al 2017 although the element with imsedi higher than the threshold should be considered as de however an undamaged element which is positioned near a de might have imsedi higher than the threshold too this means that in some situations a simple comparison with the threshold is not enough to detect the de the impact of the damage on the axial and bending mse at each suspicious element should be considered to ensure a correct damage detection 3 damage detection 3 1 case study the proposed method has been verified using the results of an experimental study on k n toosi benchmark platform which is a scaled model of a newly installed jacket type offshore platform in the persian gulf the geometric scale is 1 15 this jacket has six legged horizontal and vertical braces which are steel welded and three level deck a numerical model has been created using abaqus software the legs diameter and thickness are 48 mm and 3 mm the external horizontal and vertical braces diameter and thickness are 34 mm and 3 mm and internal horizontal brace diameter and thickness are 27 2 mm and 3 mm intersectional beams with box section 60 40 3 mm are used in the deck to simulate rigid diaphragm action and deck mass a plate with 15 mm thickness is welded to deck beam the thickness of the legs is increased up to 5 mm to consider joint cans in the jacket eight skirt sleeves are connected to legs 88 9 mm diameter and 5 mm thickness the experimental results of the hinged base condition have been used in this study two 2 directional accelerometers in the upper level of the jacket have been used to measure and record dynamic responses accelerations have been recorded by two 2 directional accelerometers in the upper level of the jacket to convert analog to digital and prevent the occurrence of frequency reflection assuming a sampling rate of 100 hz during the experiment a six orders butterworth filter with cutoff frequency 50 hz was used more details are presented in asgarian et al 2012 2016 see fig 1 3 2 simulation scenarios four damage scenarios have been studied each scenario is performed to evaluate the proposed method when different damages occurred the modal frequencies of the undamaged and damaged structure are given in table 1 elements numbers and the sensors locations have been shown in fig 2 3 it should be mentioned that low order modes can be measured practically 3 3 damage detection results the acceleration is measured in the time domain in each location using signal processing the modal characteristics of the experimental model such as natural frequencies and mode shapes are estimated two mode shapes in y direction of the undamaged structure have been compared in fig 4 the mode expansion diagram shows the expanded mode shape which is achieved by expanding data of two 2 directional sensors in two upper levels of the jacket the experimental diagram shows the mode shape of reference asgarian et al 2012 which is achieved using additional sensors in the undamaged structure as shown in fig 4 the mode expansion diagram is more adjusted to the experimental diagram because dofs are located near sensors in the upper level also the modal data has been extracted from the modal analysis results of the numerical model in abaqus under various damage scenarios after expanding mode shapes by eqs 2 and 3 matlab program has been used to calculate the imsed by eq 19 the results have been compared with imsei li et al 2016 and msei shi et al 1998 finally damage locations are detected 3 3 1 damage scenario 1 in scenario 1 the damage was suffered by a leg at element 77 this scenario is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in case of single damage to the structure the first two modes in the y direction have been used for damage detection that the frequency reduction of the first mode is 0 4 and the second mode is 0 05 figs 5 8 show the results of msei imsei and imsedi for each element respectively according to figs 5 and 6 in the msem and imsem there are some elements indices which are higher than the damage threshold line therefore they are probably damaged the column 77 which has a higher indicator can be detected as a de but it cannot be proved certainly according to figs 7 and 8 in imsedm column 77 has a high bending msei several connected elements like 277 278 349 and 350 have changed in their axial and bending mseis since in this method the impact of damage in axial and bending mse are decomposed column 77 with higher bending damage indicator can be proved as a de therefore imsedm is more precise for detecting the single damage scenario 3 3 2 damage scenario 2 in scenario 2 the diameter of braces 201 202 229 230 325 326 353 and 354 have been reduced from 34 mm to 27 6 mm this scenario is performed to show the robustness of imsedi in case of multiple damages to the structure in which the damages are located near the sensors the first two modes in x and y direction have been used for damage detection with 1 9 and 0 18 frequency loss at the first two modes in the x direction and 2 1 and 0 15 frequency loss at the first two modes in the y direction figs 9 12 show the results of msem imsem and imsedm for each element respectively in this multiple damages scenario msem and imsem have the same precision according to figs 9 and 10 in the mse and imsem braces 201 202 229 230 325 326 353 and 354 which have higher indices than the damage threshold can be introduced as des in imsedm as shown in figs 11 and 12 members 201 202 229 230 325 326 353 and 354 have higher axial and bending indicators several elements such as columns 13 45 63 and 95 connected to des can be recognized according to the geometric relation of elements and relationship between change rates of axial and bending mses some connected elements such as 26 76 204 231 324 with high bending mse are unknown as des because of their small axial mseis these elements are proof of damage of braces 201 202 229 230 325 326 353 and 354 therefore imsedm is more helpful for damage detection when damage locations are near the location of the sensors 3 3 3 damage scenario 3 in this scenario the damage was suffered at elements 311 313 314 339 341 and 342 in comparison with scenario 2 this scenario is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of imsedi in case of multiple damages in which damages have occurred far from sensors figs 13 16 show damage detection results of msem imsem and imsedm for each element the first two modes in the x direction are approximately without frequency loss and the first two modes in the y direction are 25 and 55 frequency losses according to figs 13 and 14 in this multiple damages scenario in msem and imsem the indices of braces 311 314 339 and 342 are higher than the threshold therefore they are detected as des but the msem can t detect braces 313 and 341 also their indices are lower than the threshold in imsem therefore they can t be identified using msem and imsem in imsedm as mentioned the axial mse impact is more helpful to identify damage at braces as shown in figs 15 and 16 braces 311 314 339 and 342 are introduced as des because of higher axial damage indicator than the threshold and changes in their bending indices although the braces 313 and 341 do not reach the threshold in imsed these braces have a higher index in comparison with the msem and imsem furthermore their connected elements with high bending mseis such as 11 23 43 61 73 93 have small axial msei then they cannot be detected as des but the position relations of elements and the relationships between change rates of two modal strain energies prove that there are damages on braces 311 313 314 339 341 and 342 compared to the two other methods imsedm is more precise when damage locations are far from the location of the sensors the detection error is due to the distance between the utilized sensors and the braces 313 and 341 3 3 4 damage scenario 4 in scenario 4 the damage was suffered by braces 201 202 229 230 325 326 353 354 and columns 13 27 45 63 77 95 resulting in 2 84 and 2 37 frequency losses at the first two modes in the x direction 2 7 frequency loss at first mode and 2 3 frequency gain at the second mode in the y direction this scenario is performed to show the decomposition effect of imsed when at least one leg and one brace are damaged damage detection results of msem imsem and imsedm are shown in figs 17 20 for each element in this multiple damages scenario elements with higher change rates of both axial and bending mse must be examined carefully according to figs 17 and 18 in msem and imsem elements with indices higher than the threshold can be detected as des however there may be some errors in msem and imsem detections in this scenario according to figs 19 and 20 in imsedm braces 201 202 229 230 325 326 353 and 354 have higher axial indices than threshold and change in their bending indices columns 13 27 45 63 77 and 95 have high bending indices and their axial indices change the axial damage index is more helpful to identify damage occurring at braces and the bending damage index is more useful to identify damage at legs also the index of connected elements to a de would change therefore in this scenario too imsedm is more precise than msem and imsem to detect damaged elements the high precision of the proposed method is due to the analysis of the effect of damage on axial and bending mse when the damage occurred simultaneously in legs and braces 4 conclusion in this paper the imsedm is proposed which is an improved and robust damage detection method based on the mse index in jacket type offshore platform structures imsedm utilizes mode shapes and frequency data simultaneously which is more accurate than conventional mode shapes based methods the proposed method considers the impact of damage to axial and bending modal strain energy experimental studies with a limited number of sensors in four different damage scenarios on a steel jacket type offshore platform structure were conducted the analytical model is used to achieve all dofs modal information by expansion method the results confirm effectiveness of the method imsedi correctly identified single and multiple damages when the damage locations are near or far from the sensors the proposed index significantly outperformed imsem and traditional msem credit authorship contribution statement azita khosravan conceptualization methodology writing original draft preparation writing review editing
