16975,accumulibacter is a well known group of organisms typically considered to be polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos but potentially capable of glycogen accumulating organism gao metabolism under limiting influent phosphate levels metabolic features of accumulibacter are typically linked to its phylogenetic identity at the type or clade level though it is unclear the extent to which accumulibacter diversity can correlate with its capacity to perform p removal this paper investigates the fine scale diversity of accumulibacter and its link with enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr performance under various operating conditions to understand the conditions and community structure leading to successful and unsuccessful ebpr operation for this purpose the organic carbon feeding rate and total organic carbon concentration were varied during three distinct operational periods where influent phosphate was never limiting accumulibacter was always the dominant microbial group 80 of all bacteria according to quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridisation fish and low levels of competibacter and other gaos were consistently observed 15 of all bacteria steady state was achieved in each of the three periods with average phosphorus removal levels of 36 99 and 99 respectively experimentally determined stoichiometric activity supported the expression of a mixed pao gao metabolism in the first steady state period and the typical pao metabolism in the other two steady state periods fish quantification and amplicon sequencing of the polyphosphate kinase ppk1 functional gene indicated that accumulibacter clade iic was selected in the first steady state period which shifted to clade ia after decreasing the carbon feeding rate in steady state period 2 and finally shifted back to clade iic in the third steady state period fine resolution ppk based phylogenetic analysis revealed three different clusters within accumulibacter clade iic where clusters iicii and iiciii were linked to poor ebpr performance in period 1 and cluster iici was linked to good ebpr performance in period 3 this study shows that the deterioration of ebpr processes through gao activity at non limiting p concentrations can be linked to organisms that are typically classified as paos not only to known gaos such as competibacter intra clade phylogenetic diversity within accumulibacter showed that some clusters actually behave similarly to gaos even without influent phosphate limitation this study highlights the need to closely re examine traditional interpretations regarding the link between the microbial community composition and identity with the performance and metabolism of ebpr systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis intra clade diversity pao metabolism gao metabolism 1 introduction phosphorus p is both a pollutant in aquatic ecosystems and an indispensable nutrient and resource in agriculture enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr processes are commonly implemented due to the potentially high p removal efficiencies that can be achieved through a chemical free approach promoting economic and environmental sustainability and can be advantageous when implementing complimentary p recovery processes ebpr relies on polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos that can take up and store excess amounts of p as polyphosphate transferring it from the liquid phase to the biomass achieving p removal requirements and simultaneously creating a valuable p rich sludge suitable for p recovery wang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 ebpr is achieved by alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions where pao organisms such as accumulibacter take up organic carbon sources such as volatile fatty acids vfas anaerobically and store them as poly β hydroxyalkanoates phas obtaining energy from polyphosphate cleavage and phosphate release from cells glycolysis of their stored glycogen provides additional energy and a reducing power source for pha synthesis aerobic pha oxidation serves as the carbon and energy source for biomass growth p uptake polyphosphate storage and glycogen regeneration oehmen et al 2007 zhou et al 2008 glycogen accumulating organisms gaos are the competitors of paos as they can also uptake vfas in anaerobic conditions but do not perform p uptake thus do not contribute to p removal oehmen et al 2007 many studies have focused on investigating the competition between these two organisms establishing conditions for enrichment of paos and inhibition of gaos by applying various carbon sources feeding rates ph dissolved oxygen and temperature conditions carvalheira et al 2014a 2014b 2014c lopez vazquez et al 2009 tu and schuler 2013 for example tu and schuler 2013 investigated the competition of paos and gaos with different feeding rates showing that higher acetate feeding rates can enrich gaos over paos and thus lead to the deterioration of ebpr systems accumulibacter is a well known pao that consists of two distinct types type i and type ii based on the analysis of the 16s rrna gene and the ppk1 gene he et al 2007 within these two types several clades were identified ia i e and iia ii i reflecting fine differences in the genetic sequence of the ppk1 gene camejo et al 2016 these differences in the specific phylogenetic identity of accumulibacter have been correlated with differences in its metabolic expression initially carvalho et al 2007 have detected different cell morphotypes of accumulibacter where rod morphotypes were able to use nitrate as the electron acceptor while cocci were not oehmen et al 2010 later found that the rod morphotype in that study corresponded to accumulibacter type i and the cocci to accumulibacter type ii flowers et al 2009 achieved a similar conclusion for paos belonging to clades ia and iia respectively more recently camejo et al 2019 and rubio rincón et al 2019 investigated the differences in denitrification pathways between the same accumulibacter clade both studies investigated accumulibacter clade ic but intra clade diversity analysis showed that the ic selected in the study of camejo et al 2019 was capable of performing the full pathway for respiratory denitrification ca accumulibacter uw ldo ic while rubio rincón et al 2019 enriched a culture of ca accumulibacter delftensis ic which was not capable of using nitrate as the electron acceptor these studies prove that phylogenetic diversity at the sub clade level can influence accumulibacter metabolism one metabolic aspect of high importance impacting p removal performance in ebpr systems is the capacity of accumulibacter to perform both pao and gao like metabolism the deterioration of p removal has been observed even in enriched accumulibacter pao systems where zhou et al 2008 found that accumulibacter were able to use glycolysis as a main source of energy in limited p conditions acevedo et al 2012 observed a correlation between accumulibacter type and the level of polyphosphate storage leading to pao type i or gao type ii metabolism by accumulibacter when shifted to p limiting conditions the study of welles et al 2015 concluded that when phosphate was not limiting pao type i performed typical pao metabolism while pao type ii performed mixed pao and gao metabolism however under phosphate limitation both types shifted to a gao like metabolism with a strong competitive advantage of type ii over type i welles et al 2017 later showed that accumulibacter clade iic displayed differing pao and gao like behaviour depending on the availability of the influent p concentration while the metabolic flexibility of accumulibacter is dependant on the clade and environmental conditions guedes da silva et al 2020 it is unclear if a clade level description of accumulibacter is sufficient to establish the pao vs gao metabolic capacity of accumulibacter in addition previous studies have not investigated if some accumulibacter sub lineages perform gao like metabolism even when influent p levels are not limiting this study focuses on investigating the metabolism of different accumulibacter lineages and their impact on ebpr performance an accumulibacter bioreactor was subjected to various conditions in long term tests that are typically conducive to different ecological profiles the carbon feeding strategy feeding rate and loading was manipulated while non limiting influent phosphorus levels were maintained the feeding strategy represents one of the operating parameters that are known to affect the dominant species of a microbial community a high or low abundance of resources such as organic carbon impacts the microbial profile by enriching for organisms that are either r or k strategists respectively therefore we operated an ebpr reactor with different feeding strategies to select for different pao cultures the metabolism was studied along with a fine scale microbial community analysis of the accumulibacter sludge at the sub clade level to identify the link between phylogenetic identity and metabolic function three different feeding conditions were investigated for selecting the accumulibacter reactors where ebpr performance was compared at different organic carbon feeding rates and concentration levels this study provides needed clarity on factors leading to ebpr failure and upsets through better understanding of how accumulibacter performance varies as a function of the specific clade and sub clade within this diverse and important microbial group of organisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 sequencing batch reactor sbr operation a two litre reactor was inoculated with sludge from a municipal wwtp beirolas in lisbon portugal and a gradual cod increase from 50 mgcod l to 200 mgcod l was initially applied in the start up phase in order to select for paos the reactor was operated in sequencing batch mode with 4 cycles per day the six hour cycle was comprised of a 2 h anaerobic phase 3 h aerobic phase and a 1 h settling decant phase without stirring to achieve anaerobic and aerobic conditions argon and air were continuously bubbled respectively temperature was controlled with a water bath at 20 c and ph was controlled between 7 and 7 5 with automatic addition of hcl or naoh the sludge retention time srt was 10 days and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h 2 2 feed composition the 1 l feed medium was a mixture of two solutions fed separately a phosphate and b carbon and nutrient solutions the phosphate feeding rate and concentration was constant throughout the entire period of reactor operation feeding took place at the beginning of the anaerobic phase for 5 min with a total volume of 750 ml the solution a contained 124 mg of k2hpo4 and 96 8 mg of kh2po4 per litre the carbon source was a mixture of acetate hac and propionate hpr at a proportion of 75 25 on a cod basis respectively as was suggested to be beneficial for paos to outcompete gaos carvalheira et al 2014b lopez vazquez et al 2009 the composition of solution b consisted of cod ammonium and micronutrients as detailed in carvalheira et al 2014a where 250 ml was added per cycle 2 3 operation of the sbr in the three steady state periods as previously mentioned the phosphate feeding rate and concentration was maintained constant throughout the study during the first steady state period of reactor operation cod was fed over 5 min after phosphate feeding fast mode while afterwards in steady state periods 2 and 3 it was switched to 50 min slow mode the period of stabilization after changing the cod feeding rate is referred to as the transition phase after achieving steady state in each of the three operation periods reactor performance and the fine scale pao community were investigated 2 3 1 steady state period 1 fast cod feeding rate 200 mgcod l in period 1 a fast cod feeding rate strategy was employed at a rate of 40 mg cod l min to achieve 200 mgcod l in the reactor these conditions were operated in steady state for 30 days 2 3 2 steady state period 2 slow cod feeding rate 200 mgcod l in period 2 the reactor was fed with a slow cod feeding rate strategy of 4 mgcod l min to achieve 200 mgcod l in the reactor the steady state of period 2 lasted for 100 days 2 3 3 steady state period 3 slow cod feeding rate 150 mgcod l after a shutdown start up period the reactor was re seeded using sludge from period 2 and a gradual increase of cod concentration was applied during this start up phase until reaching 150 mgcod l at steady state in this period the reactor was also fed with a slow cod feeding rate strategy 3 mgcod l min and steady state was achieved for 150 days 2 4 sampling and chemical analysis routine monitoring of the reactor was performed once per week where total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss phosphate po4 p ammonium glycogen gly polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and volatile fatty acids vfa were analysed samples were collected along the anaerobic and aerobic phases except tss and vss which were measured at the end of the aerobic phase samples were centrifuged for 3 min at 10 000 rpm following separation of the solid and liquid phases with 0 45 µm filters p ammonium and vfas were analysed on the liquid phase while pha and glycogen were analysed on lyophilized biomass pellets p and ammonium analysis were performed with segmented flow analysis skalar 5100 skalar analytical the netherlands

gc fid detector and a restek column 60 m 0 53 mm internal diameter 1 mm df crossbond glycogen samples were prepared using acid digestion of lyophilized biomass at 0 9 m hcl for 3 h and the supernatant was analysed by hplc as described in carvalho et al 2018 biomass samples were also collected at the end of the anaerobic phase for microbiological characterisation of the community as described below 2 5 calculation of the kinetic and stoichiometric parameters stoichiometric and kinetic parameters presented in the results section were calculated via the equations presented below p removal was determined by difference between the phosphorus concentration in the beginning pstart anaerobic of the anaerobic phase mgp l after p feeding and the end of the aerobic phase pend aerobic divided by

biomass samples from the three different steady state periods were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde pfa or ethanol as described by nielsen 2009 quantitative fish qfish was performed according to amann 1995 to analyse the microbial composition and abundance of the bacterial populations present in the sbr specific fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes were applied to the biomass to allow the visualization of the microbial consortia cyanine 5 cy5 labelled eubmix probe that targets all bacteria mixture of eub338 amann et al 1990 eub338 ii and eub338 iii daims et al 1999 was applied together with the cyanine 3 labelled probes acc i 444 and acc ii 444 flowers et al 2009 to target candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis types i and ii respectively and with the cy3 labelled cpb 654 probe for candidatus competibater phosphatis mcilroy et al 2015 other oligonucleotide probes and hybridisation details are described in probebase greuter et al 2016 hybridised samples were observed using a zeisss lsm 710 meta confocal laser scanning microscope clsm with a magnification of 400x using an argon laser 488 nm helium laser 543 nm and a red diode laser 637 nm daime software daims et al 2006 was used to analyse 20 photos that were taken in several regions of the wells containing the biomass samples the ratio between the area of the accumulibacter or competibacter population over the cy5 labelled eubmix population yields the biovolume of each organism the standard error of the mean sem is calculated as the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of images 2 6 2 ppk gene clone library construction and phylogenetic analysis for this study there was a need to accurately classify the three communities obtained in this work to the sub clade level of accumulibacter accumulibacter types clades clusters are all very close phylogenetically requiring near complete and highly accurate gene sequence analysis to detect these subtle differences sanger sequencing is the gold standard for this purpose generating long up to 1000 bp and highly accurate 99 9 sequence reads however sanger is ineffective at sequencing cultures comprised of many different unknown organisms cloning is a reliable technique to separate amplicons from diverse organisms prior to sanger and was thus employed in this work prior to sanger sequencing biomass samples were taken during the three steady state periods of the process and centrifuged for 3 min at 10 000 rpm pellets were stored at 20 c until dna extraction genomic dna gdna was extracted using the dneasy ultraclean microbial kit qiagen germany and quantified with a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific rockford il the quality and integrity of the extracted gdna was assessed in 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the gdna was stored at 20 c until processing polymerase chain reaction pcr was done to amplify the polyphosphate kinase 1 gene ppk1 using the general primers acc ppk1 254f tcaccaccgacggcaagac and acc ppk1 1376r acgatcatcagcatcttggc mcmahon et al 2007 the pcr mixture was achieved using the nzytaq ii 2x green master mix nzytech portugal containing dntps 2 5 mm of mgcl2 and 2 5 u of nzytaq ii dna polymerase to which were added 400 nm of each forward and reverse primer 100 ng of template gdna and nuclease free water to a final volume of 25 μl negative controls were made with nuclease free water and no template the pcr cycling program started with an initial denaturation step for 10 min at 95 c followed by 30 cycles of denaturation step at 95 c for 30 s annealing of the primers at 68 c for 1 min and extension of the dna at 72 c for 2 min in the end of the cycle a final extension of 12 min at 72 c was performed the dna fragments were then purified using the nzygelpure kit nzytech portugal where the correct bands were confirmed through agarose gel electrophoresis and amplicons were quantified using a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific rockford il the targeted ppk1 fragments were cloned in a pgem t vector using the pgem t easy vector systems kit following the manufacturer s instructions promega usa using t4 dna ligase ligations were performed considering 55 ng of insert and 50 ng of vector to a final insert vector molar ratio of 3 1 reactions were incubated overnight at 4 c and transformations of e coli jm109 cells were made by heat shock of the cells for 50 s at 42 c followed by 2 min on ice transformation cultures were plated in lb medium supplemented with iptg 100 mm x gal 50 mg ml and ampicillin to a final concentration of 100 μg ml for each reactor operation period 50 white colonies were selected and isolated screening of the clones with the correct insert was performed and pcr products were sanger sequenced by stabvida portugal bidirectional fasta sequences were processed using geneious prime software v2019 1 consensus sequences were obtained after denovo assembly of the forward and reverse sequences multiple sequence alignment msa was done using the muscle algorithm and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbour joining method with 1000 bootstraps both included in the geneious package msa was trimmed up to 866 bp using orf opean reading frame finder to search for the orfs within the query sequences chimeric sequences were identified and removed using bellerophon huber et al 2004 and blast was used as the database for the phylogenetic classification of the clones based on a pairwise identity of 97 the nucleotide sequences were deposited in the genbank ncbi database with the accession numbers mw034869 mw034998 3 results 3 1 reactor performance the sbr was seeded with wwtp sludge and operated 300 days using conditions previously proposed as ideal to enrich for paos carvalheira et al 2014b after inoculation a gradual increase of the cod concentration was applied until reaching 200 mgcod l leading to an increase in anaerobic p release and aerobic p uptake as a response to each cod change however the overall p removal efficiency in the start up period was lower than 40 3 1 1 steady state period 1 poor ebpr performance was maintained for more than 3 srts after the start up period where 200 mgcod l of vfa were added in the reactor each cycle fig 1 shows the anaerobic p vfa ratio and aerobic p removal with p removal remaining low 40 the experimentally determined stoichiometry for all steady state periods is summarized in table 1 while cycle profiles in the anaerobic and aerobic phase are presented in fig 2 although vfas were consumed in the anaerobic phase the average p vfa ratio was consistently low 0 29 p mol c mol as compared to values usually reported in literature for enriched pao reactors with similar carbon sources 0 40 p mol c mol glycogen hydrolysis vfa uptake ratio gly vfa was 0 79 c mol c mol supporting the expression of gao metabolism by the culture carvalheira et al 2014a the pha production vfa uptake ratio was 1 85 c mol c mol with 0 84 and 0 99 c mol c mol of phb vfa and phv vfa respectively enriched pao systems fed with a similar fraction of acetate and propionate produce less total pha with a lower phv fraction carvalheira et al 2014a where the higher phv and overall pha production can be linked to gao metabolism table 2 shows the anaerobic p release and p uptake rates which were 25 03 and 21 22 mgp gx h respectively where the p concentration in the effluent was 16 03 2 78 mgp l clearly confirming the poor p removal 3 1 2 steady state period 2 after steady state period 1 the carbon feeding rate was decreased 10 times from 40 to 4 mgcod l min but with the same final concentration of cod in the reactor 200 mgcod l immediately after changing the feeding rate a big increase of p removal was observed until reaching 99 p removal p effluent concentration of 0 21 0 41 mgp l the anaerobic p vfa ratio doubled with an average of 0 58 p mol c mol supporting a shift towards pao metabolism vfas were consumed along the extended period of cod addition and the anaerobic gly vfa ratio decreased to 0 51 c mol c mol indicating a decrease in glycogen use as an energy source and consistent with pao metabolism the anaerobic pha vfa ratio also decreased to 1 56 c mol c mol from which phb vfa was 0 94 and phv vfa significantly decreased to 0 58 c mol c mol further supporting a shift from gao to pao metabolism p uptake took place mostly in the first hour of the aerobic phase fig 2b the p release and uptake rates were considerably higher in this period table 2 at 51 46 and 55 63 mgp gx h respectively as compared to period 1 each of these indicators confirm a shift in metabolic activity towards pao metabolism where good ebpr performance was achieved 3 1 3 steady state period 3 in steady state period 3 no p was detected in the effluent so 99 of p removal was achieved with 150 mgcod l and a feeding rate of 3 mgcod l min the slow feeding rate strategy led to stable p removal performance even at this lower cod level the vfas were consumed immediately where no accumulation of vfa was detected and the anaerobic p vfa ratio was similar to steady state period 2 at 0 51 p mol c mol as was the gly vfa ratio 0 46 c mol c mol the anaerobic pha vfa ratio was 1 54 c mol c mol with similar phb vfa and phv vfa ratios of 0 88 and 0 59 c mol c mol respectively compared to steady state period 2 the anaerobic p release rate decreased to 48 48 mgp gx h due to the lower carbon concentration fed to the reactor but the p uptake rate was kept at an average 55 57 mgp gx h for more than 15 srts of stable reactor operation overall good p removal performance with the typical pao metabolism was maintained in steady state period 3 fig 2c 3 2 microbial community 3 2 1 overall pao and gao community analysis qualitative fish analyses were performed throughout the reactor operation to follow the microbiological community changes see si and quantitative fish was performed in the three steady state periods to quantify the microbial groups most relevant for ebpr i e paos and gaos fig 3 shows quantitative fish results for accumulibacter types i and ii which is the finest level classification possible based on the 16s sequence and for competibacter in steady state period 1 accumulibacter type ii was dominant representing 86 9 of total bacterial biovolume while accumulibacter type i had a very low abundance of 2 3 competibacter gaos were present 13 5 but in lower abundance as compared to the total accumulibacter population after changing the carbon feeding rate from fast to slow there was a shift in the accumulibacter composition where type i increased to 78 and type ii almost completely disappeared 0 1 in this period a small decrease in competibacter was also observed 7 4 a shift in the accumulibacter composition occurred again in steady state period 3 type i decreased to 10 1 and type ii proliferated to 84 5 similarly to steady state period 1 the competibacter abundance was lowest in this period at 2 0 other gaos including defluviicoccus and propionivibrio were never found at levels 1 of all bacteria in any of the steady state periods 3 2 2 fine scale pao community analysis regarding the limited capacity of differentiation of 16s based fish probes we investigated the sequence of the gene encoding for the polyphosphate kinase ppk1 in order to further investigate the clade composition of accumulibacter on a finer level the phylogenetic tree topology fig 4 supports the fish quantification results showing the dominance of accumulibacter type ii in steady state periods 1 and 3 while type i was dominant in steady state period 2 the phylogenetic output of the neighbour joining tree groups the sequences according to their similarity which leads to a robust differentiation of several clusters namely one cluster within type i and four clusters within type ii the type i cluster belongs to clade ia whereas members of clade iia and iic were detected from type ii the sequences for clade iia are all grouped in the same cluster and the sequences of clade iic are further sub divided into three clusters or sub clades iici iicii and iiciii steady state period 1 was composed of members of clade iia and members of clade iic clusters ii and iii steady state period 2 shifted to clade ia while finally in steady state period 3 the community shifted again towards clade iic but in this case was mostly composed of members of cluster iici 4 discussion 4 1 the link between reactor performance and microbial community profile the mixture of acetate and propionate as carbon substrate as well as the relatively low cod p ratio should promote the proliferation of paos and good ebpr performance carvalheira et al 2014b lu et al 2006 oehmen et al 2007 carvalheira et al 2014a 2014b 2014c used similar conditions in their studies as conditions applied in this study period 1 and achieved 95 of p removal with high accumulibacter and low competibacter abundance 71 85 and 17 21 respectively however in this study p removal was low throughout steady state period 1 fig 1 even with a similarly high enrichment of accumulibacter 85 fig 3 and lower competibacter abundance as compared to carvalheira et al 2014a 2014b 2014c the carbon substrate was fully consumed but low stoichiometric p vfa and high gly vfa ratios suggested that glycogen was an important source of energy for acetate and propionate uptake the gly vfa and pha vfa ratios were similar to those reported in the study of carvalheira et al 2014a for a gao dominated sbr strongly suggesting the expression of a mixed pao gao metabolism in steady state period 1 furthermore the composition of phas produced in the anaerobic phase also indicate gao metabolism with a high fraction of phv and high total pha vfa ratio zhou et al 2008 while competibacter was present in the sbr in period 1 its relatively low abundance should not have negatively impacted the p removal performance the acetate uptake rates for accumulibacter and competibacter are very similar while propionate uptake rate is significantly higher for accumulibacter lopez vazquez et al 2009 indicating that even with some vfa consumption by competibacter present in lower abundance 13 5 most of the vfas 85 or approximately 170 mgcod l were consumed by accumulibacter indeed in period 3 where only 150 mgcod l was fed to the sbr complete p removal was still achieved supporting the fact that the vfa level in the feed during period 1 should have been sufficient to achieve a low p concentration in the effluent thus the accumulibacter population observed during period 1 displayed ineffective p removal capacity the carbon feeding rate was previously shown to influence the pao gao competition where accumulibacter displayed a competitive advantage over defluviicoccus gaos with a slow carbon feeding strategy tu and schuler 2013 their study suggested that gaos correspond to r strategists while paos correspond to k strategists in this study the decreased carbon feeding rate in steady state period 2 immediately caused an improvement in ebpr performance though without a corresponding shift in the pao vs gao global abundances instead the accumulibacter population shifted from clade iic to clade ia during these periods moreover in steady state period 3 the p removal performance and characteristic pao metabolism was maintained by the sbr despite the lower organic carbon source addition and a further shift in the accumulibacter population from clade ia back to clade iic this result prompted further phylogenetic characterization of the bacterial community which indicated three distinct clade iic clusters i ii and iii fig 4 with a fast carbon feeding rate strategy clade iia and iic clusters ii and iii were present inside the bioreactor which exhibited a mixed pao gao metabolism it should be noted that clade iic has been previously shown to be capable of expressing gao metabolism under p limiting conditions welles et al 2017 suggesting that the poor ebpr performance in this period could be attributed to the high abundance of the clade iic clusters in steady state period 3 the phylogenetically distant cluster i from clade iic was detected in contrast to clusters ii and iii from clade iic in period 1 that exhibited gao metabolism this cluster was linked with good ebpr performance and the typical pao metabolism thus it is clear that metabolic differences exhibiting a high impact on ebpr performance can be linked within the previously identified accumulibacter clades highlighting that knowledge of intra clade diversity is just as important as inter clade diversity for this key group of organisms furthermore this study also shows that the characteristic gao metabolism can also be employed by some members of the accumulibacter even when the influent p concentration is not limiting implying that accumulibacter clade iic clusters ii and iii are effectively gaos and are undesirable organisms in ebpr plants 4 2 accumulibacter diversity and its link with metabolism over the past 10 years ebpr studies have more frequently linked the process performance with not only the abundance of the total accumulibacter group or other groups of paos or gaos but also the dominant type or clade of these organisms table 3 provides an overview of the results of literature studies in this regard for accumulibacter focussing on metabolic aspects including denitrification capacity pao or gao metabolic shifts as well as the toxicity of nitrite and free nitrous acid fna several inconsistencies can be found in studies examining links between metabolism and type i and type ii accumulibacter but other studies have also noted inconsistencies even at the clade level rubio rincón et al 2019 selected accumulibacter clade ic which was not able to perform anoxic p removal using nitrate but the study of camejo et al 2019 showed that anoxic p uptake did proceed with nitrate for accumulibacter clade ic thus in addition to this study whereby clusters within accumulibacter clade iic led to distinct pao or gao metabolism intra clade diversity can also lead to other important metabolic differences within ebpr systems the present study emphasizes the complexity of ebpr microbial ecology where poor ebpr performance cannot be solely attributed to gaos but also to intra clade phylogenetic diversity within accumulibacter a group of organisms that is typically regarded as a pao while accumulibacter is known to be capable of gao metabolism under p limiting conditions the fact that there s differences at the sub clade level that impacts performance even when p is not limiting suggests for the first time that some accumulibacter are effectively gaos indeed accumulibacter should be considered as a diverse group of organisms rather than a single organism with a unique phenotype this has a significant impact on future research in ebpr whereby such a consideration is not always implied during studies investigating the link between the microbial community composition its metabolism and the ebpr process performance 5 conclusions this study shows that intra clade diversity within accumulibacter can influence the ebpr performance and lead to poor p removal even without limiting levels of p in the wastewater influent thus some members of the accumulibacter a group of organisms widely recognised as important paos effectively behave like gaos in ebpr systems future studies should focus on the link between ebpr performance and finer scale characterisation of the accumulibacter group since recharacterization of the accumulibacter group beyond the clade level may be necessary to understand the link between intra clade diversities of accumulibacter and ebpr performance gao like activity should not be linked solely to competibacter and other gaos but also specific clades of organisms currently recognised as paos declaration of competing interest none

16975,accumulibacter is a well known group of organisms typically considered to be polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos but potentially capable of glycogen accumulating organism gao metabolism under limiting influent phosphate levels metabolic features of accumulibacter are typically linked to its phylogenetic identity at the type or clade level though it is unclear the extent to which accumulibacter diversity can correlate with its capacity to perform p removal this paper investigates the fine scale diversity of accumulibacter and its link with enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr performance under various operating conditions to understand the conditions and community structure leading to successful and unsuccessful ebpr operation for this purpose the organic carbon feeding rate and total organic carbon concentration were varied during three distinct operational periods where influent phosphate was never limiting accumulibacter was always the dominant microbial group 80 of all bacteria according to quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridisation fish and low levels of competibacter and other gaos were consistently observed 15 of all bacteria steady state was achieved in each of the three periods with average phosphorus removal levels of 36 99 and 99 respectively experimentally determined stoichiometric activity supported the expression of a mixed pao gao metabolism in the first steady state period and the typical pao metabolism in the other two steady state periods fish quantification and amplicon sequencing of the polyphosphate kinase ppk1 functional gene indicated that accumulibacter clade iic was selected in the first steady state period which shifted to clade ia after decreasing the carbon feeding rate in steady state period 2 and finally shifted back to clade iic in the third steady state period fine resolution ppk based phylogenetic analysis revealed three different clusters within accumulibacter clade iic where clusters iicii and iiciii were linked to poor ebpr performance in period 1 and cluster iici was linked to good ebpr performance in period 3 this study shows that the deterioration of ebpr processes through gao activity at non limiting p concentrations can be linked to organisms that are typically classified as paos not only to known gaos such as competibacter intra clade phylogenetic diversity within accumulibacter showed that some clusters actually behave similarly to gaos even without influent phosphate limitation this study highlights the need to closely re examine traditional interpretations regarding the link between the microbial community composition and identity with the performance and metabolism of ebpr systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis intra clade diversity pao metabolism gao metabolism 1 introduction phosphorus p is both a pollutant in aquatic ecosystems and an indispensable nutrient and resource in agriculture enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr processes are commonly implemented due to the potentially high p removal efficiencies that can be achieved through a chemical free approach promoting economic and environmental sustainability and can be advantageous when implementing complimentary p recovery processes ebpr relies on polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos that can take up and store excess amounts of p as polyphosphate transferring it from the liquid phase to the biomass achieving p removal requirements and simultaneously creating a valuable p rich sludge suitable for p recovery wang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 ebpr is achieved by alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions where pao organisms such as accumulibacter take up organic carbon sources such as volatile fatty acids vfas anaerobically and store them as poly β hydroxyalkanoates phas obtaining energy from polyphosphate cleavage and phosphate release from cells glycolysis of their stored glycogen provides additional energy and a reducing power source for pha synthesis aerobic pha oxidation serves as the carbon and energy source for biomass growth p uptake polyphosphate storage and glycogen regeneration oehmen et al 2007 zhou et al 2008 glycogen accumulating organisms gaos are the competitors of paos as they can also uptake vfas in anaerobic conditions but do not perform p uptake thus do not contribute to p removal oehmen et al 2007 many studies have focused on investigating the competition between these two organisms establishing conditions for enrichment of paos and inhibition of gaos by applying various carbon sources feeding rates ph dissolved oxygen and temperature conditions carvalheira et al 2014a 2014b 2014c lopez vazquez et al 2009 tu and schuler 2013 for example tu and schuler 2013 investigated the competition of paos and gaos with different feeding rates showing that higher acetate feeding rates can enrich gaos over paos and thus lead to the deterioration of ebpr systems accumulibacter is a well known pao that consists of two distinct types type i and type ii based on the analysis of the 16s rrna gene and the ppk1 gene he et al 2007 within these two types several clades were identified ia i e and iia ii i reflecting fine differences in the genetic sequence of the ppk1 gene camejo et al 2016 these differences in the specific phylogenetic identity of accumulibacter have been correlated with differences in its metabolic expression initially carvalho et al 2007 have detected different cell morphotypes of accumulibacter where rod morphotypes were able to use nitrate as the electron acceptor while cocci were not oehmen et al 2010 later found that the rod morphotype in that study corresponded to accumulibacter type i and the cocci to accumulibacter type ii flowers et al 2009 achieved a similar conclusion for paos belonging to clades ia and iia respectively more recently camejo et al 2019 and rubio rincón et al 2019 investigated the differences in denitrification pathways between the same accumulibacter clade both studies investigated accumulibacter clade ic but intra clade diversity analysis showed that the ic selected in the study of camejo et al 2019 was capable of performing the full pathway for respiratory denitrification ca accumulibacter uw ldo ic while rubio rincón et al 2019 enriched a culture of ca accumulibacter delftensis ic which was not capable of using nitrate as the electron acceptor these studies prove that phylogenetic diversity at the sub clade level can influence accumulibacter metabolism one metabolic aspect of high importance impacting p removal performance in ebpr systems is the capacity of accumulibacter to perform both pao and gao like metabolism the deterioration of p removal has been observed even in enriched accumulibacter pao systems where zhou et al 2008 found that accumulibacter were able to use glycolysis as a main source of energy in limited p conditions acevedo et al 2012 observed a correlation between accumulibacter type and the level of polyphosphate storage leading to pao type i or gao type ii metabolism by accumulibacter when shifted to p limiting conditions the study of welles et al 2015 concluded that when phosphate was not limiting pao type i performed typical pao metabolism while pao type ii performed mixed pao and gao metabolism however under phosphate limitation both types shifted to a gao like metabolism with a strong competitive advantage of type ii over type i welles et al 2017 later showed that accumulibacter clade iic displayed differing pao and gao like behaviour depending on the availability of the influent p concentration while the metabolic flexibility of accumulibacter is dependant on the clade and environmental conditions guedes da silva et al 2020 it is unclear if a clade level description of accumulibacter is sufficient to establish the pao vs gao metabolic capacity of accumulibacter in addition previous studies have not investigated if some accumulibacter sub lineages perform gao like metabolism even when influent p levels are not limiting this study focuses on investigating the metabolism of different accumulibacter lineages and their impact on ebpr performance an accumulibacter bioreactor was subjected to various conditions in long term tests that are typically conducive to different ecological profiles the carbon feeding strategy feeding rate and loading was manipulated while non limiting influent phosphorus levels were maintained the feeding strategy represents one of the operating parameters that are known to affect the dominant species of a microbial community a high or low abundance of resources such as organic carbon impacts the microbial profile by enriching for organisms that are either r or k strategists respectively therefore we operated an ebpr reactor with different feeding strategies to select for different pao cultures the metabolism was studied along with a fine scale microbial community analysis of the accumulibacter sludge at the sub clade level to identify the link between phylogenetic identity and metabolic function three different feeding conditions were investigated for selecting the accumulibacter reactors where ebpr performance was compared at different organic carbon feeding rates and concentration levels this study provides needed clarity on factors leading to ebpr failure and upsets through better understanding of how accumulibacter performance varies as a function of the specific clade and sub clade within this diverse and important microbial group of organisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 sequencing batch reactor sbr operation a two litre reactor was inoculated with sludge from a municipal wwtp beirolas in lisbon portugal and a gradual cod increase from 50 mgcod l to 200 mgcod l was initially applied in the start up phase in order to select for paos the reactor was operated in sequencing batch mode with 4 cycles per day the six hour cycle was comprised of a 2 h anaerobic phase 3 h aerobic phase and a 1 h settling decant phase without stirring to achieve anaerobic and aerobic conditions argon and air were continuously bubbled respectively temperature was controlled with a water bath at 20 c and ph was controlled between 7 and 7 5 with automatic addition of hcl or naoh the sludge retention time srt was 10 days and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h 2 2 feed composition the 1 l feed medium was a mixture of two solutions fed separately a phosphate and b carbon and nutrient solutions the phosphate feeding rate and concentration was constant throughout the entire period of reactor operation feeding took place at the beginning of the anaerobic phase for 5 min with a total volume of 750 ml the solution a contained 124 mg of k2hpo4 and 96 8 mg of kh2po4 per litre the carbon source was a mixture of acetate hac and propionate hpr at a proportion of 75 25 on a cod basis respectively as was suggested to be beneficial for paos to outcompete gaos carvalheira et al 2014b lopez vazquez et al 2009 the composition of solution b consisted of cod ammonium and micronutrients as detailed in carvalheira et al 2014a where 250 ml was added per cycle 2 3 operation of the sbr in the three steady state periods as previously mentioned the phosphate feeding rate and concentration was maintained constant throughout the study during the first steady state period of reactor operation cod was fed over 5 min after phosphate feeding fast mode while afterwards in steady state periods 2 and 3 it was switched to 50 min slow mode the period of stabilization after changing the cod feeding rate is referred to as the transition phase after achieving steady state in each of the three operation periods reactor performance and the fine scale pao community were investigated 2 3 1 steady state period 1 fast cod feeding rate 200 mgcod l in period 1 a fast cod feeding rate strategy was employed at a rate of 40 mg cod l min to achieve 200 mgcod l in the reactor these conditions were operated in steady state for 30 days 2 3 2 steady state period 2 slow cod feeding rate 200 mgcod l in period 2 the reactor was fed with a slow cod feeding rate strategy of 4 mgcod l min to achieve 200 mgcod l in the reactor the steady state of period 2 lasted for 100 days 2 3 3 steady state period 3 slow cod feeding rate 150 mgcod l after a shutdown start up period the reactor was re seeded using sludge from period 2 and a gradual increase of cod concentration was applied during this start up phase until reaching 150 mgcod l at steady state in this period the reactor was also fed with a slow cod feeding rate strategy 3 mgcod l min and steady state was achieved for 150 days 2 4 sampling and chemical analysis routine monitoring of the reactor was performed once per week where total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss phosphate po4 p ammonium glycogen gly polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and volatile fatty acids vfa were analysed samples were collected along the anaerobic and aerobic phases except tss and vss which were measured at the end of the aerobic phase samples were centrifuged for 3 min at 10 000 rpm following separation of the solid and liquid phases with 0 45 µm filters p ammonium and vfas were analysed on the liquid phase while pha and glycogen were analysed on lyophilized biomass pellets p and ammonium analysis were performed with segmented flow analysis skalar 5100 skalar analytical the netherlands

was analysed by hplc as described in carvalho et al 2018 biomass samples were also collected at the end of the anaerobic phase for microbiological characterisation of the community as described below 2 5 calculation of the kinetic and stoichiometric parameters stoichiometric and kinetic parameters presented in the results section were calculated via the equations presented below p removal was determined by difference between the phosphorus concentration in the beginning pstart anaerobic of the anaerobic phase mgp l after p feeding and the end of the aerobic phase pend aerobic divided by

biomass samples from the three different steady state periods were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde pfa or ethanol as described by nielsen 2009 quantitative fish qfish was performed according to amann 1995 to analyse the microbial composition and abundance of the bacterial populations present in the sbr specific fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes were applied to the biomass to allow the visualization of the microbial consortia cyanine 5 cy5 labelled eubmix probe that targets all bacteria mixture of eub338 amann et al 1990 eub338 ii and eub338 iii daims et al 1999 was applied together with the cyanine 3 labelled probes acc i 444 and acc ii 444 flowers et al 2009 to target candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis types i and ii respectively and with the cy3 labelled cpb 654 probe for candidatus competibater phosphatis mcilroy et al 2015 other oligonucleotide probes and hybridisation details are described in probebase greuter et al 2016 hybridised samples were observed using a zeisss lsm 710 meta confocal laser scanning microscope clsm with a magnification of 400x using an argon laser 488 nm helium laser 543 nm and a red diode laser 637 nm daime software daims et al 2006 was used to analyse 20 photos that were taken in several regions of the wells containing the biomass samples the ratio between the area of the accumulibacter or competibacter population over the cy5 labelled eubmix population yields the biovolume of each organism the standard error of the mean sem is calculated as the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of images 2 6 2 ppk gene clone library construction and phylogenetic analysis for this study there was a need to accurately classify the three communities obtained in this work to the sub clade level of accumulibacter accumulibacter types clades clusters are all very close phylogenetically requiring near complete and highly accurate gene sequence analysis to detect these subtle differences sanger sequencing is the gold standard for this purpose generating long up to 1000 bp and highly accurate 99 9 sequence reads however sanger is ineffective at sequencing cultures comprised of many different unknown organisms cloning is a reliable technique to separate amplicons from diverse organisms prior to sanger and was thus employed in this work prior to sanger sequencing biomass samples were taken during the three steady state periods of the process and centrifuged for 3 min at 10 000 rpm pellets were stored at 20 c until dna extraction genomic dna gdna was extracted using the dneasy ultraclean microbial kit qiagen germany and quantified with a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific rockford il the quality and integrity of the extracted gdna was assessed in 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the gdna was stored at 20 c until processing polymerase chain reaction pcr was done to amplify the polyphosphate kinase 1 gene ppk1 using the general primers acc ppk1 254f tcaccaccgacggcaagac and acc ppk1 1376r acgatcatcagcatcttggc mcmahon et al 2007 the pcr mixture was achieved using the nzytaq ii 2x green master mix nzytech portugal containing dntps 2 5 mm of mgcl2 and 2 5 u of nzytaq ii dna polymerase to which were added 400 nm of each forward and reverse primer 100 ng of template gdna and nuclease free water to a final volume of 25 μl negative controls were made with nuclease free water and no template the pcr cycling program started with an initial denaturation step for 10 min at 95 c followed by 30 cycles of denaturation step at 95 c for 30 s annealing of the primers at 68 c for 1 min and extension of the dna at 72 c for 2 min in the end of the cycle a final extension of 12 min at 72 c was performed the dna fragments were then purified using the nzygelpure kit nzytech portugal where the correct bands were confirmed through agarose gel electrophoresis and amplicons were quantified using a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific rockford il the targeted ppk1 fragments were cloned in a pgem t vector using the pgem t easy vector systems kit following the manufacturer s instructions promega usa using t4 dna ligase ligations were performed considering 55 ng of insert and 50 ng of vector to a final insert vector molar ratio of 3 1 reactions were incubated overnight at 4 c and transformations of e coli jm109 cells were made by heat shock of the cells for 50 s at 42 c followed by 2 min on ice transformation cultures were plated in lb medium supplemented with iptg 100 mm x gal 50 mg ml and ampicillin to a final concentration of 100 μg ml for each reactor operation period 50 white colonies were selected and isolated screening of the clones with the correct insert was performed and pcr products were sanger sequenced by stabvida portugal bidirectional fasta sequences were processed using geneious prime software v2019 1 consensus sequences were obtained after denovo assembly of the forward and reverse sequences multiple sequence alignment msa was done using the muscle algorithm and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbour joining method with 1000 bootstraps both included in the geneious package msa was trimmed up to 866 bp using orf opean reading frame finder to search for the orfs within the query sequences chimeric sequences were identified and removed using bellerophon huber et al 2004 and blast was used as the database for the phylogenetic classification of the clones based on a pairwise identity of 97 the nucleotide sequences were deposited in the genbank ncbi database with the accession numbers mw034869 mw034998 3 results 3 1 reactor performance the sbr was seeded with wwtp sludge and operated 300 days using conditions previously proposed as ideal to enrich for paos carvalheira et al 2014b after inoculation a gradual increase of the cod concentration was applied until reaching 200 mgcod l leading to an increase in anaerobic p release and aerobic p uptake as a response to each cod change however the overall p removal efficiency in the start up period was lower than 40 3 1 1 steady state period 1 poor ebpr performance was maintained for more than 3 srts after the start up period where 200 mgcod l of vfa were added in the reactor each cycle fig 1 shows the anaerobic p vfa ratio and aerobic p removal with p removal remaining low 40 the experimentally determined stoichiometry for all steady state periods is summarized in table 1 while cycle profiles in the anaerobic and aerobic phase are presented in fig 2 although vfas were consumed in the anaerobic phase the average p vfa ratio was consistently low 0 29 p mol c mol as compared to values usually reported in literature for enriched pao reactors with similar carbon sources 0 40 p mol c mol glycogen hydrolysis vfa uptake ratio gly vfa was 0 79 c mol c mol supporting the expression of gao metabolism by the culture carvalheira et al 2014a the pha production vfa uptake ratio was 1 85 c mol c mol with 0 84 and 0 99 c mol c mol of phb vfa and phv vfa respectively enriched pao systems fed with a similar fraction of acetate and propionate produce less total pha with a lower phv fraction carvalheira et al 2014a where the higher phv and overall pha production can be linked to gao metabolism table 2 shows the anaerobic p release and p uptake rates which were 25 03 and 21 22 mgp gx h respectively where the p concentration in the effluent was 16 03 2 78 mgp l clearly confirming the poor p removal 3 1 2 steady state period 2 after steady state period 1 the carbon feeding rate was decreased 10 times from 40 to 4 mgcod l min but with the same final concentration of cod in the reactor 200 mgcod l immediately after changing the feeding rate a big increase of p removal was observed until reaching 99 p removal p effluent concentration of 0 21 0 41 mgp l the anaerobic p vfa ratio doubled with an average of 0 58 p mol c mol supporting a shift towards pao metabolism vfas were consumed along the extended period of cod addition and the anaerobic gly vfa ratio decreased to 0 51 c mol c mol indicating a decrease in glycogen use as an energy source and consistent with pao metabolism the anaerobic pha vfa ratio also decreased to 1 56 c mol c mol from which phb vfa was 0 94 and phv vfa significantly decreased to 0 58 c mol c mol further supporting a shift from gao to pao metabolism p uptake took place mostly in the first hour of the aerobic phase fig 2b the p release and uptake rates were considerably higher in this period table 2 at 51 46 and 55 63 mgp gx h respectively as compared to period 1 each of these indicators confirm a shift in metabolic activity towards pao metabolism where good ebpr performance was achieved 3 1 3 steady state period 3 in steady state period 3 no p was detected in the effluent so 99 of p removal was achieved with 150 mgcod l and a feeding rate of 3 mgcod l min the slow feeding rate strategy led to stable p removal performance even at this lower cod level the vfas were consumed immediately where no accumulation of vfa was detected and the anaerobic p vfa ratio was similar to steady state period 2 at 0 51 p mol c mol as was the gly vfa ratio 0 46 c mol c mol the anaerobic pha vfa ratio was 1 54 c mol c mol with similar phb vfa and phv vfa ratios of 0 88 and 0 59 c mol c mol respectively compared to steady state period 2 the anaerobic p release rate decreased to 48 48 mgp gx h due to the lower carbon concentration fed to the reactor but the p uptake rate was kept at an average 55 57 mgp gx h for more than 15 srts of stable reactor operation overall good p removal performance with the typical pao metabolism was maintained in steady state period 3 fig 2c 3 2 microbial community 3 2 1 overall pao and gao community analysis qualitative fish analyses were performed throughout the reactor operation to follow the microbiological community changes see si and quantitative fish was performed in the three steady state periods to quantify the microbial groups most relevant for ebpr i e paos and gaos fig 3 shows quantitative fish results for accumulibacter types i and ii which is the finest level classification possible based on the 16s sequence and for competibacter in steady state period 1 accumulibacter type ii was dominant representing 86 9 of total bacterial biovolume while accumulibacter type i had a very low abundance of 2 3 competibacter gaos were present 13 5 but in lower abundance as compared to the total accumulibacter population after changing the carbon feeding rate from fast to slow there was a shift in the accumulibacter composition where type i increased to 78 and type ii almost completely disappeared 0 1 in this period a small decrease in competibacter was also observed 7 4 a shift in the accumulibacter composition occurred again in steady state period 3 type i decreased to 10 1 and type ii proliferated to 84 5 similarly to steady state period 1 the competibacter abundance was lowest in this period at 2 0 other gaos including defluviicoccus and propionivibrio were never found at levels 1 of all bacteria in any of the steady state periods 3 2 2 fine scale pao community analysis regarding the limited capacity of differentiation of 16s based fish probes we investigated the sequence of the gene encoding for the polyphosphate kinase ppk1 in order to further investigate the clade composition of accumulibacter on a finer level the phylogenetic tree topology fig 4 supports the fish quantification results showing the dominance of accumulibacter type ii in steady state periods 1 and 3 while type i was dominant in steady state period 2 the phylogenetic output of the neighbour joining tree groups the sequences according to their similarity which leads to a robust differentiation of several clusters namely one cluster within type i and four clusters within type ii the type i cluster belongs to clade ia whereas members of clade iia and iic were detected from type ii the sequences for clade iia are all grouped in the same cluster and the sequences of clade iic are further sub divided into three clusters or sub clades iici iicii and iiciii steady state period 1 was composed of members of clade iia and members of clade iic clusters ii and iii steady state period 2 shifted to clade ia while finally in steady state period 3 the community shifted again towards clade iic but in this case was mostly composed of members of cluster iici 4 discussion 4 1 the link between reactor performance and microbial community profile the mixture of acetate and propionate as carbon substrate as well as the relatively low cod p ratio should promote the proliferation of paos and good ebpr performance carvalheira et al 2014b lu et al 2006 oehmen et al 2007 carvalheira et al 2014a 2014b 2014c used similar conditions in their studies as conditions applied in this study period 1 and achieved 95 of p removal with high accumulibacter and low competibacter abundance 71 85 and 17 21 respectively however in this study p removal was low throughout steady state period 1 fig 1 even with a similarly high enrichment of accumulibacter 85 fig 3 and lower competibacter abundance as compared to carvalheira et al 2014a 2014b 2014c the carbon substrate was fully consumed but low stoichiometric p vfa and high gly vfa ratios suggested that glycogen was an important source of energy for acetate and propionate uptake the gly vfa and pha vfa ratios were similar to those reported in the study of carvalheira et al 2014a for a gao dominated sbr strongly suggesting the expression of a mixed pao gao metabolism in steady state period 1 furthermore the composition of phas produced in the anaerobic phase also indicate gao metabolism with a high fraction of phv and high total pha vfa ratio zhou et al 2008 while competibacter was present in the sbr in period 1 its relatively low abundance should not have negatively impacted the p removal performance the acetate uptake rates for accumulibacter and competibacter are very similar while propionate uptake rate is significantly higher for accumulibacter lopez vazquez et al 2009 indicating that even with some vfa consumption by competibacter present in lower abundance 13 5 most of the vfas 85 or approximately 170 mgcod l were consumed by accumulibacter indeed in period 3 where only 150 mgcod l was fed to the sbr complete p removal was still achieved supporting the fact that the vfa level in the feed during period 1 should have been sufficient to achieve a low p concentration in the effluent thus the accumulibacter population observed during period 1 displayed ineffective p removal capacity the carbon feeding rate was previously shown to influence the pao gao competition where accumulibacter displayed a competitive advantage over defluviicoccus gaos with a slow carbon feeding strategy tu and schuler 2013 their study suggested that gaos correspond to r strategists while paos correspond to k strategists in this study the decreased carbon feeding rate in steady state period 2 immediately caused an improvement in ebpr performance though without a corresponding shift in the pao vs gao global abundances instead the accumulibacter population shifted from clade iic to clade ia during these periods moreover in steady state period 3 the p removal performance and characteristic pao metabolism was maintained by the sbr despite the lower organic carbon source addition and a further shift in the accumulibacter population from clade ia back to clade iic this result prompted further phylogenetic characterization of the bacterial community which indicated three distinct clade iic clusters i ii and iii fig 4 with a fast carbon feeding rate strategy clade iia and iic clusters ii and iii were present inside the bioreactor which exhibited a mixed pao gao metabolism it should be noted that clade iic has been previously shown to be capable of expressing gao metabolism under p limiting conditions welles et al 2017 suggesting that the poor ebpr performance in this period could be attributed to the high abundance of the clade iic clusters in steady state period 3 the phylogenetically distant cluster i from clade iic was detected in contrast to clusters ii and iii from clade iic in period 1 that exhibited gao metabolism this cluster was linked with good ebpr performance and the typical pao metabolism thus it is clear that metabolic differences exhibiting a high impact on ebpr performance can be linked within the previously identified accumulibacter clades highlighting that knowledge of intra clade diversity is just as important as inter clade diversity for this key group of organisms furthermore this study also shows that the characteristic gao metabolism can also be employed by some members of the accumulibacter even when the influent p concentration is not limiting implying that accumulibacter clade iic clusters ii and iii are effectively gaos and are undesirable organisms in ebpr plants 4 2 accumulibacter diversity and its link with metabolism over the past 10 years ebpr studies have more frequently linked the process performance with not only the abundance of the total accumulibacter group or other groups of paos or gaos but also the dominant type or clade of these organisms table 3 provides an overview of the results of literature studies in this regard for accumulibacter focussing on metabolic aspects including denitrification capacity pao or gao metabolic shifts as well as the toxicity of nitrite and free nitrous acid fna several inconsistencies can be found in studies examining links between metabolism and type i and type ii accumulibacter but other studies have also noted inconsistencies even at the clade level rubio rincón et al 2019 selected accumulibacter clade ic which was not able to perform anoxic p removal using nitrate but the study of camejo et al 2019 showed that anoxic p uptake did proceed with nitrate for accumulibacter clade ic thus in addition to this study whereby clusters within accumulibacter clade iic led to distinct pao or gao metabolism intra clade diversity can also lead to other important metabolic differences within ebpr systems the present study emphasizes the complexity of ebpr microbial ecology where poor ebpr performance cannot be solely attributed to gaos but also to intra clade phylogenetic diversity within accumulibacter a group of organisms that is typically regarded as a pao while accumulibacter is known to be capable of gao metabolism under p limiting conditions the fact that there s differences at the sub clade level that impacts performance even when p is not limiting suggests for the first time that some accumulibacter are effectively gaos indeed accumulibacter should be considered as a diverse group of organisms rather than a single organism with a unique phenotype this has a significant impact on future research in ebpr whereby such a consideration is not always implied during studies investigating the link between the microbial community composition its metabolism and the ebpr process performance 5 conclusions this study shows that intra clade diversity within accumulibacter can influence the ebpr performance and lead to poor p removal even without limiting levels of p in the wastewater influent thus some members of the accumulibacter a group of organisms widely recognised as important paos effectively behave like gaos in ebpr systems future studies should focus on the link between ebpr performance and finer scale characterisation of the accumulibacter group since recharacterization of the accumulibacter group beyond the clade level may be necessary to understand the link between intra clade diversities of accumulibacter and ebpr performance gao like activity should not be linked solely to competibacter and other gaos but also specific clades of organisms currently recognised as paos declaration of competing interest none

16976,diatom species are good pollution bioindicators due to their large distribution fast response to changes in environmental parameters and different tolerance ranges these organisms are used in ecological water assessment all over the world using autoecological indices such assessments commonly rely on the taxonomic identification of diatom species specific shape and frustule ornaments from which cell counts species richness and diversity indices can be estimated taxonomic identification is however time consuming and requires years of expertise additionally though the diatom autoecological indices are region specific they are often applied indiscriminately across regions raman spectroscopy is a simpler fast and label free technique that can be applied to environmental diagnosis with diatoms however this approach has been poorly explored this work reviews raman spectroscopy studies involving the structure location and conformation of diatom cell components and their variation under different conditions a critical appreciation of the pros and cons of its application to environmental diagnosis is also given this knowledge provides a strong foundation for the development of environmental protocols using raman spectroscopy in diatoms our work aims at stimulating further research on the application of raman spectroscopy as a tool to assess physiological

practically all kinds of aquatic environments due to their large distribution round et al 2007 morphological diversity guiry 2012 fast response to environmental changes and the existence of species with different tolerance ranges squires et al 1979 almeida and gil 2001 vilbaste and truu 2003 diatoms are recognized bioindicators and have been employed in the assessment of water quality for decades patrick 1973 dixit et al 1999 blanco et al 2004 desrosiers et al 2013 these microalgae are easy to sample process lear et al 2012 and store mendes et al 2012 additionally their taxonomic identification is made through diatom floras based on their siliceous cell wall the frustule which has ornaments differing amongst species fig 1 germain 1981 pandey et al 2017 in europe according to the water framework directive wfd diatoms are a biological element of the aquatic flora of obligatory evaluation for the ecological assessment of watercourses in european union countries directive 2000 diatoms are also used in routine water monitoring surveys in other parts of the world such as canada usa japan south america and australia unesco who unep 1996 the traditional methods for assessing water quality using diatoms are based on taxonomic identification and valve counting pandey et al 2017 pinto et al 2020 the species abundance is then used for the calculation of autoecological indexes such as for example the ips indice de polluosensibilité spécifique cemagref 1982 or ibd indice biologique diatomées coste et al 2009 this approach has some drawbacks since it is time consuming taxa are recurrently changing and taxonomic identification requires many years of expertise additionally ecological indexes are sometimes region specific and consequently can be applied inaccurately morin et al 2016 raman spectroscopy rs is a promising alternative technique for application to monitoring and diagnostic testing with diatoms in the biological analysis this technique has many advantages in relation to other methods because it is label free and it requires minimal or simple sample preparation and processing heraud et al 2007 water is also a low raman scatterer so its interference can be minimized parker 1983 furthermore the inherent fluorescence of the organic compounds that often superimpose and hinder the raman signal can be minimized using a suitable laser wavelength typically with a low frequency such as near infrared laser or minimize its effect through photobleaching ivleva et al 2017 the technique was first described in 1928 and is based on the inelastically scattered radiation resulting of an incident electromagnetic beam with a well defined excitation wavelength ranging from near infrared to uv by molecular vibrations in the sample raman krishnan 1928 fig 2 shows the vibrational energy level diagram showing the energy states involved in the light scattering process the vast majority of the photons are elastically scattered i e no change in energy when they interact with the molecules rayleigh scattering smith and dent 2019 yet only a small part 1 106 of these photons are inelastically scattered though this probably depends on the polarizability tensor for a given vibration smith and dent 2019 raman scattering is a type of inelastic light scattering by molecular vibrations in which the energy of the incident photon νi can be either higher or lower than the energy of the scattered photon νs resulting on positive or negative frequency shifts stokes or anti stokes raman scattering respectively smith and dent 2019 the lower panel of fig 2 shows a schematic representation of the rayleigh stokes and anti stokes components of an experimental raman spectrum the difference between the scattered and the incident frequencies is a direct measurement of the vibration frequency for anti stokes and for stokes processes 1 ν s ν i ν v where νv is the vibration frequency smith and dent 2019 usually spectroscopists refer to vibrations by their wavenumber 2 ν ν v c where c is the light speed and ν is expressed in cm 1 this quantity is often still designated as frequency using the typical approximation of c 1 smith and dent 2019 according to eq 1 raman bands associated with a vibrational transition whether stokes or anti stokes are systematically located in relation to the rayleigh band where its central position is assumed to be the origin of the wave number scale thus the raman shift is a direct measurement of the frequency of the molecular vibration smith and dent 2019 since the stokes process is more probable to occur than the anti stokes it has a higher intensity and therefore only the stokes part of the spectra is usually recorded at room temperature smith and dent 2019 the raman signature of a sample gives information regarding its chemical and structural properties thus both external or internal parameters can influence the spectral profile i band position is determined by the dynamics of the vibrating system namely chemical bond strength and bond length ii the bandwidth measured by the band full width at half maximum is usually associated with the disorder which can be chemical i e slight changes of the chemical species or structural i e slight changes of the bond lengths iii the appearance disappearance of bands evidence for changes in the chemical composition e g formation of new bonds due to chemical reactions or structural transitions assigned to different molecules conformations and links in the molecular structure such as hydration sometimes the application of rs is limited due to the low raman cross sections of the molecules and the low power of the incident laser typically below 1 mw to avoid sample damaging which may result in a low scattered signal shahbazyan and stockman 2013 or the high fluorescence characteristic of some biological samples which may hinder the raman signal byrne et al 2016 to overcome these problems some variations of rs can also be used namely the resonant raman spectroscopy rrs and the surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers though the resulting rrs or sers spectra can be deeply changed when compared to the normal raman spectra in the resonant raman spectroscopy the energy of the incident laser radiation matches the electronic transitions of a given compound in some cases the electronic transitions couple with vibrational ones strongly enhancing the scattering intensity of the corresponding raman bands 102 to 106 fold fig 2 ivleva et al 2017 a relevant case of resonant raman for biology is that of the conjugated double bonds as in carotenoids when an excitation green 532 nm laser is used for the measurement therefore the electrons in conjugated double bonds are highly polarizable which explains their high raman cross sections and high raman intensities this was observed for example for carotenoids in diatom studies premvardhan et al 2009 2010 intensity enhancement of the raman scattered radiation can also be achieved by using plasmonic processes typically using metallic surfaces or metallic micro nanoparticles giving rise to the surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers baena and lendl 2004 in this case the excitation of plasmonic particles by the incident radiation creates strong local electric fields near the surface of metallic structures giving rise to strong scattering processes note that sers is most frequently used in studies where diatoms are used as biosensors rather than as the direct organism under investigation in sers diatom frustules are used as a substrate for the nanometallic surface and act as biosensors to detect the presence of other substances e g kamińska et al 2017 in the case of diatoms as study organisms similarly to other types of microalgae he et al 2018 the main spectral information obtained through rs are bands assigned to photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments chlorophylls chls a and c and carotenoids such as fucoxanthin fx diadinoxanthin ddx and diatoxanthin dtx e g premvardhan et al 2009 2010 alexandre et al 2014 raman spectroscopy also enables the possibility to obtain spectral

2000 studies concerning direct rs applications in diatoms are mainly focused on understanding the diversity of structures and conformations of the main molecules within the cell the location of molecules within the cell the optimal abiotic conditions to enhance the production of lipids to be used in the biofuel industry and the variation of pigmentation under different light conditions raman spectroscopy is frequently complemented by raman imaging ri raman imaging consists of taking several raman spectra covering a certain area and mapping a certain band parameter interest intensity or frequency for example in that area with this method it is possible to locate components within the cell through colour schemes stewart et al 2012 usually the quantitative analyses of raman data consist of spectral deconvolution using multiple fitting models the simplest method to do this fitting consists of a sum of lorentzian functions defined by their position width and intensity different chemometrics methods for processing the spectral information can be used to analyse band variations such as principal component analysis pca or partial least squares discriminant analysis pls da meksiarun et al 2015 rüger et al 2019 despite the relatively high number of rs studies applied to diatoms these have been mostly done under controlled laboratory conditions whereas field environmental taxonomic and toxicological studies are lacking nevertheless this represents a promising approach since raman bands assigned to diatom cell components can vary with abiotic and physiological conditions it was previously demonstrated for instance that high co2 levels in the water can favour the production of fatty acids in the diatom thalassiosira pseudonana meksiarun et al 2014 or that the growth phases in the diatom ditylium brightwellii are accompanied by changes in raman bands assigned to carotenoids rüger et al 2016 the objective of this review is thus to describe the recent advances in rs applied to diatoms and comment on the evidence supporting the use of this technique as a tool for environmental diagnostic tests emphasis was given to the qualitative and quantitative analysis of cell constituents and rs application in diatom toxicity assays both of interest for the diagnostic testing of water quality and the environmental status of aquatic ecosystems 2 qualitative and quantitative analysis of cell components 2 1 pigments in diatoms as in other photosynthetic organisms exist two types of pigments chls and carotenoids kuczynska et al 2015 two types of chls represented in fig 3 are present chl a and chl c divided in chl c1 and chl c2 chlorophylls contain a porphyrin ring constituted by a magnesium coordination complex of cyclic tetrapyrroles and a fifth isocyclic ring jeffrey and vesk 2005 chlorophyll a fig 3a differs from the two types of chl c fig 3b and c in that it contains a long phytyl chain in the 17th position of the porphyrin ring chlorophyll c2 fig 3c differs from chl c1 fig 3b in that it contains a vinyl group in the 8th position of the porphyrin ring instead of an ethyl group wagner and waidelich 1986 fucoxanthin chlorophyll protein complexes fcps are also relevant for the study of diatom pigments fig 4 i presents rrs spectra of cyclotella meneghiniana fcps obtained at several laser excitation wavelengths premvardhan et al 2010 these oligomeric or trimeric complexes constitute the main light harvesting complexes in diatoms lavaud et al 2002 guglielmi et al 2005 lepetit et al 2010 through the raman spectra of fcps the characteristic spectral regions of chlorophylls and carotenoids can be identified raman spectra of chls in diatoms were first studied in 1986 in the species phaeodactylum tricornutum and gomphonema parvulum wagner and waidelich 1986 the raman spectra of chls are composed of three main spectral regions fig 4i cn breathing mode region 1300 to 1420 cm 1 the bands assigned to vinyl groups and the respective bonds with porphyrin groups 1580 to 1630 cm 1 and the bands assigned to in plane stretches or peripheral substituents such as c 13 keto carbonyl 1650 to 1700 cm 1 premvardhan et al 2010 chlorophylls can be classified in three groups based on their c 13 keto carbonyl groups weak hydrogen linkages giving rise to bands located between 1685 and 1705 cm 1 moderate hydrogen linkages with bands located between 1670 and 1680 cm 1 and strong hydrogen linkages with bands located between 1650 and 1665 cm 1 mimuro et al 1990 regarding carotenoids the most mentioned in rs studies are fx ddx and dtx fig 5 all carotenoids contain a conjugated polyene chain varying in the number of carbon atoms fig 5a c carotenoids fx and ddx have a 5 6 monoepoxide group fig 5a and b which is not present in dtx carotenoid fx contains a unique allenic bond fig 5a kuczynska et al 2015 spectral regions characteristic of carotenoids are also shown in fig 4i namely in the resonant raman spectra obtained for the excitation at 476 5 nm 1 the υ1 region located between 1500 to 1570 cm 1 assigned to cc stretching modes 2 the υ2 region located between 1140 to 1180 cm 1 assigned to cc stretching modes 3 the υ3 region located between 1000 and 1040 cm 1 assigned to ch3 in plain wagging modes and 4 the υ4 region located close to 950 980 cm 1 assigned to ch out of plain wagging modes alongside the main four regions of carotenoid spectra the spectral region corresponding to carbonyl groups around 1700 cm 1 can also be associated with carotenoids premvardhan et al 2009 in carotenoid raman spectra the region υ1 is a good marker of the length of the polyene chain while the region υ4 is a marker for the conformation of carotenoids lutz et al 1987 frank et al 2006 the position of the υ1 band is proportional to the length of the polyene conjugated chain merlin 1985 and is evidenced in fig 6 it was originally thought that fcps stoichiometry was 4 1 1 fx chl a chl c2 büchel 2003 however studies in fcp complexes isolated from the diatom cyclotella meneghiniana using rrs with other techniques have evidenced a different ratio according to the evidence gathered in these studies the band υ1 of fx in fcps is indicative of a polyene chain with about seven double bonds the low intensity of υ3 and υ4 bands indicates an all trans and planar conformation in both complexes premvardhan et al 2009 fig 4ii and iii furthermore it was also shown that differences in all regions of fx spectra indicate two types of fx red in lower energy regions two types of fx blue in higher energy regions and one to two types of fx green in intermediate energy regions indeed the wavelengths used for resonant excitation of the various types of fx were coincident with the 0 0 and 0 1 of the electroabsorption spectrum premvardhan et al 2009 the two types of fx red were detected on both oligomeric and trimeric fcps when 540 and 550 nm lasers are used as excitation the presence of a shoulder on the lower energy side of the υ1 band fig 4iih i and the presence of two carbonyl bands 1647 and 1655 cm 1 that vary in intensity between the two wavelengths fig 4iiif g were indicative of two types of fx red premvardhan et al 2009 the small downshift of the υ1 band and the broadening of the carbonyl band at 514 5 nm fig 4iif have suggested the existence of at least one type of fx green premvardhan et al 2009 in trimeric fcp the carbonyl band 1642 cm 1 was associated with one of the types of fx green fig 4iiid whereas the other type of fx green was evidenced by the apparent increase in intensity of the 1645 cm 1 band with excitation wavelength of 528 7 nm and 496 5 nm fig 4iiic e premvardhan et al 2009 in oligomeric fcp there was also an evidence of two types of fx green one suggested by the shoulder 1647 cm 1 at an excitation wavelength of 528 7 nm fig 4iiie and the other one suggested by the increase in full width at half maximum of the υ1 band and the decrease of the energy separation of the doublet υ3 at an excitation wavelength at 488 and 496 5 nm fig 4iid e premvardhan et al 2009 in oligomeric fcp the lower frequency of the υ1 band fig 4iiid g indicated differences between the molecular conformation of the fx green between trimeric and oligomeric fcp premvardhan et al 2009 also different frequencies in trimeric fcp together with a lower full width at half maximum of the υ1 band with excitation wavelength at 413 7 and 441 6 nm were found to indicate the presence of a fx blue fig 4iia premvardhan et al 2009 for chls the results are represented in fig 4i there were two c 13 keto carbonyl bands characteristic of chl c2 in raman spectra of fcp one with moderate hydrogen bonds 1675 cm 1 in both trimeric and oligomeric fcps and another one with very weak hydrogen bonds 1695 cm 1 in trimeric fcp and 1690 cm 1 in oligomeric fcp fig 4id also there were two bands characteristic of cn breathing modes in chl c2 1355 cm 1 in oligomeric fcp 1360 cm 1 in trimeric fcp and 1362 cm 1 in both oligomeric and trimeric fcps fig 4id altogether these data pointed out the existence of two types of chl c2 differing also between trimeric and oligomeric fcps when considering the c 13 keto carbonyl groups in chl a of trimeric fcp there were three bands to be considered at an excitation wavelength of 406 7 nm 1654 cm 1 corresponding to strong hydrogen bonds 1677 cm 1 corresponding to medium hydrogen bonds and 1688 cm 1 corresponding to weak hydrogen bonds fig 4ia premvardhan et al 2010 the broadening and higher intensity of the bands at the incident wavelength of 413 1 nm with a higher full width at half maximum indicated the existence of more than one type of chl a two to three with weak or no hydrogen bonds three with moderate hydrogen bonds and two to three with strong hydrogen bonds fig 4ib besides these the broader and less structured bands between 1650 and 1700 cm 1 in oligomeric fcp indicate the existence of other distinguishable types of chl a figs 4ia b premvardhan et al 2010 furthermore chl a can be classified into blue soret and red absorbing species depending on the bands that were more enhanced at a wavelength of 406 7 nm in opposition to those that were enhanced at a wavelength of 413 1 and 441 6 nm the methine bridge mode of red chl a appears close to 1610 cm 1 at an excitation wavelength of 413 1 and 441 6 nm in both fcps figs 4ib c and the blue chl a appears as a shoulder at 1615 cm 1 at 406 7 nm also in both fcps fig 4ia premvardhan et al 2010 the remaining carotenoids ddx and dtx play an important role in the photoprotection of the diatoms from the large light variations caused by caudal changes tides and their position in the water column alexandre et al 2014 these carotenoids are involved in two photoprotection mechanisms non photochemical quenching npq chl a fluorescence grouneva et al 2008 and the xanthophyll cycle in the xanthophyll cycle under high light hl conditions a de epoxidation occurs converting ddx into dtx stransky and hager 1970 diatoxanthin contributes to the dissipation of excess energy and capture of harmful singlet oxygen species rüger et al 2019 low light ll conditions favour the inverse reaction goss et al 2006 grouneva et al 2008 variation of ddx and dtx with different light conditions was studied in the diatom cyclotella meneghiniana using rs in comparison with high performance liquid chromatography hplc results alexandre et al 2014 for rs recording cells were concentrated and dropped in a microscope slide as the chlorophyll content did not change with light conditions in either of the analytical techniques the chlorophyll b and 1555 cm 1 was used as a normalization to estimate the carotenoid content carotenoid spectra differed the most between ll and hl conditions in the spectral ranges υ1 υ3 and υ4 under hl the υ1 region increased in amplitude 1 8 times at an excitation wavelength of 413 1 nm and 1 5 times at an excitation wavelength of 441 6 nm compared to ll as the content in carotenoids in the hplc increased about 1 42 times the authors concluded the 441 6 nm excitation wavelength was the best for the quantification of carotenoids due to the similar increase in amplitude in the hplc the increase in carotenoids under hl conditions was due to higher levels of ddx dtx since dtx has a longer polyene conjugated chain than ddx alexandre et al 2014 increases in the content of dtx relatively to ddx are accompanied by a red shift in the frequency of the υ1 band merlin 1985 these red shifts occur in almost every spectrum under every excitation wavelength registered under hl conditions in the second part of the study normalization to the υ1 region of carotenoid spectra was done to understand the conformation of the carotenoids through the analysis of the υ4 region the authors observed that in cells under hl conditions there was an increased intensity of the 983 cm 1 band compared to ll conditions probably indicating a twisted dtx related to a bounded protein also at an excitation wavelength of 496 5 nm resonant with ddx there was a shifting from 980 cm 1 to 983 cm 1 of the υ4 band and an increase in the band intensity was observed under hl compared to ll alexandre et al 2014 this was interpreted as an indication of a new more distorted and complexly protein bound pool of ddx under hl conditions a similar study was carried out using coherent anti stokes raman scattering cars and rs to investigate carotenoid location and content in the diatoms ditylum brightwellii and stephanopyxis turris legesse et al 2018 cells were immobilized with poly l lysine onto caf2 slides in general cars and rs also detected an increase in carotenoids concentration between ll and hl conditions in both diatoms raman spectroscopy was also used to characterize marennine and marennine like pigments inside alive diatom specimens and extracted in solution gastineau et al 2012 2016 marennine is a blue pigment characteristic of the diatom haslea ostrearia and it is observed also in oysters feeding on this species gastineau et al 2014 other diatoms of the genus haslea have similar blue pigments though different in structure raman detected differences in marennine from haslea ostrearia relative to other marennine like pigments within the wave number range 1240 1420 cm 1 gastineau et al 2012 2016 the structure and biosynthesis of marennine are still unknown nevertheless it has been hypothesized that this pigment is greatly produced depending on light conditions nutrient deficiencies or salt induced stress gastineau et al 2014 this pigment can be used as a blue dye in the food and cosmetic industries and has anti inflammatory properties carlson et al 1985 collin et al 2001 bretéché et al 2002 the bands associated with the vibration of pigments species tested spectral profile and the respective mode assignments made in the studies above are presented in table s1 supplementary data it is important to understand that pigment contents can change not only with light conditions but also with other environmental or physiological conditions kuczynska et al 2015 more studies are thus required to understand variation in rs bands of diatom pigments in relation to other factors this will allow developing faster and easier tools for environmental assessment and diagnostic tests additionally some rs studies point out that the pigment bands may differ amongst taxa wood et al 2005 abbas et al 2011 and growth phases rüger et al 2016 if so rs could be used to compensate the inherent constraints in taxonomic identification of diatoms and to assess the influence of stress conditions on their growth phases 2 2 lipids in diatoms lipids are stored in specific organelles called lipid bodies liu and benning 2013 goold et al 2015 zienkiewicz et al 2016 lipid bodies occupy a large portion of the cell volume supriya et al 2012 variable amongst species maeda et al 2017 enhanced lipid production is usually associated with exposure to environmental stress such as ph variations temperature light intensity nitrogen carbon silica phosphorus iron and salinity supriya et al 2012 this occurs because under stress conditions lipids act like secondary sources of energy necessary to maintain membrane functions and cell signalling pathways hu et al 2008 a rs study of lipid pool variation in relation to different nitrogen sources i e sodium nitrate and urea was performed in diatoms of the genus nitzschia measurements were made on cells placed directly under the raman microscope after seven days of experiments the authors detected changes in bands assigned to lipids associated with changes in the lipid pool due to changes in the nitrogen source supriya et al 2012 similar studies conjugating rs with chemometric techniques were performed directly on individuals of the species thalassiosira pseudonana placed on a petri dish with a quartz bottom meksiarun et al 2014 2015 and in purified fatty acids extracts meksiarun et al 2015 the objective was to determine changes in lipid composition and concentration under different stress conditions the authors used a ratiometric method based on the ratio of two band intensities the band 1660 cm 1 which corresponded to the number of cc present in lipids and the band 1440 cm 1 assigned to ch2 bending modes they discovered that diatom lipids are mostly recorded between palmitic and linoleic acid suggesting that many of their fatty acid chains contain one to two double bonds since diatoms have triglycerides with varied compositions in their fatty acid chains a conventional ratiometric method would hardly reflect all this variety to better characterize these molecules the authors performed a pca comparing spectral data from pure fatty acid chains and diatom samples the spectra recorded from diatom samples were mostly related to the spectra of myristic acid 14 carbon 0 double bond palmitic acid 16 carbon 0 double bond palmitoleic acid 16 carbon 1 double bond and eicosapentaenoic acid 20 carbon 5 double bond data from the two other fatty acids tested linoleic and oleic acids were not related to the lipid spectra of the diatom additionally raman ordinary least squares raman ols method was used to determine lipid quantities under seven different conditions control iron abundance and shortage carbon dioxide abundance and shortage and nitrogen abundance and shortage meksiarun et al 2015 lipids were divided into three groups based on the ratio of saturated myristic and palmitic acids to unsaturated fatty acid chains palmitoleic and eicosapentaenoic acids saturated fatty acid dominated sfd unsaturated fatty acid dominated ufd and saturated unsaturated fatty acid transformation suft the results obtained are shown in table 1 reflecting changes in lipid groups of diatom populations exposed to the different experimental conditions relative to the control there was an increase in sfd in all conditions tested a decrease in ufd was also observed in all conditions tested although less remarkable in the case of iron shortage regarding suft iron shortage induced a suft reduction while iron abundance carbon dioxide abundance and shortage and nitrogen starvation elicited a suft increase meksiarun et al 2015 in another study from the same authors fatty acid production was found to increase with the increase in carbon dioxide meksiarun et al 2014 although these rs studies were mainly performed to evaluate the optimal conditions for the mass production of unsaturated lipids in the biofuel industry this knowledge could be used in environmental diagnosis where alterations in lipid bands could be related to stressful aquatic conditions the bands associated with molecular vibrations of lipids species tested spectral profile and the respective mode assignments in the studies above are presented in table s2 supplementary data 2 3 frustule the most distinctive feature in diatoms is the frustule the frustule is a siliceous cell wall that protects the cell against all kinds of stress factors such as mechanical pressure xenobiotics environmental changes and grazing townley 2011 furthermore it has photonic crystal properties fuhrmann et al 2004 such properties can play an important role in light manipulation since diatoms are often in environments where light is not easily available to perform photosynthesis de tommasi 2016 as in lipids rs studies concerning the constitution and conformation of the frustule are few but the technique was proven to be very effective for that purpose studies involving the rs of the frustule usually require the oxidation of the organic material as expected the results showed a general prevalence of bands assigned to siliceous materials in all the studies yuan et al 2004 kammer et al 2010 de tommasi 2016 arasuna and okuno 2018 biswas et al 2018 however bands attributed to other unknown inorganic compounds were also observed in addition bands related to vibrations of some trace organic molecules appeared in the diatoms stephanopyxis turris kammer et al 2010 and coscinodiscus wailesii fig 4iv de tommasi et al 2018 these can possibly be due to the presence of impurities that absorb uv radiation and consequently protect the cell de tommasi et al 2018 interestingly spectral data from the frustule of the centric diatom coscinodiscus wailesii showed some additional bands assigned to sulphur bonds de tommasi 2016 de tommasi et al 2018 these sulphur compounds might be related to the important role of diatoms in the global sulphur cycle diatoms produce dimethyl sulphide dms that is emitted to the atmosphere and contributes to cloud condensation and solar radiation scattering this variation in radiation balances the light reaching the earth thus influencing phytoplankton growth simó 2001 the sulphur compounds can also act as precursors for the biosynthesis of silica de tommasi 2016 de tommasi et al 2018 details on the bands associated with molecular vibrations of frustule species tested spectral profile and the respective mode assignments are listed in table s3 supplementary data from an environmental point of view frustule silicification is affected by various abiotic factors such as salinity heavy metals temperature ph nutrient conditions and light reviewed in su et al 2018 some shifts in frequency and differences in the intensity of frustule bands were found in two samples containing different diatom genera yuan et al 2004 which can be elicited by different processes of mineralization this is another indication that rs is a sound method to overcome limitations imposed by the taxonomic identification of diatoms in traditional ecological assessment though further studies involving its application to explore the effects of abiotic factors in frustules need to be conducted 2 4 other components apart from the molecules already described rs was also used to understand the constitution of eps and the detection of domoic acid da in diatoms in nature diatoms are mostly found within biofilms in conjunction with other organisms such as bacteria protozoa fungi and other algae in these biofilms diatoms are the most abundant group sabater et al 2007 salta et al 2013 battin et al 2016 furthermore they produce the major amount of eps which makes up from 50 to 90 of the inorganic mass in biofilms nielsen et al 1997 eps contributes to cell adhesion locomotion and colony formation reports about the use of rs to investigate eps characteristics can also be found in the literature a study about the eps of nitzschia palea laviale et al 2019 showed bands mainly assigned to proteins lipids and carbohydrates in another study mucilage bands released when the diatom is motionless and mucilage strands released when the diatom is gliding onto a surface of the diatom navicula sp were analysed fig 4vi chen et al 2019 as in n palea bands assigned to the amino acids phenylalanine at 594 and 599 cm 1 and tyrosine at 1612 and 1619 cm 1 as well as to polysaccharides at 1088 and 1090 cm 1 appeared on both types of mucilage additional bands were detected in mucilage strands at wave numbers 1437 cm 1 1655 cm 1 2882 cm 1 and 2936 cm 1 corresponding probably to carbohydrate bond vibrations chen et al 2019 table s4 supplementary data domoic acid was another substance investigated through rs this is a toxin produced by marine diatoms from the genus pseudonitzschia if ingested by humans indirectly through contamination of the food chain da causes a pathology named amnesic shellfish poisoning asp todd 1993 seafood contamination by da is usually detected by chemical separation from other interfering substances this method is time consuming and together with bioassays requires animal sacrifice therefore a faster and non invasive method as rs was needed to detect da and protect public health raman spectra of diatoms with da showed a strong resonance raman enhancement at 251 nm of the 1652 cm 1 vibrational band which was assigned to the coupling of the symmetric cc mode of this compound fig 4vi wu et al 2000 in fact the band 1652 cm 1 is more intense in the spectra of toxic algae than in the spectra of non toxic algae moreover a formula was proposed to determine da concentration relating the cross section band intensity and frequency of da with the same parameters and a known concentration of an internal standard wu et al 2000 the above results highlight the potential of rs to be applied in future studies of eps in the field of environmental diagnosis the eps constitutes a protective barrier slowing the diffusion of diverse toxic compounds such as metals or even antibiotics stewart 2003 spectral data may thus be useful to detect man made toxicants possibly present in this matrix and better understand their physiological impact on diatoms 3 diatoms as an innovative substrate for sers as mentioned above sers is a technique in which raman signals are enhanced by coating metals generally nanoparticles onto a surface baena and lendl 2004 this technique can be applied to a flat surface better enhancement factors however are obtained when it is applied onto a patterned surface by coating patterned surfaces with nanoparticles nps some of them might be placed inside or near dielectric microcavities and form hybrid photonic plasmonic modes white et al 2007 barth et al 2010 hu et al 2011 schmidt et al 2012 xu et al 2012 these modes increase the quality of the local electric field when coupling of the guided magnetic resonance gmr with the local surface plasmons lsps takes place enhancing rs signals cheng and scherer 1995 synthetic patterned surfaces are commercially available nevertheless the processes required to obtain such intricate nanostructures are very expensive yang et al 2014 diatoms offer a more cost effective and naturally available alternative owing to their naturally ornamented frustules kong et al 2016 three alternatives are available to coat the frustules of diatoms with nps the first is coating by physical processes such as deposition or immersion e g chamuah et al 2017 the second is based on chemical methods the substrate is immersed in a cleaning solution rca clean 1 1 5 h2o2 nh4oh h2o to remove organic contamination and particles and the sample is rinsed in water and methanol to create hydroxyl groups on the diatoms and the substrate frustules are then immersed in aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes and this compound bounds to the hydroxyl groups on the substrate the sample is then immersed in a colloidal solution of nps ren et al 2014 the third alternative is by in situ growth of nps for this the frustules of the diatoms are immersed in sncl2 and hcl for the deposition of sn2 these frustules are then immersed in agno3 promoting the growth of ag seeds finally the frustules are immersed in appropriate culture media kong et al 2016 the use of frustules as a substrate has many applications in the detection of all kinds of biomolecules in a variety of fields such as medicine food safety or environmental quality for example in medicine it can be used in immunoassays for the detection of interleukin 8 an inflammatory cytokine playing a role in breast cancer kamińska et al 2017 this method is recognized as offering better results than the traditional enzyme linked immunosorbent assays in the food industry coated frustules can be used to detect melamine in food which is illegally added to increase the protein content here sers detection shows a 3 fold enhancement compared to common rs in environmental quality it can be used for example to detect xylene a water and air pollutant offering a simpler and faster alternative to detection by the conventional gas chromatography method kong et al 2016 4 toxicity assessment employing raman spectroscopy to our knowledge rs was only used in two recent toxicity studies with diatoms one employed a technique called high throughput screening raman spectroscopy hts rs with automated location algorithms to detect the effects of dithiothreitol dtt in the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum dithiothreitol inhibits the xanthophyll cycle which is a mechanism of photoprotection rüger et al 2019 the authors conducted a chronic toxicity assay comprising groups with different combinations of dtt and light conditions control adequate light conditions with no dtt treatment hl high light conditions with dtt treatment and hl high light conditions with no dtt treatment through pls lda spectra from the different experimental conditions were compared to reference spectra and discriminated one and a half hours after inoculation hl was already separated from the other conditions rüger et al 2019 in this group exposed cells were found to change the most over time in comparison to the control according to the authors this occurred because inhibition of the xanthophyll cycle caused by dtt affected the photoprotection of the cells against the high light conditions and harmful singlet oxygen species at the beginning of the experiment hl cells showed a response pattern similar to the control however over time they tended to shift towards higher linear discriminant scores probably due to dtx enhancement elicited by high light conditions rüger et al 2019 in the other study sers and ri were used to investigate the incorporation of gold nanoparticles aunps with different diameters into the diatom stephanopyxis turris pytlik et al 2019 this work is especially relevant because information about the hazardous effects of metal nanoparticles in aquatic organisms is still scarce despite their increasing use in various technological and medical fields and potential for environmental contamination for diatoms in particular it is not yet clear how nanoparticles can affect the cells moreover the uptake mechanisms are not fully understood and their interpretation is mostly based on information obtained from other organisms navarro et al 2008 for the purpose of the experiment ri of the most intense bands assigned to pigments was used to estimate the shape of the cell whereas sers spectra of aunps were used to locate these compounds within the cells briefly aunps with dimensions above 50 nm were most frequently located inside the cell compared to smaller nanoparticles suggesting a size dependant mechanism requiring further investigation pytlik et al 2019 5 environmental diagnosis with diatom raman spectroscopy pros cons and prospective use in the toxicological works above the cell pigments were major contributors to the raman spectra detected raman parameters i e laser wavelength and power table 3 can also be set to avoid measurement of pigments and their possible masking effects this allows recording spectra and molecular fingerprints from other cellular components to bring further understanding on the effects of environmental toxicants on diatoms compared to the conventional endpoints rs based methods are usually a more expeditious technique to couple with exposure bioassays providing a wealth of data useful to characterize diatom responses to environmental stress raman spectroscopy has also been employed to analyse other types of microalgae to characterize their growth phases under laboratory simulated environmental conditions he et al 2018 a review of a large variety of microalgae studies employing mostly fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir suggested previously that vibrational spectroscopy analysis could be used in the screening and monitoring of aquatic systems akkas and severcan 2012 nevertheless compared to ftir rs typically gives rise to sharper bands ivleva et al 2017 favouring its choice for environmental monitoring and diagnosing raman spectroscopy is a well established technique routinely used as an analytical tool in chemistry biology and material science amongst others besides the sharper bands produced rs main advantages are table 2 i the simple inexpensive sample preparation required ii it is very sensitive to structural and chemical features of the samples even at the small extent and in low concentrations iii capability of chemical or structural based imaging as in other techniques rs also has some disadvantages related to the structure of biological molecules i the superposition of fluorescence signal usually found in biological molecules can hinder the raman signal from the sample attempts to overcome this problem are the use of a lower frequency excitation laser e g infrared to avoid electronic transitions the use of photobleaching procedure mentioned above ivleva et al 2017 minimizing their interference with pre and post processing steps such as background removal by suitable algorithms byrne et al 2016 or time gating to separate the faster raman scattering from the slower fluorescence emission lieber and mahadevan jansen 2003 ii in biological tissues raman spectra can exhibit poorly resolved bands this may occur because the structure of the different polyatomic groups varying slightly and the complex chemical composition of tissues and cells give rise to very close bands forming a broad continuum hindering band assignment iii high resolution raman imaging is a time consuming technique demanding long acquisition times over extended sample surface areas in fresh samples the water evaporation and sample oxidation caused by long acquisition times bring problems concerning the laser focus and sample movement despite the above limitations the high cost effectiveness in sample measurement and fast acquisition of a great number of variables i e frequency width and area of each raman band detected reflecting composition and physiological status rüger et al 2016 in so short a period makes rs a powerful analytical tool for use in the diagnosis of environmental health a summary of the pros and cons of diatom rs and the main diatom based methods in use or recently developed is given in table 2 calculation of autoecological indices based on taxonomic identification is the conventional method approved by regulatory frameworks in recent years other approaches have been sought as a way to avoid the various known limitations of autoecological indices including the high expertise necessary for species identification their regional specificity and need for previous knowledge of the ecological profile which strongly limits its widespread use morin et al 2016 pandey et al 2017 the most interesting recent methods are the trait based approach using life forms cell sizes and ecological guilds or functional groups and the metabarcoding sequencing table 2 as with rs such methods do not require taxonomic identification to the species level or can provide the identification themselves once the necessary supporting libraries are produced i e metabarcoding based on dna barcode reference libraries this is a huge advantage also for their global application avoiding the geographical limitations of autoecological indices raman spectroscopy also involves little sample preparation with no need for fixation oxidation or extraction of cellular components producing no hazardous chemical residuals compared to the other methods the fast band acquisition provided allows processing a relevant number of samples with considerably lower measurement time and costs table 2 furthermore rs reflects the molecular composition smith and dent 2019 of an individual and its physiological status rüger et al 2016 i e responses at lower organizational levels that can be used as early warning tools of ecosystem disruption useful to plan timely protection and management actions e g limitation of pollution inputs cleaning and or ecosystem restoration actions the possibility of chemical or structural based raman imaging with a spatial resolution comparable to those based on microscopy observations ivleva et al 2017 is also a significant advantage though this band imaging mapping is more time consuming it can usually be done with the automated configuration of the equipment and can add very interesting information in environmental studies ivleva et al 2017 an example here would be mapping the spatial distribution of organisms or toxicants in diatom biofilms overall however there is a lack of field studies concerning the application of diatom rs in diagnostic tests of environmental quality to develop a diagnosing protocol with diatom rs it is necessary to define adequate apparatus parameters inadequate laser wavelengths larger acquisition times and high laser power can cause alterations within the cell such as pigment rearrangements barletta et al 2015 or even loss of cellular viability hence preliminary experiments should be conducted to confirm the acquisition conditions providing the most adequate measurements in relation to the testing hypotheses the use of rrs and sers can also contribute to reducing the acquisition time minimizing the effects of phototoxicity ivleva et al 2017 hence firstly a suitable laser wavelength needs to be selected in general for biological studies near infrared lasers are extensively applied due to their low photon energy which contributes to lower levels of photodamage butler et al 2016 however the laser wavelength also depends on the cell component under analysis as indicated by the studies reviewed fig 7 presents laser wavelengths in relation to cell components retrieved from the studies reviewed in this work it is noticeable that rs studies about diatom pigments and frustule have mainly used blue and green lasers violet and infrared lasers have also been employed in the study of pigments as well as red and infrared lasers in frustules lipids have been evaluated using only infrared lasers while da raman signals have been enhanced only with an uv laser the molecular components of eps have been investigated using uv and green lasers additionally due to resonance phenomena different laser wavelengths enhance the measurement of different types of pigments according to their maximum absorption mccreery 2005 the laser wavelengths enhancing each type of pigment are described in table 3 apart from laser wavelength the selection of the microscope objective acquisition time laser power and spectral range are also important the selection of the objective depends on the detail and size of the component to be analysed regarding the spectral range according to the studies reviewed see supplementary data pigment bands appear from 340 to 1700 cm 1 lipid bands from 865 to 1800 cm 1 frustule bands from 373 to 3000 cm 1 eps bands from 594 to 3000 cm 1 and the da band corresponds to 1652 cm 1 the selection of the correct raman methodology and subsequent analysis of data is also important statistical methods such as pca pls da and artificial neural networks are useful to analyse raman data in diatoms under different environmental conditions meksiarun et al 2015 rüger et al 2019 providing significant results including sensitivity and specificity analysis for decision making towards mitigation and management actions in the target ecosystems although rs is a good technique to detect molecular and physiological changes in cells in relation to environmental stress rs bands of frustule and pigments can vary also depending on the diatom genera yuan et al 2004 wood et al 2005 abbas et al 2011 moreover only a few band assignments are yet available for diatom cellular components such assignments are highly effective to depict in deeper the physiological alterations elicited by exposure to chemical pollution and other environmental stressors such water acidification and factors related to climate changes they should thus also be a focus of future research overall a myriad of possibilities and experiments are opened to exploration by diatom rs 6 conclusion and future perspective the best methods to diagnose water quality using diatoms are time consuming often very expensive require much expertise and provide limited or no information useful to anticipate timely management actions towards protection or recovery of polluted ecosystems conversely application of raman spectroscopy to diatoms shows great potential to address these drawbacks it is an easy to use fast and cost effective method applicable to environmental diagnosis and routine monitoring enabling comparison amongst geographical regions and with the added possibility of providing crucial physiological information the information gathered here e g wavelengths parameter setting artefact corrections band assignments provides a solid foundation supporting the development of such studies

16976,diatom species are good pollution bioindicators due to their large distribution fast response to changes in environmental parameters and different tolerance ranges these organisms are used in ecological water assessment all over the world using autoecological indices such assessments commonly rely on the taxonomic identification of diatom species specific shape and frustule ornaments from which cell counts species richness and diversity indices can be estimated taxonomic identification is however time consuming and requires years of expertise additionally though the diatom autoecological indices are region specific they are often applied indiscriminately across regions raman spectroscopy is a simpler fast and label free technique that can be applied to environmental diagnosis with diatoms however this approach has been poorly explored this work reviews raman spectroscopy studies involving the structure location and conformation of diatom cell components and their variation under different conditions a critical appreciation of the pros and cons of its application to environmental diagnosis is also given this knowledge provides a strong foundation for the development of environmental protocols using raman spectroscopy in diatoms our work aims at stimulating further research on the application of raman spectroscopy as a tool to assess physiological

identification is made through diatom floras based on their siliceous cell wall the frustule which has ornaments differing amongst species fig 1 germain 1981 pandey et al 2017 in europe according to the water framework directive wfd diatoms are a biological element of the aquatic flora of obligatory evaluation for the ecological assessment of watercourses in european union countries directive 2000 diatoms are also used in routine water monitoring surveys in other parts of the world such as canada usa japan south america and australia unesco who unep 1996 the traditional methods for assessing water quality using diatoms are based on taxonomic identification and valve counting pandey et al 2017 pinto et al 2020 the species abundance is then used for the calculation of autoecological indexes such as for example the ips indice de polluosensibilité spécifique cemagref 1982 or ibd indice biologique diatomées coste et al 2009 this approach has some drawbacks since it is time consuming taxa are recurrently changing and taxonomic identification requires many years of expertise additionally ecological indexes are sometimes region specific and consequently can be applied inaccurately morin et al 2016 raman spectroscopy rs is a promising alternative technique for application to monitoring and diagnostic testing with diatoms in the biological analysis this technique has many advantages in relation to other methods because it is label free and it requires minimal or simple sample preparation and processing heraud et al 2007 water is also a low raman scatterer so its interference can be minimized parker 1983 furthermore the inherent fluorescence of the organic compounds that often superimpose and hinder the raman signal can be minimized using a suitable laser wavelength typically with a low frequency such as near infrared laser or minimize its effect through photobleaching ivleva et al 2017 the technique was first described in 1928 and is based on the inelastically scattered radiation resulting of an incident electromagnetic beam with a well defined excitation wavelength ranging from near infrared to uv by molecular vibrations in the sample raman krishnan 1928 fig 2 shows the vibrational energy level diagram showing the energy states involved in the light scattering process the vast majority of the photons are elastically scattered i e no change in energy when they interact with the molecules rayleigh scattering smith and dent 2019 yet only a small part 1 106 of these photons are inelastically scattered though this probably depends on the polarizability tensor for a given vibration smith and dent 2019 raman scattering is a type of inelastic light scattering by molecular vibrations in which the energy of the incident photon νi can be either higher or lower than the energy of the scattered photon νs resulting on positive or negative frequency shifts stokes or anti stokes raman scattering respectively smith and dent 2019 the lower panel of fig 2 shows a schematic representation of the rayleigh stokes and anti stokes components of an experimental raman spectrum the difference between the scattered and the incident frequencies is a direct measurement of the vibration frequency for anti stokes and for stokes processes 1 ν s ν i ν v where νv is the vibration frequency smith and dent 2019 usually spectroscopists refer to vibrations by their wavenumber 2 ν ν v c where c is the light speed and ν is expressed in cm 1 this quantity is often still designated as frequency using the typical approximation of c 1 smith and dent 2019 according to eq 1 raman bands associated with a vibrational transition whether stokes or anti stokes are systematically located in relation to the rayleigh band where its central position is assumed to be the origin of the wave number scale thus the raman shift is a direct measurement of the frequency of the molecular vibration smith and dent 2019 since the stokes process is more probable to occur than the anti stokes it has a higher intensity and therefore only the stokes part of the spectra is usually recorded at room temperature smith and dent 2019 the raman signature of a sample gives information regarding its chemical and structural properties thus both external or internal parameters can influence the spectral profile i band position is determined by the dynamics of the vibrating system namely chemical bond strength and bond length ii the bandwidth measured by the band full width at half maximum is usually associated with the disorder which can be chemical i e slight changes of the chemical species or structural i e slight changes of the bond lengths iii the appearance disappearance of bands evidence for changes in the chemical composition e g formation of new bonds due to chemical reactions or structural transitions assigned to different molecules conformations and links in the molecular structure such as hydration sometimes the application of rs is limited due to the low raman cross sections of the molecules and the low power of the incident laser typically below 1 mw to avoid sample damaging which may result in a low scattered signal shahbazyan and stockman 2013 or the high fluorescence characteristic of some biological samples which may hinder the raman signal byrne et al 2016 to overcome these problems some variations of rs can also be used namely the resonant raman spectroscopy rrs and the surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers though the resulting rrs or sers spectra can be deeply changed when compared to the normal raman spectra in the resonant raman spectroscopy the energy of the incident laser radiation matches the electronic transitions of a given compound in some cases the electronic transitions couple with vibrational ones strongly enhancing the scattering intensity of the corresponding raman bands 102 to 106 fold fig 2 ivleva et al 2017 a relevant case of resonant raman for biology is that of the conjugated double bonds as in carotenoids when an excitation green 532 nm laser is used for the measurement therefore the electrons in conjugated double bonds are highly polarizable which explains their high raman cross sections and high raman intensities this was observed for example for carotenoids in diatom studies premvardhan et al 2009 2010 intensity enhancement of the raman scattered radiation can also be achieved by using plasmonic processes typically using metallic surfaces or metallic micro nanoparticles giving rise to the surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers baena and lendl 2004 in this case the excitation of plasmonic particles by the incident radiation creates strong local electric fields near the surface of metallic structures giving rise to strong scattering processes note that sers is most frequently used in studies where diatoms are used as biosensors rather than as the direct organism under investigation in sers diatom frustules are used as a substrate for the nanometallic surface and act as biosensors to detect the presence of other substances e g kamińska et al 2017 in the case of diatoms as study organisms similarly to other types of microalgae he et al 2018 the main spectral information obtained through rs are bands assigned to photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments chlorophylls chls a and c and carotenoids such as fucoxanthin fx diadinoxanthin ddx and diatoxanthin dtx e g premvardhan et al 2009 2010 alexandre et al 2014 raman spectroscopy also enables the possibility to obtain spectral

2000 studies concerning direct rs applications in diatoms are mainly focused on understanding the diversity of structures and conformations of the main molecules within the cell the location of molecules within the cell the optimal abiotic conditions to enhance the production of lipids to be used in the biofuel industry and the variation of pigmentation under different light conditions raman spectroscopy is frequently complemented by raman imaging ri raman imaging consists of taking several raman spectra covering a certain area and mapping a certain band parameter interest intensity or frequency for example in that area with this method it is possible to locate components within the cell through colour schemes stewart et al 2012 usually the quantitative analyses of raman data consist of spectral deconvolution using multiple fitting models the simplest method to do this fitting consists of a sum of lorentzian functions defined by their position width and intensity different chemometrics methods for processing the spectral information can be used to analyse band variations such as principal component analysis pca or partial least squares discriminant analysis pls da meksiarun et al 2015 rüger et al 2019 despite the relatively high number of rs studies applied to diatoms these have been mostly done under controlled laboratory conditions whereas field environmental taxonomic and toxicological studies are lacking nevertheless this represents a promising approach since raman bands assigned to diatom cell components can vary with abiotic and physiological conditions it was previously demonstrated for instance that high co2 levels in the water can favour the production of fatty acids in the diatom thalassiosira pseudonana meksiarun et al 2014 or that the growth phases in the diatom ditylium brightwellii are accompanied by changes in raman bands assigned to carotenoids rüger et al 2016 the objective of this review is thus to describe the recent advances in rs applied to diatoms and comment on the evidence supporting the use of this technique as a tool for environmental diagnostic tests emphasis was given to the qualitative and quantitative analysis of cell constituents and rs application in diatom toxicity assays both of interest for the diagnostic testing of water quality and the environmental status of aquatic ecosystems 2 qualitative and quantitative analysis of cell components 2 1 pigments in diatoms as in other photosynthetic organisms exist two types of pigments chls and carotenoids kuczynska et al 2015 two types of chls represented in fig 3 are present chl a and chl c divided in chl c1 and chl c2 chlorophylls contain a porphyrin ring constituted by a magnesium coordination complex of cyclic tetrapyrroles and a fifth isocyclic ring jeffrey and vesk 2005 chlorophyll a fig 3a differs from the two types of chl c fig 3b and c in that it contains a long phytyl chain in the 17th position of the porphyrin ring chlorophyll c2 fig 3c differs from chl c1 fig 3b in that it contains a vinyl group in the 8th position of the porphyrin ring instead of an ethyl group wagner and waidelich 1986 fucoxanthin chlorophyll protein complexes fcps are also relevant for the study of diatom pigments fig 4 i presents rrs spectra of cyclotella meneghiniana fcps obtained at several laser excitation wavelengths premvardhan et al 2010 these oligomeric or trimeric complexes constitute the main light harvesting complexes in diatoms lavaud et al 2002 guglielmi et al 2005 lepetit et al 2010 through the raman spectra of fcps the characteristic spectral regions of chlorophylls and carotenoids can be identified raman spectra of chls in diatoms were first studied in 1986 in the species phaeodactylum tricornutum and gomphonema parvulum wagner and waidelich 1986 the raman spectra of chls are composed of three main spectral regions fig 4i cn breathing mode region 1300 to 1420 cm 1 the bands assigned to vinyl groups and the respective bonds with porphyrin groups 1580 to 1630 cm 1 and the bands assigned to in plane stretches or peripheral substituents such as c 13 keto carbonyl 1650 to 1700 cm 1 premvardhan et al 2010 chlorophylls can be classified in three groups based on their c 13 keto carbonyl groups weak hydrogen linkages giving rise to bands located between 1685 and 1705 cm 1 moderate hydrogen linkages with bands located between 1670 and 1680 cm 1 and strong hydrogen linkages with bands located between 1650 and 1665 cm 1 mimuro et al 1990 regarding carotenoids the most mentioned in rs studies are fx ddx and dtx fig 5 all carotenoids contain a conjugated polyene chain varying in the number of carbon atoms fig 5a c carotenoids fx and ddx have a 5 6 monoepoxide group fig 5a and b which is not present in dtx carotenoid fx contains a unique allenic bond fig 5a kuczynska et al 2015 spectral regions characteristic of carotenoids are also shown in fig 4i namely in the resonant raman spectra obtained for the excitation at 476 5 nm 1 the υ1 region located between 1500 to 1570 cm 1 assigned to cc stretching modes 2 the υ2 region located between 1140 to 1180 cm 1 assigned to cc stretching modes 3 the υ3 region located between 1000 and 1040 cm 1 assigned to ch3 in plain wagging modes and 4 the υ4 region located close to 950 980 cm 1 assigned to ch out of plain wagging modes alongside the main four regions of carotenoid spectra the spectral region corresponding to carbonyl groups around 1700 cm 1 can also be associated with carotenoids premvardhan et al 2009 in carotenoid raman spectra the region υ1 is a good marker of the length of the polyene chain while the region υ4 is a marker for the conformation of carotenoids lutz et al 1987 frank et al 2006 the position of the υ1 band is proportional to the length of the polyene conjugated chain merlin 1985 and is evidenced in fig 6 it was originally thought that fcps stoichiometry was 4 1 1 fx chl a chl c2 büchel 2003 however studies in fcp complexes isolated from the diatom cyclotella meneghiniana using rrs with other techniques have evidenced a different ratio according to the evidence gathered in these studies the band υ1 of fx in fcps is indicative of a polyene chain with about seven double bonds the low intensity of υ3 and υ4 bands indicates an all trans and planar conformation in both complexes premvardhan et al 2009 fig 4ii and iii furthermore it was also shown that differences in all regions of fx spectra indicate two types of fx red in lower energy regions two types of fx blue in higher energy regions and one to two types of fx green in intermediate energy regions indeed the wavelengths used for resonant excitation of the various types of fx were coincident with the 0 0 and 0 1 of the electroabsorption spectrum premvardhan et al 2009 the two types of fx red were detected on both oligomeric and trimeric fcps when 540 and 550 nm lasers are used as excitation the presence of a shoulder on the lower energy side of the υ1 band fig 4iih i and the presence of two carbonyl bands 1647 and 1655 cm 1 that vary in intensity between the two wavelengths fig 4iiif g were indicative of two types of fx red premvardhan et al 2009 the small downshift of the υ1 band and the broadening of the carbonyl band at 514 5 nm fig 4iif have suggested the existence of at least one type of fx green premvardhan et al 2009 in trimeric fcp the carbonyl band 1642 cm 1 was associated with one of the types of fx green fig 4iiid whereas the other type of fx green was evidenced by the apparent increase in intensity of the 1645 cm 1 band with excitation wavelength of 528 7 nm and 496 5 nm fig 4iiic e premvardhan et al 2009 in oligomeric fcp there was also an evidence of two types of fx green one suggested by the shoulder 1647 cm 1 at an excitation wavelength of 528 7 nm fig 4iiie and the other one suggested by the increase in full width at half maximum of the υ1 band and the decrease of the energy separation of the doublet υ3 at an excitation wavelength at 488 and 496 5 nm fig 4iid e premvardhan et al 2009 in oligomeric fcp the lower frequency of the υ1 band fig 4iiid g indicated differences between the molecular conformation of the fx green between trimeric and oligomeric fcp premvardhan et al 2009 also different frequencies in trimeric fcp together with a lower full width at half maximum of the υ1 band with excitation wavelength at 413 7 and 441 6 nm were found to indicate the presence of a fx blue fig 4iia premvardhan et al 2009 for chls the results are represented in fig 4i there were two c 13 keto carbonyl bands characteristic of chl c2 in raman spectra of fcp one with moderate hydrogen bonds 1675 cm 1 in both trimeric and oligomeric fcps and another one with very weak hydrogen bonds 1695 cm 1 in trimeric fcp and 1690 cm 1 in oligomeric fcp fig 4id also there were two bands characteristic of cn breathing modes in chl c2 1355 cm 1 in oligomeric fcp 1360 cm 1 in trimeric fcp and 1362 cm 1 in both oligomeric and trimeric fcps fig 4id altogether these data pointed out the existence of two types of chl c2 differing also between trimeric and oligomeric fcps when considering the c 13 keto carbonyl groups in chl a of trimeric fcp there were three bands to be considered at an excitation wavelength of 406 7 nm 1654 cm 1 corresponding to strong hydrogen bonds 1677 cm 1 corresponding to medium hydrogen bonds and 1688 cm 1 corresponding to weak hydrogen bonds fig 4ia premvardhan et al 2010 the broadening and higher intensity of the bands at the incident wavelength of 413 1 nm with a higher full width at half maximum indicated the existence of more than one type of chl a two to three with weak or no hydrogen bonds three with moderate hydrogen bonds and two to three with strong hydrogen bonds fig 4ib besides these the broader and less structured bands between 1650 and 1700 cm 1 in oligomeric fcp indicate the existence of other distinguishable types of chl a figs 4ia b premvardhan et al 2010 furthermore chl a can be classified into blue soret and red absorbing species depending on the bands that were more enhanced at a wavelength of 406 7 nm in opposition to those that were enhanced at a wavelength of 413 1 and 441 6 nm the methine bridge mode of red chl a appears close to 1610 cm 1 at an excitation wavelength of 413 1 and 441 6 nm in both fcps figs 4ib c and the blue chl a appears as a shoulder at 1615 cm 1 at 406 7 nm also in both fcps fig 4ia premvardhan et al 2010 the remaining carotenoids ddx and dtx play an important role in the photoprotection of the diatoms from the large light variations caused by caudal changes tides and their position in the water column alexandre et al 2014 these carotenoids are involved in two photoprotection mechanisms non photochemical quenching npq chl a fluorescence grouneva et al 2008 and the xanthophyll cycle in the xanthophyll cycle under high light hl conditions a de epoxidation occurs converting ddx into dtx stransky and hager 1970 diatoxanthin contributes to the dissipation of excess energy and capture of harmful singlet oxygen species rüger et al 2019 low light ll conditions favour the inverse reaction goss et al 2006 grouneva et al 2008 variation of ddx and dtx with different light conditions was studied in the diatom cyclotella meneghiniana using rs in comparison with high performance liquid chromatography hplc results alexandre et al 2014 for rs recording cells were concentrated and dropped in a microscope slide as the chlorophyll content did not change with light conditions in either of the analytical techniques the chlorophyll b and 1555 cm 1 was used as a normalization to estimate the carotenoid content carotenoid spectra differed the most between ll and hl conditions in the spectral ranges υ1 υ3 and υ4 under hl the υ1 region increased in amplitude 1 8 times at an excitation wavelength of 413 1 nm and 1 5 times at an excitation wavelength of 441 6 nm compared to ll as the content in carotenoids in the hplc increased about 1 42 times the authors concluded the 441 6 nm excitation wavelength was the best for the quantification of carotenoids due to the similar increase in amplitude in the hplc the increase in carotenoids under hl conditions was due to higher levels of ddx dtx since dtx has a longer polyene conjugated chain than ddx alexandre et al 2014 increases in the content of dtx relatively to ddx are accompanied by a red shift in the frequency of the υ1 band merlin 1985 these red shifts occur in almost every spectrum under every excitation wavelength registered under hl conditions in the second part of the study normalization to the υ1 region of carotenoid spectra was done to understand the conformation of the carotenoids through the analysis of the υ4 region the authors observed that in cells under hl conditions there was an increased intensity of the 983 cm 1 band compared to ll conditions probably indicating a twisted dtx related to a bounded protein also at an excitation wavelength of 496 5 nm resonant with ddx there was a shifting from 980 cm 1 to 983 cm 1 of the υ4 band and an increase in the band intensity was observed under hl compared to ll alexandre et al 2014 this was interpreted as an indication of a new more distorted and complexly protein bound pool of ddx under hl conditions a similar study was carried out using coherent anti stokes raman scattering cars and rs to investigate carotenoid location and content in the diatoms ditylum brightwellii and stephanopyxis turris legesse et al 2018 cells were immobilized with poly l lysine onto caf2 slides in general cars and rs also detected an increase in carotenoids concentration between ll and hl conditions in both diatoms raman spectroscopy was also used to characterize marennine and marennine like pigments inside alive diatom specimens and extracted in solution gastineau et al 2012 2016 marennine is a blue pigment characteristic of the diatom haslea ostrearia and it is observed also in oysters feeding on this species gastineau et al 2014 other diatoms of the genus haslea have similar blue pigments though different in structure raman detected differences in marennine from haslea ostrearia relative to other marennine like pigments within the wave number range 1240 1420 cm 1 gastineau et al 2012 2016 the structure and biosynthesis of marennine are still unknown nevertheless it has been hypothesized that this pigment is greatly produced depending on light conditions nutrient deficiencies or salt induced stress gastineau et al 2014 this pigment can be used as a blue dye in the food and cosmetic industries and has anti inflammatory properties carlson et al 1985 collin et al 2001 bretéché et al 2002 the bands associated with the vibration of pigments species tested spectral profile and the respective mode assignments made in the studies above are presented in table s1 supplementary data it is important to understand that pigment contents can change not only with light conditions but also with other environmental or physiological conditions kuczynska et al 2015 more studies are thus required to understand variation in rs bands of diatom pigments in relation to other factors this will allow developing faster and easier tools for environmental assessment and diagnostic tests additionally some rs studies point out that the pigment bands may differ amongst taxa wood et al 2005 abbas et al 2011 and growth phases rüger et al 2016 if so rs could be used to compensate the inherent constraints in taxonomic identification of diatoms and to assess the influence of stress conditions on their growth phases 2 2 lipids in diatoms lipids are stored in specific organelles called lipid bodies liu and benning 2013 goold et al 2015 zienkiewicz et al 2016 lipid bodies occupy a large portion of the cell volume supriya et al 2012 variable amongst species maeda et al 2017 enhanced lipid production is usually associated with exposure to environmental stress such as ph variations temperature light intensity nitrogen carbon silica phosphorus iron and salinity supriya et al 2012 this occurs because under stress conditions lipids act like secondary sources of energy necessary to maintain membrane functions and cell signalling pathways hu et al 2008 a rs study of lipid pool variation in relation to different nitrogen sources i e sodium nitrate and urea was performed in diatoms of the genus nitzschia measurements were made on cells placed directly under the raman microscope after seven days of experiments the authors detected changes in bands assigned to lipids associated with changes in the lipid pool due to changes in the nitrogen source supriya et al 2012 similar studies conjugating rs with chemometric techniques were performed directly on individuals of the species thalassiosira pseudonana placed on a petri dish with a quartz bottom meksiarun et al 2014 2015 and in purified fatty acids extracts meksiarun et al 2015 the objective was to determine changes in lipid composition and concentration under different stress conditions the authors used a ratiometric method based on the ratio of two band intensities the band 1660 cm 1 which corresponded to the number of cc present in lipids and the band 1440 cm 1 assigned to ch2 bending modes they discovered that diatom lipids are mostly recorded between palmitic and linoleic acid suggesting that many of their fatty acid chains contain one to two double bonds since diatoms have triglycerides with varied compositions in their fatty acid chains a conventional ratiometric method would hardly reflect all this variety to better characterize these molecules the authors performed a pca comparing spectral data from pure fatty acid chains and diatom samples the spectra recorded from diatom samples were mostly related to the spectra of myristic acid 14 carbon 0 double bond palmitic acid 16 carbon 0 double bond palmitoleic acid 16 carbon 1 double bond and eicosapentaenoic acid 20 carbon 5 double bond data from the two other fatty acids tested linoleic and oleic acids were not related to the lipid spectra of the diatom additionally raman ordinary least squares raman ols method was used to determine lipid quantities under seven different conditions control iron abundance and shortage carbon dioxide abundance and shortage and nitrogen abundance and shortage meksiarun et al 2015 lipids were divided into three groups based on the ratio of saturated myristic and palmitic acids to unsaturated fatty acid chains palmitoleic and eicosapentaenoic acids saturated fatty acid dominated sfd unsaturated fatty acid dominated ufd and saturated unsaturated fatty acid transformation suft the results obtained are shown in table 1 reflecting changes in lipid groups of diatom populations exposed to the different experimental conditions relative to the control there was an increase in sfd in all conditions tested a decrease in ufd was also observed in all conditions tested although less remarkable in the case of iron shortage regarding suft iron shortage induced a suft reduction while iron abundance carbon dioxide abundance and shortage and nitrogen starvation elicited a suft increase meksiarun et al 2015 in another study from the same authors fatty acid production was found to increase with the increase in carbon dioxide meksiarun et al 2014 although these rs studies were mainly performed to evaluate the optimal conditions for the mass production of unsaturated lipids in the biofuel industry this knowledge could be used in environmental diagnosis where alterations in lipid bands could be related to stressful aquatic conditions the bands associated with molecular vibrations of lipids species tested spectral profile and the respective mode assignments in the studies above are presented in table s2 supplementary data 2 3 frustule the most distinctive feature in diatoms is the frustule the frustule is a siliceous cell wall that protects the cell against all kinds of stress factors such as mechanical pressure xenobiotics environmental changes and grazing townley 2011 furthermore it has photonic crystal properties fuhrmann et al 2004 such properties can play an important role in light manipulation since diatoms are often in environments where light is not easily available to perform photosynthesis de tommasi 2016 as in lipids rs studies concerning the constitution and conformation of the frustule are few but the technique was proven to be very effective for that purpose studies involving the rs of the frustule usually require the oxidation of the organic material as expected the results showed a general prevalence of bands assigned to siliceous materials in all the studies yuan et al 2004 kammer et al 2010 de tommasi 2016 arasuna and okuno 2018 biswas et al 2018 however bands attributed to other unknown inorganic compounds were also observed in addition bands related to vibrations of some trace organic molecules appeared in the diatoms stephanopyxis turris kammer et al 2010 and coscinodiscus wailesii fig 4iv de tommasi et al 2018 these can possibly be due to the presence of impurities that absorb uv radiation and consequently protect the cell de tommasi et al 2018 interestingly spectral data from the frustule of the centric diatom coscinodiscus wailesii showed some additional bands assigned to sulphur bonds de tommasi 2016 de tommasi et al 2018 these sulphur compounds might be related to the important role of diatoms in the global sulphur cycle diatoms produce dimethyl sulphide dms that is emitted to the atmosphere and contributes to cloud condensation and solar radiation scattering this variation in radiation balances the light reaching the earth thus influencing phytoplankton growth simó 2001 the sulphur compounds can also act as precursors for the biosynthesis of silica de tommasi 2016 de tommasi et al 2018 details on the bands associated with molecular vibrations of frustule species tested spectral profile and the respective mode assignments are listed in table s3 supplementary data from an environmental point of view frustule silicification is affected by various abiotic factors such as salinity heavy metals temperature ph nutrient conditions and light reviewed in su et al 2018 some shifts in frequency and differences in the intensity of frustule bands were found in two samples containing different diatom genera yuan et al 2004 which can be elicited by different processes of mineralization this is another indication that rs is a sound method to overcome limitations imposed by the taxonomic identification of diatoms in traditional ecological assessment though further studies involving its application to explore the effects of abiotic factors in frustules need to be conducted 2 4 other components apart from the molecules already described rs was also used to understand the constitution of eps and the detection of domoic acid da in diatoms in nature diatoms are mostly found within biofilms in conjunction with other organisms such as bacteria protozoa fungi and other algae in these biofilms diatoms are the most abundant group sabater et al 2007 salta et al 2013 battin et al 2016 furthermore they produce the major amount of eps which makes up from 50 to 90 of the inorganic mass in biofilms nielsen et al 1997 eps contributes to cell adhesion locomotion and colony formation reports about the use of rs to investigate eps characteristics can also be found in the literature a study about the eps of nitzschia palea laviale et al 2019 showed bands mainly assigned to proteins lipids and carbohydrates in another study mucilage bands released when the diatom is motionless and mucilage strands released when the diatom is gliding onto a surface of the diatom navicula sp were analysed fig 4vi chen et al 2019 as in n palea bands assigned to the amino acids phenylalanine at 594 and 599 cm 1 and tyrosine at 1612 and 1619 cm 1 as well as to polysaccharides at 1088 and 1090 cm 1 appeared on both types of mucilage additional bands were detected in mucilage strands at wave numbers 1437 cm 1 1655 cm 1 2882 cm 1 and 2936 cm 1 corresponding probably to carbohydrate bond vibrations chen et al 2019 table s4 supplementary data domoic acid was another substance investigated through rs this is a toxin produced by marine diatoms from the genus pseudonitzschia if ingested by humans indirectly through contamination of the food chain da causes a pathology named amnesic shellfish poisoning asp todd 1993 seafood contamination by da is usually detected by chemical separation from other interfering substances this method is time consuming and together with bioassays requires animal sacrifice therefore a faster and non invasive method as rs was needed to detect da and protect public health raman spectra of diatoms with da showed a strong resonance raman enhancement at 251 nm of the 1652 cm 1 vibrational band which was assigned to the coupling of the symmetric cc mode of this compound fig 4vi wu et al 2000 in fact the band 1652 cm 1 is more intense in the spectra of toxic algae than in the spectra of non toxic algae moreover a formula was proposed to determine da concentration relating the cross section band intensity and frequency of da with the same parameters and a known concentration of an internal standard wu et al 2000 the above results highlight the potential of rs to be applied in future studies of eps in the field of environmental diagnosis the eps constitutes a protective barrier slowing the diffusion of diverse toxic compounds such as metals or even antibiotics stewart 2003 spectral data may thus be useful to detect man made toxicants possibly present in this matrix and better understand their physiological impact on diatoms 3 diatoms as an innovative substrate for sers as mentioned above sers is a technique in which raman signals are enhanced by coating metals generally nanoparticles onto a surface baena and lendl 2004 this technique can be applied to a flat surface better enhancement factors however are obtained when it is applied onto a patterned surface by coating patterned surfaces with nanoparticles nps some of them might be placed inside or near dielectric microcavities and form hybrid photonic plasmonic modes white et al 2007 barth et al 2010 hu et al 2011 schmidt et al 2012 xu et al 2012 these modes increase the quality of the local electric field when coupling of the guided magnetic resonance gmr with the local surface plasmons lsps takes place enhancing rs signals cheng and scherer 1995 synthetic patterned surfaces are commercially available nevertheless the processes required to obtain such intricate nanostructures are very expensive yang et al 2014 diatoms offer a more cost effective and naturally available alternative owing to their naturally ornamented frustules kong et al 2016 three alternatives are available to coat the frustules of diatoms with nps the first is coating by physical processes such as deposition or immersion e g chamuah et al 2017 the second is based on chemical methods the substrate is immersed in a cleaning solution rca clean 1 1 5 h2o2 nh4oh h2o to remove organic contamination and particles and the sample is rinsed in water and methanol to create hydroxyl groups on the diatoms and the substrate frustules are then immersed in aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes and this compound bounds to the hydroxyl groups on the substrate the sample is then immersed in a colloidal solution of nps ren et al 2014 the third alternative is by in situ growth of nps for this the frustules of the diatoms are immersed in sncl2 and hcl for the deposition of sn2 these frustules are then immersed in agno3 promoting the growth of ag seeds finally the frustules are immersed in appropriate culture media kong et al 2016 the use of frustules as a substrate has many applications in the detection of all kinds of biomolecules in a variety of fields such as medicine food safety or environmental quality for example in medicine it can be used in immunoassays for the detection of interleukin 8 an inflammatory cytokine playing a role in breast cancer kamińska et al 2017 this method is recognized as offering better results than the traditional enzyme linked immunosorbent assays in the food industry coated frustules can be used to detect melamine in food which is illegally added to increase the protein content here sers detection shows a 3 fold enhancement compared to common rs in environmental quality it can be used for example to detect xylene a water and air pollutant offering a simpler and faster alternative to detection by the conventional gas chromatography method kong et al 2016 4 toxicity assessment employing raman spectroscopy to our knowledge rs was only used in two recent toxicity studies with diatoms one employed a technique called high throughput screening raman spectroscopy hts rs with automated location algorithms to detect the effects of dithiothreitol dtt in the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum dithiothreitol inhibits the xanthophyll cycle which is a mechanism of photoprotection rüger et al 2019 the authors conducted a chronic toxicity assay comprising groups with different combinations of dtt and light conditions control adequate light conditions with no dtt treatment hl high light conditions with dtt treatment and hl high light conditions with no dtt treatment through pls lda spectra from the different experimental conditions were compared to reference spectra and discriminated one and a half hours after inoculation hl was already separated from the other conditions rüger et al 2019 in this group exposed cells were found to change the most over time in comparison to the control according to the authors this occurred because inhibition of the xanthophyll cycle caused by dtt affected the photoprotection of the cells against the high light conditions and harmful singlet oxygen species at the beginning of the experiment hl cells showed a response pattern similar to the control however over time they tended to shift towards higher linear discriminant scores probably due to dtx enhancement elicited by high light conditions rüger et al 2019 in the other study sers and ri were used to investigate the incorporation of gold nanoparticles aunps with different diameters into the diatom stephanopyxis turris pytlik et al 2019 this work is especially relevant because information about the hazardous effects of metal nanoparticles in aquatic organisms is still scarce despite their increasing use in various technological and medical fields and potential for environmental contamination for diatoms in particular it is not yet clear how nanoparticles can affect the cells moreover the uptake mechanisms are not fully understood and their interpretation is mostly based on information obtained from other organisms navarro et al 2008 for the purpose of the experiment ri of the most intense bands assigned to pigments was used to estimate the shape of the cell whereas sers spectra of aunps were used to locate these compounds within the cells briefly aunps with dimensions above 50 nm were most frequently located inside the cell compared to smaller nanoparticles suggesting a size dependant mechanism requiring further investigation pytlik et al 2019 5 environmental diagnosis with diatom raman spectroscopy pros cons and prospective use in the toxicological works above the cell pigments were major contributors to the raman spectra detected raman parameters i e laser wavelength and power table 3 can also be set to avoid measurement of pigments and their possible masking effects this allows recording spectra and molecular fingerprints from other cellular components to bring further understanding on the effects of environmental toxicants on diatoms compared to the conventional endpoints rs based methods are usually a more expeditious technique to couple with exposure bioassays providing a wealth of data useful to characterize diatom responses to environmental stress raman spectroscopy has also been employed to analyse other types of microalgae to characterize their growth phases under laboratory simulated environmental conditions he et al 2018 a review of a large variety of microalgae studies employing mostly fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir suggested previously that vibrational spectroscopy analysis could be used in the screening and monitoring of aquatic systems akkas and severcan 2012 nevertheless compared to ftir rs typically gives rise to sharper bands ivleva et al 2017 favouring its choice for environmental monitoring and diagnosing raman spectroscopy is a well established technique routinely used as an analytical tool in chemistry biology and material science amongst others besides the sharper bands produced rs main advantages are table 2 i the simple inexpensive sample preparation required ii it is very sensitive to structural and chemical features of the samples even at the small extent and in low concentrations iii capability of chemical or structural based imaging as in other techniques rs also has some disadvantages related to the structure of biological molecules i the superposition of fluorescence signal usually found in biological molecules can hinder the raman signal from the sample attempts to overcome this problem are the use of a lower frequency excitation laser e g infrared to avoid electronic transitions the use of photobleaching procedure mentioned above ivleva et al 2017 minimizing their interference with pre and post processing steps such as background removal by suitable algorithms byrne et al 2016 or time gating to separate the faster raman scattering from the slower fluorescence emission lieber and mahadevan jansen 2003 ii in biological tissues raman spectra can exhibit poorly resolved bands this may occur because the structure of the different polyatomic groups varying slightly and the complex chemical composition of tissues and cells give rise to very close bands forming a broad continuum hindering band assignment iii high resolution raman imaging is a time consuming technique demanding long acquisition times over extended sample surface areas in fresh samples the water evaporation and sample oxidation caused by long acquisition times bring problems concerning the laser focus and sample movement despite the above limitations the high cost effectiveness in sample measurement and fast acquisition of a great number of variables i e frequency width and area of each raman band detected reflecting composition and physiological status rüger et al 2016 in so short a period makes rs a powerful analytical tool for use in the diagnosis of environmental health a summary of the pros and cons of diatom rs and the main diatom based methods in use or recently developed is given in table 2 calculation of autoecological indices based on taxonomic identification is the conventional method approved by regulatory frameworks in recent years other approaches have been sought as a way to avoid the various known limitations of autoecological indices including the high expertise necessary for species identification their regional specificity and need for previous knowledge of the ecological profile which strongly limits its widespread use morin et al 2016 pandey et al 2017 the most interesting recent methods are the trait based approach using life forms cell sizes and ecological guilds or functional groups and the metabarcoding sequencing table 2 as with rs such methods do not require taxonomic identification to the species level or can provide the identification themselves once the necessary supporting libraries are produced i e metabarcoding based on dna barcode reference libraries this is a huge advantage also for their global application avoiding the geographical limitations of autoecological indices raman spectroscopy also involves little sample preparation with no need for fixation oxidation or extraction of cellular components producing no hazardous chemical residuals compared to the other methods the fast band acquisition provided allows processing a relevant number of samples with considerably lower measurement time and costs table 2 furthermore rs reflects the molecular composition smith and dent 2019 of an individual and its physiological status rüger et al 2016 i e responses at lower organizational levels that can be used as early warning tools of ecosystem disruption useful to plan timely protection and management actions e g limitation of pollution inputs cleaning and or ecosystem restoration actions the possibility of chemical or structural based raman imaging with a spatial resolution comparable to those based on microscopy observations ivleva et al 2017 is also a significant advantage though this band imaging mapping is more time consuming it can usually be done with the automated configuration of the equipment and can add very interesting information in environmental studies ivleva et al 2017 an example here would be mapping the spatial distribution of organisms or toxicants in diatom biofilms overall however there is a lack of field studies concerning the application of diatom rs in diagnostic tests of environmental quality to develop a diagnosing protocol with diatom rs it is necessary to define adequate apparatus parameters inadequate laser wavelengths larger acquisition times and high laser power can cause alterations within the cell such as pigment rearrangements barletta et al 2015 or even loss of cellular viability hence preliminary experiments should be conducted to confirm the acquisition conditions providing the most adequate measurements in relation to the testing hypotheses the use of rrs and sers can also contribute to reducing the acquisition time minimizing the effects of phototoxicity ivleva et al 2017 hence firstly a suitable laser wavelength needs to be selected in general for biological studies near infrared lasers are extensively applied due to their low photon energy which contributes to lower levels of photodamage butler et al 2016 however the laser wavelength also depends on the cell component under analysis as indicated by the studies reviewed fig 7 presents laser wavelengths in relation to cell components retrieved from the studies reviewed in this work it is noticeable that rs studies about diatom pigments and frustule have mainly used blue and green lasers violet and infrared lasers have also been employed in the study of pigments as well as red and infrared lasers in frustules lipids have been evaluated using only infrared lasers while da raman signals have been enhanced only with an uv laser the molecular components of eps have been investigated using uv and green lasers additionally due to resonance phenomena different laser wavelengths enhance the measurement of different types of pigments according to their maximum absorption mccreery 2005 the laser wavelengths enhancing each type of pigment are described in table 3 apart from laser wavelength the selection of the microscope objective acquisition time laser power and spectral range are also important the selection of the objective depends on the detail and size of the component to be analysed regarding the spectral range according to the studies reviewed see supplementary data pigment bands appear from 340 to 1700 cm 1 lipid bands from 865 to 1800 cm 1 frustule bands from 373 to 3000 cm 1 eps bands from 594 to 3000 cm 1 and the da band corresponds to 1652 cm 1 the selection of the correct raman methodology and subsequent analysis of data is also important statistical methods such as pca pls da and artificial neural networks are useful to analyse raman data in diatoms under different environmental conditions meksiarun et al 2015 rüger et al 2019 providing significant results including sensitivity and specificity analysis for decision making towards mitigation and management actions in the target ecosystems although rs is a good technique to detect molecular and physiological changes in cells in relation to environmental stress rs bands of frustule and pigments can vary also depending on the diatom genera yuan et al 2004 wood et al 2005 abbas et al 2011 moreover only a few band assignments are yet available for diatom cellular components such assignments are highly effective to depict in deeper the physiological alterations elicited by exposure to chemical pollution and other environmental stressors such water acidification and factors related to climate changes they should thus also be a focus of future research overall a myriad of possibilities and experiments are opened to exploration by diatom rs 6 conclusion and future perspective the best methods to diagnose water quality using diatoms are time consuming often very expensive require much expertise and provide limited or no information useful to anticipate timely management actions towards protection or recovery of polluted ecosystems conversely application of raman spectroscopy to diatoms shows great potential to address these drawbacks it is an easy to use fast and cost effective method applicable to environmental diagnosis and routine monitoring enabling comparison amongst geographical regions and with the added possibility of providing crucial physiological information the information gathered here e g wavelengths parameter setting artefact corrections band assignments provides a solid foundation supporting the development of such studies

energy performance compared with commercial scale desalination unclear relation between solar collecting area and membrane area and few discussions on efficient condensation etc to tackle these

only 2 5 of the total water on our blue planet is freshwater furthermore most of the freshwater exists in glaciers and ice caps which cannot be easily accessed eventually merely 1 2 of the freshwater can be exploited from the earth surface for the use in our daily life agriculture and industry gleick 1993 statistical study shows that about 4 billion people around the world encounter water deficiency at least 1 month per year and about half a billion of them suffer from water crisis all year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 seawater desalination can serve as a viable approach in some coastal places or islands where seawater is abundant in definition a desalination process separates freshwater and concentrated brine from a saline water source khawaji et al 2008 currently industrial scale desalination plants mostly adopting reverse osmosis ro multi effect distillation med and multi stage flash msf have already been installed all across the globe abdelkareem et al 2018 the latter two are the earliest generation of desalination technologies based on thermal distillation where a complete salt rejection is theoretically achievable upon cascading several stages or effects the vapor condensation heat in the previous stage or effect is effectively recovered by heat exchange with the feed stream in the next stage or effect on the other hand ro is based on membrane separation instead of demanding huge amounts of heat for evaporation and it actually takes up to 65 of the total installed desalination capacity gonzález et al 2017 mechanical compression is applied to overcome the osmotic pressure of the saline water to drive water across the semi permeable membrane while detaining ions the configuration with membranes allows for a substantial interfacial surface area that maintains a compact module the development in ro membranes permits higher water fluxes and the progress in ro energy recovery devices erd brings down the electricity consumption along with such improvements ro technology for desalination has thrived since 20 30 years ago greenlee et al 2009 despite the development and commercialization of the above mentioned industry scale desalination facilities distributed small scale desalination technology is yet to develop for some small communities in remote areas or isolated islands compact structure easy operation portable volume and high

requirement for vapor and the multi stage configuration lead to an inevitable large footprint of the whole system receding its applicability in small and compact devices guillén burrieza et al 2011 on the other hand ro representing the membrane separation process of seawater the pressurized process and low water recovery ratio are the main obstacles for distributed portable devices in small communities cabassud and balmann 2017 especially for some regions like gcc gulf cooperation council with relatively high salinity seawater amy et al 2017 the high sensitivity of the osmotic pressure to the salinity hinders the applicability of ro besides the erd in small ro systems is not as efficient as in industry scale ones resulting in a much higher consumption 1980 kwh m 3 in politano antonio et al 2016 membrane distillation md is an emerging technology for seawater desalination combining the merits of both the thermal distillation and the membrane separation drioli et al 2015 a hydrophobic microporous membrane is applied in md to physically segregate saline water feed side and freshwater or vapor permeate side the interfacial area is largely extended by the membrane allowing for a compact module design due to the surface hydrophobicity only vapor can diffuse through membrane pores from the feed side and then be collected on the permeate side thus a vapor pressure difference needs to be created between the two sides of the membrane but without an operating temperature close to the boiling point lawson and lloyd 1997 in such a configuration a total detention of salt and other non volatiles on the feed side is attainable under atmospheric pressure lawson and lloyd 1997 also due to the insensitivity of partial water vapor pressure to the salinity mericq et al 2009 high water recovery rate and low consumption increment in high salinity condition can be realized consequently md has been considered a suitable candidate for small scale compact systems for domestic applications in dispersed communities guillén burrieza et al 2011 another important aspect regarding the scattered population in remote coastal areas and isolated islands is the energy distribution without centralized power supply in general solar insolation in many of those regions is plentiful being an essential renewable energy source weber 2007 meanwhile for md the thermal energy demand is low grade usually between 30 c and 90 c cai and guo 2017 this operating temperature enables a potential combination of solar thermal energy and md besides solar energy can also be directly converted to electricity via photovoltaic pv technology to supply the required power in md systems conclusively a solar powered md system is one of the most promising desalination technologies in small scale distributed applications for the target remote areas indeed related research work has gained an uprising attention while the current desalination performance needs further improvement to be more competitive and thus one step closer to commercialization in this review paper the coupling of solar thermal collecting unit with md process in a distributed device solar collector area up to about 5 m2 will be firstly reviewed with emphases on specific energy consumption sec and freshwater production then the bottleneck of the system overall performance and the literature gap in previous studies will be highlighted and discussed finally perspectives on the measures to reduce energy consumption and to boost water production rate will be critically and systematically presented for future research considerations 2 small scale solar membrane distillation systems 2 1 membrane distillation as shown in fig 1 a hydrophobic microporous membrane generally made of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf or polypropylene pp alsebaeai et al 2020 is installed in the device between the feed and the permeate side because of the hydrophobicity of the membrane only vapor is allowed to pass through the pores moreover the working temperature of seawater on the feed side tf ranges from 30 c to 90 c cai and guo 2017 as long as a higher water vapor partial pressure is created against the permeate side the transmembrane vapor pressure difference generates vapor diffusion inside the pores and water evaporation on the membrane surface of the feed side due to the existence of thermal boundary layer the actual temperature on the membrane surface of the feed side tfm is often slightly lower than the feed bulk tf same phenomenon happens on the permeate side as well tpm tp except for the configuration of vacuum md vmd due to the total vacuum chamber created on permeate side and a uniform tv can be approximated for the permeate side temperature chiam and sarbatly 2013 these temperature polarizations could reduce the transmembrane vapor pressure difference and thus the distillation performance salt concentration polarization also takes place on the feed side cfm cf but the feed salinity seldom alters permeate flux in md khayet 2011 based on the configuration of the permeate side generally four basic types of md have been generally recognized in the literature alkhudhiri et al 2012 as illustrated in fig 2 in direct contact md dcmd fig 2a the lower partial vapor pressure on the permeate side is created by circulating cold distillate in the permeate channel overall the configuration resembles a normal plate heat exchanger where hot fluid and cold fluid flowing counter currently on the two sides its simple configuration brings popularity in md research long et al 2018 however contrary to heat exchangers the conductive heat through the membrane is considered as heat loss and should be diminished in dcmd this loss is usually significant due to the direct contact of the two liquid state sides and the membrane qtaishat et al 2008 jeopardizing the overall energy efficiency vmd fig 2b is statistically the second most studied configuration in the literature thomas et al 2017 where vacuum environment is applied on the permeate side md process occurs when the feed side is heated up to a temperature level with a vapor partial pressure higher than the vacuum pressure such a configuration allows for an adjustable permeate flux by controlling the vacuum sun et al 2014 more importantly the vacuum chamber of the permeate side significantly deters the conductive heat loss through the membrane alkhudhiri et al 2012 khayet 2011 the permeate vapor requires an external condensation for the same purpose of reduced heat loss and higher thermal efficiency air gap md agmd uses a stagnant air gap between the membrane and the permeate side fig 2c narayan and pitchumani 2020 water vapor permeates through the air gap and is then condensed on a cooled plate which enables a possible internal heat recovery by using cold feed to cool down the condenser plate droplets on the condenser plate is then collected outside of the module though transmembrane heat conduction is much decreased by the additional air gap mass transfer resistance is enhanced simultaneously leading to an attenuated permeate flux cho et al 2016 some innovative md modules also have been studied in the literature by altering the air gap in agmd such as permeate gap md pgmd using distillate to fill the gap cipollina et al 2012 swaminathan et al 2016a and material gap md mgmd the latter can be further specified by the material filled in the gap i e non conductive material gap sand sponge etc francis et al 2013 conductive material gap metal mesh swaminathan et al 2016a lastly sweeping gas md sgmd fig 2d applies a cold gas stream blowing out the vapor that permeates through the membrane same as vmd an outside condenser is needed to collect the vapor externally thomas et al 2017 at the scale of the module three main types have been reported the most based on those four md configurations plate and frame tubular and spiral wound as described in fig 3 plate and frame module fig 3a is the simplest among those where flat sheet membrane is often applied with spacers supporting the shape camacho et al 2013 feed channel and permeate channel are both flat box shaped separated by the membrane all four md configurations are suitable for plate and frame modules but the active membrane surface area per unit volume packing density of the module 400 800 m2 m 3 is relatively lower than the other two pangarkar et al 2014 the shape of tubular modules fig 3b resembles a shell and tube heat exchanger where hollow fiber membranes are installed inside the shell either the shell side or the lumen side of the hollow fibers can work as the feed channel some previous experimental study showed that higher permeate flux can be achieved with feed saline water flowing inside the lumen inside out wirth and cabassud 2002 compared with plate and frame modules the packing density of tubular modules is much higher 2000 5000 m2 m 3 pangarkar et al 2014 but the module complexity and the difficulty in membrane replacement are the major issues spiral wound modules are more specific and have mostly been applied to agmd or pgmd several layers of flat sheet membrane are wrapped in one module with a center tube collecting the permeate fig 3c schwinge et al 2004 the packing density of spiral wound modules is intermediate being 800 1200 m2 m 3 pangarkar et al 2014 and internal heat recovery is possible will be further introduced in section 4 2 however membrane replacement and cleaning can raise problems in such a module nevertheless md is still a thermal evaporation process that needs a heat supply of at least above the latent heat same as other thermal distillation process thus as stated in introduction low grade thermal energy more specifically solar energy via solar thermal collecting has been an important resource to provide heat for md systems in remote areas based on the relatively low operating temperature of md usually below 90 c vmd even lower miladi et al 2017 and its tolerance on temperature variations on the other hand solar energy can be easily converted to electricity source via pv panels to supply electrical energy for the pumping sensors monitoring etc indeed in the literature a pv system is often installed parallelly to a solar md module if an autonomous operation is desired banat et al 2007a 2007b ben abdallah et al 2013 bouguecha et al 2015 chafidz et al 2016 2014 fath et al 2008 frikha et al 2014 khan and martin 2015 moore et al 2018 raluy et al 2012 rodríguez et al 2013 saffarini et al 2012 comparatively the configuration of coupling md and solar thermal collectors is more various and more frequently studied this is probably because thermal consumption of md is usually much more significant than electrical consumption mericq et al 2011 and the approach to collect low grade thermal energy is more diverse 2 2 solar thermal collecting units for membrane distillation currently the solar collecting devices coupled with md are mostly non concentrating collectors their relatively low working temperature usually 100 c perfectly matches md operation and their low system cost and complexity add to the popularity in solar md demonstrations ma et al 2018 flat plate collectors fpc evacuated tube collectors etc and salinity gradient solar ponds sgsp are the three commonly seen types fpc and etc are widely applied in solar water heating systems an fpc normally uses a metal plate absorber plate with selective coating to absorb incident solar radiation and a glass cover to prevent convective and radiative heat loss working fluid flows in the channel that conductively adhered to the absorber plate and solar thermal energy is stored in the sensible heat of the fluid sarsam et al 2015 an etc can usually reach slightly higher solar thermal efficiency and higher temperature than fpc budihardjo et al 2007 water in glass type and heat pipe type are the two major forms of an etc both having a glass tube as the outer cover and a vacuum space inside the tube chow et al 2011 differently in the vacuum another glass tube carrying working medium is installed inside for the water in glass type with its outer surface coated with solar selective material liu et al 2013 while for the heat pipe type a coated metallic finned tube is installed inside the vacuum a phase change material evaporates inside the finned tube when heated by solar energy and then condenses when releasing heat to the storage tank by heat exchange elsheniti et al 2019 in most solar md applications the low grade solar thermal energy stored in fpc or etc is then extracted to heat up the feed seawater to power the desalination process via direct connection one loop system or heat exchanging two loop system as depicted in fig 4 comparatively two loop systems may prevent the corrosion problem by the seawater from solar collectors porrazzo et al 2013 while one loop systems are more suitable for small applications with lower system complexity and higher operation controllability koschikowski et al 2009 other than solar collectors sgsp have also been employed to couple with md in the literature nakoa et al 2015 an sgsp is one common type of a solar pond where solar energy is absorbed and stored in its bottom region to suppress the convection ranjan and kaushik 2014 warm brine with higher salinity is naturally positioned at the bottom due to its bigger density thus the conserved thermal energy can be extracted from the bottom brine leblanc et al 2011 therefore the natural salt content in seawater renders it a fair couple with sgsp for desalination from an industrial view currently the ranges of electricity and heat consumption per unit volume of water produced for ro med msf and md are depicted in fig 5 gopi et al 2019 though the electricity demand of md is less than the others the massively higher heat consumption impedes it from widespread application wang and chung 2015 therefore solar powered md is still hardly competitive with other solar desalination technologies in industry scale when electricity supply is stable and large areas of solar collectors can significantly elevate operating temperature such as pv ro and solar med consequently the levelized cost of water lcow of solar md was estimated to be 15 18 m 3 saffarini et al 2012 while the lcows of pv ro and solar med were undoubtedly lower being 6 5 9 1 m 3 and 2 6 6 5 m 3 respectively abdelkareem et al 2018 on the other hand solar md in small scale is advantageous over other desalination technologies due to its compact module low working temperature and easy operation etc as discussed in section 1 indeed most implemented solar md plants are in smaller scale than other solar desalination plants thomas et al 2017 moreover the distributed application for household desalination in remote place often demands lightweight and portability therefore the main scope of this article covers the research on solar md in small scale rather than large scale considering that the energy intensity of solar irradiation is usually between 400 and 800 w m 2 around the world li et al 2013 a 10 hour daytime can yield an energy intensity of 4 8 kwh m 2 knowing that the water evaporation heat is around 667 kwh m 3 3 6 l m 2 d 1 of water can be produced assuming a moderate solar thermal efficiency of 50 and no heat recovery the amount of water intake is estimated to be 2 3 l per person per day khan and martin 2015 thus 5 m2 of solar collecting area is probably able to meet the drinking water need of at least a 5 person household 10 15 l d 1 in total consequently the solar md research discussed in this work will be up to around 5 m2 of solar thermal collecting surface 2 3 research status on conventional small scale solar membrane distillation 2 3 1 major previous studies a considerable amount of work has been contributed to the subject of solar powered md for distributed desalination both theoretically and experimentally conventionally the solar collectors introduced in section 2 2 can be directly utilized to generate heat for md based on their simplicity and market availability 2 3 1 1 theoretical studies tracing back to 1991 hogan et al hogan et al 1991 theoretically studied an fpc powered tubular dcmd module with hollow fiber membranes targeting 50 l of freshwater per day the applied membrane area was 1 8 m2 and the installed fpc area was 3 m2 to provide the md heat demand in addition they considered a heat exchanger of 0 7 m2 between the retentate and the cold feed inlet to recover heat koschikowski et al koschikowski et al 2003 ran a simple simulation for a spiral wound agmd module with internal heat recovery the applied solar fpc area was 5 9 m2 with a total membrane area of 8 m2 one important point is that the daily water production was expressed in terms of per unit area of the solar collector the corresponding value was from 11 l per m2 of fpc in winter to 28 l per m2 of fpc in summer both under clear weather this expression can give us a clear idea of the device productivity with regards to the system volume most recently li and lu li and lu 2020 li et al 2020 established a complete systemic mathematical model of a small autonomous sgmd system only powered by solar energy for remote islands and coastal households the model was validated by experimental results under real weather conditions in hong kong 4 92 m2 of solar pv panel and 4 14 m2 of etc were installed to power an sgmd module with a total membrane area of 0 6 m2 daily freshwater production indicated a range between 9 98 l d 1 and 23 26 l d 1 unlike other research in the literature the applied pv area was even larger than the solar thermal collecting area and the produced excess electricity was consumed by the heater inside the feed storage tank instead of being wasted additionally they discussed the impact of the ratio between solar pv area and solar collector area which has rarely been seen elsewhere in the literature however it seems no heat recovery was designed for the sgmd process other than tubular and spiral wound modules a plate and frame dcmd module with flat sheet membranes has also been studied ding et al 2005 one key perspective was revealed that heat recovery is essential to amplify freshwater productivity due to the sparsity of solar energy restraining heat income under limited solar collecting area same for a plate and frame dcmd module 0 13 m2 a two dimensional dynamic model was built to predict the operation in a solar thermally powered system solar collecting area 4 7m2 shim et al 2015 no heat recovery configuration was applied and the calculated stec for freshwater production was between 896 and 1433 kwh m 3 for an sgsp a dcmd desalination system without heat recovery settings was theoretically connected to it by heat exchangers to predict the water production rate suárez and urtubia 2016 the validated model resulted in a water production of 2 5 l d 1 per m2 of the solar pond at a stec of 880 60 kwh m 3 duong et al simulated a typical one loop small dcmd system powered by fpcs duong et al 2017 the result was presented in terms of per unit area of both membrane and solar collector being 19 7 l d 1 per m2 of membrane or 6 3 l d 1 per m2 of fpc according to their system layout fig 6 however still no heat recovery was applied the water production surprisingly decreased with an increasing circulation flow rate and the authors attributed such a phenomenon to the shorter residence time of the saline water inside the solar collectors at higher flow rates 2 3 1 2 experimental studies the framework smades has funded the establishment of some small scale solar driven autonomous agmd systems in irbid jordan banat et al 2007a fpcs of 5 73 m2 was installed to provide heat for a spiral wound agmd module with internal heat recovery the highest production rate attained 19 l d 1 per unit m2 of the solar collecting area recording a stec between 200 and 300 kwh m 3 in alexandria egypt fath et al 2008 a similar system with the same areas of solar collectors and agmd module was tested the archived production rate was lower than the previous work being 11 2 l d 1 per unit area of the fpc field additionally it resulted in a higher stec of 647 kwh m 3 calculated from the test data raluy et al operated a solar fpc and pv powered pgmd system with internal heat recovery for as long as five years from 2005 to 2010 in pozo izquierdo gran canary island spain raluy et al 2012 subiela et al 2009 their meticulous work revealed a daily water production from 5 l d 1 up to 120 l d 1 at the expense of a stec in the range of 140 350 kwh m 3 additionally they summarized the seec supplied by pv which varied from 2 1 to 51 2 kwh m 3 later a tiny experimental agmd module 0 07 m2 solar collector area and 0 05 m2 flat sheet membrane area was tested and optimized chang et al 2012 and maximumly 0 25 l d 1 of water was achieved regarding vmd an etc field of 2 16 m2 was used to drive a vmd module with a flat sheet membrane area of 0 25 m2 wang et al 2015 and the production data was released based on the permeate flux 4 l m 2 h 1 instead of the daily water gain besides the stec was reported as 750 kwh m 3 probably without any heat recovery regime for vmd with hollow fiber membranes an etc pv powered vmd system was established in inner mongolia china deng et al 2020 the surface areas of etc pv and membrane were 1 82 m2 1 62 m2 and 0 1 m2 respectively similarly to the simulation study in li and lu 2020 the pv panel was also connected to an electrical heater inside the feed storage tank to exploit the excess electricity daily production and thermal consumption were not reported but an seec of 79 87 kwh m 3 can be calculated from the result data using an existing lab sgsp with an aperture area of 2 m2 suárez et al 2014 a tubular dcmd module total membrane area 0 1 m2 was driven by the thermal energy storage in sgsp suárez et al 2015 1 16 l of freshwater could be produced daily per unit area of the sgsp also for dcmd kabeel et al added an extra air water cooling unit with an air fan to lower the permeate temperature in order to enhance the transmembrane driving force kabeel et al 2017 the system yielded a daily water production of 33 55 l d 1 with an etc field of 2 61m2 they claimed that the production was improved by 1 25 times at the expense of the cooling unit operation but the consumption of the additional fan was not reported in perth australia shafieian and khiadani 2019 heat pipe etcs were applied to supply heat to a dcmd module with hollow fiber membranes the employment of heat pipe etc intended to avoid the problems of sedimentation corrosion and rustiness caused by feed saline water inside a water in glass etc the constructed device is shown in fig 7 forming an integrated compact system similar to the previous study an extra cooling loop was added to maintain the vapor partial pressure difference across the membrane besides an auxiliary heater was used to fast initiate the desalination process in the morning the gross area of the solar collector was 3 93 m2 and the total membrane area of the tubular dcmd module was 0 2 m2 taking both thermal and electrical energy consumption into consideration the average sec was between 377 and 450 kwh m 3 in all scenarios while the daily production was not clearly reported in this work zarzoum et al built an fpc 3 ⅹ 2m2 pv 1 63m2 powered compact dcmd a total membrane area of 10 m2 desalination system zarzoum et al 2019 with the help of latent heat recovery by preheating the feed with the condenser a total amount of 86 l of freshwater could be obtained on a sunny summer day in kairouan tunisia summarily table 1 below chronicles the key information of the major research work on coupling solar collectors to md modules for a small scale solar powered desalination device the information includes md configuration membrane type hollow fiber hf flat sheet fs spiral wound sw solar collector type and area membrane area daily water production in terms of per unit area of solar collecting surface heat recovery regime sec thermal t electrical e and year of contribution 2 3 2 observations from table 1 the first thing we can see is that almost all the previous work indicated a production rate lower than 20 l d 1 m 2 furthermore the value would be even lower 10 l d 1 m 2 when heat recovery was excluded besides the ratios between solar collecting area and membrane area are scattered being from as low as 0 6 to as high as 36 only in li and lu 2020 a small section was dedicated to the influence of solar collecting area and pv area respectively nonetheless no deep insight into their ratio nor the discussion on the interaction of membrane area and solar unit area was provided more attention should be focused on the overall system footprint for small scale applications considering the mobility and compactness of the distributed device adapted for remote places in this regard solar collecting area would be a key factor that influences the total volume of the system while the total membrane area can be packed into a module with high packing density and placed under the solar collecting surface from the view of heat consumption almost all the available figures are still higher than 200 kwh m 3 being less competitive compared with med or msf while for the systems without heat recovery settings the corresponding values are likely to be even higher this observation also explains the limited production rate under sole solar energy provision in addition though md is principally a thermal driven process certain electrical energy is indeed demanded for the function of pumps sensors etc however little work has included an independent discussion on the variation of electricity consumption let alone the research on its optimization from the data in deng et al 2020 raluy et al 2012 and considering the comparatively low efficiency of pv panels this part of consumption is definitely not negligible besides cooling and condensation stage of md is another important aspect for further study including its efficiency and possible consumption in an energy autarky regime such effort has not yet been seen in the above reviewed papers in summary the performance of the reported solar driven md devices is still less interesting compared with other widely applied desalination technologies gopi et al gopi et al 2019 provided some general ways to improve solar powered md systems in 2019 however it was not targeting small scale autonomous devices and in the author s humble opinion the suggested perspectives might not be entirely promising in the near future and lack some important aspects as discussed in section 2 2 only 6 12 l m 2 d 1 of water can be evaporated even with a perfect solar efficiency of 100 hence the energy source from the sole solar energy against the enormous latent heat of evaporation is the main limitations that restrains md performance therefore the improvement in membrane materials and its properties to enhance heat and mass transfer becomes less relevant when the normal permeate flux of md under steady unlimited heat supply can already easily reach 30 40 l m 2 h 1 li et al 2014 such insignificance of the research on materials was also recently pointed out by patel et al k patel et al 2020 for all thermal desalination technologies instead future research directions should be more centered on innovative module and system design to i intensify the solar thermal energy income which intends to solve the problem from the energy source side and ii augment the heat recovery ratio which is expected to solve the problem from the energy consumption side besides the lifetime of the md system largely depends on the membrane material against wetting fouling and other issues that potentially induce production declination or even a total failure of md process thus studies on membrane materials to prevent the above mentioned issues for long time operations such as the work in raluy et al 2012 subiela et al 2009 also demand more efforts together with the research on improving the efficiency in water production such efforts were aggregated in some recent dedicated review works alsebaeai et al 2020 rezaei et al 2018 in this review paper several perspectives on the performance enhancement of an autonomous small scale solar md system are given in the following sections being oriented to two general paths i e intensifying solar energy source and reducing md energy consumption together with a critical review of some cutting edge work on these directions a concluding remark is then provided at the end 3 performance enhancement via intensified solar energy harvesting from the energy source side an intensified solar energy harvesting is undoubtedly able to improve the production rate of a solar powered md system from the authors point of view i direct solar heating to improve the solar utilization efficiency and ii solar concentration to multiply the solar radiation that falls on the collecting surface would be the two foreseeable pathways 3 1 solar direct heating to reduce thermal loss a relatively new research field of directly integrating md with solar energy absorption is continuously sprouting compared with the conventional system layout reviewed in section 2 3 the direct heating setting can not only cut down the thermal loss during the heat transfer from solar collectors to the final solar energy utilization but also compact the entire system for distributed applications 3 1 1 direct integration between membrane distillation and thermal collectors in fact this idea dates back to 2009 murase et al 2009 where agmd with flat sheet membranes was directly integrated into a solar basin still later in 2013 by the same research group pv was further added into the device forming a pv t md compact module murase et al 2013 as shown in fig 8 pv t is a compound solar collector where a cooling unit is usually adhered to the back of pv cells to reduce the operating temperature as well as to collect the excess solar heat xie et al 2016 however the resultant distillate production was considerably low due to the aim of the study was more towards electricity generation this integration concept was also applied by another research team in 2010 for dcmd chen and ho 2010 and in 2016 for agmd ho et al 2016 as illustrated in fig 9 taking dcmd as an example the original water circulation space under the absorber plate in an fpc is reconfigured as an md module thus the feed flow directly received solar thermal energy absorbed by the absorber plate however no dynamic performance on varying solar conditions was reported under a similar module structure ma et al theoretically studied the performance of vmd by a comprehensive dynamic simulation including solar radiation model vmd separation model and 1 dimensional module model ma et al 2018 vmd was chosen on account of its low transmembrane conductive heat loss to maximize the efficiency in solar utilization alkhudhiri et al 2012 khayet 2011 a daily production rate of 8 l m 2 d 1 was demonstrated but a high electrical consumption seec was also revealed 239 kwh m 3 due to the intensive work of the vacuum pump sucking out permeate vapor a well improved performance with much higher production rate and much shrunk consumption was then predicted upon applying a suitable heat recovery strategy however no experimental test results were provided considering multi stage heat recovery single stage 3 stage and 10 stage solar distillers were fabricated and tested for passive operation chiavazzo et al 2018 and ptfe membranes were inserted between two hydrophilic layers under a simulated solar radiation intensity of 900 w m 2 in lab the resulted distillate fluxes were 0 48 1 44 2 95 l m 2 h 1 for the 1 3 and 10 stage modules at the secs of 1871 624 and 305 kwh m 3 respectively the 10 stage module obviously exceeded the thermodynamic limit of evaporation 667 kwh m 3 due to the heat recovery between stages furthermore field tests on roof and floating on sea surface were carried out a 3 stage module was enclosed by foam to float the module to fit real application scenarios the production rate recorded 1 5 l m 2 h 1 at a sec of 564 kwh m 3 similarly a 2 layer passive agmd device was designed and tested xue et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 10 sponges were installed to replace the feed channel and its active circulation however the daily production rate was rather limited being 3 67 l m 2 d 1 mainly due to the low feed flow rate for md process in passive mode inspired by the above module designs both passive dead end mode and active cross flow mode modules were studied for a 3 stage dcmd configuration and pv t pattern same as the idea in murase et al 2013 was applied as an addition wang et al 2019 the lab test under one sun irradiation indicated a water production rate around 1 7 l m 2 h 1 and a pv efficiency of more than 11 however they pointed out that the passive mode might not be suitable for long term operation additionally they conducted a field test using a 5 stage module at the scale of 10cm ⅹ 10cm and a daily accumulated water production of 4 7 6 1 l d 1 m 2 was yielded together with a pv efficiency at 11 7 11 9 the heat recovery between stages was revealed by a thermal efficiency more than 100 126 195 the above mentioned work on module integration all concerns fpc shaped configuration as for etc shaped module also a few efforts have been already witnessed considering the tubular shape hollow fiber membranes are the reasonable choice instead of flat sheet membranes taking a normal etc collector of 1 6 m2 hollow fiber membranes with a total area of 0 2 m2 were placed into the inner glass tube li et al 2019 using the outside in flow arrangement for a vmd process fig 11 however the main objective of this device seemed more towards hot water production rather than desalination the desalination performance of the device was limited to 4 l d 1 at a calculated seec of 208 313 kwh m 3 and a stec of over 1000 kwh m 3 recently a similar configuration integrating vmd with etc was experimentally studied natural convection mode was employed inside the etc to keep the feed staying longer in the module to minimize heat loss and to remove electricity consumption for pumping bamasag et al 2021 the system could produce 6 7 l of fresh water on a daily basis per m2 of solar absorbing area at an overall thermal efficiency of 51 for dcmd such configuration has also been studied by the same group bamasag et al 2020 outdoor tests showed an average water production of 0 37 l h 1 per m2 of solar collecting area after comparison the application of such integrated module was claimed to increase md performance by up to 17 from the above advancements we can estimate that the freshwater production rate of a single layer integrated solar md module remains limited generally 5 l d 1 m 2 multi layered modules can significantly improve the performance indicating the importance of heat recovery regime however the productions after multi staging reviewed above hardly reached 10 l m 2 d 1 with a sec value above 300 kwh m 3 and the stacked multiple module setting has to be further designed to fit small scale applications will be discussed again in section 4 1 this implies a higher thermal efficiency and maybe more innovative integrated module structures are yet to be developed such as the modules applying photothermal membranes discussed in the following part 3 1 2 photothermal membranes for localized solar heating in order to further integrate md process with solar collecting innovative membrane materials were developed to join the functions of solar absorption and md separation onto the same membrane in 2013 summers and lienhard summers and lienhard v 2013a 2013b were the first researchers to propose a solar absorbing membrane in this fashion fig 12 feed saline water inside an agmd module can be directly heated at the surface of evaporation thus the thermal resistance of the boundary layer can be much lowered enhancing the overall solar thermal efficiency and relieving temperature polarization a composite membrane was therefore fabricated made of a hydrophilic membrane millipore nitrocellulose absorbing solar energy layered on top of a normal md hydrophobic membrane experimental results indicated that lower feed mass flow rate favored the permeate flux same as discussed in duong et al 2017 for an fpc powered dcmd module which reached around 0 36 kg m 2 h 1 under a simulated solar radiation intensity of 750 w m 2 inspired by this configuration and by the new concept of solar thermal interfacial evaporation huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 p f liu et al 2019 s liu et al 2019 liu et al 2016 shi et al 2017 xu et al 2019 recent studies on the fabrication and testing of new photothermal membrane material for solar md have been in an outburst in 2017 politano et al developed a photothermal pvdf membrane with ag nanoparticles np incorporation for vmd operation politano antonio et al 2016 the resultant desalination performance under a uv lamp at an intensive radiant heating power of 23000 w m 2 exhibited a higher permeate flux and a claimed lower sec than a lab scale small ro unit being 25 7 l m 2 h 1 and 1490 kwh m 3 respectively dongare et al dispersed carbon black nps into polyvinyl alcohol pva solution and layered the hydrophilic pva onto a pvdf membrane to form a solar absorbing membrane for dcmd process termed nanophotonics enabled solar membrane distillation nesmd dongare et al 2017 the permeate flux was found to be strongly affected by the ambient temperature due to the heat loss to the surroundings which varied between 0 22 and 0 55 kg m 2 h 1 at a thermal efficiency up to 53 8 under 700 w m 2 solar illumination a 4l per day production was predicted in a summer day another work on photothermal membranes using carbon black nps or sio2 au nanoshells ns for the same nesmd module pushed its thermal efficiency to a higher value of 74 6 under 1 sun unit illumination 1367 w m 2 wu et al 2017 a research group in japan dyed ptfe membrane with disperse red 1 and disperse blue 14 fujiwara 2017 fujiwara and kikuchi 2017 to evaporate water on the surface by solar energy the permeate flux calculated from the provided data was 0 78 l m 2 h 1 at a lowest sec of 1129 kwh m 3 then in 2018 an easy to fabricate polydopamine pda coated pvdf membrane was developed for a small dcmd module wu et al 2018 at an ambient temperature 20 c the permeate flux was observed to be 0 49 kg m 2 h 1 under a solar irradiance of 750 w m 2 and 4 23 kg m 2 h 1 under an intensified radiation of 7000 w m 2 the corresponding solar conversion efficiency was 45 and 41 respectively huang et al huang et al 2018 modified ptfe membrane with reduced graphene oxide rgo and then coated the membrane with a pda layer after 1 hour of solar illumination at an intensity of 1 kw m 2 0 7163 kg m 2 of vapor permeated through the membrane equal to a thermal efficiency of 49 0 instead of modifying the membrane ang et al installed a three dimensional plasmonic spacer network using nickel foam on top of the membrane to generate localized heating ang et al 2019 solar illumination was only adopted to enhance the permeate flux from a fixed feed temperature a photothermal efficiency as high as 98 was claimed while at a rather high sec of 2500 kwh m 3 li et al prepared fe3o4 polyvinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene fe3o4 pvdf hfp membrane and the experiments resulted in a photothermal efficiency of 53 li et al 2020 in order to address the fouling and salt deposition issues on the membrane a small vapor gap was arranged to separate the evaporation surface and the membrane surface gong et al 2019 a high thermal efficiency of 73 4 and a permeate flux of 1 13 kg m 2 h 1 at 1 sun were attained the evaporation took place on the solar absorbing surface instead which was a customized graphene nickel foam with polymer coating 12 fold solar concentration by a fresnel lens was then installed for a field test yielding a daily production of 92 8 kg m 2 d 1 huang et al huang et al 2020a 2020b developed and manufactured polydimethylsiloxane carbon nanotube poly vinylidene fluoride pdms cnt pvdf membranes by electrospinning and spraying for a two level agmd device under solar illumination of 1 kw m 2 a maximum production rate of 1 43 l m 2 h 1 and a lowest sec at 700 kwh m 3 were achieved owing to the two level heat recovery most recently a multi layer agmd device exhibited in fig 13 was designed and tested with a ptfe membrane spray coated by a composition of trichloro 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorooctyl silane ftcs polymerized dopamine pda and graphene nanosheets at the top layer ghim et al 2021 the rest stages were all applying conventional ptfe membranes under 750 w m 2 solar radiation a water flux of 1 17 kg m 2 h 1 was obtained at a high solar conversion efficiency of 105 this value was higher than all the reported thermal efficiencies in photothermal md studies underlining again the significance of heat recovery in general a boost in the research on photothermal membrane materials is observed for the application in solar md process however according to the above reported performance its improvement over the integrated modules without solar absorbing membranes section 3 1 1 is still not clear this also confirms the insignificance in new material study to enhance the performance of solar thermal desalination technologies k patel et al 2020 therefore more research on module and system design to magnify heat income such as solar concentration that will be introduced in section 3 2 and heat recovery will be introduced in section 4 awaits more attention nevertheless efforts on membrane material are indeed necessary but should be more essentially on the direction of long term field operation against fouling scaling wetting or other problems that can cause performance declination for example the work in gong et al 2019 3 2 solar concentration for more solar energy income a common recognition in all previous efforts was the lack of solar radiation intensity in this regard solar concentration for md might be a significant perspective for future research directions though only a few articles have addressed this subject for now under the condition of solar simulators in lab almost all the previous work on photothermal membranes section 3 1 2 has attempted using intensified solar radiation and the results showed a sharply increased production rate under multiple sun illumination however more outdoor tests of a thoroughly designed device with a real solar concentrator are yet to conduct such as the field test of a scaled module with solar concentration by a fresnel lens gong et al 2019 as a cost effective solar concentrator at low concentration ratio a compound parabolic concentrator cpc was applied to power a commercial agmd module scarab guillén burrieza et al 2011 2015 and a stec around 1000 kwh m 3 was registered however a large area of cpc field 500 m2 was applied in these works for a relatively small total membrane area 2 8 m2 being not applicable for small scale distributed systems a techno economic assessment of different solar collector types fpc etc cpc was as well conducted vmd with hollow fiber membranes was integrated in the absorber tube of a cpc collector in mathematical modeling abdallah et al 2014 a daily water production of 38 75 l could be attained but more details on the model coupling of solar energy and md were lacking concentrating solar power plants csp using solar concentrators with relatively higher concentration ratios parabolic trough collectors ptc linear fresnel reflectors lfr solar tower were connected to md modules by the same research group soomro and kim 2018a 2018b 2018c however seawater only worked as the cooling medium and exploited the waste heat of the massive csp for desalination most recently the first attempt to combine a small concentrating pv t cpv t with agmd was reported using a simple v trough concentrator elminshawy et al 2020 the waste heat from the cpv t cooling and the thermal energy from a 6 kw electric heater were used together to power the desalination process without discussing the stand alone md performance the concentration of solar energy can definitely multiply the available solar energy and resolve the energy sparsity which brings in better production however higher operating temperature would be attained with potentially higher thermal loss and faster salt accumulation a trade off in concentration intensity requests detailed study regarding this issue furthermore the solar collecting area would be enlarged by the concentrator as well which is essentially the same matter of applying more solar collectors taking the target of small compact system into consideration concentrating solar md devices yet necessitate a holistic design and optimization on the entire system to meet not only the fresh water and cost demand but also the system simplicity efficiency mobility and footprint requirements besides the choice of concentration ratio also raises the question of the most suited solar collecting area for a certain md module i e the fittest area ratio between solar collecting area and membrane area which is hardly seen in the literature and needs exploration 3 3 summary in general a limited production rate and a rather high sec characterize the reports on integrating solar absorption into md modules according to the review in section 3 1 besides the development on new configurations and photothermal membrane materials still necessitates more long time operation tests to study the lifetime of the whole md system then the coupling of solar concentration and md module is obviously effective and awaits more detailed studies however the multiplication of solar absorbing area would complicate the module configuration and not help dwindle the sec of water production therefore the research efforts that shrink the massive heat consumption are of great significance which would in turn enlarge the production rate given a certain amount of available solar energy accordingly the next section discusses the concerned perspectives 4 performance enhancement via reducing energy consumption regarding the energy consumption the secs in all the documented studies are still in the range between 100 and 2000 kwh m 3 higher than some widely adopted thermal desalination technologies like msf and med a universal observation lies in the lack of detailed optimization study on the pv panels for electricity consumption except a small section in li and lu 2020 discussing the influence of pv panel area on the other hand a pv subsystem is probably not demanded in the articles on passive systems alsaati and marconnet 2018 bamasag et al 2021 chiavazzo et al 2018 fujiwara 2017 fujiwara and kikuchi 2017 huang et al 2020a wang et al 2019 however long term operations of passive md are often impeded by fouling problem on the membrane surface due to the quasi static saline water the common solution of agitation also demands electricity alsaadi et al 2014 meng et al 2015 thus more efforts on the optimization of coupling pv systems are still expected in the future for the major consumption of heat an effective heat recovery strategy still requires more efforts khayet 2013 though this issue had been identified since the very beginning of md concept findley 1967 in this regard three possible solutions represent the future research directions i module stacking recovering the condensation heat between module layers ii internal heat recovery enhancement more applicable for agmd pgmd iii innovative coupling with other devices condensing vapor externally while recovering the heat more applicable for vmd sgmd 4 1 module stacking one of the earliest concept of stacked multiple md modules in a solar powered desalination system can be found in vega beltrán et al 2010 with multi stage md the feed seawater of one stage acts as the cooling water for the previous stage and thus gets heated while the feed of the next stage receives the condensation heat from the permeate conventionally multi stage thermal desalination such as med and msf demands large space for the entire facility due to the multiplied unit and large amounts of vapor guillén burrieza et al 2011 similarly most of the literature that studied multi stage md aimed scaling up with a large area of solar collectors chafidz et al 2016 2014 dutta et al 2020 kim et al 2021 2015 lee et al 2018 omar et al 2021 zaragoza et al 2014 zhao et al 2013 being in the range from 20 m2 to 550 m2 since memsys released their commercial vacuum multi effect md v memd module in 2010 andrés mañas et al 2020 most of the concerned studies have been applying this v memd concept or directly the memsys module similar to an msf process with reduced pressure chafidz et al 2016 2014 kim et al 2021 2015 omar et al 2021 zaragoza et al 2014 zhao et al 2013 recently simulation studies on dcmd began to appear as an alternative for multi stage mds dutta et al 2020 lee et al 2018 yet all of the aforementioned work included a big solar collecting area which is out of the scope of the present work thanks to the high compactness nature of md and the development of the research on novel integrated modules reviewed in section 3 1 the configuration of multi layered md started to be frequented in small distributed devices chiavazzo et al 2018 ghim et al 2021 huang et al 2020b signorato et al 2020 wang et al 2019 the highest recorded production rate among them was the agmd module in chiavazzo et al 2018 being 2 95 l m 2 h 1 at a thermal efficiency of 218 for a ten stage module under 900 w m 2 illumination although the application of membranes in agmd has recently been proven to be positive on water production compared with solar stills without membranes shirsath et al 2020 an innovative 10 stage small solar still with direct solar heating recorded an ultrahigh efficiency of 385 xu et al 2020 such an achievement indicates plenty of room for improvement of small solar multi layered md modules from the experience of commercialized technologies of med msf and the md studies introduced in this section module stacking to form a multi stage process is surely an effective method to enhance heat recovery for systems with separated solar unit and md unit future outlook would be the development on smaller devices rather than the currently reported large solar collecting areas for small scale integrated solar md devices section 3 1 higher energy efficiency is yet to attain through module design innovation and optimization 4 2 module internal heat recovery in terms of heat recovery inside the md module itself the configuration of agmd pgmd is the natural candidate due to its vapor condensation on the condenser plate in the module fig 2c its thermal efficiency has been proven to be the highest among all implemented md configurations summers et al 2012 though dcmd and vmd are the two most studied md types throughout the literature thomas et al 2017 due to the higher permeate flux than agmd pgmd under the same controlled operating condition gonzález et al 2017 the frequency of agmd pgmd appearances in solar powered systems is obviously higher than vmd and no lower than dcmd according to the research reviewed in section 2 and 3 it is also a reflection of the fact that the total amount of solar energy input is the major limitation to md process instead of the mass transfer quality often represented by permeate flux in order to further improve the performance of agmd pgmd one approach is to enhance the permeate vapor condensation on the condenser plate and consequently the heat transfer between the cooling feed and the condenser plate the research group in mit has contributed to this issue tremendously swaminathan et al 2018 2016a 2016b warsinger et al 2015 2018 a superhydrophobic condensing surface was developed to form a jumping droplet condensation which significantly strengthens the vapor condensation and subsequently the overall md performance warsinger et al 2015 furthermore a detailed study on the visualized condensate flow patterns in agmd again correlates the hydrophobicity of the condensing surface with possibly thinner air gap size designs and stronger thermal efficiency warsinger et al 2018 such progress in condensation enhancement is promising in being applied to solar md systems under varying outdoor conditions besides in contrast with the conventional view that the heat conduction between the feed and the permeate ought to be cut off to prevent heat loss a conductive gap md was studied cgmd inserting materials with high conductivity into the gap swaminathan et al 2016a it surprisingly produced better heat recovery and higher energy efficiency at the same module size and the same constant permeate flux swaminathan et al 2016a 2016b meanwhile practical applications of agmd pgmd cgmd into solar powered stand alone desalination system require further study instead of the evaluations under fixed flux and steady heat supply at the scale of the module agmd pgmd with internal heat recovery surely has been the most successfully commercialized md configuration promoted by several international corporations zaragoza et al 2018 fraunhofer ise has been developing spiral wound agmd pgmd modules with internal heat recovery since 2001 koschikowski et al 2009 2003 raluy et al 2012 ruiz aguirre et al 2017 schwantes et al 2013 winter et al 2012 2011 feed and condensing channels flow counter currently and heat is recovered by the stacked channel as depicted in fig 14 winter et al 2017 additionally dcmd has lately been integrated with such spiral wound modules as well winter et al 2017 hagedorn et al 2017 the recorded sec for these spiral wound modules has been in the range of 120 350 kwh m 3 and the value for the newly developed dcmd spiral wound module was 215 kwh m 3 until now most of the studied modules were relatively big in membrane surface area 7 m2 zaragoza et al 2018 and probably coordinate with large solar collectors nevertheless the spiral wound modules indeed possess the capability of efficiently recovering condensation heat internally based on its performance data therefore future concerned research can possibly be conducted towards smaller modules under outdoor operation with limited solar collecting area and maybe innovative integrations with solar direct heating for a compact module 4 3 external condensation heat recovery in conventional vmd and sgmd vapor is either transported by vacuum vmd or blown out by cold inert gas flow sgmd eventually permeated vapor has to be condensed outside the md module and it is often reckoned as one of the disadvantages for demanding an external condenser when compared with other md configurations ahmed et al 2020 however from the authors point of view the vapor flux coming out of the module offers more possibilities in intensively recovering latent heat by efficient condensation strategy assisted by outside devices due to low vapor pressure and thus low condensation temperature in vacuum or in sweeping gas the condensation in vmd and sgmd often poses difficulty not to mention reusing its latent heat ma et al 2020 most recently miladi et al proposed using liquid ring pump in solar vmd to simultaneously condense vapor and create vacuum miladi et al 2021 however the vapor latent heat was not efficiently recovered in the vacuum due to the low condensation temperature yielding a stec of a little bit lower than 700 kwh m 3 seec was otherwise effectively reduced to 4 2 7 47 kwh m 3 compared with other solar vmd works using conventional vacuum pumps li et al 2019 ma et al 2018 compressing low temperature and low pressure water vapor to an elevated temperature before condensation and heat recovery could be a possible solution in the last 2 years a research team in nanjing china has been working on a combined system coupling vmd and mechanical vapor recompression mvr si et al 2020b 2020a 2019 the vmd permeate vapor was led to a compressor outside the module and compressed to a relatively high temperature then cooled and efficiently condensed by feed recirculation from the vmd module in this fashion the condensation heat in higher temperature can be absorbed and recovered by the feed flow the overall sec was found to be as low as 145 kwh m 3 including the electrical heater the compressor the vacuum pump and the circulation pumps applying the similar idea ma et al utilized a full heat pump cycle for an autonomous small scale solar powered vmd system ma et al 2020 with the integrated vmd fpc module design in ma et al 2018 as demonstrated in fig 15 the condenser of the heat pump was in heat exchange with feed recirculation while the evaporator of the heat pump was kept in low temperature in order to efficiently condense permeate vapor from vmd thus the heat pump loop elevates the grade of the condensation heat from the permeate vapor and recovers it to the feed that needs heating simulation and optimization results revealed a maximum production rate over 30 l d 1 per unit solar area of the vmd fpc module exceeding the value of almost all the previous research on small distributed solar md system the corresponding stec and seec was about 200 and 56 kwh m 3 respectively according to the simulation however experimental system is yet to be established to confirm such a performance same idea was also seen in shaulsky et al 2020 for a heat pump assisted dcmd process without solar energy involved simulation resulted in an impressive 10 kwh m 3 of overall electricity consumption for freshwater production without discussing the thermal energy for feed side heating most of the above mentioned work in fact consumes extra electricity to realize higher water production and lower heat demand thus for a distributed design small pv systems must be further included in detail for future studies moreover the additional cost and the system complexity brought by the external facilities should also be discussed overall the concerned works are currently still in theoretical stage experimental establishments are yet to be constructed to demonstrate the effectiveness nonetheless the predicted specific consumption of 10 kwh m 3 in shaulsky et al 2020 manifests the great prospect on the future experimental efforts of compressor heat pump assisted distributed solar md systems 4 4 summary based on the perspectives on heat recovery introduced in section 4 the sec of water production was reduced to as low as 305 kwh m 3 by stacking multiple md modules in a small experimental device with direct solar heating chiavazzo et al 2018 while by module internal heat recovery in a spiral wound module an even lower sec of around 200 kwh m 3 could be achieved in pilot plants winter et al 2017 hagedorn et al 2017 however the concerned reports were mostly coupled to a relatively big solar collector field and no direct solar heating regime was applied aiming a small desalination device finally the combination with external condensation heat recovery by compressor heat pump indicated an overall sec of 145 kwh m 3 si et al 2019 and an impressive seec of only 10 kwh m 3 shaulsky et al 2020 nonetheless corresponding experimental studies are yet to develop including the pv panels that has to be installed to provide electricity moreover the extra cost for the additional facilities and the operational stability have to be experimentally checked in long time tests to demonstrate its lifetime and economic efficiency 5 conclusions water crisis has been and will durably be a major issue around the globe especially for the scattered population in remote coastal areas or isolated islands as an emerging desalination technology membrane distillation md is deemed prospective in distributed solar powered desalination for freshwater provision in dispersed communities related research works are summarily reviewed with certain observations primarily on the water production rate and energy consumption critical perspectives are then provided in two major directions intensifying solar energy harvesting which aims the advancement from the energy source side reducing md energy consumption which aims the advancement from the energy spending side in order to more efficiently utilize solar energy solar direct heating has been a rising interest in the literature in recent years new integrated module designs that combine solar absorption and md into one compact module can effectively minimize the heat loss in piping and heat exchanging moreover the piling development in photothermal membranes that can further integrate solar collection and md separation onto the same surface for more enhanced thermal efficiency however current concerned research works still indicate a rather limited production rate and high specific energy consumption mainly due to the sparsity of solar energy thus the future research direction is to be shifted to more innovative system designs which might include solar concentration and heat recovery regarding the former current contributions on concentrated solar md systems are more directed towards large solar collectors small scale holistically designed devices require future explorations and the optimized ratio of solar collecting area and membrane area is yet to receive more attention regarding the latter an efficient heat recovery regime would be an inevitable route to lower the consumption of md to overcome the energy barrier of water evaporation module stacking inspired by the commercialized med and msf could be an obvious option small compact multi stage solar md modules deserve more efforts given the current research status mainly on space occupied systems similar to med msf newly designed small integrated multi layered md devices yet have large improvement possibilities module internal heat recovery by using condensation energy to heat the feed flow is another important way to raise thermal efficiency adapted for agmd pgmd and even dcmd module recent studies on condensation efficiency and the unique spiral wound md module are both promising and their applications in small distributed solar md modules or even integrated modules awaits further examination lastly external condensation in vmd sgmd could be exploited by the assistance from other facilities especially compressors heat pumps encouraging results were shown by replacing the massive heat consumption with limited electricity for the compression cycle which also highlights the need for the optimization study on pv subsystems in a distributed operation manner experimental research on such a combination is also expected to confirm the impressive simulation results from the authors view a largely enhanced performance of autonomous small solar md would potentially be obtained from the combination of the research perspectives discussed in this paper integrating direct solar heating into md modules is innovative and promising however instead of developing new membrane materials that provide better solar absorption and mass transfer efficacy currently more contributions should be made towards the novel designs that enhance incident solar radiation and heat recovery efficiency after massively improving the production rate and reducing the specific consumption studies on new materials at a reasonable cost and the optimized operation control could be more interesting by then nonetheless the research on membrane materials against wetting fouling scaling and other issues that hamper long term operations should be dedicated all along in parallel declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work was supported by the fellowship of china postdoctoral science foundation no 2020tq0186

16978,membrane distillation md has been proven promising in solar driven desalination moreover its unique characteristics such as simple process module compactness high salt rejection rate etc allow for a small scale device in a distributed system both theoretical and experimental researches on the coupling between solar collectors and md aiming at compact and autonomous desalination system have been devoted to enhance freshwater productivity and energy efficiency in this paper certain critical gaps are summarized upon a panoramic review of the current status including limited production and energy performance compared with commercial scale desalination unclear relation between solar collecting area and membrane area and few discussions on efficient condensation etc to tackle these challenges perspectives on the essential future research directions are proposed solar direct heating and solar concentration constitute the possible resolution to enhance solar energy utilization for higher water production which also raise the question of optimizing solar md areas meanwhile module stacking module internal heat recovery and external evaporation heat recovery are deemed prospective in further reducing md energy consumption subsequently an enhanced vapor condensation needs more exploration those aspects and a potential combination among them are the main tasks in the near future

only 2 5 of the total water on our blue planet is freshwater furthermore most of the freshwater exists in glaciers and ice caps which cannot be easily accessed eventually merely 1 2 of the freshwater can be exploited from the earth surface for the use in our daily life agriculture and industry gleick 1993 statistical study shows that about 4 billion people around the world encounter water deficiency at least 1 month per year and about half a billion of them suffer from water crisis all year mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 seawater desalination can serve as a viable approach in some coastal places or islands where seawater is abundant in definition a desalination process separates freshwater and concentrated brine from a saline water source khawaji et al 2008 currently industrial scale desalination plants mostly adopting reverse osmosis ro multi effect distillation med and multi stage flash msf have already been installed all across the globe abdelkareem et al 2018 the latter two are the earliest generation of desalination technologies based on thermal distillation where a complete salt rejection is theoretically achievable upon cascading several stages or effects the vapor condensation heat in the previous stage or effect is effectively recovered by heat exchange with the feed stream in the next stage or effect on the other hand ro is based on membrane separation instead of demanding huge amounts of heat for evaporation and it actually takes up to 65 of the total installed desalination capacity gonzález et al 2017 mechanical compression is applied to overcome the osmotic pressure of the saline water to drive water across the semi permeable membrane while detaining ions the configuration with membranes allows for a substantial interfacial surface area that maintains a compact module the development in ro membranes permits higher water fluxes and the progress in ro energy recovery devices erd brings down the electricity consumption along with such improvements ro technology for desalination has thrived since 20 30 years ago greenlee et al 2009 despite the development and commercialization of the above mentioned industry scale desalination facilities distributed small scale desalination technology is yet to develop for some small communities in remote areas or isolated islands compact structure easy operation portable volume and high freshwater production compose the expected properties of such a device without centralized energy supply thermal distillation of seawater requires at least 667 kwh m 3 to surpass the latent heat of evaporation deshmukh et al 2018 but med msf can already lower the specific thermal energy consumption stec by over an order of magnitude around 40 80 kwh m 3 ghaffour et al 2015 however the vast space requirement for vapor and the multi stage configuration lead to an inevitable large footprint of the whole system receding its applicability in small and compact devices guillén burrieza et al 2011 on the other hand ro representing the membrane separation process of seawater the pressurized process and low water recovery ratio are the main obstacles for distributed portable devices in small communities cabassud and balmann 2017 especially for some regions like gcc gulf cooperation council with relatively high salinity seawater amy et al 2017 the high sensitivity of the osmotic pressure to the salinity hinders the applicability of ro besides the erd in small ro systems is not as efficient as in industry scale ones resulting in a much higher consumption 1980 kwh m 3 in politano antonio et al 2016 membrane distillation md is an emerging technology for seawater desalination combining the merits of both the thermal distillation and the membrane separation drioli et al 2015 a hydrophobic microporous membrane is applied in md to physically segregate saline water feed side and freshwater or vapor permeate side the interfacial area is largely extended by the membrane allowing for a compact module design due to the surface hydrophobicity only vapor can diffuse through membrane pores from the feed side and then be collected on the permeate side thus a vapor pressure difference needs to be created between the two sides of the membrane but without an operating temperature close to the boiling point lawson and lloyd 1997 in such a configuration a total detention of salt and other non volatiles on the feed side is attainable under atmospheric pressure lawson and lloyd 1997 also due to the insensitivity of partial water vapor pressure to the salinity mericq et al 2009 high water recovery rate and low consumption increment in high salinity condition can be realized consequently md has been considered a suitable candidate for small scale compact systems for domestic applications in dispersed communities guillén burrieza et al 2011 another important aspect regarding the scattered population in remote coastal areas and isolated islands is the energy distribution without centralized power supply in general solar insolation in many of those regions is plentiful being an essential renewable energy source weber 2007 meanwhile for md the thermal energy demand is low grade usually between 30 c and 90 c cai and guo 2017 this operating temperature enables a potential combination of solar thermal energy and md besides solar energy can also be directly converted to electricity via photovoltaic pv technology to supply the required power in md systems conclusively a solar powered md system is one of the most promising desalination technologies in small scale distributed applications for the target remote areas indeed related research work has gained an uprising attention while the current desalination performance needs further improvement to be more competitive and thus one step closer to commercialization in this review paper the coupling of solar thermal collecting unit with md process in a distributed device solar collector area up to about 5 m2 will be firstly reviewed with emphases on specific energy consumption sec and freshwater production then the bottleneck of the system overall performance and the literature gap in previous studies will be highlighted and discussed finally perspectives on the measures to reduce energy consumption and to boost water production rate will be critically and systematically presented for future research considerations 2 small scale solar membrane distillation systems 2 1 membrane distillation as shown in fig 1 a hydrophobic microporous membrane generally made of polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf or polypropylene pp alsebaeai et al 2020 is installed in the device between the feed and the permeate side because of the hydrophobicity of the membrane only vapor is allowed to pass through the pores moreover the working temperature of seawater on the feed side tf ranges from 30 c to 90 c cai and guo 2017 as long as a higher water vapor partial pressure is created against the permeate side the transmembrane vapor pressure difference generates vapor diffusion inside the pores and water evaporation on the membrane surface of the feed side due to the existence of thermal boundary layer the actual temperature on the membrane surface of the feed side tfm is often slightly lower than the feed bulk tf same phenomenon happens on the permeate side as well tpm tp except for the configuration of vacuum md vmd due to the total vacuum chamber created on permeate side and a uniform tv can be approximated for the permeate side temperature chiam and sarbatly 2013 these temperature polarizations could reduce the transmembrane vapor pressure difference and thus the distillation performance salt concentration polarization also takes place on the feed side cfm cf but the feed salinity seldom alters permeate flux in md khayet 2011 based on the configuration of the permeate side generally four basic types of md have been generally recognized in the literature alkhudhiri et al 2012 as illustrated in fig 2 in direct contact md dcmd fig 2a the lower partial vapor pressure on the permeate side is created by circulating cold distillate in the permeate channel overall the configuration resembles a normal plate heat exchanger where hot fluid and cold fluid flowing counter currently on the two sides its simple configuration brings popularity in md research long et al 2018 however contrary to heat exchangers the conductive heat through the membrane is considered as heat loss and should be diminished in dcmd this loss is usually significant due to the direct contact of the two liquid state sides and the membrane qtaishat et al 2008 jeopardizing the overall energy efficiency vmd fig 2b is statistically the second most studied configuration in the literature thomas et al 2017 where vacuum environment is applied on the permeate side md process occurs when the feed side is heated up to a temperature level with a vapor partial pressure higher than the vacuum pressure such a configuration allows for an adjustable permeate flux by controlling the vacuum sun et al 2014 more importantly the vacuum chamber of the permeate side significantly deters the conductive heat loss through the membrane alkhudhiri et al 2012 khayet 2011 the permeate vapor requires an external condensation for the same purpose of reduced heat loss and higher thermal efficiency air gap md agmd uses a stagnant air gap between the membrane and the permeate side fig 2c narayan and pitchumani 2020 water vapor permeates through the air gap and is then condensed on a cooled plate which enables a possible internal heat recovery by using cold feed to cool down the condenser plate droplets on the condenser plate is then collected outside of the module though transmembrane heat conduction is much decreased by the additional air gap mass transfer resistance is enhanced simultaneously leading to an attenuated permeate flux cho et al 2016 some innovative md modules also have been studied in the literature by altering the air gap in agmd such as permeate gap md pgmd using distillate to fill the gap cipollina et al 2012 swaminathan et al 2016a and material gap md mgmd the latter can be further specified by the material filled in the gap i e non conductive material gap sand sponge etc francis et al 2013 conductive material gap metal mesh swaminathan et al 2016a lastly sweeping gas md sgmd fig 2d applies a cold gas stream blowing out the vapor that permeates through the membrane same as vmd an outside condenser is needed to collect the vapor externally thomas et al 2017 at the scale of the module three main types have been reported the most based on those four md configurations plate and frame tubular and spiral wound as described in fig 3 plate and frame module fig 3a is the simplest among those where flat sheet membrane is often applied with spacers supporting the shape camacho et al 2013 feed channel and permeate channel are both flat box shaped separated by the membrane all four md configurations are suitable for plate and frame modules but the active membrane surface area per unit volume packing density of the module 400 800 m2 m 3 is relatively lower than the other two pangarkar et al 2014 the shape of tubular modules fig 3b resembles a shell and tube heat exchanger where hollow fiber membranes are installed inside the shell either the shell side or the lumen side of the hollow fibers can work as the feed channel some previous experimental study showed that higher permeate flux can be achieved with feed saline water flowing inside the lumen inside out wirth and cabassud 2002 compared with plate and frame modules the packing density of tubular modules is much higher 2000 5000 m2 m 3 pangarkar et al 2014 but the module complexity and the difficulty in membrane replacement are the major issues spiral wound modules are more specific and have mostly been applied to agmd or pgmd several layers of flat sheet membrane are wrapped in one module with a center tube collecting the permeate fig 3c schwinge et al 2004 the packing density of spiral wound modules is intermediate being 800 1200 m2 m 3 pangarkar et al 2014 and internal heat recovery is possible will be further introduced in section 4 2 however membrane replacement and cleaning can raise problems in such a module nevertheless md is still a thermal evaporation process that needs a heat supply of at least above the latent heat same as other thermal distillation process thus as stated in introduction low grade thermal energy more specifically solar energy via solar thermal collecting has been an important resource to provide heat for md systems in remote areas based on the relatively low operating temperature of md usually below 90 c vmd even lower miladi et al 2017 and its tolerance on temperature variations on the other hand solar energy can be easily converted to electricity source via pv panels to supply electrical energy for the pumping sensors monitoring etc indeed in the literature a pv system is often installed parallelly to a solar md module if an autonomous operation is desired banat et al 2007a 2007b ben abdallah et al 2013 bouguecha et al 2015 chafidz et al 2016 2014 fath et al 2008 frikha et al 2014 khan and martin 2015 moore et al 2018 raluy et al 2012 rodríguez et al 2013 saffarini et al 2012 comparatively the configuration of coupling md and solar thermal collectors is more various and more frequently studied this is probably because thermal consumption of md is usually much more significant than electrical consumption mericq et al 2011 and the approach to collect low grade thermal energy is more diverse 2 2 solar thermal collecting units for membrane distillation currently the solar collecting devices coupled with md are mostly non concentrating collectors their relatively low working temperature usually 100 c perfectly matches md operation and their low system cost and complexity add to the popularity in solar md demonstrations ma et al 2018 flat plate collectors fpc evacuated tube collectors etc and salinity gradient solar ponds sgsp are the three commonly seen types fpc and etc are widely applied in solar water heating systems an fpc normally uses a metal plate absorber plate with selective coating to absorb incident solar radiation and a glass cover to prevent convective and radiative heat loss working fluid flows in the channel that conductively adhered to the absorber plate and solar thermal energy is stored in the sensible heat of the fluid sarsam et al 2015 an etc can usually reach slightly higher solar thermal efficiency and higher temperature than fpc budihardjo et al 2007 water in glass type and heat pipe type are the two major forms of an etc both having a glass tube as the outer cover and a vacuum space inside the tube chow et al 2011 differently in the vacuum another glass tube carrying working medium is installed inside for the water in glass type with its outer surface coated with solar selective material liu et al 2013 while for the heat pipe type a coated metallic finned tube is installed inside the vacuum a phase change material evaporates inside the finned tube when heated by solar energy and then condenses when releasing heat to the storage tank by heat exchange elsheniti et al 2019 in most solar md applications the low grade solar thermal energy stored in fpc or etc is then extracted to heat up the feed seawater to power the desalination process via direct connection one loop system or heat exchanging two loop system as depicted in fig 4 comparatively two loop systems may prevent the corrosion problem by the seawater from solar collectors porrazzo et al 2013 while one loop systems are more suitable for small applications with lower system complexity and higher operation controllability koschikowski et al 2009 other than solar collectors sgsp have also been employed to couple with md in the literature nakoa et al 2015 an sgsp is one common type of a solar pond where solar energy is absorbed and stored in its bottom region to suppress the convection ranjan and kaushik 2014 warm brine with higher salinity is naturally positioned at the bottom due to its bigger density thus the conserved thermal energy can be extracted from the bottom brine leblanc et al 2011 therefore the natural salt content in seawater renders it a fair couple with sgsp for desalination from an industrial view currently the ranges of electricity and heat consumption per unit volume of water produced for ro med msf and md are depicted in fig 5 gopi et al 2019 though the electricity demand of md is less than the others the massively higher heat consumption impedes it from widespread application wang and chung 2015 therefore solar powered md is still hardly competitive with other solar desalination technologies in industry scale when electricity supply is stable and large areas of solar collectors can significantly elevate operating temperature such as pv ro and solar med consequently the levelized cost of water lcow of solar md was estimated to be 15 18 m 3 saffarini et al 2012 while the lcows of pv ro and solar med were undoubtedly lower being 6 5 9 1 m 3 and 2 6 6 5 m 3 respectively abdelkareem et al 2018 on the other hand solar md in small scale is advantageous over other desalination technologies due to its compact module low working temperature and easy operation etc as discussed in section 1 indeed most implemented solar md plants are in smaller scale than other solar desalination plants thomas et al 2017 moreover the distributed application for household desalination in remote place often demands lightweight and portability therefore the main scope of this article covers the research on solar md in small scale rather than large scale considering that the energy intensity of solar irradiation is usually between 400 and 800 w m 2 around the world li et al 2013 a 10 hour daytime can yield an energy intensity of 4 8 kwh m 2 knowing that the water evaporation heat is around 667 kwh m 3 3 6 l m 2 d 1 of water can be produced assuming a moderate solar thermal efficiency of 50 and no heat recovery the amount of water intake is estimated to be 2 3 l per person per day khan and martin 2015 thus 5 m2 of solar collecting area is probably able to meet the drinking water need of at least a 5 person household 10 15 l d 1 in total consequently the solar md research discussed in this work will be up to around 5 m2 of solar thermal collecting surface 2 3 research status on conventional small scale solar membrane distillation 2 3 1 major previous studies a considerable amount of work has been contributed to the subject of solar powered md for distributed desalination both theoretically and experimentally conventionally the solar collectors introduced in section 2 2 can be directly utilized to generate heat for md based on their simplicity and market availability 2 3 1 1 theoretical studies tracing back to 1991 hogan et al hogan et al 1991 theoretically studied an fpc powered tubular dcmd module with hollow fiber membranes targeting 50 l of freshwater per day the applied membrane area was 1 8 m2 and the installed fpc area was 3 m2 to provide the md heat demand in addition they considered a heat exchanger of 0 7 m2 between the retentate and the cold feed inlet to recover heat koschikowski et al koschikowski et al 2003 ran a simple simulation for a spiral wound agmd module with internal heat recovery the applied solar fpc area was 5 9 m2 with a total membrane area of 8 m2 one important point is that the daily water production was expressed in terms of per unit area of the solar collector the corresponding value was from 11 l per m2 of fpc in winter to 28 l per m2 of fpc in summer both under clear weather this expression can give us a clear idea of the device productivity with regards to the system volume most recently li and lu li and lu 2020 li et al 2020 established a complete systemic mathematical model of a small autonomous sgmd system only powered by solar energy for remote islands and coastal households the model was validated by experimental results under real weather conditions in hong kong 4 92 m2 of solar pv panel and 4 14 m2 of etc were installed to power an sgmd module with a total membrane area of 0 6 m2 daily freshwater production indicated a range between 9 98 l d 1 and 23 26 l d 1 unlike other research in the literature the applied pv area was even larger than the solar thermal collecting area and the produced excess electricity was consumed by the heater inside the feed storage tank instead of being wasted additionally they discussed the impact of the ratio between solar pv area and solar collector area which has rarely been seen elsewhere in the literature however it seems no heat recovery was designed for the sgmd process other than tubular and spiral wound modules a plate and frame dcmd module with flat sheet membranes has also been studied ding et al 2005 one key perspective was revealed that heat recovery is essential to amplify freshwater productivity due to the sparsity of solar energy restraining heat income under limited solar collecting area same for a plate and frame dcmd module 0 13 m2 a two dimensional dynamic model was built to predict the operation in a solar thermally powered system solar collecting area 4 7m2 shim et al 2015 no heat recovery configuration was applied and the calculated stec for freshwater production was between 896 and 1433 kwh m 3 for an sgsp a dcmd desalination system without heat recovery settings was theoretically connected to it by heat exchangers to predict the water production rate suárez and urtubia 2016 the validated model resulted in a water production of 2 5 l d 1 per m2 of the solar pond at a stec of 880 60 kwh m 3 duong et al simulated a typical one loop small dcmd system powered by fpcs duong et al 2017 the result was presented in terms of per unit area of both membrane and solar collector being 19 7 l d 1 per m2 of membrane or 6 3 l d 1 per m2 of fpc according to their system layout fig 6 however still no heat recovery was applied the water production surprisingly decreased with an increasing circulation flow rate and the authors attributed such a phenomenon to the shorter residence time of the saline water inside the solar collectors at higher flow rates 2 3 1 2 experimental studies the framework smades has funded the establishment of some small scale solar driven autonomous agmd systems in irbid jordan banat et al 2007a fpcs of 5 73 m2 was installed to provide heat for a spiral wound agmd module with internal heat recovery the highest production rate attained 19 l d 1 per unit m2 of the solar collecting area recording a stec between 200 and 300 kwh m 3 in alexandria egypt fath et al 2008 a similar system with the same areas of solar collectors and agmd module was tested the archived production rate was lower than the previous work being 11 2 l d 1 per unit area of the fpc field additionally it resulted in a higher stec of 647 kwh m 3 calculated from the test data raluy et al operated a solar fpc and pv powered pgmd system with internal heat recovery for as long as five years from 2005 to 2010 in pozo izquierdo gran canary island spain raluy et al 2012 subiela et al 2009 their meticulous work revealed a daily water production from 5 l d 1 up to 120 l d 1 at the expense of a stec in the range of 140 350 kwh m 3 additionally they summarized the seec supplied by pv which varied from 2 1 to 51 2 kwh m 3 later a tiny experimental agmd module 0 07 m2 solar collector area and 0 05 m2 flat sheet membrane area was tested and optimized chang et al 2012 and maximumly 0 25 l d 1 of water was achieved regarding vmd an etc field of 2 16 m2 was used to drive a vmd module with a flat sheet membrane area of 0 25 m2 wang et al 2015 and the production data was released based on the permeate flux 4 l m 2 h 1 instead of the daily water gain besides the stec was reported as 750 kwh m 3 probably without any heat recovery regime for vmd with hollow fiber membranes an etc pv powered vmd system was established in inner mongolia china deng et al 2020 the surface areas of etc pv and membrane were 1 82 m2 1 62 m2 and 0 1 m2 respectively similarly to the simulation study in li and lu 2020 the pv panel was also connected to an electrical heater inside the feed storage tank to exploit the excess electricity daily production and thermal consumption were not reported but an seec of 79 87 kwh m 3 can be calculated from the result data using an existing lab sgsp with an aperture area of 2 m2 suárez et al 2014 a tubular dcmd module total membrane area 0 1 m2 was driven by the thermal energy storage in sgsp suárez et al 2015 1 16 l of freshwater could be produced daily per unit area of the sgsp also for dcmd kabeel et al added an extra air water cooling unit with an air fan to lower the permeate temperature in order to enhance the transmembrane driving force kabeel et al 2017 the system yielded a daily water production of 33 55 l d 1 with an etc field of 2 61m2 they claimed that the production was improved by 1 25 times at the expense of the cooling unit operation but the consumption of the additional fan was not reported in perth australia shafieian and khiadani 2019 heat pipe etcs were applied to supply heat to a dcmd module with hollow fiber membranes the employment of heat pipe etc intended to avoid the problems of sedimentation corrosion and rustiness caused by feed saline water inside a water in glass etc the constructed device is shown in fig 7 forming an integrated compact system similar to the previous study an extra cooling loop was added to maintain the vapor partial pressure difference across the membrane besides an auxiliary heater was used to fast initiate the desalination process in the morning the gross area of the solar collector was 3 93 m2 and the total membrane area of the tubular dcmd module was 0 2 m2 taking both thermal and electrical energy consumption into consideration the average sec was between 377 and 450 kwh m 3 in all scenarios while the daily production was not clearly reported in this work zarzoum et al built an fpc 3 ⅹ 2m2 pv 1 63m2 powered compact dcmd a total membrane area of 10 m2 desalination system zarzoum et al 2019 with the help of latent heat recovery by preheating the feed with the condenser a total amount of 86 l of freshwater could be obtained on a sunny summer day in kairouan tunisia summarily table 1 below chronicles the key information of the major research work on coupling solar collectors to md modules for a small scale solar powered desalination device the information includes md configuration membrane type hollow fiber hf flat sheet fs spiral wound sw solar collector type and area membrane area daily water production in terms of per unit area of solar collecting surface heat recovery regime sec thermal t electrical e and year of contribution 2 3 2 observations from table 1 the first thing we can see is that almost all the previous work indicated a production rate lower than 20 l d 1 m 2 furthermore the value would be even lower 10 l d 1 m 2 when heat recovery was excluded besides the ratios between solar collecting area and membrane area are scattered being from as low as 0 6 to as high as 36 only in li and lu 2020 a small section was dedicated to the influence of solar collecting area and pv area respectively nonetheless no deep insight into their ratio nor the discussion on the interaction of membrane area and solar unit area was provided more attention should be focused on the overall system footprint for small scale applications considering the mobility and compactness of the distributed device adapted for remote places in this regard solar collecting area would be a key factor that influences the total volume of the system while the total membrane area can be packed into a module with high packing density and placed under the solar collecting surface from the view of heat consumption almost all the available figures are still higher than 200 kwh m 3 being less competitive compared with med or msf while for the systems without heat recovery settings the corresponding values are likely to be even higher this observation also explains the limited production rate under sole solar energy provision in addition though md is principally a thermal driven process certain electrical energy is indeed demanded for the function of pumps sensors etc however little work has included an independent discussion on the variation of electricity consumption let alone the research on its optimization from the data in deng et al 2020 raluy et al 2012 and considering the comparatively low efficiency of pv panels this part of consumption is definitely not negligible besides cooling and condensation stage of md is another important aspect for further study including its efficiency and possible consumption in an energy autarky regime such effort has not yet been seen in the above reviewed papers in summary the performance of the reported solar driven md devices is still less interesting compared with other widely applied desalination technologies gopi et al gopi et al 2019 provided some general ways to improve solar powered md systems in 2019 however it was not targeting small scale autonomous devices and in the author s humble opinion the suggested perspectives might not be entirely promising in the near future and lack some important aspects as discussed in section 2 2 only 6 12 l m 2 d 1 of water can be evaporated even with a perfect solar efficiency of 100 hence the energy source from the sole solar energy against the enormous latent heat of evaporation is the main limitations that restrains md performance therefore the improvement in membrane materials and its properties to enhance heat and mass transfer becomes less relevant when the normal permeate flux of md under steady unlimited heat supply can already easily reach 30 40 l m 2 h 1 li et al 2014 such insignificance of the research on materials was also recently pointed out by patel et al k patel et al 2020 for all thermal desalination technologies instead future research directions should be more centered on innovative module and system design to i intensify the solar thermal energy income which intends to solve the problem from the energy source side and ii augment the heat recovery ratio which is expected to solve the problem from the energy consumption side besides the lifetime of the md system largely depends on the membrane material against wetting fouling and other issues that potentially induce production declination or even a total failure of md process thus studies on membrane materials to prevent the above mentioned issues for long time operations such as the work in raluy et al 2012 subiela et al 2009 also demand more efforts together with the research on improving the efficiency in water production such efforts were aggregated in some recent dedicated review works alsebaeai et al 2020 rezaei et al 2018 in this review paper several perspectives on the performance enhancement of an autonomous small scale solar md system are given in the following sections being oriented to two general paths i e intensifying solar energy source and reducing md energy consumption together with a critical review of some cutting edge work on these directions a concluding remark is then provided at the end 3 performance enhancement via intensified solar energy harvesting from the energy source side an intensified solar energy harvesting is undoubtedly able to improve the production rate of a solar powered md system from the authors point of view i direct solar heating to improve the solar utilization efficiency and ii solar concentration to multiply the solar radiation that falls on the collecting surface would be the two foreseeable pathways 3 1 solar direct heating to reduce thermal loss a relatively new research field of directly integrating md with solar energy absorption is continuously sprouting compared with the conventional system layout reviewed in section 2 3 the direct heating setting can not only cut down the thermal loss during the heat transfer from solar collectors to the final solar energy utilization but also compact the entire system for distributed applications 3 1 1 direct integration between membrane distillation and thermal collectors in fact this idea dates back to 2009 murase et al 2009 where agmd with flat sheet membranes was directly integrated into a solar basin still later in 2013 by the same research group pv was further added into the device forming a pv t md compact module murase et al 2013 as shown in fig 8 pv t is a compound solar collector where a cooling unit is usually adhered to the back of pv cells to reduce the operating temperature as well as to collect the excess solar heat xie et al 2016 however the resultant distillate production was considerably low due to the aim of the study was more towards electricity generation this integration concept was also applied by another research team in 2010 for dcmd chen and ho 2010 and in 2016 for agmd ho et al 2016 as illustrated in fig 9 taking dcmd as an example the original water circulation space under the absorber plate in an fpc is reconfigured as an md module thus the feed flow directly received solar thermal energy absorbed by the absorber plate however no dynamic performance on varying solar conditions was reported under a similar module structure ma et al theoretically studied the performance of vmd by a comprehensive dynamic simulation including solar radiation model vmd separation model and 1 dimensional module model ma et al 2018 vmd was chosen on account of its low transmembrane conductive heat loss to maximize the efficiency in solar utilization alkhudhiri et al 2012 khayet 2011 a daily production rate of 8 l m 2 d 1 was demonstrated but a high electrical consumption seec was also revealed 239 kwh m 3 due to the intensive work of the vacuum pump sucking out permeate vapor a well improved performance with much higher production rate and much shrunk consumption was then predicted upon applying a suitable heat recovery strategy however no experimental test results were provided considering multi stage heat recovery single stage 3 stage and 10 stage solar distillers were fabricated and tested for passive operation chiavazzo et al 2018 and ptfe membranes were inserted between two hydrophilic layers under a simulated solar radiation intensity of 900 w m 2 in lab the resulted distillate fluxes were 0 48 1 44 2 95 l m 2 h 1 for the 1 3 and 10 stage modules at the secs of 1871 624 and 305 kwh m 3 respectively the 10 stage module obviously exceeded the thermodynamic limit of evaporation 667 kwh m 3 due to the heat recovery between stages furthermore field tests on roof and floating on sea surface were carried out a 3 stage module was enclosed by foam to float the module to fit real application scenarios the production rate recorded 1 5 l m 2 h 1 at a sec of 564 kwh m 3 similarly a 2 layer passive agmd device was designed and tested xue et al 2018 as illustrated in fig 10 sponges were installed to replace the feed channel and its active circulation however the daily production rate was rather limited being 3 67 l m 2 d 1 mainly due to the low feed flow rate for md process in passive mode inspired by the above module designs both passive dead end mode and active cross flow mode modules were studied for a 3 stage dcmd configuration and pv t pattern same as the idea in murase et al 2013 was applied as an addition wang et al 2019 the lab test under one sun irradiation indicated a water production rate around 1 7 l m 2 h 1 and a pv efficiency of more than 11 however they pointed out that the passive mode might not be suitable for long term operation additionally they conducted a field test using a 5 stage module at the scale of 10cm ⅹ 10cm and a daily accumulated water production of 4 7 6 1 l d 1 m 2 was yielded together with a pv efficiency at 11 7 11 9 the heat recovery between stages was revealed by a thermal efficiency more than 100 126 195 the above mentioned work on module integration all concerns fpc shaped configuration as for etc shaped module also a few efforts have been already witnessed considering the tubular shape hollow fiber membranes are the reasonable choice instead of flat sheet membranes taking a normal etc collector of 1 6 m2 hollow fiber membranes with a total area of 0 2 m2 were placed into the inner glass tube li et al 2019 using the outside in flow arrangement for a vmd process fig 11 however the main objective of this device seemed more towards hot water production rather than desalination the desalination performance of the device was limited to 4 l d 1 at a calculated seec of 208 313 kwh m 3 and a stec of over 1000 kwh m 3 recently a similar configuration integrating vmd with etc was experimentally studied natural convection mode was employed inside the etc to keep the feed staying longer in the module to minimize heat loss and to remove electricity consumption for pumping bamasag et al 2021 the system could produce 6 7 l of fresh water on a daily basis per m2 of solar absorbing area at an overall thermal efficiency of 51 for dcmd such configuration has also been studied by the same group bamasag et al 2020 outdoor tests showed an average water production of 0 37 l h 1 per m2 of solar collecting area after comparison the application of such integrated module was claimed to increase md performance by up to 17 from the above advancements we can estimate that the freshwater production rate of a single layer integrated solar md module remains limited generally 5 l d 1 m 2 multi layered modules can significantly improve the performance indicating the importance of heat recovery regime however the productions after multi staging reviewed above hardly reached 10 l m 2 d 1 with a sec value above 300 kwh m 3 and the stacked multiple module setting has to be further designed to fit small scale applications will be discussed again in section 4 1 this implies a higher thermal efficiency and maybe more innovative integrated module structures are yet to be developed such as the modules applying photothermal membranes discussed in the following part 3 1 2 photothermal membranes for localized solar heating in order to further integrate md process with solar collecting innovative membrane materials were developed to join the functions of solar absorption and md separation onto the same membrane in 2013 summers and lienhard summers and lienhard v 2013a 2013b were the first researchers to propose a solar absorbing membrane in this fashion fig 12 feed saline water inside an agmd module can be directly heated at the surface of evaporation thus the thermal resistance of the boundary layer can be much lowered enhancing the overall solar thermal efficiency and relieving temperature polarization a composite membrane was therefore fabricated made of a hydrophilic membrane millipore nitrocellulose absorbing solar energy layered on top of a normal md hydrophobic membrane experimental results indicated that lower feed mass flow rate favored the permeate flux same as discussed in duong et al 2017 for an fpc powered dcmd module which reached around 0 36 kg m 2 h 1 under a simulated solar radiation intensity of 750 w m 2 inspired by this configuration and by the new concept of solar thermal interfacial evaporation huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 p f liu et al 2019 s liu et al 2019 liu et al 2016 shi et al 2017 xu et al 2019 recent studies on the fabrication and testing of new photothermal membrane material for solar md have been in an outburst in 2017 politano et al developed a photothermal pvdf membrane with ag nanoparticles np incorporation for vmd operation politano antonio et al 2016 the resultant desalination performance under a uv lamp at an intensive radiant heating power of 23000 w m 2 exhibited a higher permeate flux and a claimed lower sec than a lab scale small ro unit being 25 7 l m 2 h 1 and 1490 kwh m 3 respectively dongare et al dispersed carbon black nps into polyvinyl alcohol pva solution and layered the hydrophilic pva onto a pvdf membrane to form a solar absorbing membrane for dcmd process termed nanophotonics enabled solar membrane distillation nesmd dongare et al 2017 the permeate flux was found to be strongly affected by the ambient temperature due to the heat loss to the surroundings which varied between 0 22 and 0 55 kg m 2 h 1 at a thermal efficiency up to 53 8 under 700 w m 2 solar illumination a 4l per day production was predicted in a summer day another work on photothermal membranes using carbon black nps or sio2 au nanoshells ns for the same nesmd module pushed its thermal efficiency to a higher value of 74 6 under 1 sun unit illumination 1367 w m 2 wu et al 2017 a research group in japan dyed ptfe membrane with disperse red 1 and disperse blue 14 fujiwara 2017 fujiwara and kikuchi 2017 to evaporate water on the surface by solar energy the permeate flux calculated from the provided data was 0 78 l m 2 h 1 at a lowest sec of 1129 kwh m 3 then in 2018 an easy to fabricate polydopamine pda coated pvdf membrane was developed for a small dcmd module wu et al 2018 at an ambient temperature 20 c the permeate flux was observed to be 0 49 kg m 2 h 1 under a solar irradiance of 750 w m 2 and 4 23 kg m 2 h 1 under an intensified radiation of 7000 w m 2 the corresponding solar conversion efficiency was 45 and 41 respectively huang et al huang et al 2018 modified ptfe membrane with reduced graphene oxide rgo and then coated the membrane with a pda layer after 1 hour of solar illumination at an intensity of 1 kw m 2 0 7163 kg m 2 of vapor permeated through the membrane equal to a thermal efficiency of 49 0 instead of modifying the membrane ang et al installed a three dimensional plasmonic spacer network using nickel foam on top of the membrane to generate localized heating ang et al 2019 solar illumination was only adopted to enhance the permeate flux from a fixed feed temperature a photothermal efficiency as high as 98 was claimed while at a rather high sec of 2500 kwh m 3 li et al prepared fe3o4 polyvinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene fe3o4 pvdf hfp membrane and the experiments resulted in a photothermal efficiency of 53 li et al 2020 in order to address the fouling and salt deposition issues on the membrane a small vapor gap was arranged to separate the evaporation surface and the membrane surface gong et al 2019 a high thermal efficiency of 73 4 and a permeate flux of 1 13 kg m 2 h 1 at 1 sun were attained the evaporation took place on the solar absorbing surface instead which was a customized graphene nickel foam with polymer coating 12 fold solar concentration by a fresnel lens was then installed for a field test yielding a daily production of 92 8 kg m 2 d 1 huang et al huang et al 2020a 2020b developed and manufactured polydimethylsiloxane carbon nanotube poly vinylidene fluoride pdms cnt pvdf membranes by electrospinning and spraying for a two level agmd device under solar illumination of 1 kw m 2 a maximum production rate of 1 43 l m 2 h 1 and a lowest sec at 700 kwh m 3 were achieved owing to the two level heat recovery most recently a multi layer agmd device exhibited in fig 13 was designed and tested with a ptfe membrane spray coated by a composition of trichloro 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorooctyl silane ftcs polymerized dopamine pda and graphene nanosheets at the top layer ghim et al 2021 the rest stages were all applying conventional ptfe membranes under 750 w m 2 solar radiation a water flux of 1 17 kg m 2 h 1 was obtained at a high solar conversion efficiency of 105 this value was higher than all the reported thermal efficiencies in photothermal md studies underlining again the significance of heat recovery in general a boost in the research on photothermal membrane materials is observed for the application in solar md process however according to the above reported performance its improvement over the integrated modules without solar absorbing membranes section 3 1 1 is still not clear this also confirms the insignificance in new material study to enhance the performance of solar thermal desalination technologies k patel et al 2020 therefore more research on module and system design to magnify heat income such as solar concentration that will be introduced in section 3 2 and heat recovery will be introduced in section 4 awaits more attention nevertheless efforts on membrane material are indeed necessary but should be more essentially on the direction of long term field operation against fouling scaling wetting or other problems that can cause performance declination for example the work in gong et al 2019 3 2 solar concentration for more solar energy income a common recognition in all previous efforts was the lack of solar radiation intensity in this regard solar concentration for md might be a significant perspective for future research directions though only a few articles have addressed this subject for now under the condition of solar simulators in lab almost all the previous work on photothermal membranes section 3 1 2 has attempted using intensified solar radiation and the results showed a sharply increased production rate under multiple sun illumination however more outdoor tests of a thoroughly designed device with a real solar concentrator are yet to conduct such as the field test of a scaled module with solar concentration by a fresnel lens gong et al 2019 as a cost effective solar concentrator at low concentration ratio a compound parabolic concentrator cpc was applied to power a commercial agmd module scarab guillén burrieza et al 2011 2015 and a stec around 1000 kwh m 3 was registered however a large area of cpc field 500 m2 was applied in these works for a relatively small total membrane area 2 8 m2 being not applicable for small scale distributed systems a techno economic assessment of different solar collector types fpc etc cpc was as well conducted vmd with hollow fiber membranes was integrated in the absorber tube of a cpc collector in mathematical modeling abdallah et al 2014 a daily water production of 38 75 l could be attained but more details on the model coupling of solar energy and md were lacking concentrating solar power plants csp using solar concentrators with relatively higher concentration ratios parabolic trough collectors ptc linear fresnel reflectors lfr solar tower were connected to md modules by the same research group soomro and kim 2018a 2018b 2018c however seawater only worked as the cooling medium and exploited the waste heat of the massive csp for desalination most recently the first attempt to combine a small concentrating pv t cpv t with agmd was reported using a simple v trough concentrator elminshawy et al 2020 the waste heat from the cpv t cooling and the thermal energy from a 6 kw electric heater were used together to power the desalination process without discussing the stand alone md performance the concentration of solar energy can definitely multiply the available solar energy and resolve the energy sparsity which brings in better production however higher operating temperature would be attained with potentially higher thermal loss and faster salt accumulation a trade off in concentration intensity requests detailed study regarding this issue furthermore the solar collecting area would be enlarged by the concentrator as well which is essentially the same matter of applying more solar collectors taking the target of small compact system into consideration concentrating solar md devices yet necessitate a holistic design and optimization on the entire system to meet not only the fresh water and cost demand but also the system simplicity efficiency mobility and footprint requirements besides the choice of concentration ratio also raises the question of the most suited solar collecting area for a certain md module i e the fittest area ratio between solar collecting area and membrane area which is hardly seen in the literature and needs exploration 3 3 summary in general a limited production rate and a rather high sec characterize the reports on integrating solar absorption into md modules according to the review in section 3 1 besides the development on new configurations and photothermal membrane materials still necessitates more long time operation tests to study the lifetime of the whole md system then the coupling of solar concentration and md module is obviously effective and awaits more detailed studies however the multiplication of solar absorbing area would complicate the module configuration and not help dwindle the sec of water production therefore the research efforts that shrink the massive heat consumption are of great significance which would in turn enlarge the production rate given a certain amount of available solar energy accordingly the next section discusses the concerned perspectives 4 performance enhancement via reducing energy consumption regarding the energy consumption the secs in all the documented studies are still in the range between 100 and 2000 kwh m 3 higher than some widely adopted thermal desalination technologies like msf and med a universal observation lies in the lack of detailed optimization study on the pv panels for electricity consumption except a small section in li and lu 2020 discussing the influence of pv panel area on the other hand a pv subsystem is probably not demanded in the articles on passive systems alsaati and marconnet 2018 bamasag et al 2021 chiavazzo et al 2018 fujiwara 2017 fujiwara and kikuchi 2017 huang et al 2020a wang et al 2019 however long term operations of passive md are often impeded by fouling problem on the membrane surface due to the quasi static saline water the common solution of agitation also demands electricity alsaadi et al 2014 meng et al 2015 thus more efforts on the optimization of coupling pv systems are still expected in the future for the major consumption of heat an effective heat recovery strategy still requires more efforts khayet 2013 though this issue had been identified since the very beginning of md concept findley 1967 in this regard three possible solutions represent the future research directions i module stacking recovering the condensation heat between module layers ii internal heat recovery enhancement more applicable for agmd pgmd iii innovative coupling with other devices condensing vapor externally while recovering the heat more applicable for vmd sgmd 4 1 module stacking one of the earliest concept of stacked multiple md modules in a solar powered desalination system can be found in vega beltrán et al 2010 with multi stage md the feed seawater of one stage acts as the cooling water for the previous stage and thus gets heated while the feed of the next stage receives the condensation heat from the permeate conventionally multi stage thermal desalination such as med and msf demands large space for the entire facility due to the multiplied unit and large amounts of vapor guillén burrieza et al 2011 similarly most of the literature that studied multi stage md aimed scaling up with a large area of solar collectors chafidz et al 2016 2014 dutta et al 2020 kim et al 2021 2015 lee et al 2018 omar et al 2021 zaragoza et al 2014 zhao et al 2013 being in the range from 20 m2 to 550 m2 since memsys released their commercial vacuum multi effect md v memd module in 2010 andrés mañas et al 2020 most of the concerned studies have been applying this v memd concept or directly the memsys module similar to an msf process with reduced pressure chafidz et al 2016 2014 kim et al 2021 2015 omar et al 2021 zaragoza et al 2014 zhao et al 2013 recently simulation studies on dcmd began to appear as an alternative for multi stage mds dutta et al 2020 lee et al 2018 yet all of the aforementioned work included a big solar collecting area which is out of the scope of the present work thanks to the high compactness nature of md and the development of the research on novel integrated modules reviewed in section 3 1 the configuration of multi layered md started to be frequented in small distributed devices chiavazzo et al 2018 ghim et al 2021 huang et al 2020b signorato et al 2020 wang et al 2019 the highest recorded production rate among them was the agmd module in chiavazzo et al 2018 being 2 95 l m 2 h 1 at a thermal efficiency of 218 for a ten stage module under 900 w m 2 illumination although the application of membranes in agmd has recently been proven to be positive on water production compared with solar stills without membranes shirsath et al 2020 an innovative 10 stage small solar still with direct solar heating recorded an ultrahigh efficiency of 385 xu et al 2020 such an achievement indicates plenty of room for improvement of small solar multi layered md modules from the experience of commercialized technologies of med msf and the md studies introduced in this section module stacking to form a multi stage process is surely an effective method to enhance heat recovery for systems with separated solar unit and md unit future outlook would be the development on smaller devices rather than the currently reported large solar collecting areas for small scale integrated solar md devices section 3 1 higher energy efficiency is yet to attain through module design innovation and optimization 4 2 module internal heat recovery in terms of heat recovery inside the md module itself the configuration of agmd pgmd is the natural candidate due to its vapor condensation on the condenser plate in the module fig 2c its thermal efficiency has been proven to be the highest among all implemented md configurations summers et al 2012 though dcmd and vmd are the two most studied md types throughout the literature thomas et al 2017 due to the higher permeate flux than agmd pgmd under the same controlled operating condition gonzález et al 2017 the frequency of agmd pgmd appearances in solar powered systems is obviously higher than vmd and no lower than dcmd according to the research reviewed in section 2 and 3 it is also a reflection of the fact that the total amount of solar energy input is the major limitation to md process instead of the mass transfer quality often represented by permeate flux in order to further improve the performance of agmd pgmd one approach is to enhance the permeate vapor condensation on the condenser plate and consequently the heat transfer between the cooling feed and the condenser plate the research group in mit has contributed to this issue tremendously swaminathan et al 2018 2016a 2016b warsinger et al 2015 2018 a superhydrophobic condensing surface was developed to form a jumping droplet condensation which significantly strengthens the vapor condensation and subsequently the overall md performance warsinger et al 2015 furthermore a detailed study on the visualized condensate flow patterns in agmd again correlates the hydrophobicity of the condensing surface with possibly thinner air gap size designs and stronger thermal efficiency warsinger et al 2018 such progress in condensation enhancement is promising in being applied to solar md systems under varying outdoor conditions besides in contrast with the conventional view that the heat conduction between the feed and the permeate ought to be cut off to prevent heat loss a conductive gap md was studied cgmd inserting materials with high conductivity into the gap swaminathan et al 2016a it surprisingly produced better heat recovery and higher energy efficiency at the same module size and the same constant permeate flux swaminathan et al 2016a 2016b meanwhile practical applications of agmd pgmd cgmd into solar powered stand alone desalination system require further study instead of the evaluations under fixed flux and steady heat supply at the scale of the module agmd pgmd with internal heat recovery surely has been the most successfully commercialized md configuration promoted by several international corporations zaragoza et al 2018 fraunhofer ise has been developing spiral wound agmd pgmd modules with internal heat recovery since 2001 koschikowski et al 2009 2003 raluy et al 2012 ruiz aguirre et al 2017 schwantes et al 2013 winter et al 2012 2011 feed and condensing channels flow counter currently and heat is recovered by the stacked channel as depicted in fig 14 winter et al 2017 additionally dcmd has lately been integrated with such spiral wound modules as well winter et al 2017 hagedorn et al 2017 the recorded sec for these spiral wound modules has been in the range of 120 350 kwh m 3 and the value for the newly developed dcmd spiral wound module was 215 kwh m 3 until now most of the studied modules were relatively big in membrane surface area 7 m2 zaragoza et al 2018 and probably coordinate with large solar collectors nevertheless the spiral wound modules indeed possess the capability of efficiently recovering condensation heat internally based on its performance data therefore future concerned research can possibly be conducted towards smaller modules under outdoor operation with limited solar collecting area and maybe innovative integrations with solar direct heating for a compact module 4 3 external condensation heat recovery in conventional vmd and sgmd vapor is either transported by vacuum vmd or blown out by cold inert gas flow sgmd eventually permeated vapor has to be condensed outside the md module and it is often reckoned as one of the disadvantages for demanding an external condenser when compared with other md configurations ahmed et al 2020 however from the authors point of view the vapor flux coming out of the module offers more possibilities in intensively recovering latent heat by efficient condensation strategy assisted by outside devices due to low vapor pressure and thus low condensation temperature in vacuum or in sweeping gas the condensation in vmd and sgmd often poses difficulty not to mention reusing its latent heat ma et al 2020 most recently miladi et al proposed using liquid ring pump in solar vmd to simultaneously condense vapor and create vacuum miladi et al 2021 however the vapor latent heat was not efficiently recovered in the vacuum due to the low condensation temperature yielding a stec of a little bit lower than 700 kwh m 3 seec was otherwise effectively reduced to 4 2 7 47 kwh m 3 compared with other solar vmd works using conventional vacuum pumps li et al 2019 ma et al 2018 compressing low temperature and low pressure water vapor to an elevated temperature before condensation and heat recovery could be a possible solution in the last 2 years a research team in nanjing china has been working on a combined system coupling vmd and mechanical vapor recompression mvr si et al 2020b 2020a 2019 the vmd permeate vapor was led to a compressor outside the module and compressed to a relatively high temperature then cooled and efficiently condensed by feed recirculation from the vmd module in this fashion the condensation heat in higher temperature can be absorbed and recovered by the feed flow the overall sec was found to be as low as 145 kwh m 3 including the electrical heater the compressor the vacuum pump and the circulation pumps applying the similar idea ma et al utilized a full heat pump cycle for an autonomous small scale solar powered vmd system ma et al 2020 with the integrated vmd fpc module design in ma et al 2018 as demonstrated in fig 15 the condenser of the heat pump was in heat exchange with feed recirculation while the evaporator of the heat pump was kept in low temperature in order to efficiently condense permeate vapor from vmd thus the heat pump loop elevates the grade of the condensation heat from the permeate vapor and recovers it to the feed that needs heating simulation and optimization results revealed a maximum production rate over 30 l d 1 per unit solar area of the vmd fpc module exceeding the value of almost all the previous research on small distributed solar md system the corresponding stec and seec was about 200 and 56 kwh m 3 respectively according to the simulation however experimental system is yet to be established to confirm such a performance same idea was also seen in shaulsky et al 2020 for a heat pump assisted dcmd process without solar energy involved simulation resulted in an impressive 10 kwh m 3 of overall electricity consumption for freshwater production without discussing the thermal energy for feed side heating most of the above mentioned work in fact consumes extra electricity to realize higher water production and lower heat demand thus for a distributed design small pv systems must be further included in detail for future studies moreover the additional cost and the system complexity brought by the external facilities should also be discussed overall the concerned works are currently still in theoretical stage experimental establishments are yet to be constructed to demonstrate the effectiveness nonetheless the predicted specific consumption of 10 kwh m 3 in shaulsky et al 2020 manifests the great prospect on the future experimental efforts of compressor heat pump assisted distributed solar md systems 4 4 summary based on the perspectives on heat recovery introduced in section 4 the sec of water production was reduced to as low as 305 kwh m 3 by stacking multiple md modules in a small experimental device with direct solar heating chiavazzo et al 2018 while by module internal heat recovery in a spiral wound module an even lower sec of around 200 kwh m 3 could be achieved in pilot plants winter et al 2017 hagedorn et al 2017 however the concerned reports were mostly coupled to a relatively big solar collector field and no direct solar heating regime was applied aiming a small desalination device finally the combination with external condensation heat recovery by compressor heat pump indicated an overall sec of 145 kwh m 3 si et al 2019 and an impressive seec of only 10 kwh m 3 shaulsky et al 2020 nonetheless corresponding experimental studies are yet to develop including the pv panels that has to be installed to provide electricity moreover the extra cost for the additional facilities and the operational stability have to be experimentally checked in long time tests to demonstrate its lifetime and economic efficiency 5 conclusions water crisis has been and will durably be a major issue around the globe especially for the scattered population in remote coastal areas or isolated islands as an emerging desalination technology membrane distillation md is deemed prospective in distributed solar powered desalination for freshwater provision in dispersed communities related research works are summarily reviewed with certain observations primarily on the water production rate and energy consumption critical perspectives are then provided in two major directions intensifying solar energy harvesting which aims the advancement from the energy source side reducing md energy consumption which aims the advancement from the energy spending side in order to more efficiently utilize solar energy solar direct heating has been a rising interest in the literature in recent years new integrated module designs that combine solar absorption and md into one compact module can effectively minimize the heat loss in piping and heat exchanging moreover the piling development in photothermal membranes that can further integrate solar collection and md separation onto the same surface for more enhanced thermal efficiency however current concerned research works still indicate a rather limited production rate and high specific energy consumption mainly due to the sparsity of solar energy thus the future research direction is to be shifted to more innovative system designs which might include solar concentration and heat recovery regarding the former current contributions on concentrated solar md systems are more directed towards large solar collectors small scale holistically designed devices require future explorations and the optimized ratio of solar collecting area and membrane area is yet to receive more attention regarding the latter an efficient heat recovery regime would be an inevitable route to lower the consumption of md to overcome the energy barrier of water evaporation module stacking inspired by the commercialized med and msf could be an obvious option small compact multi stage solar md modules deserve more efforts given the current research status mainly on space occupied systems similar to med msf newly designed small integrated multi layered md devices yet have large improvement possibilities module internal heat recovery by using condensation energy to heat the feed flow is another important way to raise thermal efficiency adapted for agmd pgmd and even dcmd module recent studies on condensation efficiency and the unique spiral wound md module are both promising and their applications in small distributed solar md modules or even integrated modules awaits further examination lastly external condensation in vmd sgmd could be exploited by the assistance from other facilities especially compressors heat pumps encouraging results were shown by replacing the massive heat consumption with limited electricity for the compression cycle which also highlights the need for the optimization study on pv subsystems in a distributed operation manner experimental research on such a combination is also expected to confirm the impressive simulation results from the authors view a largely enhanced performance of autonomous small solar md would potentially be obtained from the combination of the research perspectives discussed in this paper integrating direct solar heating into md modules is innovative and promising however instead of developing new membrane materials that provide better solar absorption and mass transfer efficacy currently more contributions should be made towards the novel designs that enhance incident solar radiation and heat recovery efficiency after massively improving the production rate and reducing the specific consumption studies on new materials at a reasonable cost and the optimized operation control could be more interesting by then nonetheless the research on membrane materials against wetting fouling scaling and other issues that hamper long term operations should be dedicated all along in parallel declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work was supported by the fellowship of china postdoctoral science foundation no 2020tq0186

16979,in recent years the ubiquitous detection and accumulation of microplastics mps in the aquatic environment have raised significant concerns on water security and long term ecological impacts all around the world nevertheless critical reviews on strategic control and effective remediation of mps in the aqueous phase are still lacking in this work we summarise the origins and types of mps and then introduce the methodologies for extraction identification and quantification more importantly we for the first time provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the emerging mps removal and transformation technologies except for biodegradation this review presents new applications of advanced oxidation processes aops for mps degradation and utilisation including photocatalysis photoreforming and fenton like reactions physical or catalytic thermal treatment can transform plastics into value added nanocarbons or hydrocarbons these transformation technologies demonstrate great potentials in dealing with mps the review will guide researchers to further explore the feasible approaches and develop new strategies for advanced control and remediation of mps in the future keywords microplastics advanced oxidation processes purification transformation catalysis 1 introduction since the first synthesis of polystyrene based plastics by eduard simon in 1839 there have been numerous studies on plastics diversification properties improvement and advanced plastics technology alimba and faggio 2019 chen and patel 2012 kroon et al 2016 this can be reflected by the number of publications which have been exponentially increasing in the past 10 years fig 1 a plastics have fascinating features and versatility for diverse applications and the global yields of plastics soared to 368 million tonnes in 2019 from 1 5 million tonnes in 1950 alimba and faggio 2019 plasticseurope 2020 fig 1 b and are estimated to achieve 33 billion tonnes by 2050 rochman et al 2013 packaging building and construction are by far the largest plastic end use markets among various types of plastics polyethylene pe polypropylene pp and polyvinyl chloride pvc are the most consumed products plasticseurope 2020 though plastic debris was firstly reported in the early 1970s the term microplastics was not raised to describe plastic pollution until 2004 by thomspon fig 1 c horton et al 2017 thompson et al 2004 microplastics mps defined as plastics smaller than 5 mm in size were firstly reported in 2004 and raised increasing public awareness and research interests thereafter thompson et al 2004 the upper size of mps is recognized as 5 mm in most research but the lower limit as the dividing line between mps and nanoplastics nps is inconsistent in research which could be 100 nm nguyen et al 2019 or 1 μm sobhani et al 2020 a universal terminology and criterion has been proposed to categorise plastic debris hartmann et al 2019 whereas some elements are debatable thus the definition and categorisation framework cannot be fixed and needs to be developed in the future the most abundant mps according to a previous study are pe pp pvc polystyrene ps and polyamides pa alimba and faggio 2019 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 they exist in various shapes and morphologies including fibres fragments films pellets beads etc which influence their behaviours and fates in nature li et al 2020a however the definition of each shape is still vague and needs a general criterion for the classification so far mps are pervasive around the globe under the effects of wind action ocean current and river flow the small size feature of mps results in their ingestion by various organisms especially low trophic level animals causing unexpected accumulative and adverse consequences to the food chain it has been reported that over 690 marine species have confronted debris of which 92 are made of plastics burgess and ho 2017 moreover these mps are resistant to bio photo degradation in the natural environment and the number of mps persisted in the environment will keep increasing up to now plastics account for over 60 of floating debris in the oceans gewert et al 2015 in the process of plastic manufacture various additives are added to obtain specific characteristics e g antiaging and antioxidising which are typically hazardous chemicals to the environment the relatively high surface area and wealthy functional groups also enable mps to draft adsorb toxic organic inorganic compounds and transfer them to the food web which are the indirect risks of mps furthermore mps can induce a series of physical and toxic effects on animals such as a reduction in growth rate oxidative stress and false satiation auta et al 2017 additionally mps have been frequently detected in human food including table salts tea bags and drinking water zhang et al 2020 posing potential threats to public health therefore it is critical and urgent to issue policies on plastics regulations and management by the governments and to develop effective strategies to control mps pollution considering the continuous accretion of plastics waste for example a policy has been made to ban polyethylene microbeads in america in 2015 strifling 2016 despite the efforts from governments and individuals to mitigate the environmental input of plastics effective strategies and technologies are essential to control and remediate the existing mps wastewater treatment plants wwtps can attain high mps removal efficiency over 90 using tertiary treatment however a large volume of mps will be still released into the environment an effective method to reduce mps input is to substitute conventional plastics with bioplastics according to a report from european bioplastics the global production capacity of bioplastics including bio based biodegradable or both in 2019 was 2 11 million tonnes most of which were applied in the market of packaging textiles agriculture horticulture consumer goods building and transport european bioplastics 2019 bioplastics can be defined as biodegradable plastics or plastics produced from plants or animals bio based bio based plastics are not necessarily biodegradable and vice versa for example non degradable bioplastics include bio based pe polyethylene terephthalate pet pa which occupy almost half of the bioplastic market in 2019 european bioplastics 2019 on the other hand biodegradable plastics includes polybutylene adipate terephthalate pbat polybutylenesuccinate pbs polylactic acid pla polyhydroxybutyrates pha and starch pectin chitosan based blends composites fojt et al 2020 these plastics can be degraded naturally or digested by the microorganisms in the environment in relatively short time less than 180 days which signifies that the biodegradable plastics will release microplastics called bio microplastics faster than conventional plastics if the conditions for complete biodegradation are not satisfied sintim et al 2019 but the differences between the environmental impacts of bio microplastics and conventional microplastics are ambiguous sintim et al 2019 there are mainly four stages of biodegradation 1 plastic fragmentation by biofilms 2 microorganisms release extracellular enzymes to depolymerise plastic fragments 3 the depolymerised small molecules enter the cells of microorganisms and 4 small molecules are mineralised by intracellular enzymes fojt et al 2020 biodegradation can proceed in two ways aerobic and anaerobic degradation the aerobic pathway will produce co2 h2o and heat but heat cannot be captured or utilized in contrary anaerobic process will store the energy in ch4 accompanied with by products of co2 h2s and h2o however research on anaerobic degradation is still in infancy and needs future investigation bátori et al 2018 though bioplastics demonstrate the potential as a substitution of petroleum based plastics they only have a minimal share of total plastics production about 1 european bioplastics 2019 also research on bioplastic degradation by chemical treatment is rare thus bioplastics will not be discussed in this review a more comprehensive summary of the degradation of bioplastics can be referred to recent reviews bátori et al 2018 fojt et al 2020 polman et al 2020 rameshkumar et al 2020 thakur et al 2018 except cutting off the source of mps up to now numerous approaches have been proposed to degrade or transform conventional mps such as biodegradation photocatalysis advanced oxidation processes aops thermal treatments and wastewater treatment technologies previously biodegradation of plastics by bacteria and fungi has been extensively studied various bacteria strains were reported to be reactive for plastic degradation and the corresponding enzymes were extracted to evaluate the efficiency roager and sonnenschein 2019 yoshida et al 2016 though these studies are not directly dealing with mps they can provide knowledge for the development of new technologies towards mps elimination another strategy is chemical reaction to oxidise and mineralise mps into harmless compounds via advanced oxidation technologies in a recent study photodegradation demonstrates as an auspicious approach for the degradation and transformation of mps into small molecule fuels jiao et al 2020 the concept of upgrading of mps into value added fuels is appealing in terms of carbon emission and energy regeneration in addition fenton fenton likes systems use peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds as oxidants to produce highly reactive oxygen species ros to decompose mps directly kang et al 2019 miao et al 2020 the aops technique was very effective and could achieve respectful degradation rates in a relatively short time compared with biodegradation also the degradation products can act as carbon sources for algae s growth kang et al 2019 thermal approaches such as pyrolysis and gasification have also been used for mps treatment the most fascinating feature of the technology is its high efficiency in mps transformation into fuels such as ch4 h2 and co but such a process requires high temperature and product selectivity is usually low recently microwave treatment with a fealox catalyst was used to produce high purity h2 and carbon nanotubes within 90 seconds jie et al 2020 except the catalytic systems improving the mps removal efficiency in a wastewater treatment plant is also a promising option a membrane bioreactor is reported to exhibit the highest removal capability 99 99 among various wastewater treatment processes talvitie et al 2017 though a variety of mps removal strategies have been recently developed no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive summary on these findings or to provide critical comments in the field this review aims to comprehensively overview the recent advances in mps remediation by showcasing the advantages and bottlenecks of each technology before that sources and types of mps will be briefly introduced because the mps properties determine the susceptibility of different treatments understanding the plastic characteristics will help select the appropriate technology also sampling methods are briefly presented because it is vital to the future research on the identification and quantification of environmental mps prior to remediation on this basis we provide perspectives and directions for future studies on mps purification strategies particularly photocatalysis and thermal treatment are very promising in terms of energy recovery as they can convert mps into value added fuels in addition fenton fenton like systems and biodegradation will decompose mps into small molecule nutrients for microorganism utilisation thus mps remediation technologies will not only secure water safety but also help address issues of energy crisis and sustainability 2 microplastics in the environment 2 1 sources of mps there are mainly three fates of plastic waste recycle thermal destruction incineration and discard or in a managed system geyer et al 2017 though the discarded rate has been declining since 1980 around 4 9 billion tonnes of plastics have been accumulating in landfills or the natural environment globally from 1950 to 2015 consisting of 60 of the overall plastics ever manufactured and 79 of the plastics waste geyer et al 2017 these discarded plastic wastes are the potential origins of mps generally mps mainly come from two routes primary and secondary sources primary source referred as unaged plastics are those plastics manufactured less than 5 mm in size for specific cosmetic and industrial applications including microbeads in facial scrubs toothpaste and air blast cleaning media auta et al 2017 the extensive use of primary mps results in a large mass discharge into the environment via municipal effluents murphy et al 2016 the amount of plastic waste for recycling is increasing every year plasticseurope 2020 and up to 99 9 of mps can be removed by the sewage treatment unit however a significant number of mps penetrate the filtration systems and are discharged into the environment under the effects of ultraviolet radiation weathering and physical abrasion large pieces of plastics will fragment into small debris and eventually into mps which are referred as the secondary source for example plastic strips will produce mps only after eight weeks of exposure to intertidal salt marshes by surface erosion from mechanical abrasion periwinkle grazing and microbial degradation tagg et al 2017 in addition mps formation is subjected to geological factors intense uv radiation in lands and shallow water as well as severe wave impact in coastal waters are considered to result in serious fragmentations andrady 2011 barnes et al 2009 horton et al 2017 except for abiotic factors animals such as geophagous soil fauna can contribute to the formation of secondary mps when grinding up the ingested mps rillig 2012 other secondary sources are produced from clothes washing horton et al 2017 tire abrasion road markings marine coatings etc an et al 2020 the fragmentation of large pieces of plastics releases toxic additives and significantly increases the abundance of plastics exposed to the aquatic environment meanwhile the larger surface area and decreased size are conductive to adsorption of microcontaminants heavy metals and will lead to a higher ingestion rate in biota which further enhances the potential hazards of mps auta et al 2017 2 2 types of mps and susceptibility to natural degradation according to the report from plasticseurope 2020 over 80 of the produced plastics in 2019 are pe pp pvc pet ps and polyurethane pu for the mps identified by the recent research nylon i e pa polyester pes and acrylic are very common in the environment sobhani et al 2020 sun et al 2019 other types of mps which are less or rarely reported due to their small quantity or identification limitations include polysulfone psu acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer abs polycarbonate pc biodegradable plastics such as polylactide acid pla and polyvinyl acetate pva andrady 2011 koelmans et al 2019 kutralam muniasamy et al 2020 lorenz et al 2019 mani et al 2019 mistri et al 2020 the amount of waste produced from different types are shown in fig 2 these plastics can be divided into two groups gewert et al 2015 plastics with c c bond pe pp ps pvc and acrylic are more susceptible to photo initiated degradation and plastics with heteroatoms in the main chain pa pes pet and pu have better thermal stability but are prone to hydrolytic cleavage of the e g amide bonds or ester bonds gewert et al 2015 2 2 1 plastics with c c main chain for plastics with c c bond only natural degradation involves of three processes initiation propagation and termination in the initiation stage uv light breaks up the c h bond and generates free radicals which subsequently react with oxygen and produce roo in the propagation stage leading to autoxidation and ultimately chain scission or crosslinking finally the chain reaction will be terminated when two radicals combine and form inert products the reduction of molecular weight during photooxidation increases the brittleness of plastics making them more vulnerable to fragmentation into mps 2 2 1 1 pe and pp pe and pp in the initiation stage are immune to photooxidation due to the lack of unsaturated chromophoric groups that absorb light but the external impurities or structural imperfections allow the initiation of natural photodegradation bond et al 2018 gewert et al 2015 compared with pe pp was reported to be less stable and experienced a higher degree of weathering in the marine environment as the tertiary carbons the c atoms bound to three other c atoms in pp are more susceptible to abiotic attack gewert et al 2015 zbyszewski and corcoran 2011 then peroxyl radicals and environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs are generated during photodegradation and further oxidise the polymer gewert et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 after the photo initiated oxidation thermo oxidation occurs with the presence of oxygen andrady 2011 however because of the absence of functional groups and the high molecular mass biodegradation is limited without photo initiation gewert et al 2015 thus photooxidation is critical for the formation of pe and pp derived mps in the environment 2 2 1 2 ps ps possesses a low persistence towards outdoor weathering gewert et al 2015 because the excitation energy from uv irradiation in the phenyl ring can transfer to the adjacent c h bond causing hydrogen cleavage and formation of polymer radicals yousif and haddad 2013 amongst thermoplastics ps is most persistent towards biodegradation gewert et al 2015 and uv irradiation is a significant drive for the formation of ps based mps 2 2 1 3 pvc pvc is the least stable to photodegradation due to its high sensitivity towards uv radiation gewert et al 2015 to be specific sunlight will cause dechlorination and produce hcl and c c which are low stable under photoirradiation and will break up the backbone into smaller fragments gewert et al 2015 nevertheless pvc is resistant to biodegradation due to the existence of halogens especially chlorine its dechlorination during photo degradation is conducive to biodegradation gewert et al 2015 2 2 2 plastics with heteroatoms in the main chain for plastics with heteroatoms in the main chain photodegradation biodegradation fungal bacterial and enzymes and hydrolysis can cause their deterioration in the marine environment gewert et al 2015 take pu as an example photodegradation can happen at the α methylene position while hydrolysis is effective not only to the ester bond but also to urea and urethane bonds with slower rates lamba et al 1997 szycher 1999 in biodegradation microbes will degrade urethane bonds and polyol polyester type or polyether type segments producing low molar mass molecules such as carboxylic acid alcohol carbamic acid amine and ultimately carbon dioxide magnin et al 2020 nakajima kambe et al 1999 similarly pa is very susceptible to photodegradation and can be easily weathered eroded and degraded tang et al 2020 thomas and hridayanathan 2006 pet as the main type of pes is prone to photooxidation and hydrolytic oxidation causing cleavage of the ester bond and formation of vinyl end groups and carboxylic acid gewert et al 2015 the reduction of molar mass linearly decreases the maximum stress at break up indicating the potential of fracturing pet into mps arhant et al 2019 however pet is highly insusceptible to biodegradation in the environment gewert et al 2015 due to its highly compact structure and less amorphous domains compared to the amorphous plastics taniguchi et al 2019 thus abiotic activities e g ultraviolet irradiation are desired for plastics before biodegradation when mps enter the aquatic environment their density is the primary factor affecting their distribution in the water body for example mps with a lower density than freshwater and seawater such as pe pp and expanded ps are prone to appear in surface water and shorelines but scarce in the deep sea and intermediate depths bond et al 2018 erni cassola et al 2019 in contrast for higher density mps such as pvc pet and pp a they tend to rest in sediments beaches subsurface waters and deep sea bond et al 2018 therefore different types of plastics will have different deterioration pathways under natural conditions and cause diverse ecological effects on aquatic and even soil sediment organisms machado et al 2019 machado et al 2018 however some investigations did not distinguish the types of plastics which will affect the data reliability and mislead future meta analysis thus the precise identification of the polymer types or acknowledging the difficulties in analysing similar polymers will provide guidance to trace mps sources and improve data reliability for future analysis 3 sampling extraction and quantification methods to analyse the population and distribution of mps in different environments several steps should be followed including sampling extraction purification and identification quantification the different approaches for each step have been reviewed and discussed in several articles elkhatib and oyanedel craver 2020 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 huang et al 2020 li et al 2018 möller et al 2020 nguyen et al 2019 prata et al 2019 these steps are vital for future research on in situ environmental mps remediation thus pros and cons of these techniques will be briefly introduced in this section in the aquatic environment there are three main sampling approaches including selective volume reduced and bulk sampling hidalgo ruz et al 2012 selective sampling in the field takes the direct extraction of items that are recognizable by naked eyes from the environment usually performed on the surface of sediments this method is simple but has a great risk of overlooking mps in some characteristic shapes hidalgo ruz et al 2012 volume reduce sampling only preserves the portion that is of interest using a neuston plankton net or manta net while bulk sampling takes the entire volume of the sample li et al 2018 in addition grab samplers composite samplers extraction pumps or neuston nets were used for wastewater sampling in wwtps elkhatib and oyanedel craver 2020 in order to separate mps from water samples filtration sieving and density separation are most frequently used in the stage of primary separation filtration sieving can isolate particles directly from the samples collected from different matrixes and efficiently remove particles larger than 5 mm dioses salinas et al 2020 huang et al 2020 density separation uses a solution with a specific density to enable high density particles to sink while low density particles to float saturated nacl 1 2 g ml is the most used solution other conventional solutions include na6 h2w12o6 1 4 g ml cacl2 1 3 g ml nai 1 8 g ml zncl2 1 6 1 7 g ml nabr 1 55 g ml and znbr2 1 7 g ml li et al 2018 möller et al 2020 prata et al 2019 generally speaking the higher density solution can achieve a higher recovery rate with low errors then filtration sieving with different mesh sizes can be used again to separate the particles other separation methods of electrostatic separation oil extraction froth flotation magnetic extraction vertical density gradient separation pressurized fluid extraction elutriation centrifugation and staining have been discussed in several reviews elkhatib and oyanedel craver 2020 li et al 2018 möller et al 2020 for extracting mps from other organic matters different digestion approaches have been explored including acidic alkaline digestion h2o2 fenton s reagent and enzymatic digestion acidic alkaline digestion has been adopted to separate mps from biological tissues but some plastics can be degraded or damaged by the acid or alkaline treatment möller et al 2020 h2o2 is the most popular oxidising agent to digest organic compounds however treatment with high concentration h2o2 at high temperature usually 60 c will result in the decolouration and size reduction of some plastics such as pa pp and pc möller et al 2020 fenton reagent h2o2 fe2 was explored for removing the organics without affecting mps hurley et al 2018 enzymatic digestion such as amylase chitinase cellulose lipase and proteinase is less hazardous and is friendly to mps but the efficiency varies depending on the types of organic matters li et al 2018 möller et al 2020 thus sequential combination of enzymatic digestion and other extraction approaches such as h2o2 and fenton reagent is proposed to be able to enhance the purification möller et al 2020 for the identification and quantification of mps visual inspection microscopy vibrational spectroscopy and mass spectrometry are the widely used techniques among them visual inspection under a light microscope is the simplest way to discern the shape size and colour of mps but this approach is prone to bias and cannot obtain the compositional information elkhatib and oyanedel craver 2020 vibrational spectroscopy including fourier transform infrared ftir and raman spectroscopy can directly signal and reveal the chemical compositions ftir is a fast and reliable technique for hydrocarbon analysis but it cannot detect samples smaller than 20 μm li et al 2018 in this regard raman technique is more favourable in mps research as its detection limit can be as low as 1 μm a recent study developed surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers with an exceptional klarite substrate which even detected mp sizes down to 36 nm xu et al 2020 nonetheless raman spectroscopy is a relatively expensive and time consuming technique li et al 2018 mass spectrometry methods such as pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms are suitable to qualify and quantify mps under specific configurations the py gc ms technique has demonstrated good performances in mps characterisation and mass quantification but the upper size and amount limits of the sample are 1 5 mm fries et al 2013 and 0 5 mg dümichen et al 2017 respectively which hinder it from the application in complex samples similar to py gc ms thermal desorption coupled with gc ms tds gc ms and thermal depolymerisation liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms were also reported for the same purpose and the techniques have different advantages and limitations huang et al 2020 except for the methods discussed above other techniques for mps qualification and quantification have been reviewed by möller et al 2020 such as liquid chromatography and thermogravimetric analysis tga coupled with differential scanning calorimetry dsc or mass spectrometry ms 4 remediation and transformation strategies except precautious methods such as reducing plastic production and usage advanced remediation technologies have been explored to degrade or remove the existing mps from water though plastics degradation has been studied for decades incumbent strategies that focus on mps are still limited and mainly fall in 5 categories microbial degradation aops techniques thermal treatment wastewater treatment plant and other physical approaches such as adsorption and filtration the brief degradation pathways of biodegradation aops and thermal treatment are depicted in fig 3 amongst these approaches microbial degradation has the longest history in mps abatement with the merit of low energy input aops and thermal treatment can attain a faster decomposition rate and demonstrate the potential to leverage the carbon and hydrogen elements in mps to produce fuels in this section representative studies from different categories will be showcased and suggestions for future research will be provided accordingly 4 1 microbial degradation biodegradation compared to other abiotic purification methods biodegradation has the advantages of environmental friendliness low cost and low energy input as well as optimised carbon footprint microorganisms can utilise plastics as the carbon and nitrogen sources to survive and proliferate montazer et al 2020 taniguchi et al 2019 zheng et al 2005 microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi are evidenced to be capable of degrading specific polymers though they are not specifically designed to degrade mps in most cases such a function holds a grand promise for the applications in mps control and purification 4 1 1 bacteria bacteria that can colonise or degrade marine plastics have been comprehensively reviewed by roager and sonnenschein 2019 it was found that kocuria palustris m16 and rhodococcus sp 36 from actinobacteria class and various bacillus strains were capable of degrading mps however the degradation rates were mostly very slow with 1 10 weight loss in the timeframe between 30 days and one year roager and sonnenschein 2019 one exception was ideonella sakaiensis 201 f6 which was extracted from a microbial consortium by yoshida et al 2016 and could almost completely degrade pet after six weeks at 30 c such a process is achieved via secreting petase and incorporating enzymatically released compounds terephthalic acid tps and mono 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalic acid mhet for the cell growth recently tournier et al 2020 improved the performances of pet hydrolase and leaf branch compost cutinase lcc fig 4 a b the system achieved at least 90 of pet depolymerisation into monomers over 10 h fig 4 c which outperformed all the existing pet hydrolases including i sakaiensis 201 f6 and the related improved variants what is more the depolymerised monomers can be subsequently recycled to produce pet that exhibited the same properties as the petrochemical pet herein closing the loop of the circular economy tournier et al 2020 also the high degradation rate can be contributed to the low crystallinity of pet yang et al 2016 and the high chain mobility marten et al 2005 in addition to single bacterium microbial consortium was investigated in plastic degradation acclimatisation and bioaugmentation on indigenous microbial consortia isolated from the environment have been proved to be capable strategies in plastic removal roager and sonnenschein 2019 breakthroughs have been achieved in pet degradation which is more susceptible to biodegradation however practical solutions to degrade non hydrolysable plastics such as pe and pp are urgent as they are more pervasive in different environments and are resistant to biodegradation krueger et al 2015 effective microbiological solutions to varying types of plastics including pe pp pvc ps pur and nylon were discussed and summarised jacquin et al 2019 krueger et al 2015 pathak and navneet 2017 fig 5 a meanwhile reviews that exclusively discussed pe montazer et al 2020 restrepo flórez et al 2014 and pet taniguchi et al 2019 degradation are also available microbial degradation of plastic debris in different scenarios including cold marine habitats urbanek et al 2018 soil helmberger et al 2020 and marine environment kumar et al 2020b oberbeckmann and labrenz 2020 and corresponding environmental influences have been overviewed which will not be detailed here 4 1 2 fungi apart from bacteria fungi are also capable of utilising mps as sole carbon and energy sources through releasing enzymes fungi are capable of biodegrading petroleum based plastics and the corresponding degradation pathways are shown in fig 5 b sanchez 2020 it was found that fungi are effective to various plastic substrates including ldpe hdpe pp pvc pet pa polyester polyurethane ppu and polystyrene sulfonate the degradation ability of fungi can be attributed to the combination of intracellular process which is for detoxification fungal adaptation and extracellular enzymatic process such a process will release hydrolases for mps degradation sanchez 2020 in order to improve biodegradation activities sanchez 2020 also proposed several strategies including adding pro oxidants species reducing biocides and antioxidant stabilizers during the plastics production compared with bacteria fungi were reported to have a better performance towards pe degradation muhonja et al 2018 the ability to synthesise hydrophobin to attach hyphae to hydrophobic substrates make them appropriate candidates for polymer deterioration fungi also have the advantage of great adaptability to various environments as they have been discovered in multiple terrestrial and marine environments even under extreme conditions such as deep sea and anoxic habitats raghukumar 2017 however enzymes that would participate in mps degradation were only investigated in limited studies sanchez 2020 therefore more studies should consider performing the experiments in the ocean especially below the sea surface where more fungi are present amaral zettler et al 2020 although weight loss measurement has been extensively used to evaluate the biodegradability for both bacteria and fungi detecting co2 evolution is more appropriate according to astm standards american society for testing and materials astm 2012 astm 2017 however co2 may originate from the micropollutants drafted on plastics or can be consumed via photosynthetic communities thus combining co2 evaluation with tracing approaches such as isotope labelling to ascertain the extent of assimilation is adopted to solve the issue amaral zettler et al 2020 until now for plastics containing hydrolysable bonds like esters or amides only pet was efficiently depolymerised by enzymes while the efficient depolymerisation of pa and pu has yet been reported wei et al 2020a on the other hand research on biodegradation towards polyolefin chains is limited due to the lack of functional groups and high molecular weight so beforehand abiotic treatment is pivotal to polyolefin gewert et al 2015 besides other characteristics of hydrophobicity and cross linked chemical structure impede their biodegradation horton et al 2017 natural microbes are unlikely to degrade mps but can interact with mps to form microbial communities called plastisphere deep sea microbes may be valuable sources for potential enzymes but the access to deep sea poses a challenge for biochemists wei et al 2020a thus aops systems such as photocatalysis or h2o2 pms pds activation can be applied as abiotic treatments considering that the produced ros can introduce oxygen containing functional groups decrease molecular weight and reduce hydrophobicity of plastics 4 2 advanced oxidation processes aops 4 2 1 photodegradation photocatalytic degradation photocatalytic degradation is a branch of aops which has been proved to be an energy efficient technique to degrade mps in the aqueous environment when semiconductor photocatalysts are exposed to an appropriate light source holes h and excited electrons e will be generated these holes can combine with h2o or oh to produce ros such as oh and o2 which will attack mps and cause polymeric chain rupture branching crosslinking and even mineralisation into co2 and h2o advances in photodegradation of mps are showcased as follows in addition composite films of larger plastics and photocatalysts are also discussed considering that it may be useful information for improving mps targeted photooxidation before discussing photocatalytic processes it is vital to understand the photolysis in the natural environment photo initiated degradation happens to the c c backbone of plastics which can be concluded in three steps initiation propagation and termination the detailed pathways have been illustrated in a literature gewert et al 2015 during the processes radicals will be formed on the backbone to produce peroxyl radicals which play critical roles in natural photo degradation gewert et al 2015 in addition chemical chain scission addition reaction with o2 h2o and formation of epfrs happen to mps after 15 days of photoirradiation zhu et al 2019 epfrs subsequently result in ros e g oh which will in turn attack the mps and further rupture the chain causing molecular weight reduction and ultimately generating various small molecular products zhu et al 2019 the generation of epfrs is mainly determined by the chemical structures of mps for example ps and phenolformaldehyde resin pf with ample benzene rings are more likely to form epfrs under light irradiation whereas aliphatic polymers such as pvc and pe are photo inert nevertheless as an emerging research topic the role of epfrs needs to be investigated to reveal their effects on plastic degradation and animal health wang et al 2020 4 2 1 1 solid phase photocatalytic degradation a large quantities of waste plastic are exposed to sunlight in the open air which will undergo solid phase photocatalytic degradation the research on plastic photodegradation in the solid state can be traced back to 1970s allen and mckellar 1975 until now the most used strategy is suspending photocatalysts usually 10 wt in plastic stock solution to form composite films for photodegradation tests fig 6 a the universal approach to evaluate the degradation efficiency is to measure the weight loss of the composites because it can reflect the mineralisation efficiency of transforming the plastic carbons to co2 therefore the plastic composites are promising substitutes that are susceptible to photodegradation generally the degradation of plastics matrix starts from the interface between the polymer and catalysts by oh produced from photocatalysis this process makes the surrounding plastics degrade and form cavities around the catalyst particles or aggregates then the oxidation process spatially extends into the polymer matrix through ros diffusion subsequently generating carbon centred radicals and causing carbon chain cleavage with oxygen insertion in the course of photocatalysis intermediates containing carbonyl and carboxyl groups will then be produced and eventually photo oxidised to small molecule volatile organics co2 and h2o liu et al 2011 zhao et al 2007 via gas chromatography identification these volatile organic compounds can be ethene ethane butane acetaldehyde formaldehyde and ethanol when ps is used as the plastic substrate shang et al 2003b however volatile organic compounds are scarcely detected in other plastic matrixes the experimental conditions and degradation performances of different photocatalytic systems are listed in table 2 tio2 is the most frequently used photocatalyst for plastic degradation due to its high photoactivity low cost and nontoxicity on this basis various strategies as listed in fig 6 b have been applied to improve the photocatalytic performances for instance because the photocatalytic reaction occurs mostly at the interface of polymer and the catalyst other components such as tio2 p25 particles ohtani et al 1989 ohtani et al 1992 nanotubes ali et al 2016 and nanoparticles nps thomas and sandhyarani 2013 have been added into composites to increase specific surface area and intensify the photocatalytic performances however embedding photocatalysts in polymer films suffer from severe recombination of charge carriers due to the lack of excitation traps inside the composites to this end dye sensitisation can extend the visible absorption of tio2 and facilitate the separation of photoinduced excitations which can be applied to improve photodegradation efficiency shang et al 2003a zhao et al 2008 similarly composite photocatalysts such as polypyrrole tio2 li et al 2010 were designed to enhance the photo response on the other hand unmodified tio2 nps tend to agglomerate in the polymer matrix which will cause a negative impact on the degradation efficiency because of the rapid plastic whitening and decreased interface areas between plastics and catalysts liang et al 2013 the whitening phenomenon shortens the depth of light penetration and deteriorates photocatalysis therefore grafting nano tio2 that can disperse well in the low polarity solvent is another valid approach to further improve the photodegradation zan et al 2006b during the photocatalytic process tio2 reacts with h2o in the air to form oh to initiate plastic degradation and the absence of h2o in polymer matrix will significantly suppress the degradation therefore the addition of hydrophilic materials such as polyethylene oxide peo miyazaki and nakatani 2009 and polyacrylamide pam liang et al 2013 will adsorb the moisture and further improve the oxidation efficiency for peo it can be oxidised by tio2 to form acids and aldehydes which will facilitate the decomposition of hydroperoxide and then plastic degradation miyazaki and nakatani 2009 during plastics manufacture diverse additives such as plasticisers stabilisers and phenolic antioxidants will be added for some specific purposes however these compounds may consume oh radicals to suppress the photocatalytic degradation horikoshi et al 1998 a potential method to solve this problem is to find chemicals that not only can substitute these additives but also can be grafted on photocatalysts to enhance the decomposition performances for example hyperbranched poly ε caprolactone is a substitution for pvc plasticiser which can increase the flexibility and help disperse tio2 nps in the pvc matrix kim et al 2006 except for the strategies discussed above changing the operational parameters also affects the plastic deformation efficiency usually increasing the weight percentage of photocatalysts in the composites ali et al 2016 chakrabarti et al 2008 zan et al 2006a using high energy light sources ali et al 2016 zhao et al 2007 and oxygen rich environment zan et al 2006a zan et al 2006b will facilitate the degradation processes however the excessive loading of additive like carbon nanotubes cnts will attenuate the performance as a consequence of the light absorbing scattering properties of cnts lankone et al 2017 other photocatalysts were also developed to decompose plastics table 1 palladium nps can absorb visible light because of the localized surface plasmon resonance effect and are used to form nanocomposite film with ldpe olajire and mohammed 2019 in addition due to the higher quantum efficiency and catalytic activity of zno compared to tio2 a novel composite of zno and pvc was synthesised for polymer degradation chakrabarti et al 2008 despite the wide band gap of biocl nanodisk it is an ideal candidate owing to its good optical electrical and mechanical properties and has been used as a photocatalyst for ps degradation sarwan et al 2020 also goethite α feooh liu et al 2009 liu et al 2010 cryptomelane type manganese oxide oms 2 liu et al 2011 and cnts lankone et al 2017 have been applied as optional materials for pe degradation apart from preparing composite films spreading aqueous dispersion of photocatalysts on plastics can directly drive the degradation under real sunlight though it is less reported table 1 zro2 demonstrates a higher photocatalytic activity than tio2 due to its mesoporous structure greater redox ability and higher capability for stabilising oxygen vacancies bandara et al 2017 intriguingly a recent study reported that spreading 400 nm ps sphere solution on tio2 catalyst films achieved an excellent mineralisation 98 4 after 36 h this photodegradation was initiated by holes and ros such as oh and o2 produced from the tio2 photocatalyst nabi et al 2020 in addition polymer photocatalyst composites were also applied in the degradation of organic pollutants frazão et al 2019 utami et al 2019 yu et al 2007 and microorganism disinfection kiatkittipong et al 2020 in the aqueous environment the systems leverage the advantages of composites such as a low catalyst dosage and great reusability during long term operations highlighting the versatility of polymer photocatalyst composites however there are some limitations of this composite design for mps remediation although the polymer matrixes are stable the presence of photocatalysts in the polymer will accelerate collapse of the plastic framework the process will cause the release of the photocatalysts from the composites and pose potential risks to the environment on the other hand considering that the existed mps permeate every sector of the environment the solid phase degradation is not suitable to relieve the present environmental pressure however it provides a promising strategy for recycling the collected mps and slow down the future growth of mps via replacing conventional plastics with the photoactive composites but it only limits to low density polymers because dense mps tend to sink to the bottom of the water body where sun light cannot reach so far mps degradation in an aqueous environment is still limited it was found that pvc in tio2 aqueous dispersion is much less susceptible than under dry conditions horikoshi et al 1998 thus it calls for more efforts to optimise and enhance the performances of polymer catalyst composites for mps removal in the aqueous phase 4 2 1 2 aqueous photocatalysis photodegradation of plastics in the aqueous environment has been extensively studied hidaka et al 1996 tio2 and zno were firstly utilised as photocatalysts to degrade pvc and polyvinylidene chloride copolymer 95 pvc 5 pvlc hidaka et al 1996 zno exhibited a higher initial rate of dechlorination than tio2 but levelled off to a plateau shortly interestingly the addition of oxidising agents k2s2o8 or h2o2 promoted the dechlorination efficiency of tio2 but inhibited zno based dechlorination due to the severe catalyst dissolution during the photooxidation then in order to increase the surface to volume ratio zno nanorods were developed to degrade ldpe film residues and it reached 30 increase in the carbonyl index of ldpe after 175 h of oxidation under irradiation tofa et al 2019a to further improve the photodegradation performances pt nps were dispersed on zno nanorods zno pt to reduce recombination of electron hole pairs and enhance visible light absorption tofa et al 2019b after the photocatalytic process carbonyl hydroperoxide peroxides and unsaturated groups appeared on ldpe wrinkles cracks and cavities were also observed on the ldpe surface due to the formation of oxygenated groups and volatile organic compounds despite of the decades of exploration using photocatalysts to decompose polymer in the aqueous environment the degradation of mps is rarely investigated in water solution table 2 ariza tarazona et al 2019 firstly used protein based porous n tio2 as a photocatalyst to degrade hdpe mps extracted from facial scrub in both solid phase and aqueous environment hdpe mps were successfully degraded to a certain extent under both conditions while the degradation rate 6 4 was much faster in the aqueous medium than that in the solid state 1 85 the dehydration of the solid sample is the main reason for the lower efficiency because hydroxyl radicals are generated by water and the moisture is the driving force of plastic degradation thus humidity is essential for photocatalytic degradation of plastics however the degradation rate of photocatalysis is still not satisfactory ariza tarazona et al 2020 further synthesised c n co doped tio2 to study the impacts of operating variables for process optimisation compared with the reaction under high temperatures and at high ph plastic degradation was faster at ph 3 and 0 c this is because the fragmentation preferred to happen at 0 c which increased the surface to volume ratio and a higher concentration of h promoted plastic degradation and photocatalyst deagglomeration under this condition the weight loss of mps reached 71 77 1 88 after 50 h of irradiation unlike other strategies mps after photocatalysis presented a smooth surface with cracks and cavities the surface roughness reduced because the degradation primarily occurred at the surface of mps exposed to radical attack though the above photocatalysis can degrade mps to a certain degree the corresponding c revolution is less investigated the carbon elements in mps are presumed to ultimately evolve into co2 releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere thus it is desirable to develop a technology to transform the elements in plastics into valuable products to optimise the global carbon footprint and plastic recycling photoreforming pr is a low energy input and straightforward method which can transform an organic substrate into value added fuels using sustainable sunlight as the driving force under ambient temperature and pressure during the photoreforming process the target substrate will serve as an electron donor which will be oxidised and decomposed by the oxidative holes of the excited photocatalyst to produce other organic molecules the photogenerated electrons will be transferred from the photocatalyst to a cocatalyst and reduce water protons to h2 as shown in fig 7 kawai and sakata 1981 uekert et al 2019 a desirable photocatalyst is expected to possess a valance band higher enough to oxidise water or organic compounds as well as a conduction band suitable for h2 production kawai and sakata 1981 in this process oh plays an auxiliary role while the direct hole oxidation of the organic substrate by the photocatalyst is the primary process in pr uekert et al 2019 the first study on plastics photoreforming can be traced to 1981 when kawai and sakata 1981 used pt deposited tio2 tio2 pt to convert pe and pvc after 10 h of pr process 93 and 45 μmol h2 were obtained using pe and pvc as the corresponding substrates in 5 m naoh solution table 2 displays the studies of plastic debris or mps reforming in the aqueous environment and the unit is unified to μmolh2 gsub 1 for better comparison with other photocatalysts due to the use of an expensive pt cocatalyst and the dependence on uv irradiation high performance cds cdox quantum dots qds fig 7 a c uekert et al 2018 and nontoxic carbon nitride nickel phosphide cnx ni2p fig 7 d f uekert et al 2019 were synthesised to degrade mps cds cdox qds showed a higher activity than tio2 pt and cnx ni2p table 2 since cd is highly toxic the environmental friendly cnx ni2p was used to reform mps to a clean fuel h2 after 50 h of pr treatment cnx ni2p yielded 82 5 7 3 and 178 12 μmolh2 gsub 1 from pet and pla respectively amongst the diverse polymer substrates including pe pet pla pp ps pur and polystyrene block polybutadiene rubber pet pla and pur were discovered to generate the highest amounts of h2 this is ascribed to the presence of ester groups on the three plastics because they can be hydrolysed by koh into alcohols and acids which are favourable sacrificial agents to generate hydrogen an alkaline environment will increase h2 yield in the pr process by multiple folds as the solution ph increases a higher h2 generation rate will be achieved there are several possible reasons for the positive effects of mps pre treatment in alkaline solutions first the formation of ros i e oh will be easier via direct oxidation of oh kawai and sakata 1981 second a high concentration of oh can initiate the breakdown of the carbon chain and release monomers such as ethylene glycol terephthalate and lactate which are more favourable for photoreforming uekert et al 2019 especially to esters containing plastics such as pet and pla uekert et al 2019 uekert et al 2018 in addition if the undissolved polymer is removed after the pre treatment more photons can reach the quantum dot photocatalysts to improve efficiency uekert et al 2018 however considering the h2 conversions defined as the moles of detected h2 divided by the theoretical h2 yield the pr efficiency is still low less than 40 compared with direct gasification of plastics to h2 65 95 to enhance the applicability efficacy conversion rate and selectivity of the pr catalysts should be further improved uekert et al 2019 the carbon elements in mps can be transformed to c2 fuels by photocatalysis under simulated natural conditions jiao et al 2020 synthesised nb2o5 atomic layers which attained 100 photodegradation of pe pp and pvc in 40 60 and 90 h respectively fig 8 a b additionally the generated co2 was in situ reduced to ch3cooh this process can be separated into 2 steps in fig 8 c d 1 c c bond cleavage process plastics were oxidised and mineralised into co2 by o2 and ros oh generated from the valence band of nb2o5 2 c c coupling process the generated co2 was catalytically reduced by the photoinduced electrons from the conduction band of nb2o5 into ch3cooh via the coupling of cooh intermediates meanwhile the other half reaction was water oxidation into o2 by the holes furthermore plastics from disposable food containers single use bags and food wrap films can be also photoconverted to ch3cooh however it was pointed out that the yield of c2 fuels was relatively low less than 1 5 mg gcat after 30 h so two component photocatalysts are recommended to respectively optimise the c c bond cleavage and coupling processes jiao et al 2020 solid based photocatalyst polymer composites are capable of degrading plastics with light only but it usually cost several hundred hours to achieve satisfying results also it cannot deal with the mps in the aqueous environment dispersing photocatalysts in water environment can remove mps in places of oceans and freshwaters but the oxidation products are mainly co2 and h2o which cannot be directly reused as fuels and may worse the greenhouse effect thus photoreforming was proposed to convert mps into valuable products in recent outcomes the carbon in mps was successfully converted to c2 fuels and the monomers from hydrolysis can act as a sacrificial agent to produce h2 fuel however a novel system that can simultaneously convert carbon and hydrogen into valuable fuels is not existed thus future research on photocatalysis should pay more attention on mps conversion and fuels regeneration 4 2 2 fenton fenton like systems fenton fenton like processes using peroxides e g h2o2 pms or pds demonstrate extraordinary capacities to decompose persistent organic pollutants in aqueous environments particularly fenton systems have been used to recover specific polymers from wastes wang and wang 2017 wang et al 2017 in recent years aops technologies have been applied in mps remediation table 2 thanks to the high redox potentials of the produced hydroxyl radicals oh e 0 2 7 v vs normal hydrogen electrode nhe and sulphate radicals so4 e 0 3 1 v vs nhe liu et al 2019b investigated the accelerated ageing behaviours of ps and hdpe mps induced by fenton and heat activated pds treatments mps were exposed to fenton treatment fe2 h2o2 and heat activated k2s2o8 pds at 70 c and the size distributions of the pristine and treated mps were analysed by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and displayed in fig 9 before the aops treatment the dominant size range of ps and pe was between 40 50 μm after 30 days of pds treatments almost all the mps were smaller than 30 μm and 80 1 and 97 4 were 20 μm for ps and pe respectively the phenomenon of the fenton systems was similar but mps presented less fragmentation compared with pe though ps showed less size reduction after 30 day oxidation the required initial induction time for oxidation is shorter the different responses to oxidation was due to their distinct molecular structures and tensile strengths the changes of the plastic moieties in the oxidative systems were similar to those experienced in simulated natural processes indicating that aops treatment would help understand the mps weathering behaviours in addition the increased alteration degree will enhance the adsorption capacities of mps toward ciprofloxacin due to reduced size and raised o c ratio indicating that aops are capable of degrading mps but it may increase the toxicity of mps due to the increased adsorption capacities liu et al 2019b however such a low temperature aops treatment typically requires long time to cause the decay of mps in this regard increasing the reaction temperature and using a catalyst will remarkably boost the generation of ros and oxidation kinetics of mps to enhance the performances of aops systems kang et al 2019 synthesised a magnetic spring like carbon nanotube with embedded manganese nps mn ncnt fig 10 a b the carbon composites were used as novel catalysts to drive pms activation for the degradation of cosmetic mps obtained from facial cleansers the catalytic aops system was coupled with hydrothermal hydrolysis to intensify the mps decomposition under optimal conditions the mps removal efficiency reached 54 in weight loss after 8 hour treatment at 160 c fig 10 c in this system the hydrothermal condition plays a critical role in this system because it not only provides simultaneous high pressure and physical tearing to polyethylene chains to decrease the crystal degree but also intensify both catalytic and heat based pms activations to further improve the degradation efficiency the structural integrity and chemical stability are pivotal for catalyst design in hydrothermal aops systems because the high temperature and oxidative environment will cause severe metal leaching of conventional metal based catalysts as the degradation proceeded noticeable cracks appeared on the mps surface then mps was fused and re fabricated into films and eventually numerous pores appeared on the surface fig 11 a d the polymer was sheared into shorter carbon chains which were attacked by ros and then further broken into smaller molecules after the aops treatment the peaks of c o c o and o h groups were remarkably intensified in the ftir spectra of the treated samples revealing the surface oxidation process fig 11 e f in the meantime organics including alkanes alkenes alcohols aldehydes ketones lactones mono dicarboxylic acids ketoacids and esters were detected in the filtrate by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms table 3 the first increased and then declined contents of total organic carbon during the oxidation suggest that organic intermediates are produced and then partially mineralised to co2 and inorganic salts the intermediates from mps degradation have been proved to be environmentally benign and can be leveraged as carbon sources for the growth of green algae chlorella vulgaris therefore the outcomes demonstrate that the mn ncnt pms system can effectively degrade mps into nontoxic intermediates which can be further utilised by microorganism to achieve a sustainable carbon cycle and reduce the greenhouse gases emissions during mps remediation miao et al 2020 developed an electro fenton like system using tio2 graphite tio2 c as an effective cathode for pvc oxidation the dechlorination efficiency and weight loss were used to evaluate the performances of the system under optical conditions 75 of dechlorination efficiency and 56 of weight loss were achieved after 6 h of electrolysis at 100 c at 0 7 v vs ag agcl fig 12 during the treatment high temperature firstly decreased the flexural and tensile modulus and the mechanical strength of mps which rendered the subsequent attack by oh and carbon chain rupture to further expose the chloride then the dichlorination reaction occurred due to the applied cathodic potential during this process hydroxyl radicals have two functions 1 causing oxidation of organics to have oxygen groups such as o h and c o on mps 2 shedding organic intermediates from mps into solution the exfoliated hydrocarbon species were vulnerable and would be further oxidised by oh after the reaction depressions and large holes appeared and the smooth surface of pvc was destroyed entirely exposing internal pvc mps by combining the characterisations of ftir uv vis spectra and xps oxygen groups o h cooh and c c were found to form after the treatment while the amount of c h and c cl declined as the oxidation proceeded these changes in the surface structure indicate that the oxidation and dechlorination occurred simultaneously on pvc based mps which was ascribed to the backbone rupture by oh attack the backbone breakage was also evidenced by the molecular weight reduction from 46 260 to 28 470 after the electro fenton like oxidation some organics with up to 10 short chain such as alcohols alkenes monocarboxylic acids dicarboxylic acids and esters were detected formic acid acetic acid propionic acid and oxalic acid were the major carboxylic acids and oxalic acid was the most accumulative product the intermediates generated in the hydroxyl radical or sulphate radical based aops systems are listed in table 3 as the molecular mass decreased the carbon chains became shorter and oxygen content accordingly increased it is necessary to note that not all of these compounds were generated by oxidation compounds with conjugated benzene ring structures including bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate benzyl butyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate are the plasticisers used in plastics production which will be released during the oxidation and may cause harm to biota the incorrect classification of these compounds in intermediates will cause misunderstanding of degradation pathways nonetheless the existing aops techniques are efficient for mps degradation some drawbacks need to be pointed out and tackled in the future for hydrothermal coupled aops systems high temperature plays a critical role in changing the physical properties of mps to a more vulnerable state and simultaneously enhancing the generation of ros via thermal activation and boosted kinetics in heterogeneous catalysis however considering its feasibility in water treatment and the cost reducing the effective reaction temperature should be one of the main objectives in future aops research when assessing the efficiency of mps degradation several measurements could be used including mass loss co2 detection carbonyl index ci and dechlorination efficiency mass loss is the most frequently used method in the evaluation of degradation efficiency for various kinds of mps which provides intuitive results for the comparisons of different plastic materials and catalytic systems however the weight loss cannot accurately reflect the evolution of chemistry structure of mps and mineralisation rate of the intermediates also this method is not appropriate to evaluate mps biodegradation according to astm standards astm 2012 astm 2017 instead co2 evolution rate can be applied to assess biodegradation for abiotic degradation co2 evolution can reflect the mineralisation rate but the method has the limitation in assessing the deterioration of mps crystal structure and surface chemistry ci index is a handy indicator to evaluate pe degradation if the degradation is in its early steps formation of hydroxides or the degradation leads to complete mineralisation producing h2o and co2 then it does not take into account ariza tarazona et al 2020 in terms of measuring the dechlorination efficiency it is an efficient and fast method to assess the degradation degree but this method is only limited to cl containing plastics the results are typically one sided and cannot illustrate if c c bonds are ruptured and oxidised therefore it is necessary to combine different approaches to comprehensively evaluate the performances in mps degradation for future aops studies 4 3 thermal treatment in the past thermal treatment has been used to upgrade general wastes because the approach can preserve landfill space as well as relieve sanitary problems due to waste putrescence lombardi et al 2015 nowadays an additional merit of thermal treatment is energy recovery lombardi et al 2015 in this regard plastics due to its high calorific value and enormous production is a promising source of high density carbon and hydrogen elements for fuel production current techniques of converting plastics into fuels include pyrolysis gasification cracking in refinery units liquefaction and integrated methods e g pyrolysis and reforming fig 13 a which have been discussed in several reviews lopez et al 2018 lopez et al 2017 nanda and berruti 2021 panda et al 2010 wong et al 2015 in addition it has been reported that the carbons in plastic wastes can be reformed to valued added nanomaterials e g carbon nanotubes which are of extraordinary physical and chemical properties and can fulfil different applications bazargan and mckay 2012 in recent years thermal treatments have been applied for mps conversion tavares et al 2018 applied co gasification of pet based mps and biomass in a temperature range of 400 1200 c under different gasification agents air o2 and steam it was discovered that a composition of 90 pet 10 biomass is favourable to obtain higher hydrogen yields 63 66 in h2 molar fraction contents while the combination of 50 pet 50 biomass achieves a high lower heating value lhv of 9 2 mj nm3 thus for different syngas utilisation the compositions and ratios of the feedstocks as well as experimental conditions should be optimised except for co gasification thermal pyrolysis was also applied to transform mps into small molecule and value added products in order to explore the impact of pressure on fuel quality high pressure ldpe pyrolysis was conducted to investigate the influence of pressure on product distribution and the transformation mechanisms cheng et al 2020 high pressure conditions make the compositions of the liquid products closer to fuels e g gasoline with aromatics and isoparaffins also the products contain more cycloalkanes and fewer olefins recently jie et al 2020 devised a one step process to reduce the energy input to decompose polymers and enhance h2 yield using a microwave initiated solid solid catalytic reaction in this system mps were mixed with fealox as the catalyst and microwave susceptor and then the mixture was simply subjected to microwave treatment after a few minutes of treatment a high h2 yield was achieved at 55 6 mmol g 1 plastic and over 97 of the theoretical mass of h2 was obtained from the deconstructed plastic fig 14 b d in the meantime carbon yields of hdpe pp and ps attained around 70 60 and 80 wt in the catalytic system respectively the carbon products were primarily multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnts fig 14 d e during the microwave reactions because plastics are transparent to microwave heat was selectively generated on the catalyst and subsequently transferred to the plastics which facilitated mass transfer between the catalyst and plastic and then desorption of neutral hydrogen such a system is not similar to a conventional heating process which has a lower h2 yield and limited mass transfer rate of molecular desorption fig 14 c the transparency of plastics for microwave penetration also reduces side reactions of plastic self decomposition promoting the full decomposition to h2 in terms of carbon it was proposed that carbon species diffused to and reacted with the surface of fealox to form fe3c which then served as the catalyst to drive bottom up production of mwcnts jie et al 2020 the investigations as mentioned above mainly focused on the solid state deconstruction of mps and recent studies also investigated the direct decomposition of mps in the aquatic environment hydrothermal carbonization htc was firstly used to treat mps in seawater environment at 200 300 c for 3 h as temperature raised the produced hydrochar contained lower contents of inorganic anions and a higher net calorific value ncv iñiguez et al 2019 instead of decomposing mps this technique is to generate value added hydrochar that can be used as a future fuel subsequently different types of mps were used as the feedstock to proceed gasification in seawater at 500 800 c it was discovered that raising the reaction temperature prolonging the gasification time reducing the loading of mps feedstock as well as the presence of alkali metal salts promoted the treatment efficiency for all the plastics with optimised conditions the plastic carbon conversion efficiency reached 97 0 59 1 98 and 79 86 wt for abs bai et al 2019 pc bai et al 2020a pet bai et al 2020b and pp bai et al 2020c respectively though the compounds of gas and liquid products are similar among these plastics the distribution can be very different as displayed in fig 14 pp had a lower carbon conversion rate and the produced gases were mostly composed of h2 and ch4 in contrast gaseous products from other plastics contained a considerable amount of co2 the behaviour of liquid intermediates can be different for example polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs produced from pp gasification are prone to poly condensed to char instead of being further gasified into gaseous products bai et al 2020c so far thermal based treatment of mps and upgrade are still in infancy one of the main issues lies in the quality of the derived fuels which are also influenced by the selection of a proper catalyst in addition to the mps compositions and operational conditions additionally a desirable product yield was achieved in the lab scale converting mps into fuels and functional carbons in a large scale is still challenging for industrial applications another issue is that the impacts of co existing impurities and complex plastics are still unclear and need to be further investigated for solid state reactions the newly developed microwave process demonstrates its advantages in selective h2 production and mwcnts formation with high efficiency and c h utilisation while the catalyst plastic ratio is relatively high and should be optimised for upscale implementation in the future in the aquatic remediation of mps increasing the selectivity of fuel products and lowering reaction temperature will be the primary goals in future research 4 4 mps removal in waste water treatment plants wwtps wwtps were not initially and explicitly designed for mps removal but every treatment stage in wwtps can remove a certain amount of mps sun et al 2019 recently summarised the mps removal ratios in wwtps from different countries and provided estimated removal efficiency of each treatment stage fig 15 the whole wwtps processes are divided into three phases as preliminary primary secondary and tertiary treatments in preliminary and primary treatments 35 59 and 50 98 of mps are removed respectively during the processes air flotation impels contaminants especially low density mps to float on the surface to facilitate mechanical skimming subsequent sedimentation process helps trap high density mps in solid flocs during grit removal and sedimentation for further sludge treatment ngo et al 2019 this process is significantly influenced by the density lower density mps e g pa pp and pe prefer to float while high density mps e g pet and pes are more likely to appear in the sediment ngo et al 2019 the secondary stage is capable of further removing mps by 0 2 14 via biological treatment and clarification the sludge flocs and bacterial extracellular polymers facilitatethe accumulation and sinking of mps in the clarification tank during which larger mps will be removed sun et al 2019 subsequently tertiary treatment further reduces the existence of mps to 0 2 2 by various techniques talvitie et al 2017 compared the performances of a variety of tertiary treatment processes including rapid sand filter dissolved air floatation membrane bioreactor mbr and discfilter and concluded that mbr has the highest removal efficiency 99 9 mbr is also the most promising technique compared with other membrane processes including ultrafiltration uf dynamic membrane technology dm and reverse osmosis ro poerio et al 2019 concerns were raised regarding the impacts of mps on biological treatment due to the harmful effect of mps on aquatic bacteria it was discovered that mps such as pet pvc pe and ps could cause a series of negative impacts on the aerobic and anaerobic processes such as hydrolysis acidification ch4 and h2 production and digestion of waste activated sludge wei et al 2019 wei et al 2020b zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b the presence of mps will introduce toxic oxidative stress and introduce various toxic substances such as antibiotics additives persistent organic pollutants pops and heavy metals which inhibit enzymes or reduce cell viability zhang et al 2020c experiments were carried out to test the impacts of mps on the performances of nitrogen and phosphorus removal by ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob denitrifiers and polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos while the impacts were negligible liu et al 2019a thus even the same type of mps is introduced into wwtps it would lead to varied effects upon different processes of biological treatment this calls for a comprehensive assessment of mps implications on the efficiency of typical biological treatment in wwtps in the tertiary treatments researchers also investigated the influence of mps on processes such as coagulation mbr uf ro and flocculation for example the removal of organic matters and ammonia in a mbr system was inhibited with the presence of pvc mps due to membrane fouling li et al 2020b similarly irregular mps can wear the membrane in uf and ro processes zhang and chen 2020 in addition in the coagulation process mps will reduce the amount of effective flocculant because the negatively charged mps will interact with salt flocculants perren et al 2018 zhang and chen 2020 a comprehensive review on the effects of mps on each segment of wwtps was conducted by zhang and chen 2020 nevertheless wwtps attain a high retention efficiency of mps 90 there are still significant amounts of mps being released from wwtps into the treated effluents every day for example approximately 1 107 mps were discharged daily in final effluent from a wwtp with a mps retention capacity of 98 3 lares et al 2018 besides none of the aforementioned treatment processes are originally designed for mps removal thus new strategies have been proposed to address the problem for instance beljanski et al 2016 developed a filtration and backflushing system for mps removal sun et al 2019 also proposed to optimise the operating parameters of current treatment processes such as hydraulic retention time in the skimming and sedimentation processes masiá et al 2020 suggested that bioremediation is a promising strategy considering that higher eukaryotes such as seagrasses and macrophytes may have the competence to reduce mps in wwtps other strategies such as electrocoagulation and magnetic extraction are also discussed in a review by shen et al 2020 however feasible techniques have yet been developed aiming at mps removal in full scale wwtps which may be the directions for future research 4 5 other mps removal strategies except the microbial and radical based mps conversion approaches as discussed above some novel strategies have also been developed for mps removal tiwari et al 2020 synthesised zn al layered double hydroxide ldh to achieve a fast removal of ps based mps in deionised water and synthetic freshwater with the maximum sorption capacities of 164 49 and 162 62 mg g respectively chen et al 2020 developed a zirconium metal organic framework mofs coated melamine foam to filtrate mps dispersion after three consecutive filtrations the system achieved a high mps removal efficiency of 95 5 1 2 the success was attributed to the significant difference of zeta potentials between the composites foam and mps to enhance the electrostatic interactions and ultimately adsorptive removal another physical method was proposed by wang et al 2019 using photocatalytic au ni tio2 micromotors for the mps elimination two strategies were developed 1 individual micromotor removes mps by phoretic interaction and 2 the chained assemblies with multiple micromotors remove mps via shovelling or pushing interactions similarly fe2o3 mno2 micromotors were synthesised by ye et al 2021 and could effectively remove more than 10 of the suspended mps in 2 h via the synergy of catalytic degradation surface adsorption and adsorptive bubbles separation mechanisms in addition ruthenium pincer was used as a catalyst to drive a hydrogenative depolymerisation process for decomposition of polyamide powder at 150 c and 70 bar h2 kumar et al 2020a intriguingly the monomers obtained from hydrogenation process can be dehydrogenated and converted back to poly oligo amide with a similar molecular weight to the original polyamide such a process completed a closed loop for the recycling of polyamides 5 methods and governments policies to prevent mps release due to the widespread and potential hazards of mps in the environment policies have been enacted to reduce the sources of mps so far in the united states the act microbead free waters act of 2015 was signed to ban the intentionally added plastic microbeads in rinse off cosmetics such as toothpaste similarly new zealand republic of korea uk and some eu member states such as belgium france ireland italy and sweden have banned rinse off cosmetic products from the market echa 2019 however except cosmetic products releasing 3800 tonnes of mps annually in europe a high level of mps in agricultural and horticulture fertilisers have been released 23 500 tonnes per year echa 2019 the annual release of mps is estimated to reach 176 300 71 800 280 600 tonnes in europe while only around 36 000 tonnes are primary mps echa 2019 the above regulations are specifically aiming at primary mps especially microbeads from personal care products and annexe policies on the secondary mps should be put on future agenda burns and boxall 2018 researchers and governments should make a concerted effort to trace the sources of secondary mps and enact corresponding regulations to prohibit the use and spread in addition to minimising intentional mps usage in cosmetics other control strategies have been proposed such as increasing recycling rates monitoring and preventing marine litters and mps from possible ocean sources e g fisheries off shore installation and shipping unep 2017 restricting the use of oxo plastics that will fragment into mps rapidly european commission 2018 limiting the consumption of single use plastic products and substituting them with alternative materials echa 2019 and developing feasible methods to specifically filter mps in water treatment plants european commission 2019 currently the lack of policies in reducing secondary mps and other potential primary mps calls for more comprehensive research on the source detection transport and impacts of mps on the environment the information will remind the policymakers on the major sources of mps and their greater risks the scientific underpinning is useful to effectively legislate and implement prevention orientated policies however despite that the relevant law or plans have been enacted in many countries it is still challenging for developing countries to build up infrastructures to reduce mps uses and discharge free et al 2014 thus governments should seek cooperation to reduce mps based pollution and meanwhile encourage research on developing efficient and economic technologies for mps removal in wwtps 6 perspectives 6 1 mps in the aqueous environment so far microplastics have been widely inspected across different disciplines but the existing surveys are imbalanced for example investigations on the mps distributions in marine and freshwater are more comprehensive and outnumber that in other environmental compartments this may result in the cognitive bias on the existence of mps and finally influence the process of policy development thus the fate and abundance of mps in other environments especially in air and drinking water are investigated the least which contribute to the highest human intake similarly for obtaining a deeper and broader understanding of mps impacts the following research directions should be focused which can ultimately serve to resolve some unanswered questions that matter to the environment and policymakers 1 in recent studies photodegraded mps in the aqueous environment have been found to have toxic effects on biota due to the generation of persistent free radicals on the plastic surface these aged mps during photodegradation have become emerging contaminants with underestimated hazards to the environment wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 the toxicities of mps can be the combined effect of several factors such as epfrs additives and adsorbed toxic compounds so the individual factor to the overall toxicity still needs investigation also the knowledge gap of potential hazards of the mps based persistent radicals after ingestion needs to be filled 2 researchers should be aware of the water soluble polymers alongside mps and nps due to their high potentials to release into the environment and unclear environmental impacts though they are not classified as mps they are synthetic polymers similar to mps and may cause unexpected and detrimental effects huppertsberg et al 2020 3 difficulty in tracking the specific source of mps is due to the property changes of the plastics during the long period usage transport as well as the complex interactions with the environment via bio and chemical processes after a long period of ageing in the natural environment the physical and chemical properties of the plastics may be enormously changed and impede the sourcing process thus the research on the detection and the existence of mps should include the mps types sizes and shapes which can provide clues in source tracking analytical verification characterisation with appropriate quality assurance quality control qa qc is also required in future analysis lowry et al 2020 in the meantime the standards of the definition and classification of mps shapes should be established as different studies may have other descriptions to the same debris making results incomparable 4 a potential way to reduce the production of mps is using chemically recyclable plastics which can be recovered to building block chemicals through depolymerisation and synthesis to virgin quality plastics or value added materials namely chemolysis tang and chen 2019 however more research and effort should be dedicated to this area the main problem is that this process still could not typically recover building block chemicals and the degraded chemicals are of potential to cause unexpected environmental consequences other issues can be high energy costs low selectivity and trade offs between the properties and ability of polymers to be depolymerised which needs to be tackled tang and chen 2019 6 2 mps degradation removal although mps were firstly reported in 2004 methods to specifically transfer degrade or remove mps have yet extensively studied by now most of strategies to remediate plastics are based on biodegradation not until recently aops based techniques emerge as effective methods in mps deformation and remediation but the relevant research is still in the early stage and needs further development in order to develop appropriate mps control and purification strategies and increase the applicability several aspects should be considered for future study 1 even though solid phase photocatalysis is not originally designed for mps deterioration its ability to degrade polymers renders it a promising technique in mps ageing and transformation benefited from previous extensive research in photocatalysts design highly efficient photocatalytic systems for mps purification can be expected in addition the degradation efficiency carried out in water should be assessed in the meanwhile considering that plastics photocatalyst hybrids may be the potential mps sources in aquatic environment for photoreforming in water it is effective in degrading mps and capable to produce h2 or c2 fuels however the carbon hydrogen conversion efficiency and product selectivity still call for further improvements and rational design of photocatalysts and optimal operating parameters will be the keys to upgrading the system 2 the degradation processes need to be conducted in less extreme conditions for instance high temperature or strong alkaline solution is preferred in some aops processes but the high energy input and corrosive effect on the reactor hinder them from practical applications in addition since some fenton fenton like systems have been proved to be feasible in mps decomposition other aops systems such as ozonation sonication and integrated approaches with thermal photocatalysis and other peroxides should be examined to develop green facile and more powerful systems compared to developing new methods and equipment for particularly removing mps improving and optimising the existing water treatment techniques in wwtps may provide a more economic option to prevent mps release 3 there are various approaches to determine and evaluate the degradation efficiency of mps however each of them has its own advantages and drawbacks to obtain more reliable outcomes it is recommended to combine different assessment methods or propose other feasible approaches 4 the applicability of a specific remediation technique to different types of plastics should be tested and provided different polymers have demonstrated different resistances to natural degradation knowing the feasibility of a specific technique to different plastics is conducive to rational design improvement and application of the system besides the effects and consequences of plastic additives e g antioxidant are still less explored in the current studies plastics in real life were mixed with various additives during manufacture for versatile purposes most of current studies on mps only focus on the plastic itself the effects of additives on the purification processes and the potential impacts toxicity should be investigated such understanding will provide useful information for the wise selection and use of additives in plastic industry in the meantime there is a lack of research using environmentally aged mps when mps are exposed in natural environment chemicals such as pops will adsorb on mps surface and hinders the mps degradation however the ageing process due to uv irradiation may promote the efficiency proper evaluation of these factors in mps degradation processes needs to be carried out in future studies although various remediation methods were proved effective the production of nps during this process has not been investigated this knowledge gap needs to be filled 5 the carbon and hydrogen conversion reutilization efficiency should be assessed in future studies some approaches convert plastics into value added products such as carbon nanotubes ch4 and h2 thus the evaluation of h c reutilisation efficiency of plastics will indicatethe applicability economic potential and estimated carbon emission of the technologies 6 the various emerging plastics degradation strategies should be placed on the top of agenda for reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions from end of life eol processes the eol stage occupied 9 of total life cycle emissions of all the plastics in 2015 and incineration was the dominant source of ghg emissions among eol processes zheng and suh 2019 in order to mitigate ghg emissions growth in the next few decades one of the most effective strategies is decarbonising the energy mix of the plastics supply chain reaching 100 renewables in this case incineration will become the greatest contributor to the total emissions for bioplastics zheng and suh 2019 thus replacing incineration with low ghg or ghg free strategies is imperative also aops techniques will emit small amount of co2 during mineralisation of mps or produce h2 as fuel during photodegradation are a promising candidate for eol process by answering the above questions a clearer vision of mps impacts will be obtained so that the risks of mps can be accurately assessed and appropriate regulatory actions can be formulated by policymakers it is encouraged to keep exploring the existing approaches and design product orientated systems for example it is promising to design systems to modulate the degradation products into pure h2 or syngas for industrial usage and value added carbonaceous products preventing the formation of co2 helps mediate the ghg emissions in addition cost evaluation including energy input should be conducted to assess the practicability of the system so that the policymakers can carry it out further unlike soluble pollutants mps are solid contaminants how to increase the contact area between the catalysts and mps and increase the mass transfer for efficient reaction is still a challenge so far many existed systems are based on extreme conditions such as high temperature so the designed catalysts are required to have high stability and reusability for instance materials with carbonaceous matrix are ideal catalysts but researchers should consider if such highly stable materials are environmental friendly when released to the environment recently it was reported that by combining appropriate initiatives plastics recycling rates can achieve over 55 where 75 90 was recycled in a closed loop eriksen et al 2020 therefore in the future a green mps treatment technology with a low cost is expected to deal with the discarded plastics by converting them into valuable products for future usage to achieve carbon and hydrogen cycles between plastics and fuels 7 conclusion currently most mps research works focus on the properties impacts detection and distribution of mps while studies on mps degradation and conversion are emerging but still limited in this review the types of mps and sampling methods are briefly introduced this review focuses on the current progress in the existing and emerging mps remediation transformation approaches the features and limitations of each technology are discussed highly efficient approaches 10 hours such as fenton fenton like systems and thermal treatment usually require high chemical and energy inputs biodegradation and photocatalysis can degrade mps in a green manner but they need relatively long time to realize satisfactory remediation photocatalytic and thermal treatments can convert mps into value added products chemicals fuels and nanocarbons and the products of biodegradation and fenton fenton like processes can serve as nutrients for microorganism utilization to fix carbon and minimize carbon emissions wwtps with tertiary treatments can effectively remove mps during multi processes but the impacts of mps on the facilities and removal efficiency are still unclear a better understanding of mps as well as the remediation options and precautionary operations is important as million tons of plastics are being released to and accumulating in the aquatic environment annually declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement we

16979,in recent years the ubiquitous detection and accumulation of microplastics mps in the aquatic environment have raised significant concerns on water security and long term ecological impacts all around the world nevertheless critical reviews on strategic control and effective remediation of mps in the aqueous phase are still lacking in this work we summarise the origins and types of mps and then introduce the methodologies for extraction identification and quantification more importantly we for the first time provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the emerging mps removal and transformation technologies except for biodegradation this review presents new applications of advanced oxidation processes aops for mps degradation and utilisation including photocatalysis photoreforming and fenton like reactions physical or catalytic thermal treatment can transform plastics into value added nanocarbons or hydrocarbons these transformation technologies demonstrate great potentials in dealing with mps the review will guide researchers to further explore the feasible approaches and develop new strategies for advanced control and remediation of mps in the future keywords microplastics advanced oxidation processes purification transformation catalysis 1 introduction since the first synthesis of polystyrene based plastics by eduard simon in 1839 there have been numerous studies on plastics diversification properties improvement and advanced plastics technology alimba and faggio 2019 chen and patel 2012 kroon et al 2016 this can be reflected by the number of publications which have been exponentially increasing in the past 10 years fig 1 a plastics have fascinating features and versatility for diverse applications and the global yields of plastics soared to 368 million tonnes in 2019 from 1 5 million tonnes in 1950 alimba and faggio 2019 plasticseurope 2020 fig 1 b and are estimated to achieve 33 billion tonnes by 2050 rochman et al 2013 packaging building and construction are by far the largest plastic end use markets among various types of plastics polyethylene pe polypropylene pp and polyvinyl chloride pvc are the most consumed products plasticseurope 2020 though plastic debris was firstly reported in the early 1970s the term microplastics was not raised to describe plastic pollution until 2004 by thomspon fig 1 c horton et al 2017 thompson et al 2004 microplastics mps defined as plastics smaller than 5 mm in size were firstly reported in 2004 and raised increasing public awareness and research interests thereafter thompson et al 2004 the upper size of mps is recognized as 5 mm in most research but the lower limit as the dividing line between mps and nanoplastics nps is inconsistent in research which could be 100 nm nguyen et al 2019 or 1 μm sobhani et al 2020 a universal terminology and criterion has been proposed to categorise plastic debris hartmann et al 2019 whereas some elements are debatable thus the definition and categorisation framework cannot be fixed and needs to be developed in the future the most abundant mps according to a previous study are pe pp pvc polystyrene ps and polyamides pa alimba and faggio 2019 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 they exist in various shapes and morphologies including fibres fragments films pellets beads etc which influence their behaviours and fates in nature li et al 2020a however the definition of each shape is still vague and needs a general criterion for the classification so far mps are pervasive around the globe under the effects of wind action ocean current and river flow the small size feature of mps results in their ingestion by various organisms especially low trophic level animals causing unexpected accumulative and adverse consequences to the food chain it has been reported that over 690 marine species have confronted debris of which 92 are made of plastics burgess and ho 2017 moreover these mps are resistant to bio photo degradation in the natural environment and the number of mps persisted in the environment will keep increasing up to now plastics account for over 60 of floating debris in the oceans gewert et al 2015 in the process of plastic manufacture various additives are added to obtain specific characteristics e g antiaging and antioxidising which are typically hazardous chemicals to the environment the relatively high surface area and wealthy functional groups also enable mps to draft adsorb toxic organic inorganic compounds and transfer them to the food web which are the indirect risks of mps furthermore mps can induce a series of physical and toxic effects on animals such as a reduction in growth rate oxidative stress and false satiation auta et al 2017 additionally mps have been frequently detected in human food including table salts tea bags and drinking water zhang et al 2020 posing potential threats to public health therefore it is critical and urgent to issue policies on plastics regulations and management by the governments and to develop effective strategies to control mps pollution considering the continuous accretion of plastics waste for example a policy has been made to ban polyethylene microbeads in america in 2015 strifling 2016 despite the efforts from governments and individuals to mitigate the environmental input of plastics effective strategies and technologies are essential to control and remediate the existing mps wastewater treatment plants wwtps can attain high mps removal efficiency over 90 using tertiary treatment however a large volume of mps will be still released into the environment an effective method to reduce mps input is to substitute conventional plastics with bioplastics according to a report from european bioplastics the global production capacity of bioplastics including bio based biodegradable or both in 2019 was 2 11 million tonnes most of which were applied in the market of packaging textiles agriculture horticulture consumer goods building and transport european bioplastics 2019 bioplastics can be defined as biodegradable plastics or plastics produced from plants or animals bio based bio based plastics are not necessarily biodegradable and vice versa for example non degradable bioplastics include bio based pe polyethylene terephthalate pet pa which occupy almost half of the bioplastic market in 2019 european bioplastics 2019 on the other hand biodegradable plastics includes polybutylene adipate terephthalate pbat polybutylenesuccinate pbs polylactic acid pla polyhydroxybutyrates pha and starch pectin chitosan based blends composites fojt et al 2020 these plastics can be degraded naturally or digested by the microorganisms in the environment in relatively short time less than 180 days which signifies that the biodegradable plastics will release microplastics called bio microplastics faster than conventional plastics if the conditions for complete biodegradation are not satisfied sintim et al 2019 but the differences between the environmental impacts of bio microplastics and conventional microplastics are ambiguous sintim et al 2019 there are mainly four stages of biodegradation 1 plastic fragmentation by biofilms 2 microorganisms release extracellular enzymes to depolymerise plastic fragments 3 the depolymerised small molecules enter the cells of microorganisms and 4 small molecules are mineralised by intracellular enzymes fojt et al 2020 biodegradation can proceed in two ways aerobic and anaerobic degradation the aerobic pathway will produce co2 h2o and heat but heat cannot be captured or utilized in contrary anaerobic process will store the energy in ch4 accompanied with by products of co2 h2s and h2o however research on anaerobic degradation is still in infancy and needs future investigation bátori et al 2018 though bioplastics demonstrate the potential as a substitution of petroleum based plastics they only have a minimal share of total plastics production about 1 european bioplastics 2019 also research on bioplastic degradation by chemical treatment is rare thus bioplastics will not be discussed in this review a more comprehensive summary of the degradation of bioplastics can be referred to recent reviews bátori et al 2018 fojt et al 2020 polman et al 2020 rameshkumar et al 2020 thakur et al 2018 except cutting off the source of mps up to now numerous approaches have been proposed to degrade or transform conventional mps such as biodegradation photocatalysis advanced oxidation processes aops thermal treatments and wastewater treatment technologies previously biodegradation of plastics by bacteria and fungi has been extensively studied various bacteria strains were reported to be reactive for plastic degradation and the corresponding enzymes were extracted to evaluate the efficiency roager and sonnenschein 2019 yoshida et al 2016 though these studies are not directly dealing with mps they can provide knowledge for the development of new technologies towards mps elimination another strategy is chemical reaction to oxidise and mineralise mps into harmless compounds via advanced oxidation technologies in a recent study photodegradation demonstrates as an auspicious approach for the degradation and transformation of mps into small molecule fuels jiao et al 2020 the concept of upgrading of mps into value added fuels is appealing in terms of carbon emission and energy regeneration in addition fenton fenton likes systems use peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds as oxidants to produce highly reactive oxygen species ros to decompose mps directly kang et al 2019 miao et al 2020 the aops technique was very effective and could achieve respectful degradation rates in a relatively short time compared with biodegradation also the degradation products can act as carbon sources for algae s growth kang et al 2019 thermal approaches such as pyrolysis and gasification have also been used for mps treatment the most fascinating feature of the technology is its high efficiency in mps transformation into fuels such as ch4 h2 and co but such a process requires high temperature and product selectivity is usually low recently microwave treatment with a fealox catalyst was used to produce high purity h2 and carbon nanotubes within 90 seconds jie et al 2020 except the catalytic systems improving the mps removal efficiency in a wastewater treatment plant is also a promising option a membrane bioreactor is reported to exhibit the highest removal capability 99 99 among various wastewater treatment processes talvitie et al 2017 though a variety of mps removal strategies have been recently developed no attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive summary on these findings or to provide critical comments in the field this review aims to comprehensively overview the recent advances in mps remediation by showcasing the advantages and bottlenecks of each technology before that sources and types of mps will be briefly introduced because the mps properties determine the susceptibility of different treatments understanding the plastic characteristics will help select the appropriate technology also sampling methods are briefly presented because it is vital to the future research on the identification and quantification of environmental mps prior to remediation on this basis we provide perspectives and directions for future studies on mps purification strategies particularly photocatalysis and thermal treatment are very promising in terms of energy recovery as they can convert mps into value added fuels in addition fenton fenton like systems and biodegradation will decompose mps into small molecule nutrients for microorganism utilisation thus mps remediation technologies will not only secure water safety but also help address issues of energy crisis and sustainability 2 microplastics in the environment 2 1 sources of mps there are mainly three fates of plastic waste recycle thermal destruction incineration and discard or in a managed system geyer et al 2017 though the discarded rate has been declining since 1980 around 4 9 billion tonnes of plastics have been accumulating in landfills or the natural environment globally from 1950 to 2015 consisting of 60 of the overall plastics ever manufactured and 79 of the plastics waste geyer et al 2017 these discarded plastic wastes are the potential origins of mps generally mps mainly come from two routes primary and secondary sources primary source referred as unaged plastics are those plastics manufactured less than 5 mm in size for specific cosmetic and industrial applications including microbeads in facial scrubs toothpaste and air blast cleaning media auta et al 2017 the extensive use of primary mps results in a large mass discharge into the environment via municipal effluents murphy et al 2016 the amount of plastic waste for recycling is increasing every year plasticseurope 2020 and up to 99 9 of mps can be removed by the sewage treatment unit however a significant number of mps penetrate the filtration systems and are discharged into the environment under the effects of ultraviolet radiation weathering and physical abrasion large pieces of plastics will fragment into small debris and eventually into mps which are referred as the secondary source for example plastic strips will produce mps only after eight weeks of exposure to intertidal salt marshes by surface erosion from mechanical abrasion periwinkle grazing and microbial degradation tagg et al 2017 in addition mps formation is subjected to geological factors intense uv radiation in lands and shallow water as well as severe wave impact in coastal waters are considered to result in serious fragmentations andrady 2011 barnes et al 2009 horton et al 2017 except for abiotic factors animals such as geophagous soil fauna can contribute to the formation of secondary mps when grinding up the ingested mps rillig 2012 other secondary sources are produced from clothes washing horton et al 2017 tire abrasion road markings marine coatings etc an et al 2020 the fragmentation of large pieces of plastics releases toxic additives and significantly increases the abundance of plastics exposed to the aquatic environment meanwhile the larger surface area and decreased size are conductive to adsorption of microcontaminants heavy metals and will lead to a higher ingestion rate in biota which further enhances the potential hazards of mps auta et al 2017 2 2 types of mps and susceptibility to natural degradation according to the report from plasticseurope 2020 over 80 of the produced plastics in 2019 are pe pp pvc pet ps and polyurethane pu for the mps identified by the recent research nylon i e pa polyester pes and acrylic are very common in the environment sobhani et al 2020 sun et al 2019 other types of mps which are less or rarely reported due to their small quantity or identification limitations include polysulfone psu acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer abs polycarbonate pc biodegradable plastics such as polylactide acid pla and polyvinyl acetate pva andrady 2011 koelmans et al 2019 kutralam muniasamy et al 2020 lorenz et al 2019 mani et al 2019 mistri et al 2020 the amount of waste produced from different types are shown in fig 2 these plastics can be divided into two groups gewert et al 2015 plastics with c c bond pe pp ps pvc and acrylic are more susceptible to photo initiated degradation and plastics with heteroatoms in the main chain pa pes pet and pu have better thermal stability but are prone to hydrolytic cleavage of the e g amide bonds or ester bonds gewert et al 2015 2 2 1 plastics with c c main chain for plastics with c c bond only natural degradation involves of three processes initiation propagation and termination in the initiation stage uv light breaks up the c h bond and generates free radicals which subsequently react with oxygen and produce roo in the propagation stage leading to autoxidation and ultimately chain scission or crosslinking finally the chain reaction will be terminated when two radicals combine and form inert products the reduction of molecular weight during photooxidation increases the brittleness of plastics making them more vulnerable to fragmentation into mps 2 2 1 1 pe and pp pe and pp in the initiation stage are immune to photooxidation due to the lack of unsaturated chromophoric groups that absorb light but the external impurities or structural imperfections allow the initiation of natural photodegradation bond et al 2018 gewert et al 2015 compared with pe pp was reported to be less stable and experienced a higher degree of weathering in the marine environment as the tertiary carbons the c atoms bound to three other c atoms in pp are more susceptible to abiotic attack gewert et al 2015 zbyszewski and corcoran 2011 then peroxyl radicals and environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs are generated during photodegradation and further oxidise the polymer gewert et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 after the photo initiated oxidation thermo oxidation occurs with the presence of oxygen andrady 2011 however because of the absence of functional groups and the high molecular mass biodegradation is limited without photo initiation gewert et al 2015 thus photooxidation is critical for the formation of pe and pp derived mps in the environment 2 2 1 2 ps ps possesses a low persistence towards outdoor weathering gewert et al 2015 because the excitation energy from uv irradiation in the phenyl ring can transfer to the adjacent c h bond causing hydrogen cleavage and formation of polymer radicals yousif and haddad 2013 amongst thermoplastics ps is most persistent towards biodegradation gewert et al 2015 and uv irradiation is a significant drive for the formation of ps based mps 2 2 1 3 pvc pvc is the least stable to photodegradation due to its high sensitivity towards uv radiation gewert et al 2015 to be specific sunlight will cause dechlorination and produce hcl and c c which are low stable under photoirradiation and will break up the backbone into smaller fragments gewert et al 2015 nevertheless pvc is resistant to biodegradation due to the existence of halogens especially chlorine its dechlorination during photo degradation is conducive to biodegradation gewert et al 2015 2 2 2 plastics with heteroatoms in the main chain for plastics with heteroatoms in the main chain photodegradation biodegradation fungal bacterial and enzymes and hydrolysis can cause their deterioration in the marine environment gewert et al 2015 take pu as an example photodegradation can happen at the α methylene position while hydrolysis is effective not only to the ester bond but also to urea and urethane bonds with slower rates lamba et al 1997 szycher 1999 in biodegradation microbes will degrade urethane bonds and polyol polyester type or polyether type segments producing low molar mass molecules such as carboxylic acid alcohol carbamic acid amine and ultimately carbon dioxide magnin et al 2020 nakajima kambe et al 1999 similarly pa is very susceptible to photodegradation and can be easily weathered eroded and degraded tang et al 2020 thomas and hridayanathan 2006 pet as the main type of pes is prone to photooxidation and hydrolytic oxidation causing cleavage of the ester bond and formation of vinyl end groups and carboxylic acid gewert et al 2015 the reduction of molar mass linearly decreases the maximum stress at break up indicating the potential of fracturing pet into mps arhant et al 2019 however pet is highly insusceptible to biodegradation in the environment gewert et al 2015 due to its highly compact structure and less amorphous domains compared to the amorphous plastics taniguchi et al 2019 thus abiotic activities e g ultraviolet irradiation are desired for plastics before biodegradation when mps enter the aquatic environment their density is the primary factor affecting their distribution in the water body for example mps with a lower density than freshwater and seawater such as pe pp and expanded ps are prone to appear in surface water and shorelines but scarce in the deep sea and intermediate depths bond et al 2018 erni cassola et al 2019 in contrast for higher density mps such as pvc pet and pp a they tend to rest in sediments beaches subsurface waters and deep sea bond et al 2018 therefore different types of plastics will have different deterioration pathways under natural conditions and cause diverse ecological effects on aquatic and even soil sediment organisms machado et al 2019 machado et al 2018 however some investigations did not distinguish the types of plastics which will affect the data reliability and mislead future meta analysis thus the precise identification of the polymer types or acknowledging the difficulties in analysing similar polymers will provide guidance to trace mps sources and improve data reliability for future analysis 3 sampling extraction and quantification methods to analyse the population and distribution of mps in different environments several steps should be followed including sampling extraction purification and identification quantification the different approaches for each step have been reviewed and discussed in several articles elkhatib and oyanedel craver 2020 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 huang et al 2020 li et al 2018 möller et al 2020 nguyen et al 2019 prata et al 2019 these steps are vital for future research on in situ environmental mps remediation thus pros and cons of these techniques will be briefly introduced in this section in the aquatic environment there are three main sampling approaches including selective volume reduced and bulk sampling hidalgo ruz et al 2012 selective sampling in the field takes the direct extraction of items that are recognizable by naked eyes from the environment usually performed on the surface of sediments this method is simple but has a great risk of overlooking mps in some characteristic shapes hidalgo ruz et al 2012 volume reduce sampling only preserves the portion that is of interest using a neuston plankton net or manta net while bulk sampling takes the entire volume of the sample li et al 2018 in addition grab samplers composite samplers extraction pumps or neuston nets were used for wastewater sampling in wwtps elkhatib and oyanedel craver 2020 in order to separate mps from water samples filtration sieving and density separation are most frequently used in the stage of primary separation filtration sieving can isolate particles directly from the samples collected from different matrixes and efficiently remove particles larger than 5 mm dioses salinas et al 2020 huang et al 2020 density separation uses a solution with a specific density to enable high density particles to sink while low density particles to float saturated nacl 1 2 g ml is the most used solution other conventional solutions include na6 h2w12o6 1 4 g ml cacl2 1 3 g ml nai 1 8 g ml zncl2 1 6 1 7 g ml nabr 1 55 g ml and znbr2 1 7 g ml li et al 2018 möller et al 2020 prata et al 2019 generally speaking the higher density solution can achieve a higher recovery rate with low errors then filtration sieving with different mesh sizes can be used again to separate the particles other separation methods of electrostatic separation oil extraction froth flotation magnetic extraction vertical density gradient separation pressurized fluid extraction elutriation centrifugation and staining have been discussed in several reviews elkhatib and oyanedel craver 2020 li et al 2018 möller et al 2020 for extracting mps from other organic matters different digestion approaches have been explored including acidic alkaline digestion h2o2 fenton s reagent and enzymatic digestion acidic alkaline digestion has been adopted to separate mps from biological tissues but some plastics can be degraded or damaged by the acid or alkaline treatment möller et al 2020 h2o2 is the most popular oxidising agent to digest organic compounds however treatment with high concentration h2o2 at high temperature usually 60 c will result in the decolouration and size reduction of some plastics such as pa pp and pc möller et al 2020 fenton reagent h2o2 fe2 was explored for removing the organics without affecting mps hurley et al 2018 enzymatic digestion such as amylase chitinase cellulose lipase and proteinase is less hazardous and is friendly to mps but the efficiency varies depending on the types of organic matters li et al 2018 möller et al 2020 thus sequential combination of enzymatic digestion and other extraction approaches such as h2o2 and fenton reagent is proposed to be able to enhance the purification möller et al 2020 for the identification and quantification of mps visual inspection microscopy vibrational spectroscopy and mass spectrometry are the widely used techniques among them visual inspection under a light microscope is the simplest way to discern the shape size and colour of mps but this approach is prone to bias and cannot obtain the compositional information elkhatib and oyanedel craver 2020 vibrational spectroscopy including fourier transform infrared ftir and raman spectroscopy can directly signal and reveal the chemical compositions ftir is a fast and reliable technique for hydrocarbon analysis but it cannot detect samples smaller than 20 μm li et al 2018 in this regard raman technique is more favourable in mps research as its detection limit can be as low as 1 μm a recent study developed surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers with an exceptional klarite substrate which even detected mp sizes down to 36 nm xu et al 2020 nonetheless raman spectroscopy is a relatively expensive and time consuming technique li et al 2018 mass spectrometry methods such as pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms are suitable to qualify and quantify mps under specific configurations the py gc ms technique has demonstrated good performances in mps characterisation and mass quantification but the upper size and amount limits of the sample are 1 5 mm fries et al 2013 and 0 5 mg dümichen et al 2017 respectively which hinder it from the application in complex samples similar to py gc ms thermal desorption coupled with gc ms tds gc ms and thermal depolymerisation liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms were also reported for the same purpose and the techniques have different advantages and limitations huang et al 2020 except for the methods discussed above other techniques for mps qualification and quantification have been reviewed by möller et al 2020 such as liquid chromatography and thermogravimetric analysis tga coupled with differential scanning calorimetry dsc or mass spectrometry ms 4 remediation and transformation strategies except precautious methods such as reducing plastic production and usage advanced remediation technologies have been explored to degrade or remove the existing mps from water though plastics degradation has been studied for decades incumbent strategies that focus on mps are still limited and mainly fall in 5 categories microbial degradation aops techniques thermal treatment wastewater treatment plant and other physical approaches such as adsorption and filtration the brief degradation pathways of biodegradation aops and thermal treatment are depicted in fig 3 amongst these approaches microbial degradation has the longest history in mps abatement with the merit of low energy input aops and thermal treatment can attain a faster decomposition rate and demonstrate the potential to leverage the carbon and hydrogen elements in mps to produce fuels in this section representative studies from different categories will be showcased and suggestions for future research will be provided accordingly 4 1 microbial degradation biodegradation compared to other abiotic purification methods biodegradation has the advantages of environmental friendliness low cost and low energy input as well as optimised carbon footprint microorganisms can utilise plastics as the carbon and nitrogen sources to survive and proliferate montazer et al 2020 taniguchi et al 2019 zheng et al 2005 microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi are evidenced to be capable of degrading specific polymers though they are not specifically designed to degrade mps in most cases such a function holds a grand promise for the applications in mps control and purification 4 1 1 bacteria bacteria that can colonise or degrade marine plastics have been comprehensively reviewed by roager and sonnenschein 2019 it was found that kocuria palustris m16 and rhodococcus sp 36 from actinobacteria class and various bacillus strains were capable of degrading mps however the degradation rates were mostly very slow with 1 10 weight loss in the timeframe between 30 days and one year roager and sonnenschein 2019 one exception was ideonella sakaiensis 201 f6 which was extracted from a microbial consortium by yoshida et al 2016 and could almost completely degrade pet after six weeks at 30 c such a process is achieved via secreting petase and incorporating enzymatically released compounds terephthalic acid tps and mono 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalic acid mhet for the cell growth recently tournier et al 2020 improved the performances of pet hydrolase and leaf branch compost cutinase lcc fig 4 a b the system achieved at least 90 of pet depolymerisation into monomers over 10 h fig 4 c which outperformed all the existing pet hydrolases including i sakaiensis 201 f6 and the related improved variants what is more the depolymerised monomers can be subsequently recycled to produce pet that exhibited the same properties as the petrochemical pet herein closing the loop of the circular economy tournier et al 2020 also the high degradation rate can be contributed to the low crystallinity of pet yang et al 2016 and the high chain mobility marten et al 2005 in addition to single bacterium microbial consortium was investigated in plastic degradation acclimatisation and bioaugmentation on indigenous microbial consortia isolated from the environment have been proved to be capable strategies in plastic removal roager and sonnenschein 2019 breakthroughs have been achieved in pet degradation which is more susceptible to biodegradation however practical solutions to degrade non hydrolysable plastics such as pe and pp are urgent as they are more pervasive in different environments and are resistant to biodegradation krueger et al 2015 effective microbiological solutions to varying types of plastics including pe pp pvc ps pur and nylon were discussed and summarised jacquin et al 2019 krueger et al 2015 pathak and navneet 2017 fig 5 a meanwhile reviews that exclusively discussed pe montazer et al 2020 restrepo flórez et al 2014 and pet taniguchi et al 2019 degradation are also available microbial degradation of plastic debris in different scenarios including cold marine habitats urbanek et al 2018 soil helmberger et al 2020 and marine environment kumar et al 2020b oberbeckmann and labrenz 2020 and corresponding environmental influences have been overviewed which will not be detailed here 4 1 2 fungi apart from bacteria fungi are also capable of utilising mps as sole carbon and energy sources through releasing enzymes fungi are capable of biodegrading petroleum based plastics and the corresponding degradation pathways are shown in fig 5 b sanchez 2020 it was found that fungi are effective to various plastic substrates including ldpe hdpe pp pvc pet pa polyester polyurethane ppu and polystyrene sulfonate the degradation ability of fungi can be attributed to the combination of intracellular process which is for detoxification fungal adaptation and extracellular enzymatic process such a process will release hydrolases for mps degradation sanchez 2020 in order to improve biodegradation activities sanchez 2020 also proposed several strategies including adding pro oxidants species reducing biocides and antioxidant stabilizers during the plastics production compared with bacteria fungi were reported to have a better performance towards pe degradation muhonja et al 2018 the ability to synthesise hydrophobin to attach hyphae to hydrophobic substrates make them appropriate candidates for polymer deterioration fungi also have the advantage of great adaptability to various environments as they have been discovered in multiple terrestrial and marine environments even under extreme conditions such as deep sea and anoxic habitats raghukumar 2017 however enzymes that would participate in mps degradation were only investigated in limited studies sanchez 2020 therefore more studies should consider performing the experiments in the ocean especially below the sea surface where more fungi are present amaral zettler et al 2020 although weight loss measurement has been extensively used to evaluate the biodegradability for both bacteria and fungi detecting co2 evolution is more appropriate according to astm standards american society for testing and materials astm 2012 astm 2017 however co2 may originate from the micropollutants drafted on plastics or can be consumed via photosynthetic communities thus combining co2 evaluation with tracing approaches such as isotope labelling to ascertain the extent of assimilation is adopted to solve the issue amaral zettler et al 2020 until now for plastics containing hydrolysable bonds like esters or amides only pet was efficiently depolymerised by enzymes while the efficient depolymerisation of pa and pu has yet been reported wei et al 2020a on the other hand research on biodegradation towards polyolefin chains is limited due to the lack of functional groups and high molecular weight so beforehand abiotic treatment is pivotal to polyolefin gewert et al 2015 besides other characteristics of hydrophobicity and cross linked chemical structure impede their biodegradation horton et al 2017 natural microbes are unlikely to degrade mps but can interact with mps to form microbial communities called plastisphere deep sea microbes may be valuable sources for potential enzymes but the access to deep sea poses a challenge for biochemists wei et al 2020a thus aops systems such as photocatalysis or h2o2 pms pds activation can be applied as abiotic treatments considering that the produced ros can introduce oxygen containing functional groups decrease molecular weight and reduce hydrophobicity of plastics 4 2 advanced oxidation processes aops 4 2 1 photodegradation photocatalytic degradation photocatalytic degradation is a branch of aops which has been proved to be an energy efficient technique to degrade mps in the aqueous environment when semiconductor photocatalysts are exposed to an appropriate light source holes h and excited electrons e will be generated these holes can combine with h2o or oh to produce ros such as oh and o2 which will attack mps and cause polymeric chain rupture branching crosslinking and even mineralisation into co2 and h2o advances in photodegradation of mps are showcased as follows in addition composite films of larger plastics and photocatalysts are also discussed considering that it may be useful information for improving mps targeted photooxidation before discussing photocatalytic processes it is vital to understand the photolysis in the natural environment photo initiated degradation happens to the c c backbone of plastics which can be concluded in three steps initiation propagation and termination the detailed pathways have been illustrated in a literature gewert et al 2015 during the processes radicals will be formed on the backbone to produce peroxyl radicals which play critical roles in natural photo degradation gewert et al 2015 in addition chemical chain scission addition reaction with o2 h2o and formation of epfrs happen to mps after 15 days of photoirradiation zhu et al 2019 epfrs subsequently result in ros e g oh which will in turn attack the mps and further rupture the chain causing molecular weight reduction and ultimately generating various small molecular products zhu et al 2019 the generation of epfrs is mainly determined by the chemical structures of mps for example ps and phenolformaldehyde resin pf with ample benzene rings are more likely to form epfrs under light irradiation whereas aliphatic polymers such as pvc and pe are photo inert nevertheless as an emerging research topic the role of epfrs needs to be investigated to reveal their effects on plastic degradation and animal health wang et al 2020 4 2 1 1 solid phase photocatalytic degradation a large quantities of waste plastic are exposed to sunlight in the open air which will undergo solid phase photocatalytic degradation the research on plastic photodegradation in the solid state can be traced back to 1970s allen and mckellar 1975 until now the most used strategy is suspending photocatalysts usually 10 wt in plastic stock solution to form composite films for photodegradation tests fig 6 a the universal approach to evaluate the degradation efficiency is to measure the weight loss of the composites because it can reflect the mineralisation efficiency of transforming the plastic carbons to co2 therefore the plastic composites are promising substitutes that are susceptible to photodegradation generally the degradation of plastics matrix starts from the interface between the polymer and catalysts by oh produced from photocatalysis this process makes the surrounding plastics degrade and form cavities around the catalyst particles or aggregates then the oxidation process spatially extends into the polymer matrix through ros diffusion subsequently generating carbon centred radicals and causing carbon chain cleavage with oxygen insertion in the course of photocatalysis intermediates containing carbonyl and carboxyl groups will then be produced and eventually photo oxidised to small molecule volatile organics co2 and h2o liu et al 2011 zhao et al 2007 via gas chromatography identification these volatile organic compounds can be ethene ethane butane acetaldehyde formaldehyde and ethanol when ps is used as the plastic substrate shang et al 2003b however volatile organic compounds are scarcely detected in other plastic matrixes the experimental conditions and degradation performances of different photocatalytic systems are listed in table 2 tio2 is the most frequently used photocatalyst for plastic degradation due to its high photoactivity low cost and nontoxicity on this basis various strategies as listed in fig 6 b have been applied to improve the photocatalytic performances for instance because the photocatalytic reaction occurs mostly at the interface of polymer and the catalyst other components such as tio2 p25 particles ohtani et al 1989 ohtani et al 1992 nanotubes ali et al 2016 and nanoparticles nps thomas and sandhyarani 2013 have been added into composites to increase specific surface area and intensify the photocatalytic performances however embedding photocatalysts in polymer films suffer from severe recombination of charge carriers due to the lack of excitation traps inside the composites to this end dye sensitisation can extend the visible absorption of tio2 and facilitate the separation of photoinduced excitations which can be applied to improve photodegradation efficiency shang et al 2003a zhao et al 2008 similarly composite photocatalysts such as polypyrrole tio2 li et al 2010 were designed to enhance the photo response on the other hand unmodified tio2 nps tend to agglomerate in the polymer matrix which will cause a negative impact on the degradation efficiency because of the rapid plastic whitening and decreased interface areas between plastics and catalysts liang et al 2013 the whitening phenomenon shortens the depth of light penetration and deteriorates photocatalysis therefore grafting nano tio2 that can disperse well in the low polarity solvent is another valid approach to further improve the photodegradation zan et al 2006b during the photocatalytic process tio2 reacts with h2o in the air to form oh to initiate plastic degradation and the absence of h2o in polymer matrix will significantly suppress the degradation therefore the addition of hydrophilic materials such as polyethylene oxide peo miyazaki and nakatani 2009 and polyacrylamide pam liang et al 2013 will adsorb the moisture and further improve the oxidation efficiency for peo it can be oxidised by tio2 to form acids and aldehydes which will facilitate the decomposition of hydroperoxide and then plastic degradation miyazaki and nakatani 2009 during plastics manufacture diverse additives such as plasticisers stabilisers and phenolic antioxidants will be added for some specific purposes however these compounds may consume oh radicals to suppress the photocatalytic degradation horikoshi et al 1998 a potential method to solve this problem is to find chemicals that not only can substitute these additives but also can be grafted on photocatalysts to enhance the decomposition performances for example hyperbranched poly ε caprolactone is a substitution for pvc plasticiser which can increase the flexibility and help disperse tio2 nps in the pvc matrix kim et al 2006 except for the strategies discussed above changing the operational parameters also affects the plastic deformation efficiency usually increasing the weight percentage of photocatalysts in the composites ali et al 2016 chakrabarti et al 2008 zan et al 2006a using high energy light sources ali et al 2016 zhao et al 2007 and oxygen rich environment zan et al 2006a zan et al 2006b will facilitate the degradation processes however the excessive loading of additive like carbon nanotubes cnts will attenuate the performance as a consequence of the light absorbing scattering properties of cnts lankone et al 2017 other photocatalysts were also developed to decompose plastics table 1 palladium nps can absorb visible light because of the localized surface plasmon resonance effect and are used to form nanocomposite film with ldpe olajire and mohammed 2019 in addition due to the higher quantum efficiency and catalytic activity of zno compared to tio2 a novel composite of zno and pvc was synthesised for polymer degradation chakrabarti et al 2008 despite the wide band gap of biocl nanodisk it is an ideal candidate owing to its good optical electrical and mechanical properties and has been used as a photocatalyst for ps degradation sarwan et al 2020 also goethite α feooh liu et al 2009 liu et al 2010 cryptomelane type manganese oxide oms 2 liu et al 2011 and cnts lankone et al 2017 have been applied as optional materials for pe degradation apart from preparing composite films spreading aqueous dispersion of photocatalysts on plastics can directly drive the degradation under real sunlight though it is less reported table 1 zro2 demonstrates a higher photocatalytic activity than tio2 due to its mesoporous structure greater redox ability and higher capability for stabilising oxygen vacancies bandara et al 2017 intriguingly a recent study reported that spreading 400 nm ps sphere solution on tio2 catalyst films achieved an excellent mineralisation 98 4 after 36 h this photodegradation was initiated by holes and ros such as oh and o2 produced from the tio2 photocatalyst nabi et al 2020 in addition polymer photocatalyst composites were also applied in the degradation of organic pollutants frazão et al 2019 utami et al 2019 yu et al 2007 and microorganism disinfection kiatkittipong et al 2020 in the aqueous environment the systems leverage the advantages of composites such as a low catalyst dosage and great reusability during long term operations highlighting the versatility of polymer photocatalyst composites however there are some limitations of this composite design for mps remediation although the polymer matrixes are stable the presence of photocatalysts in the polymer will accelerate collapse of the plastic framework the process will cause the release of the photocatalysts from the composites and pose potential risks to the environment on the other hand considering that the existed mps permeate every sector of the environment the solid phase degradation is not suitable to relieve the present environmental pressure however it provides a promising strategy for recycling the collected mps and slow down the future growth of mps via replacing conventional plastics with the photoactive composites but it only limits to low density polymers because dense mps tend to sink to the bottom of the water body where sun light cannot reach so far mps degradation in an aqueous environment is still limited it was found that pvc in tio2 aqueous dispersion is much less susceptible than under dry conditions horikoshi et al 1998 thus it calls for more efforts to optimise and enhance the performances of polymer catalyst composites for mps removal in the aqueous phase 4 2 1 2 aqueous photocatalysis photodegradation of plastics in the aqueous environment has been extensively studied hidaka et al 1996 tio2 and zno were firstly utilised as photocatalysts to degrade pvc and polyvinylidene chloride copolymer 95 pvc 5 pvlc hidaka et al 1996 zno exhibited a higher initial rate of dechlorination than tio2 but levelled off to a plateau shortly interestingly the addition of oxidising agents k2s2o8 or h2o2 promoted the dechlorination efficiency of tio2 but inhibited zno based dechlorination due to the severe catalyst dissolution during the photooxidation then in order to increase the surface to volume ratio zno nanorods were developed to degrade ldpe film residues and it reached 30 increase in the carbonyl index of ldpe after 175 h of oxidation under irradiation tofa et al 2019a to further improve the photodegradation performances pt nps were dispersed on zno nanorods zno pt to reduce recombination of electron hole pairs and enhance visible light absorption tofa et al 2019b after the photocatalytic process carbonyl hydroperoxide peroxides and unsaturated groups appeared on ldpe wrinkles cracks and cavities were also observed on the ldpe surface due to the formation of oxygenated groups and volatile organic compounds despite of the decades of exploration using photocatalysts to decompose polymer in the aqueous environment the degradation of mps is rarely investigated in water solution table 2 ariza tarazona et al 2019 firstly used protein based porous n tio2 as a photocatalyst to degrade hdpe mps extracted from facial scrub in both solid phase and aqueous environment hdpe mps were successfully degraded to a certain extent under both conditions while the degradation rate 6 4 was much faster in the aqueous medium than that in the solid state 1 85 the dehydration of the solid sample is the main reason for the lower efficiency because hydroxyl radicals are generated by water and the moisture is the driving force of plastic degradation thus humidity is essential for photocatalytic degradation of plastics however the degradation rate of photocatalysis is still not satisfactory ariza tarazona et al 2020 further synthesised c n co doped tio2 to study the impacts of operating variables for process optimisation compared with the reaction under high temperatures and at high ph plastic degradation was faster at ph 3 and 0 c this is because the fragmentation preferred to happen at 0 c which increased the surface to volume ratio and a higher concentration of h promoted plastic degradation and photocatalyst deagglomeration under this condition the weight loss of mps reached 71 77 1 88 after 50 h of irradiation unlike other strategies mps after photocatalysis presented a smooth surface with cracks and cavities the surface roughness reduced because the degradation primarily occurred at the surface of mps exposed to radical attack though the above photocatalysis can degrade mps to a certain degree the corresponding c revolution is less investigated the carbon elements in mps are presumed to ultimately evolve into co2 releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere thus it is desirable to develop a technology to transform the elements in plastics into valuable products to optimise the global carbon footprint and plastic recycling photoreforming pr is a low energy input and straightforward method which can transform an organic substrate into value added fuels using sustainable sunlight as the driving force under ambient temperature and pressure during the photoreforming process the target substrate will serve as an electron donor which will be oxidised and decomposed by the oxidative holes of the excited photocatalyst to produce other organic molecules the photogenerated electrons will be transferred from the photocatalyst to a cocatalyst and reduce water protons to h2 as shown in fig 7 kawai and sakata 1981 uekert et al 2019 a desirable photocatalyst is expected to possess a valance band higher enough to oxidise water or organic compounds as well as a conduction band suitable for h2 production kawai and sakata 1981 in this process oh plays an auxiliary role while the direct hole oxidation of the organic substrate by the photocatalyst is the primary process in pr uekert et al 2019 the first study on plastics photoreforming can be traced to 1981 when kawai and sakata 1981 used pt deposited tio2 tio2 pt to convert pe and pvc after 10 h of pr process 93 and 45 μmol h2 were obtained using pe and pvc as the corresponding substrates in 5 m naoh solution table 2 displays the studies of plastic debris or mps reforming in the aqueous environment and the unit is unified to μmolh2 gsub 1 for better comparison with other photocatalysts due to the use of an expensive pt cocatalyst and the dependence on uv irradiation high performance cds cdox quantum dots qds fig 7 a c uekert et al 2018 and nontoxic carbon nitride nickel phosphide cnx ni2p fig 7 d f uekert et al 2019 were synthesised to degrade mps cds cdox qds showed a higher activity than tio2 pt and cnx ni2p table 2 since cd is highly toxic the environmental friendly cnx ni2p was used to reform mps to a clean fuel h2 after 50 h of pr treatment cnx ni2p yielded 82 5 7 3 and 178 12 μmolh2 gsub 1 from pet and pla respectively amongst the diverse polymer substrates including pe pet pla pp ps pur and polystyrene block polybutadiene rubber pet pla and pur were discovered to generate the highest amounts of h2 this is ascribed to the presence of ester groups on the three plastics because they can be hydrolysed by koh into alcohols and acids which are favourable sacrificial agents to generate hydrogen an alkaline environment will increase h2 yield in the pr process by multiple folds as the solution ph increases a higher h2 generation rate will be achieved there are several possible reasons for the positive effects of mps pre treatment in alkaline solutions first the formation of ros i e oh will be easier via direct oxidation of oh kawai and sakata 1981 second a high concentration of oh can initiate the breakdown of the carbon chain and release monomers such as ethylene glycol terephthalate and lactate which are more favourable for photoreforming uekert et al 2019 especially to esters containing plastics such as pet and pla uekert et al 2019 uekert et al 2018 in addition if the undissolved polymer is removed after the pre treatment more photons can reach the quantum dot photocatalysts to improve efficiency uekert et al 2018 however considering the h2 conversions defined as the moles of detected h2 divided by the theoretical h2 yield the pr efficiency is still low less than 40 compared with direct gasification of plastics to h2 65 95 to enhance the applicability efficacy conversion rate and selectivity of the pr catalysts should be further improved uekert et al 2019 the carbon elements in mps can be transformed to c2 fuels by photocatalysis under simulated natural conditions jiao et al 2020 synthesised nb2o5 atomic layers which attained 100 photodegradation of pe pp and pvc in 40 60 and 90 h respectively fig 8 a b additionally the generated co2 was in situ reduced to ch3cooh this process can be separated into 2 steps in fig 8 c d 1 c c bond cleavage process plastics were oxidised and mineralised into co2 by o2 and ros oh generated from the valence band of nb2o5 2 c c coupling process the generated co2 was catalytically reduced by the photoinduced electrons from the conduction band of nb2o5 into ch3cooh via the coupling of cooh intermediates meanwhile the other half reaction was water oxidation into o2 by the holes furthermore plastics from disposable food containers single use bags and food wrap films can be also photoconverted to ch3cooh however it was pointed out that the yield of c2 fuels was relatively low less than 1 5 mg gcat after 30 h so two component photocatalysts are recommended to respectively optimise the c c bond cleavage and coupling processes jiao et al 2020 solid based photocatalyst polymer composites are capable of degrading plastics with light only but it usually cost several hundred hours to achieve satisfying results also it cannot deal with the mps in the aqueous environment dispersing photocatalysts in water environment can remove mps in places of oceans and freshwaters but the oxidation products are mainly co2 and h2o which cannot be directly reused as fuels and may worse the greenhouse effect thus photoreforming was proposed to convert mps into valuable products in recent outcomes the carbon in mps was successfully converted to c2 fuels and the monomers from hydrolysis can act as a sacrificial agent to produce h2 fuel however a novel system that can simultaneously convert carbon and hydrogen into valuable fuels is not existed thus future research on photocatalysis should pay more attention on mps conversion and fuels regeneration 4 2 2 fenton fenton like systems fenton fenton like processes using peroxides e g h2o2 pms or pds demonstrate extraordinary capacities to decompose persistent organic pollutants in aqueous environments particularly fenton systems have been used to recover specific polymers from wastes wang and wang 2017 wang et al 2017 in recent years aops technologies have been applied in mps remediation table 2 thanks to the high redox potentials of the produced hydroxyl radicals oh e 0 2 7 v vs normal hydrogen electrode nhe and sulphate radicals so4 e 0 3 1 v vs nhe liu et al 2019b investigated the accelerated ageing behaviours of ps and hdpe mps induced by fenton and heat activated pds treatments mps were exposed to fenton treatment fe2 h2o2 and heat activated k2s2o8 pds at 70 c and the size distributions of the pristine and treated mps were analysed by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and displayed in fig 9 before the aops treatment the dominant size range of ps and pe was between 40 50 μm after 30 days of pds treatments almost all the mps were smaller than 30 μm and 80 1 and 97 4 were 20 μm for ps and pe respectively the phenomenon of the fenton systems was similar but mps presented less fragmentation compared with pe though ps showed less size reduction after 30 day oxidation the required initial induction time for oxidation is shorter the different responses to oxidation was due to their distinct molecular structures and tensile strengths the changes of the plastic moieties in the oxidative systems were similar to those experienced in simulated natural processes indicating that aops treatment would help understand the mps weathering behaviours in addition the increased alteration degree will enhance the adsorption capacities of mps toward ciprofloxacin due to reduced size and raised o c ratio indicating that aops are capable of degrading mps but it may increase the toxicity of mps due to the increased adsorption capacities liu et al 2019b however such a low temperature aops treatment typically requires long time to cause the decay of mps in this regard increasing the reaction temperature and using a catalyst will remarkably boost the generation of ros and oxidation kinetics of mps to enhance the performances of aops systems kang et al 2019 synthesised a magnetic spring like carbon nanotube with embedded manganese nps mn ncnt fig 10 a b the carbon composites were used as novel catalysts to drive pms activation for the degradation of cosmetic mps obtained from facial cleansers the catalytic aops system was coupled with hydrothermal hydrolysis to intensify the mps decomposition under optimal conditions the mps removal efficiency reached 54 in weight loss after 8 hour treatment at 160 c fig 10 c in this system the hydrothermal condition plays a critical role in this system because it not only provides simultaneous high pressure and physical tearing to polyethylene chains to decrease the crystal degree but also intensify both catalytic and heat based pms activations to further improve the degradation efficiency the structural integrity and chemical stability are pivotal for catalyst design in hydrothermal aops systems because the high temperature and oxidative environment will cause severe metal leaching of conventional metal based catalysts as the degradation proceeded noticeable cracks appeared on the mps surface then mps was fused and re fabricated into films and eventually numerous pores appeared on the surface fig 11 a d the polymer was sheared into shorter carbon chains which were attacked by ros and then further broken into smaller molecules after the aops treatment the peaks of c o c o and o h groups were remarkably intensified in the ftir spectra of the treated samples revealing the surface oxidation process fig 11 e f in the meantime organics including alkanes alkenes alcohols aldehydes ketones lactones mono dicarboxylic acids ketoacids and esters were detected in the filtrate by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms table 3 the first increased and then declined contents of total organic carbon during the oxidation suggest that organic intermediates are produced and then partially mineralised to co2 and inorganic salts the intermediates from mps degradation have been proved to be environmentally benign and can be leveraged as carbon sources for the growth of green algae chlorella vulgaris therefore the outcomes demonstrate that the mn ncnt pms system can effectively degrade mps into nontoxic intermediates which can be further utilised by microorganism to achieve a sustainable carbon cycle and reduce the greenhouse gases emissions during mps remediation miao et al 2020 developed an electro fenton like system using tio2 graphite tio2 c as an effective cathode for pvc oxidation the dechlorination efficiency and weight loss were used to evaluate the performances of the system under optical conditions 75 of dechlorination efficiency and 56 of weight loss were achieved after 6 h of electrolysis at 100 c at 0 7 v vs ag agcl fig 12 during the treatment high temperature firstly decreased the flexural and tensile modulus and the mechanical strength of mps which rendered the subsequent attack by oh and carbon chain rupture to further expose the chloride then the dichlorination reaction occurred due to the applied cathodic potential during this process hydroxyl radicals have two functions 1 causing oxidation of organics to have oxygen groups such as o h and c o on mps 2 shedding organic intermediates from mps into solution the exfoliated hydrocarbon species were vulnerable and would be further oxidised by oh after the reaction depressions and large holes appeared and the smooth surface of pvc was destroyed entirely exposing internal pvc mps by combining the characterisations of ftir uv vis spectra and xps oxygen groups o h cooh and c c were found to form after the treatment while the amount of c h and c cl declined as the oxidation proceeded these changes in the surface structure indicate that the oxidation and dechlorination occurred simultaneously on pvc based mps which was ascribed to the backbone rupture by oh attack the backbone breakage was also evidenced by the molecular weight reduction from 46 260 to 28 470 after the electro fenton like oxidation some organics with up to 10 short chain such as alcohols alkenes monocarboxylic acids dicarboxylic acids and esters were detected formic acid acetic acid propionic acid and oxalic acid were the major carboxylic acids and oxalic acid was the most accumulative product the intermediates generated in the hydroxyl radical or sulphate radical based aops systems are listed in table 3 as the molecular mass decreased the carbon chains became shorter and oxygen content accordingly increased it is necessary to note that not all of these compounds were generated by oxidation compounds with conjugated benzene ring structures including bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate benzyl butyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate are the plasticisers used in plastics production which will be released during the oxidation and may cause harm to biota the incorrect classification of these compounds in intermediates will cause misunderstanding of degradation pathways nonetheless the existing aops techniques are efficient for mps degradation some drawbacks need to be pointed out and tackled in the future for hydrothermal coupled aops systems high temperature plays a critical role in changing the physical properties of mps to a more vulnerable state and simultaneously enhancing the generation of ros via thermal activation and boosted kinetics in heterogeneous catalysis however considering its feasibility in water treatment and the cost reducing the effective reaction temperature should be one of the main objectives in future aops research when assessing the efficiency of mps degradation several measurements could be used including mass loss co2 detection carbonyl index ci and dechlorination efficiency mass loss is the most frequently used method in the evaluation of degradation efficiency for various kinds of mps which provides intuitive results for the comparisons of different plastic materials and catalytic systems however the weight loss cannot accurately reflect the evolution of chemistry structure of mps and mineralisation rate of the intermediates also this method is not appropriate to evaluate mps biodegradation according to astm standards astm 2012 astm 2017 instead co2 evolution rate can be applied to assess biodegradation for abiotic degradation co2 evolution can reflect the mineralisation rate but the method has the limitation in assessing the deterioration of mps crystal structure and surface chemistry ci index is a handy indicator to evaluate pe degradation if the degradation is in its early steps formation of hydroxides or the degradation leads to complete mineralisation producing h2o and co2 then it does not take into account ariza tarazona et al 2020 in terms of measuring the dechlorination efficiency it is an efficient and fast method to assess the degradation degree but this method is only limited to cl containing plastics the results are typically one sided and cannot illustrate if c c bonds are ruptured and oxidised therefore it is necessary to combine different approaches to comprehensively evaluate the performances in mps degradation for future aops studies 4 3 thermal treatment in the past thermal treatment has been used to upgrade general wastes because the approach can preserve landfill space as well as relieve sanitary problems due to waste putrescence lombardi et al 2015 nowadays an additional merit of thermal treatment is energy recovery lombardi et al 2015 in this regard plastics due to its high calorific value and enormous production is a promising source of high density carbon and hydrogen elements for fuel production current techniques of converting plastics into fuels include pyrolysis gasification cracking in refinery units liquefaction and integrated methods e g pyrolysis and reforming fig 13 a which have been discussed in several reviews lopez et al 2018 lopez et al 2017 nanda and berruti 2021 panda et al 2010 wong et al 2015 in addition it has been reported that the carbons in plastic wastes can be reformed to valued added nanomaterials e g carbon nanotubes which are of extraordinary physical and chemical properties and can fulfil different applications bazargan and mckay 2012 in recent years thermal treatments have been applied for mps conversion tavares et al 2018 applied co gasification of pet based mps and biomass in a temperature range of 400 1200 c under different gasification agents air o2 and steam it was discovered that a composition of 90 pet 10 biomass is favourable to obtain higher hydrogen yields 63 66 in h2 molar fraction contents while the combination of 50 pet 50 biomass achieves a high lower heating value lhv of 9 2 mj nm3 thus for different syngas utilisation the compositions and ratios of the feedstocks as well as experimental conditions should be optimised except for co gasification thermal pyrolysis was also applied to transform mps into small molecule and value added products in order to explore the impact of pressure on fuel quality high pressure ldpe pyrolysis was conducted to investigate the influence of pressure on product distribution and the transformation mechanisms cheng et al 2020 high pressure conditions make the compositions of the liquid products closer to fuels e g gasoline with aromatics and isoparaffins also the products contain more cycloalkanes and fewer olefins recently jie et al 2020 devised a one step process to reduce the energy input to decompose polymers and enhance h2 yield using a microwave initiated solid solid catalytic reaction in this system mps were mixed with fealox as the catalyst and microwave susceptor and then the mixture was simply subjected to microwave treatment after a few minutes of treatment a high h2 yield was achieved at 55 6 mmol g 1 plastic and over 97 of the theoretical mass of h2 was obtained from the deconstructed plastic fig 14 b d in the meantime carbon yields of hdpe pp and ps attained around 70 60 and 80 wt in the catalytic system respectively the carbon products were primarily multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnts fig 14 d e during the microwave reactions because plastics are transparent to microwave heat was selectively generated on the catalyst and subsequently transferred to the plastics which facilitated mass transfer between the catalyst and plastic and then desorption of neutral hydrogen such a system is not similar to a conventional heating process which has a lower h2 yield and limited mass transfer rate of molecular desorption fig 14 c the transparency of plastics for microwave penetration also reduces side reactions of plastic self decomposition promoting the full decomposition to h2 in terms of carbon it was proposed that carbon species diffused to and reacted with the surface of fealox to form fe3c which then served as the catalyst to drive bottom up production of mwcnts jie et al 2020 the investigations as mentioned above mainly focused on the solid state deconstruction of mps and recent studies also investigated the direct decomposition of mps in the aquatic environment hydrothermal carbonization htc was firstly used to treat mps in seawater environment at 200 300 c for 3 h as temperature raised the produced hydrochar contained lower contents of inorganic anions and a higher net calorific value ncv iñiguez et al 2019 instead of decomposing mps this technique is to generate value added hydrochar that can be used as a future fuel subsequently different types of mps were used as the feedstock to proceed gasification in seawater at 500 800 c it was discovered that raising the reaction temperature prolonging the gasification time reducing the loading of mps feedstock as well as the presence of alkali metal salts promoted the treatment efficiency for all the plastics with optimised conditions the plastic carbon conversion efficiency reached 97 0 59 1 98 and 79 86 wt for abs bai et al 2019 pc bai et al 2020a pet bai et al 2020b and pp bai et al 2020c respectively though the compounds of gas and liquid products are similar among these plastics the distribution can be very different as displayed in fig 14 pp had a lower carbon conversion rate and the produced gases were mostly composed of h2 and ch4 in contrast gaseous products from other plastics contained a considerable amount of co2 the behaviour of liquid intermediates can be different for example polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs produced from pp gasification are prone to poly condensed to char instead of being further gasified into gaseous products bai et al 2020c so far thermal based treatment of mps and upgrade are still in infancy one of the main issues lies in the quality of the derived fuels which are also influenced by the selection of a proper catalyst in addition to the mps compositions and operational conditions additionally a desirable product yield was achieved in the lab scale converting mps into fuels and functional carbons in a large scale is still challenging for industrial applications another issue is that the impacts of co existing impurities and complex plastics are still unclear and need to be further investigated for solid state reactions the newly developed microwave process demonstrates its advantages in selective h2 production and mwcnts formation with high efficiency and c h utilisation while the catalyst plastic ratio is relatively high and should be optimised for upscale implementation in the future in the aquatic remediation of mps increasing the selectivity of fuel products and lowering reaction temperature will be the primary goals in future research 4 4 mps removal in waste water treatment plants wwtps wwtps were not initially and explicitly designed for mps removal but every treatment stage in wwtps can remove a certain amount of mps sun et al 2019 recently summarised the mps removal ratios in wwtps from different countries and provided estimated removal efficiency of each treatment stage fig 15 the whole wwtps processes are divided into three phases as preliminary primary secondary and tertiary treatments in preliminary and primary treatments 35 59 and 50 98 of mps are removed respectively during the processes air flotation impels contaminants especially low density mps to float on the surface to facilitate mechanical skimming subsequent sedimentation process helps trap high density mps in solid flocs during grit removal and sedimentation for further sludge treatment ngo et al 2019 this process is significantly influenced by the density lower density mps e g pa pp and pe prefer to float while high density mps e g pet and pes are more likely to appear in the sediment ngo et al 2019 the secondary stage is capable of further removing mps by 0 2 14 via biological treatment and clarification the sludge flocs and bacterial extracellular polymers facilitatethe accumulation and sinking of mps in the clarification tank during which larger mps will be removed sun et al 2019 subsequently tertiary treatment further reduces the existence of mps to 0 2 2 by various techniques talvitie et al 2017 compared the performances of a variety of tertiary treatment processes including rapid sand filter dissolved air floatation membrane bioreactor mbr and discfilter and concluded that mbr has the highest removal efficiency 99 9 mbr is also the most promising technique compared with other membrane processes including ultrafiltration uf dynamic membrane technology dm and reverse osmosis ro poerio et al 2019 concerns were raised regarding the impacts of mps on biological treatment due to the harmful effect of mps on aquatic bacteria it was discovered that mps such as pet pvc pe and ps could cause a series of negative impacts on the aerobic and anaerobic processes such as hydrolysis acidification ch4 and h2 production and digestion of waste activated sludge wei et al 2019 wei et al 2020b zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b the presence of mps will introduce toxic oxidative stress and introduce various toxic substances such as antibiotics additives persistent organic pollutants pops and heavy metals which inhibit enzymes or reduce cell viability zhang et al 2020c experiments were carried out to test the impacts of mps on the performances of nitrogen and phosphorus removal by ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob denitrifiers and polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos while the impacts were negligible liu et al 2019a thus even the same type of mps is introduced into wwtps it would lead to varied effects upon different processes of biological treatment this calls for a comprehensive assessment of mps implications on the efficiency of typical biological treatment in wwtps in the tertiary treatments researchers also investigated the influence of mps on processes such as coagulation mbr uf ro and flocculation for example the removal of organic matters and ammonia in a mbr system was inhibited with the presence of pvc mps due to membrane fouling li et al 2020b similarly irregular mps can wear the membrane in uf and ro processes zhang and chen 2020 in addition in the coagulation process mps will reduce the amount of effective flocculant because the negatively charged mps will interact with salt flocculants perren et al 2018 zhang and chen 2020 a comprehensive review on the effects of mps on each segment of wwtps was conducted by zhang and chen 2020 nevertheless wwtps attain a high retention efficiency of mps 90 there are still significant amounts of mps being released from wwtps into the treated effluents every day for example approximately 1 107 mps were discharged daily in final effluent from a wwtp with a mps retention capacity of 98 3 lares et al 2018 besides none of the aforementioned treatment processes are originally designed for mps removal thus new strategies have been proposed to address the problem for instance beljanski et al 2016 developed a filtration and backflushing system for mps removal sun et al 2019 also proposed to optimise the operating parameters of current treatment processes such as hydraulic retention time in the skimming and sedimentation processes masiá et al 2020 suggested that bioremediation is a promising strategy considering that higher eukaryotes such as seagrasses and macrophytes may have the competence to reduce mps in wwtps other strategies such as electrocoagulation and magnetic extraction are also discussed in a review by shen et al 2020 however feasible techniques have yet been developed aiming at mps removal in full scale wwtps which may be the directions for future research 4 5 other mps removal strategies except the microbial and radical based mps conversion approaches as discussed above some novel strategies have also been developed for mps removal tiwari et al 2020 synthesised zn al layered double hydroxide ldh to achieve a fast removal of ps based mps in deionised water and synthetic freshwater with the maximum sorption capacities of 164 49 and 162 62 mg g respectively chen et al 2020 developed a zirconium metal organic framework mofs coated melamine foam to filtrate mps dispersion after three consecutive filtrations the system achieved a high mps removal efficiency of 95 5 1 2 the success was attributed to the significant difference of zeta potentials between the composites foam and mps to enhance the electrostatic interactions and ultimately adsorptive removal another physical method was proposed by wang et al 2019 using photocatalytic au ni tio2 micromotors for the mps elimination two strategies were developed 1 individual micromotor removes mps by phoretic interaction and 2 the chained assemblies with multiple micromotors remove mps via shovelling or pushing interactions similarly fe2o3 mno2 micromotors were synthesised by ye et al 2021 and could effectively remove more than 10 of the suspended mps in 2 h via the synergy of catalytic degradation surface adsorption and adsorptive bubbles separation mechanisms in addition ruthenium pincer was used as a catalyst to drive a hydrogenative depolymerisation process for decomposition of polyamide powder at 150 c and 70 bar h2 kumar et al 2020a intriguingly the monomers obtained from hydrogenation process can be dehydrogenated and converted back to poly oligo amide with a similar molecular weight to the original polyamide such a process completed a closed loop for the recycling of polyamides 5 methods and governments policies to prevent mps release due to the widespread and potential hazards of mps in the environment policies have been enacted to reduce the sources of mps so far in the united states the act microbead free waters act of 2015 was signed to ban the intentionally added plastic microbeads in rinse off cosmetics such as toothpaste similarly new zealand republic of korea uk and some eu member states such as belgium france ireland italy and sweden have banned rinse off cosmetic products from the market echa 2019 however except cosmetic products releasing 3800 tonnes of mps annually in europe a high level of mps in agricultural and horticulture fertilisers have been released 23 500 tonnes per year echa 2019 the annual release of mps is estimated to reach 176 300 71 800 280 600 tonnes in europe while only around 36 000 tonnes are primary mps echa 2019 the above regulations are specifically aiming at primary mps especially microbeads from personal care products and annexe policies on the secondary mps should be put on future agenda burns and boxall 2018 researchers and governments should make a concerted effort to trace the sources of secondary mps and enact corresponding regulations to prohibit the use and spread in addition to minimising intentional mps usage in cosmetics other control strategies have been proposed such as increasing recycling rates monitoring and preventing marine litters and mps from possible ocean sources e g fisheries off shore installation and shipping unep 2017 restricting the use of oxo plastics that will fragment into mps rapidly european commission 2018 limiting the consumption of single use plastic products and substituting them with alternative materials echa 2019 and developing feasible methods to specifically filter mps in water treatment plants european commission 2019 currently the lack of policies in reducing secondary mps and other potential primary mps calls for more comprehensive research on the source detection transport and impacts of mps on the environment the information will remind the policymakers on the major sources of mps and their greater risks the scientific underpinning is useful to effectively legislate and implement prevention orientated policies however despite that the relevant law or plans have been enacted in many countries it is still challenging for developing countries to build up infrastructures to reduce mps uses and discharge free et al 2014 thus governments should seek cooperation to reduce mps based pollution and meanwhile encourage research on developing efficient and economic technologies for mps removal in wwtps 6 perspectives 6 1 mps in the aqueous environment so far microplastics have been widely inspected across different disciplines but the existing surveys are imbalanced for example investigations on the mps distributions in marine and freshwater are more comprehensive and outnumber that in other environmental compartments this may result in the cognitive bias on the existence of mps and finally influence the process of policy development thus the fate and abundance of mps in other environments especially in air and drinking water are investigated the least which contribute to the highest human intake similarly for obtaining a deeper and broader understanding of mps impacts the following research directions should be focused which can ultimately serve to resolve some unanswered questions that matter to the environment and policymakers 1 in recent studies photodegraded mps in the aqueous environment have been found to have toxic effects on biota due to the generation of persistent free radicals on the plastic surface these aged mps during photodegradation have become emerging contaminants with underestimated hazards to the environment wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 the toxicities of mps can be the combined effect of several factors such as epfrs additives and adsorbed toxic compounds so the individual factor to the overall toxicity still needs investigation also the knowledge gap of potential hazards of the mps based persistent radicals after ingestion needs to be filled 2 researchers should be aware of the water soluble polymers alongside mps and nps due to their high potentials to release into the environment and unclear environmental impacts though they are not classified as mps they are synthetic polymers similar to mps and may cause unexpected and detrimental effects huppertsberg et al 2020 3 difficulty in tracking the specific source of mps is due to the property changes of the plastics during the long period usage transport as well as the complex interactions with the environment via bio and chemical processes after a long period of ageing in the natural environment the physical and chemical properties of the plastics may be enormously changed and impede the sourcing process thus the research on the detection and the existence of mps should include the mps types sizes and shapes which can provide clues in source tracking analytical verification characterisation with appropriate quality assurance quality control qa qc is also required in future analysis lowry et al 2020 in the meantime the standards of the definition and classification of mps shapes should be established as different studies may have other descriptions to the same debris making results incomparable 4 a potential way to reduce the production of mps is using chemically recyclable plastics which can be recovered to building block chemicals through depolymerisation and synthesis to virgin quality plastics or value added materials namely chemolysis tang and chen 2019 however more research and effort should be dedicated to this area the main problem is that this process still could not typically recover building block chemicals and the degraded chemicals are of potential to cause unexpected environmental consequences other issues can be high energy costs low selectivity and trade offs between the properties and ability of polymers to be depolymerised which needs to be tackled tang and chen 2019 6 2 mps degradation removal although mps were firstly reported in 2004 methods to specifically transfer degrade or remove mps have yet extensively studied by now most of strategies to remediate plastics are based on biodegradation not until recently aops based techniques emerge as effective methods in mps deformation and remediation but the relevant research is still in the early stage and needs further development in order to develop appropriate mps control and purification strategies and increase the applicability several aspects should be considered for future study 1 even though solid phase photocatalysis is not originally designed for mps deterioration its ability to degrade polymers renders it a promising technique in mps ageing and transformation benefited from previous extensive research in photocatalysts design highly efficient photocatalytic systems for mps purification can be expected in addition the degradation efficiency carried out in water should be assessed in the meanwhile considering that plastics photocatalyst hybrids may be the potential mps sources in aquatic environment for photoreforming in water it is effective in degrading mps and capable to produce h2 or c2 fuels however the carbon hydrogen conversion efficiency and product selectivity still call for further improvements and rational design of photocatalysts and optimal operating parameters will be the keys to upgrading the system 2 the degradation processes need to be conducted in less extreme conditions for instance high temperature or strong alkaline solution is preferred in some aops processes but the high energy input and corrosive effect on the reactor hinder them from practical applications in addition since some fenton fenton like systems have been proved to be feasible in mps decomposition other aops systems such as ozonation sonication and integrated approaches with thermal photocatalysis and other peroxides should be examined to develop green facile and more powerful systems compared to developing new methods and equipment for particularly removing mps improving and optimising the existing water treatment techniques in wwtps may provide a more economic option to prevent mps release 3 there are various approaches to determine and evaluate the degradation efficiency of mps however each of them has its own advantages and drawbacks to obtain more reliable outcomes it is recommended to combine different assessment methods or propose other feasible approaches 4 the applicability of a specific remediation technique to different types of plastics should be tested and provided different polymers have demonstrated different resistances to natural degradation knowing the feasibility of a specific technique to different plastics is conducive to rational design improvement and application of the system besides the effects and consequences of plastic additives e g antioxidant are still less explored in the current studies plastics in real life were mixed with various additives during manufacture for versatile purposes most of current studies on mps only focus on the plastic itself the effects of additives on the purification processes and the potential impacts toxicity should be investigated such understanding will provide useful information for the wise selection and use of additives in plastic industry in the meantime there is a lack of research using environmentally aged mps when mps are exposed in natural environment chemicals such as pops will adsorb on mps surface and hinders the mps degradation however the ageing process due to uv irradiation may promote the efficiency proper evaluation of these factors in mps degradation processes needs to be carried out in future studies although various remediation methods were proved effective the production of nps during this process has not been investigated this knowledge gap needs to be filled 5 the carbon and hydrogen conversion reutilization efficiency should be assessed in future studies some approaches convert plastics into value added products such as carbon nanotubes ch4 and h2 thus the evaluation of h c reutilisation efficiency of plastics will indicatethe applicability economic potential and estimated carbon emission of the technologies 6 the various emerging plastics degradation strategies should be placed on the top of agenda for reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions from end of life eol processes the eol stage occupied 9 of total life cycle emissions of all the plastics in 2015 and incineration was the dominant source of ghg emissions among eol processes zheng and suh 2019 in order to mitigate ghg emissions growth in the next few decades one of the most effective strategies is decarbonising the energy mix of the plastics supply chain reaching 100 renewables in this case incineration will become the greatest contributor to the total emissions for bioplastics zheng and suh 2019 thus replacing incineration with low ghg or ghg free strategies is imperative also aops techniques will emit small amount of co2 during mineralisation of mps or produce h2 as fuel during photodegradation are a promising candidate for eol process by answering the above questions a clearer vision of mps impacts will be obtained so that the risks of mps can be accurately assessed and appropriate regulatory actions can be formulated by policymakers it is encouraged to keep exploring the existing approaches and design product orientated systems for example it is promising to design systems to modulate the degradation products into pure h2 or syngas for industrial usage and value added carbonaceous products preventing the formation of co2 helps mediate the ghg emissions in addition cost evaluation including energy input should be conducted to assess the practicability of the system so that the policymakers can carry it out further unlike soluble pollutants mps are solid contaminants how to increase the contact area between the catalysts and mps and increase the mass transfer for efficient reaction is still a challenge so far many existed systems are based on extreme conditions such as high temperature so the designed catalysts are required to have high stability and reusability for instance materials with carbonaceous matrix are ideal catalysts but researchers should consider if such highly stable materials are environmental friendly when released to the environment recently it was reported that by combining appropriate initiatives plastics recycling rates can achieve over 55 where 75 90 was recycled in a closed loop eriksen et al 2020 therefore in the future a green mps treatment technology with a low cost is expected to deal with the discarded plastics by converting them into valuable products for future usage to achieve carbon and hydrogen cycles between plastics and fuels 7 conclusion currently most mps research works focus on the properties impacts detection and distribution of mps while studies on mps degradation and conversion are emerging but still limited in this review the types of mps and sampling methods are briefly introduced this review focuses on the current progress in the existing and emerging mps remediation transformation approaches the features and limitations of each technology are discussed highly efficient approaches 10 hours such as fenton fenton like systems and thermal treatment usually require high chemical and energy inputs biodegradation and photocatalysis can degrade mps in a green manner but they need relatively long time to realize satisfactory remediation photocatalytic and thermal treatments can convert mps into value added products chemicals fuels and nanocarbons and the products of biodegradation and fenton fenton like processes can serve as nutrients for microorganism utilization to fix carbon and minimize carbon emissions wwtps with tertiary treatments can effectively remove mps during multi processes but the impacts of mps on the facilities and removal efficiency are still unclear a better understanding of mps as well as the remediation options and precautionary operations is important as million tons of plastics are being released to and accumulating in the aquatic environment annually declaration of competing
