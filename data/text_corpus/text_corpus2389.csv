material properties which directly improved their adsorption performance toward both anionic and cationic dyes graphical abstract image 1 keywords dyes adsorption oil palm empty fruit bunches silylation surface modification wastewater treatment 1 introduction textile and leather industries are mainly responsible for the water pollution caused by the dyeing process in which approximately 84 000 tons of dyes were gone in water and possibly become a foremost menace to the environment routoula and patwardhan 2020 sharma and kandasubramanian 2020 dyes used in industry are mostly aromatic compounds that have a complex and stable structure causing difficulty to remove in aqueous media thiazine i e methylene blue is also known as a metachromatic cationic dye and sulfonate based i e procion red classified as an aromatic azo anionic dye dyes are commonly employed in the dying process which imposes such severe threatening disease and harms an aesthetic environment even at a small concentration almeida and corso 2014 hariani et al 2018 rafatullah et al 2010 rethinasabapathy et al 2018 therefore the treatment of wastewater containing those dyes is necessarily performed nowadays many efforts have been carried out to treat wastewater containing dyes such as photocatalytic degradation lenzi et al 2016 biological degradations van der zee et al 2003 ozonation muniyasamy et al 2019 2020 coagulation flocculation beluci et al 2019 gadekar and ahammed 2016 electrochemical oxidation cotillas et al 2018 and adsorption in most cases however some approaches are quite expensive consuming high energy and requiring complicated protocols additionally decomposition of dyes molecules viz an aromatic azo dye produces highly toxic counterparts like aromatic amines creating new issues that need to be solved hariani et al 2018 van der zee et al 2003 apart from its effectiveness on removing dyes in aqueous media the adsorption strategy offers many advantages for industrial scales such as cost benefit rapid and straightforward protocol the adsorbed dyes can be recollected via desorption and so forth guo et al 2018 kandisa and saibaba kv 2016 ozdemir et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 nevertheless it should be taken into account that the source or kind of adsorbents plays a vital role in the adsorption performance of dyes in this regard selecting a proper highly potential and cost beneficial adsorbent is mandatory to study a tremendous amount of research has been devoted to developing high performance bio based adsorbents for effectively treating effluents containing dyes bulgariu et al 2019 li et al 2019 shamsollahi and partovinia 2019 ummartyotin and pechyen 2016 polysaccharides were quietly employed as bio based adsorbent and there were many efforts focused on improving their adsorption capacity for accommodating a high concentration of dyes entrapped within the adsorbent for example microcrystalline cellulose mcc was transformed into cellulose nanocrystals cnc through a simple acid hydrolysis method and was further composited with cr oh 3 the cnc cr oh 3 nanocomposites demonstrated a high adsorption capacity toward methylene blue cationic dye up to 204 mg g 1 nekouei et al 2017 removal of cationic dyes by cellulose obtained from filter paper was achieved and its performance was elevated after modified with diatomite and functionalized by maleic anhydrides li et al 2014 in another investigation the dye adsorption capacity of cellulose also can be improved through modification with carbonylation and micro fibrillation of cellulose li et al 2018 cellulose extracted from oil pam fronds also showed excellent performance on adsorption of methylene blue with maximum adsorption capacity up to 51 811 mg g 1 hussin et al 2016 although cellulose based adsorbent demonstrated compatibility to adsorb cationic dyes this material unfortunately suffer to eliminate anionic dyes in aqueous solution mohadi et al proved that microalgae obtained a low adsorption capacity on adsorption of procion red mohadi et al 2017 nazifa et al also reported the same result even though the cellulose was carbonized in order to improve the surface area and porosity maximum adsorption capacity qm 2 86 mg g 1 nazifa et al 2018 it is thus critically important to modify the cellulose based adsorbent for the removal of anionic dye purpose toward this target zheng et al oriented polyaniline on the surface of kapok fiber and demonstrated a good result on adsorption of sulfonated based dyes zheng et al 2012 in another investigation the surface functionalization of the fiber by an amine based compound improved compatibility of the adsorbent to adsorb anionic dye zhao et al 2020 the cellulose is the most abundant polymer in nature contained in all agro waste products despite of being burned or naturally degraded it will be better to utilize the waste containing cellulose for improving its economic value the cellulose extracted from agro waste material could be used as a low cost adsorbent utilization of polysaccharide waste materials as bio sorbent has been attracted considerable attention due to its readiness inexpensive and support environmentally and sustainable technology basu et al 2019 saputra et al 2020 oil palm empty fruit bunches opefb are agriculture solid waste that easily found in indonesia despite their abundance the utilization of this solid waste is still limited these wastes are potentially transformed into valuable materials due to their high lignocellulose content pujiasih et al 2018 therefore opefb solid wastes were highlighted in this research by extracting valuable cellulose materials and were used as an adsorbent for removal dyes in aqueous media furthermore surface engineering of cellulose extracted from opefb has been performed to achieve our goal developing an adsorbent that works on both cationic and anionic dyes to do so the silylation technique was introduced in this regard this technique has been established as a simple platform to functionalize and to engineer the surface of materials herrera et al 2005 saputra et al 2020 since cellulose based adsorbent lacks on adsorbing anionic dyes the use of an amine based silylating agent is the best choice to overcome this issue as a result the silylated cellulose had extremely performance on adsorption of both cationic and anionic dyes 2 experimental 2 1 materials chopped opefb fibers 4 mm length were obtained from chemistry division indonesian institute of science 3 glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane gptms cas 2530 83 8 98 was purchased from sigma aldrich ethylenediamine 1 2 diaminoethane cas 107 15 3 sodium hydroxide naoh cas 1310 73 2 sulfuric acid h2so4 cas 7664 93 9 98 and ethanol absolute were supplied by merck sodium hypochlorite naocl 12 methylene blue and procion red were technical grade and readily available from bratako chemica corp surakarta indonesia 2 2 pretreatment and silylation of oil palm empty fruit bunches the opefb fibers are lignocellulose containing lignin hemicellulose and cellulose to obtain high crystalline of cellulose both lignin and hemicellulose should be removed as shown in scheme 1 there are three steps involved to treat the opefb namely alkalization bleaching and acid hydrolysis the alkalization and bleaching process aimed to remove the lignin content the hemicellulose and amorphous part of cellulose were eliminated by acid hydrolysis producing high crystalline cellulose that called pretreated opefb topefb further the topefb was silylated by amine based organosilane synthesized via the aminolysis of gptms chemically the reaction between gptms and 1 2 diaminoethane is facilitated by opening ring reaction in which the amines act as nucleophilic and attacks the oxirene ring acocella et al 2016 bakhtin et al 2020 bespalko and shved 2019 the silylation was performed in a water ethanol medium to facilitate the hydrolysis and condensation of silanes groups onto the surface of topefb wang et al 2015 as a result the surface of topefb was covered by amine based organosilane forming siloxane networks that were evaluated in this study treatments of opefb including alkalization bleaching and acid hydrolysis followed our previous work procedure pujiasih et al 2018 briefly about 100 g of opefb fiber was immersed in a 17 5 naoh solution overnight at room temperature the alkalized opefb was rinsed with distilled water several times and then transferred into acidified naocl solution the bleaching process was taken for 2 h at 80 c and repeated three times afterward the bleached opefb was hydrolyzed in 45 sulphuric acid for 45 min at 45 c with opefb to h2so4 ratio of 1 20 g ml 1 the pretreated opefb denoted as topefb was neutralized by washing several times using distilled water and collected using centrifugation the amine based organosilane compound was prepared by reacting 3 glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane 0 236 g with 1 2 diaminoethane 0 180 g at room temperature for 1 h then it was transferred into 1 g topefb in 20 ml of water ethanol mixture solution and ultrasonically treated for 30 min the reaction was maintained for 24 h at 70 c the silylated topefb so called s opefb was washed using ethanol and distilled water then dried using a freeze drying machine 2 3 material characterization the materials were further characterized using some instruments ftir fourier transform infra red characterization was used to identify the functional group of each material the sample was recorded using ftir model ir prestige 21 shimadzu scanned in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 number of scan 40 times with resolution of 2 cm 1 the xrd pattern of each sample was recorded using xrd x ray diffraction model shimadzu xrd lab x 6000 with cu kα as radiation source morphology of the sample was captured by sem scanning electron microscopy model vega test ln and tem transmission electron microscopy model jeol eo jem 1400 the edx spectra and elemental mapping were also taken using sem edx model oxford thermal analysis was performed by using tga thermogravimetric analysis model lineises pt 1600 the sample was burned with heat rate of 10 c per minute textural properties such as surface area pore volume and pore size were analysed using n2 adsorption desorption isotherm by using saa surface area analyzer model quantachrome nova e1600 the sample was degased for 6 h at 80 c before analysis 2 4 adsorption study the adsorption was performed in the batch method by studying the effect of ph contact time and dyes concentration methylene blue mb and procion red pr were used as dyes model representing cationic and anionic dyes respectively the ph of the dye solution was adjusted to be 3 5 7 9 and 11 by adding sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid solution about 15 mg of adsorbent was added into 50 ml of ph adjusted dye solution 30 mg l 1 and shaken for 30 min the adsorbent containing dyes was collected by centrifugation and the filtrate was taken for uv vis measurement to analyze the remaining concentration of dyes the measurement was recorded at λ max 663 and 542 nm for mb and pr samples respectively to study the adsorption kinetic the adsorption contact time was varied by 5 10 15 30 60 and 120 min the isotherm adsorption was performed by varying concentrations of dyes by 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 mg l 1 the adsorption was performed at optimum ph conditions with the amount of adsorbent by 15 mg the adsorption was performed three times of repetition for each experiment the amount of dye adsorbed onto adsorbents was calculated following eq 1 1 q e c o c e v m where c o and c e are the dye initial and equilibrium concentration mg l 1 v is the volume of dye solution l and m is the mass of adsorbent g the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e was expressed in mg of dyes adsorbed onto g of adsorbent 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of chemical pretreatment on opefb fig 1 a shows the ftir spectra of opefb topefb and s opefb revealing the change of opefb chemical functional groups both after treatment and silylation as mentioned untreated opefb contains lignin hemicellulose and cellulose which could be identified using ftir based on their functional group generally the presence of lignin could be distinguished by the presence of co stretching vibration assigned at 1660 cm 1 characteristic peaks at 3370 2930 and 1030 cm 1 correspond to the hydrogen bond o h c h and c o stretching vibrations respectively the elimination of lignin from cellulose structure via alkalization and bleaching treatments is proved by the disappearing of the characteristic peak of co stretching vibration in ftir of t opefb further a strong band is observed at 890 cm 1 represented the β glycosidic bond that confirms the formation of α cellulose pujiasih et al 2018 it also supported by xrd analysis as shown in fig 1 b the opefb has a broad xrd pattern indicating amorphous polymers which have a peak at 2θ 21 7 however new peaks are identified at 2θ 11 5 19 8 and 21 8 which quite similar to xrd characteristic peaks of the α cellulose structure according to jcpds number 03 0192 according to both ftir and xrd analysis they demonstrate that the lignin and hemicellulose are successfulness eliminated from the opefb structure leaving α cellulose as the main product surface engineering of topefb by a silylating agent was performed to introduce new functional groups that are expected to improve the adsorption performance of topefb during the silylation process a reactive silanol group that formed through hydrolysis in water ethanol system is chemically bonded to the cellulose polymer via si o c linkage this bond could be detected by ftir as provided in the insert box of fig 1 a showing a peak at around 1200 cm 1 zhang et al 2019 a new peak at 1654 cm 1 is attributed to the bending vibration of n h functional group the si o si vibrations that should be appeared at around 1100 cm 1 are difficult to identify due to overlap with c o vibration the cellulose structure arrangement has not interfered with silylation as evidenced by xrd analysis it exposes the same pattern with the previous topefb but the intensity slightly decreases due to a contribution of the amorphous phase of siloxane networks this suggests that the silylation has occurred only on the surface of the cellulose polymer 3 2 morphological thermal and textural properties the morphology of opefb topefb and s opefb was observed through sem and tem as depicted in fig 2 pretreatments and surface engineering via silylation dramatically changed the surface morphology of opefb fig 2 a shows the sem image of untreated opefb which has rough and fibrous structures a compact and aggregated like fiber structure is observed in fig 2 b after pretreating the opefb the topefb morphology seems to be a rod like structure as shown in the tem image after it was ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol prior to tem measurement this indicates that the amorphous lignin and hemicellulose are diminished and leaving rod like cellulose crystals which have a good agreement with xrd measurement fig 2 c reveals the surface morphology of s opefb covered by the siloxane network which assembled from silanol groups during the condensation step of the silylation process these silica layers were seen by tem measurements as presented in fig 2 d characterization of elemental mapping and edx was further performed to clarify the presence of silica on the surface of s opefb fig 3 demonstrates the elemental mapping image and edx spectra of s opefb observed in the selected area by the sem edx instrument the edx spectra of topefb is shown in figure s1 the topefb is contains c and o atoms with atomic percentage of 46 86 and 53 14 the elemental mapping image of s opefb confirms that the s opefb surfaces cover by the silica layer indicated by the presence of si kα signal the silica is well distributed on the surface of s opefb distinguished by blue dots the carbon atoms are predominantly spotted on the mapping image showed by red dots and followed by oxygen atom assigned as green dots this data is also supported by edx spectra as shown in fig 3 b the peaks at 0 28 0 52 and 1 75 kev correspond to c o and si signals with an atomic percentage of 76 8 22 0 and 1 2 respectively unfortunately the atomic percentage of nitrogen could not be measured due to its weak signal appeared at around 0 39 kev diarmand khalilabad et al 2019 vo et al 2014 thermal properties of pretreated and silylated opefb were evaluated by tga measurement and the result is given in fig 4 the tg curve reveals the thermal decomposition behavior of topefb and s opefb that are quietly similar generally the decomposition of both topefb and s opefb performed in three steps the first weight loss was started between 32 and 100 c related to the removal of water molecules bound to the material surfaces the amount of water released from both was different 11 for topefb and about 5 for s opefb assuming the silylation could potentially reduce the cellulose hydrophilicity the second degradation occurred at a temperature above 250 c corresponded to the decomposition of the cellulose polymer and followed a plateau curve after temperature 350 c the maximum thermal decomposition was achieved at 319 c for topefb and slightly increased by 4 c for s opefb a slight increasing of maximum thermal decomposition is also found by previous research which also modified the surface of cellulose with alkoxysilane compound khanjanzadeh et al 2018 the total weight loss of topefb was 95 that was incredibly higher than s opefb 49 which is presumably caused by the presence of siloxane networks covering the surface of opefb textural properties including surface area and pore characteristics are essential factors that dominantly influence the adsorption behavior of materials table 1 presents the bet brunauer emmet teller surface area pore volume and pore diameter of topefb and s opefb determined by the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm the bet surface area of topefb was found to be 50 64 m2 g 1 with a large pore volume of 7 06 10 2 cm3 g 1 the result exhibits higher compared to other works that extracted cellulose from various natural resources hussin et al 2016 2020 pujiasih et al 2018 zheng et al 2012 pretreatments of raw opefb mean to remove its unnecessary parts such as lignin and hemicellulose that could be interfered with the surface area and on the other side reduce the fiber dimension by breaking amorphous cellulose regions with strong acid this causes the topefb surfaces to serve a lot of active sites that facilitate high adsorption of n2 surface engineering of topefb surprisingly improved the bet surface area by 30 53 surface functionalization via silylation commonly decreased the surface area of porous materials due to pore blocking effect however it turns to be improved in our case which also found by zhang et al modifying lignocellulose material with aptes zhang et al 2019 silylation enriches not only the surfaces of topefb by additional functional groups but also improves the mesoporosity generated from ordered siloxane networks the presence of mesoporous channels d pore 3 27 nm of silica layers on the surface of s opefb provides more room for storing n2 gas molecules consequently the pore volume of s opefb was found to be 10 80 10 2 cm3 g 1 which is evidently much higher than topefb mesoporous properties high surface area and pore volume as well as enriched with functional groups are beneficial features provided by s opefb as adsorbent 3 3 evaluation of adsorption study experiments were carried out at different ph ranging from acid to base conditions the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe of each adsorbent for mb and pr is presented in fig 5 fig 5 a shows the qe of both topefb and s opefb toward the mb dye the qe of topefb was 99 54 mg g 1 at ph 9 and decreased at higher or lower ph cellulose is enriched with hydroxyl groups that are deprotonated in basic conditions inducing the negative surface charges ζ potential 28 9 mv at ph 9 presented in figure s2 these facilitate high interaction with mb which is a cationic dye peng et al 2016 saputra et al 2020 adsorption capacity of s opefb was much lower than topefb at ph 9 but it was slightly different for ph 10 qe 99 49 mg g 1 this decrease reflects a change in surface charges due to introducing an amine based organosilane compound as a silylating agent ζ potential 7 8 mv at ph 9 nevertheless the presence of hydroxyl groups on the silylating agent compound encourages the negative charges on the s opefb surfaces that could promote electrostatic attraction with cationic species of mb as shown in scheme 2 fig 5 b depicts the graph of the correlation between ph and qe value of adsorbents toward pr dye contrary to the cationic dye the adsorbents optimally worked to adsorb pr dye at the acidic condition the qe of topefb was much lower below 20 mg g 1 compared to the s opefb this is due to the surface functional groups of cellulose that tend to more negative ζ potential of topefb at ph 3 7 4 mv consequently an electrostatic repulsion occurs between negative surface charges of topefb and anionic species of pr dye molecules qe 0 78 mg g 1 at ph 11 even at low ph the topefb is not powerful enough to attract the anionic dyes which might be caused by the presence of excess h ions competing with dye molecules on the topefb adsorbent site batzias and sidiras 2007 buvaneswari and kannan 2011 the qe value at ph 4 significantly increased to be more than 400 after introducing a silylating agent at acidic condition the amine groups of s opefb are protonated to form positively charged nh3 which makes the dyes easily attaching on the surface of adsorbent through electrostatic attraction as illustrated in scheme 2 saputra et al 2017b this is also supported by ζ potential measurement in which the value was 32 5 mv recorded at ph 3 the qe of s opefb decreased at high ph due to a competition between anionic species of pr and oh ion to interact with active groups of s opefb via either hydrogen bond or electrostatic interactions this indicated by negative value of ζ potential at ph 9 7 8 mv 3 4 adsorption kinetic the adsorption capacity of each adsorbent toward mb or pr dye at t time is presented in fig 6 the results demonstrated in fig 6 a showed a high adsorption capacity of topefb toward mb achieved even at initial adsorption time qt 66 58 mg g 1 for 5 min adsorption moreover the adsorption of mb onto topefb reached equilibrium state at t 30 min having qt 99 45 mg g 1 meanwhile the adsorption equilibrium of s opefb was observed at 60 min this indicates that the adsorption of mb onto s opefb is slower than topefb during the adsorption process dye molecules are transferred from solutions to the surface of adsorbent via van der waals interaction at certain distances the dyes molecules are subsequently attracted to the adsorbent active sites via electrostatic interactions and continuously accumulated until reaching equilibrium state liu et al 2015 saputra et al 2017a the adsorption equilibrium state is highly dependent on the presence of adsorbent active sites which is associated with the ease of the adsorbent interacting with dye molecules as mentioned topefb cellulose is rich in hydroxyl groups acted as active sites for adsorbing cationic species the silylation process directly reduces the number of the hydroxyl group of topefb as a consequence of chemical reaction via si o cellulose linkage this causes the adsorption equilibrium state of s opefb quite longer than topefb the anionic pr dye molecules are difficult to adsorb onto topefb and mostly repulsed due to their charges similarity therefore the qt of topefb at equilibrium state initially started at t 60 min was found no more than 20 mg l 1 as depicted in fig 6 b however it is surprisingly given that s opefb has qt value many times higher than topefb besides the equilibrium state was achieved at 15 min of adsorption contact time the s opefb is not only powerful in adsorbing cationic dye but also highly capable of adsorbing anionic dye a plausible reason behind this phenomenon is that surface engineering of topefb introduces the amine groups as another active site besides hydroxyl groups this apparently causes s opefb to have double active sites hydroxyl groups as cationic dye active site and amine groups for the anionic species adsorption contact time plays an important role in determining adsorption kinetic it was studied by fitting pseudo first order and pseudo second order models using eq 2 and eq 3 respectively li et al 2018 saputra et al 2020 the values of each parameter are summarized in table 2 and the linear fitting plots of each model are given in figure s3 s6 accordingly the adsorption kinetics of both adsorbents is apparent following pseudo second order kinetic models based on the adsorption profiles as shown in fig 6 it is fully supported by the linear fitting analysis of the adsorption data to the adsorption kinetic model equations the data revealed that the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics was fitted to describe the kinetic adsorption mechanism which was indicated by a higher correlation coefficient r2 among all models moreover the calculated qe qe cal obtained from the pseudo second order model was in good agreement with the experimental data for example the qe cal values of topefb were 102 04 mg g 1 and 19 27 mg g 1 for mb and pr respectively closed to their qe experiment which were 99 79 mg g 1 and 18 02 mg g 1 the same result was also found in s opefb adsorption data the pseudo second order rate constant k2 of topefb on the adsorption of mb was slightly higher than s opefb however it was oppositely found for adsorption pr the k2 of s opefb was 0 94 10 2 g mg 1 min 1 meanwhile it was found to be 0 70 10 2 g mg 1 min 1 for topefb even though they have a not too significant difference in the k2 value the qe cal values between both adsorbents however are magnificently altered table 2 also reveals the initial adsorption rate h0 of pseudo second order which calculated according to eq 4 the h0 of topefb on adsorption of mb decreased from 51 02 mg g 1 min 1 24 57 mg g 1 min 1 after performing surface modification however the h0 of s opefb was 37 times faster on adsorption of pr compared to topefb demonstrating its powerfulness on adsorption both anionic and cationic dyes 2 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e c a l 2 t q e c a l 4 h 0 k 2 q e c a l 2 in order to thoroughly understand the adsorption mechanism of either mb or pr onto the adsorbents the intra particle diffusion was studied according to weber morris approach as calculated using eq 5 metin et al 2013 fig 7 shows the t1 2 versus qt plots of intra particle diffusion model exhibiting a multi linear plot which indicates more than one steps involved in the adsorption process at least there are two linear plots vividly observed i three dots line up at initial adsorption and ii a plateau state is reached afterward in the initial adsorption the intra particle rate constant at beginning adsorption kt 1 determines the adsorption mechanism in this state the adsorption is rapidly occurred which indicates a fast mass transfer of dyes from the bulk solution to external adsorbent surfaces and continue to diffuse into internal surfaces of the adsorbents the kt 1 of topefb adsorbing mb dye was about 13 81 mg g 1 min 1 2 higher than that of s opefb kt 1 12 52 mg g 1 min 1 2 as revealed in table 2 in contrast the kt 1 of s opefb was remarkably higher than topefb for the case of pr dyes this explains the result in which s opefb has a high h0 value toward pr dyes compared to topefb the intra particle diffusion rate at the second step kt 2 was lower than the kt 1 indicating a gradual adsorption process caused by the adsorbents reaching their equilibrium state based on the results the adsorption mechanism of dye molecules onto the adsorbents could be outlined as i a fast transfer of pr dye molecules driven from the bulk system into the surface of s opefb adsorbent is taken in the first step and ii finally the active sites of adsorbents are fully occupied by dyes molecules and reach the equilibrium state which is indicated by a slow rate of adsorption 5 q t k t t 1 2 c 3 5 adsorption isotherm interaction between dyes molecules with adsorbent surfaces can be described by studying the adsorption isotherm in this study two common models were employed i e langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the langmuir isotherm model expressed in eq 6 generally relates to chemisorption in which the adsorbate dye molecules occupied one site in adsorbent surfaces to form a monolayer tang et al 2016 the freundlich model eq 7 meanwhile describes a multilayer formation of adsorbate on the adsorbent surfaces which physical interaction is predominant zhao et al 2017 6 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m 7 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where qm is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 kl is langmuir equilibrium constant l mg 1 kf and n are freundlich isotherm constant and the constant describing the adsorption intensity of the adsorbent fig 8 depicts the adsorption isotherm fitting linear of both topefb and s opefb toward pr and mb dyes the results indicated that the langmuir isotherm could be better to explain the adsorption behavior implying the monolayer adsorption of dyes occurred on the surface of the adsorbent however the adsorption of pr onto s opefb is more favorable to freundlich with r2 higher than langmuir fitting linear indicating multilayer adsorption formed on the surface of the s opefb this could be due to the presence of an amine functional group as well as the pore structure of the siloxane layer on the surface of topefb which facilitated a strong electrostatic or even chemical interaction with the anionic dyes molecules since high h0 and kt 1 kinetic rates the dyes are diffused into the pore channels and favorably form a multilayer instead chemically active functional group high surface area and porous structures of s opefb make the dye molecules interact via not only chemically but also physically causing this adsorbent has high qm value unexpectedly reaching 208 33 mg g 1 compared to topefb qm 20 70 mg g 1 the qm of s opefb was more than ten times higher indicated this chemically surface engineering greatly improved the ability of such cellulose based adsorbent the fitting results of both langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are presented in table 3 the qm of topefb was 192 31 mg g 1 and 20 70 mg g 1 for adsorbing mb and pr respectively this result shows the unmodified cellulose enriched with hydroxyl group powerfully capable of adsorbing cationic dye but getting weak on anionic dyes this issue resolves by surface engineering through the silylation technique such outstanding adsorption properties are generated by s opefb having qm about 149 25 and 208 33 mg g 1 for mb and pr respectively indeed the qm of mb adsorbed within s opefb decreased compared to topefb however its ability to adsorb both cationic and anionic dyes is demanded to provide outstanding features for future environmental applications the results obtained from this experiment are also comparable with previous findings as shown in table 4 this suggests that our material can be effectively used for adsorbing dyes either cationic or anionic additionally this low cost adsorbent could be potentially developed as valuable materials having a positive impact on environmental due to its advantages 4 conclusion the cellulose was successfully extracted from oil palm empty fruit bunches opefb through chemically treatement and was further modified by an alkoxysilane compound synthesized though aminolysis of gptm the presence of amines group on the surface of s opefb acted as active sites for entrapping cationic and anionic dyes molecules the ph kinetic and isotherm adsorption were studied in order to evaluate the adsorption performance the adsorption of mb was suitable in basic condition meanwhile it was acidic for pr the kinetic study revealed that the adsorption mechanism was followed pseudo second order for both dyes the topefb has better performance in adsorbing mb qmax 192 31 mg g 1 but weak to adsorb pr qmax 20 70 mg g 1 the surface modification improved the adsorption performance toward pr dye 10 times qmax 208 33 mg g 1 but slightly degreased for mb dye 149 25 mg g 1 nevertheless the s opefb was comparable with bio based adsorbents reported in previous studies

procion red classified as an aromatic azo anionic dye dyes are commonly employed in the dying process which imposes such severe threatening disease and harms an aesthetic environment even at a small concentration almeida and corso 2014 hariani et al 2018 rafatullah et al 2010 rethinasabapathy et al 2018 therefore the treatment of wastewater containing those dyes is necessarily performed nowadays many efforts have been carried out to treat wastewater containing dyes such as photocatalytic degradation lenzi et al 2016 biological degradations van der zee et al 2003 ozonation muniyasamy et al 2019 2020 coagulation flocculation beluci et al 2019 gadekar and ahammed 2016 electrochemical oxidation cotillas et al 2018 and adsorption in most cases however some approaches are quite expensive consuming high energy and requiring complicated protocols additionally decomposition of dyes molecules viz an aromatic azo dye produces highly toxic counterparts like aromatic amines creating new issues that need to be solved hariani et al 2018 van der zee et al 2003 apart from its effectiveness on removing dyes in aqueous media the adsorption strategy offers many advantages for industrial scales such as cost benefit rapid and straightforward protocol the adsorbed dyes can be recollected via desorption and so forth guo et al 2018 kandisa and saibaba kv 2016 ozdemir et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 nevertheless it should be taken into account that the source or kind of adsorbents plays a vital role in the adsorption performance of dyes in this regard selecting a proper highly potential and cost beneficial adsorbent is mandatory to study a tremendous amount of research has been devoted to developing high performance bio based adsorbents for effectively treating effluents containing dyes bulgariu et al 2019 li et al 2019 shamsollahi and partovinia 2019 ummartyotin and pechyen 2016 polysaccharides were quietly employed as bio based adsorbent and there were many efforts focused on improving their adsorption capacity for accommodating a high concentration of dyes entrapped within the adsorbent for example microcrystalline cellulose mcc was transformed into cellulose nanocrystals cnc through a simple acid hydrolysis method and was further composited with cr oh 3 the cnc cr oh 3 nanocomposites demonstrated a high adsorption capacity toward methylene blue cationic dye up to 204 mg g 1 nekouei et al 2017 removal of cationic dyes by cellulose obtained from filter paper was achieved and its performance was elevated after modified with diatomite and functionalized by maleic anhydrides li et al 2014 in another investigation the dye adsorption capacity of cellulose also can be improved through modification with carbonylation and micro fibrillation of cellulose li et al 2018 cellulose extracted from oil pam fronds also showed excellent performance on adsorption of methylene blue with maximum adsorption capacity up to 51 811 mg g 1 hussin et al 2016 although cellulose based adsorbent demonstrated compatibility to adsorb cationic dyes this material unfortunately suffer to eliminate anionic dyes in aqueous solution mohadi et al proved that microalgae obtained a low adsorption capacity on adsorption of procion red mohadi et al 2017 nazifa et al also reported the same result even though the cellulose was carbonized in order to improve the surface area and porosity maximum adsorption capacity qm 2 86 mg g 1 nazifa et al 2018 it is thus critically important to modify the cellulose based adsorbent for the removal of anionic dye purpose toward this target zheng et al oriented polyaniline on the surface of kapok fiber and demonstrated a good result on adsorption of sulfonated based dyes zheng et al 2012 in another investigation the surface functionalization of the fiber by an amine based compound improved compatibility of the adsorbent to adsorb anionic dye zhao et al 2020 the cellulose is the most abundant polymer in nature contained in all agro waste products despite of being burned or naturally degraded it will be better to utilize the waste containing cellulose for improving its economic value the cellulose extracted from agro waste material could be used as a low cost adsorbent utilization of polysaccharide waste materials as bio sorbent has been attracted considerable attention due to its readiness inexpensive and support environmentally and sustainable technology basu et al 2019 saputra et al 2020 oil palm empty fruit bunches opefb are agriculture solid waste that easily found in indonesia despite their abundance the utilization of this solid waste is still limited these wastes are potentially transformed into valuable materials due to their high lignocellulose content pujiasih et al 2018 therefore opefb solid wastes were highlighted in this research by extracting valuable cellulose materials and were used as an adsorbent for removal dyes in aqueous media furthermore surface engineering of cellulose extracted from opefb has been performed to achieve our goal developing an adsorbent that works on both cationic and anionic dyes to do so the silylation technique was introduced in this regard this technique has been established as a simple platform to functionalize and to engineer the surface of materials herrera et al 2005 saputra et al 2020 since cellulose based adsorbent lacks on adsorbing anionic dyes the use of an amine based silylating agent is the best choice to overcome this issue as a result the silylated cellulose had extremely performance on adsorption of both cationic and anionic dyes 2 experimental 2 1 materials chopped opefb fibers 4 mm length were obtained from chemistry division indonesian institute of science 3 glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane gptms cas 2530 83 8 98 was purchased from sigma aldrich ethylenediamine 1 2 diaminoethane cas 107 15 3 sodium hydroxide naoh cas 1310 73 2 sulfuric acid h2so4 cas 7664 93 9 98 and ethanol absolute were supplied by merck sodium hypochlorite naocl 12 methylene blue and procion red were technical grade and readily available from bratako chemica corp surakarta indonesia 2 2 pretreatment and silylation of oil palm empty fruit bunches the opefb fibers are lignocellulose containing lignin hemicellulose and cellulose to obtain high crystalline of cellulose both lignin and hemicellulose should be removed as shown in scheme 1 there are three steps involved to treat the opefb namely alkalization bleaching and acid hydrolysis the alkalization and bleaching process aimed to remove the lignin content the hemicellulose and amorphous part of cellulose were eliminated by acid hydrolysis producing high crystalline cellulose that called pretreated opefb topefb further the topefb was silylated by amine based organosilane synthesized via the aminolysis of gptms chemically the reaction between gptms and 1 2 diaminoethane is facilitated by opening ring reaction in which the amines act as nucleophilic and attacks the oxirene ring acocella et al 2016 bakhtin et al 2020 bespalko and shved 2019 the silylation was performed in a water ethanol medium to facilitate the hydrolysis and condensation of silanes groups onto the surface of topefb wang et al 2015 as a result the surface of topefb was covered by amine based organosilane forming siloxane networks that were evaluated in this study treatments of opefb including alkalization bleaching and acid hydrolysis followed our previous work procedure pujiasih et al 2018 briefly about 100 g of opefb fiber was immersed in a 17 5 naoh solution overnight at room temperature the alkalized opefb was rinsed with distilled water several times and then transferred into acidified naocl solution the bleaching process was taken for 2 h at 80 c and repeated three times afterward the bleached opefb was hydrolyzed in 45 sulphuric acid for 45 min at 45 c with opefb to h2so4 ratio of 1 20 g ml 1 the pretreated opefb denoted as topefb was neutralized by washing several times using distilled water and collected using centrifugation the amine based organosilane compound was prepared by reacting 3 glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane 0 236 g with 1 2 diaminoethane 0 180 g at room temperature for 1 h then it was transferred into 1 g topefb in 20 ml of water ethanol mixture solution and ultrasonically treated for 30 min the reaction was maintained for 24 h at 70 c the silylated topefb so called s opefb was washed using ethanol and distilled water then dried using a freeze drying machine 2 3 material characterization the materials were further characterized using some instruments ftir fourier transform infra red characterization was used to identify the functional group of each material the sample was recorded using ftir model ir prestige 21 shimadzu scanned in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 number of scan 40 times with resolution of 2 cm 1 the xrd pattern of each sample was recorded using xrd x ray diffraction model shimadzu xrd lab x 6000 with cu kα as radiation source morphology of the sample was captured by sem scanning electron microscopy model vega test ln and tem transmission electron microscopy model jeol eo jem 1400 the edx spectra and elemental mapping were also taken using sem edx model oxford thermal analysis was performed by using tga thermogravimetric analysis model lineises pt 1600 the sample was burned with heat rate of 10 c per minute textural properties such as surface area pore volume and pore size were analysed using n2 adsorption desorption isotherm by using saa surface area analyzer model quantachrome nova e1600 the sample was degased for 6 h at 80 c before analysis 2 4 adsorption study the adsorption was performed in the batch method by studying the effect of ph contact time and dyes concentration methylene blue mb and procion red pr were used as dyes model representing cationic and anionic dyes respectively the ph of the dye solution was adjusted to be 3 5 7 9 and 11 by adding sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid solution about 15 mg of adsorbent was added into 50 ml of ph adjusted dye solution 30 mg l 1 and shaken for 30 min the adsorbent containing dyes was collected by centrifugation and the filtrate was taken for uv vis measurement to analyze the remaining concentration of dyes the measurement was recorded at λ max 663 and 542 nm for mb and pr samples respectively to study the adsorption kinetic the adsorption contact time was varied by 5 10 15 30 60 and 120 min the isotherm adsorption was performed by varying concentrations of dyes by 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 mg l 1 the adsorption was performed at optimum ph conditions with the amount of adsorbent by 15 mg the adsorption was performed three times of repetition for each experiment the amount of dye adsorbed onto adsorbents was calculated following eq 1 1 q e c o c e v m where c o and c e are the dye initial and equilibrium concentration mg l 1 v is the volume of dye solution l and m is the mass of adsorbent g the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e was expressed in mg of dyes adsorbed onto g of adsorbent 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of chemical pretreatment on opefb fig 1 a shows the ftir spectra of opefb topefb and s opefb revealing the change of opefb chemical functional groups both after treatment and silylation as mentioned untreated opefb contains lignin hemicellulose and cellulose which could be identified using ftir based on their functional group generally the presence of lignin could be distinguished by the presence of co stretching vibration assigned at 1660 cm 1 characteristic peaks at 3370 2930 and 1030 cm 1 correspond to the hydrogen bond o h c h and c o stretching vibrations respectively the elimination of lignin from cellulose structure via alkalization and bleaching treatments is proved by the disappearing of the characteristic peak of co stretching vibration in ftir of t opefb further a strong band is observed at 890 cm 1 represented the β glycosidic bond that confirms the formation of α cellulose pujiasih et al 2018 it also supported by xrd analysis as shown in fig 1 b the opefb has a broad xrd pattern indicating amorphous polymers which have a peak at 2θ 21 7 however new peaks are identified at 2θ 11 5 19 8 and 21 8 which quite similar to xrd characteristic peaks of the α cellulose structure according to jcpds number 03 0192 according to both ftir and xrd analysis they demonstrate that the lignin and hemicellulose are successfulness eliminated from the opefb structure leaving α cellulose as the main product surface engineering of topefb by a silylating agent was performed to introduce new functional groups that are expected to improve the adsorption performance of topefb during the silylation process a reactive silanol group that formed through hydrolysis in water ethanol system is chemically bonded to the cellulose polymer via si o c linkage this bond could be detected by ftir as provided in the insert box of fig 1 a showing a peak at around 1200 cm 1 zhang et al 2019 a new peak at 1654 cm 1 is attributed to the bending vibration of n h functional group the si o si vibrations that should be appeared at around 1100 cm 1 are difficult to identify due to overlap with c o vibration the cellulose structure arrangement has not interfered with silylation as evidenced by xrd analysis it exposes the same pattern with the previous topefb but the intensity slightly decreases due to a contribution of the amorphous phase of siloxane networks this suggests that the silylation has occurred only on the surface of the cellulose polymer 3 2 morphological thermal and textural properties the morphology of opefb topefb and s opefb was observed through sem and tem as depicted in fig 2 pretreatments and surface engineering via silylation dramatically changed the surface morphology of opefb fig 2 a shows the sem image of untreated opefb which has rough and fibrous structures a compact and aggregated like fiber structure is observed in fig 2 b after pretreating the opefb the topefb morphology seems to be a rod like structure as shown in the tem image after it was ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol prior to tem measurement this indicates that the amorphous lignin and hemicellulose are diminished and leaving rod like cellulose crystals which have a good agreement with xrd measurement fig 2 c reveals the surface morphology of s opefb covered by the siloxane network which assembled from silanol groups during the condensation step of the silylation process these silica layers were seen by tem measurements as presented in fig 2 d characterization of elemental mapping and edx was further performed to clarify the presence of silica on the surface of s opefb fig 3 demonstrates the elemental mapping image and edx spectra of s opefb observed in the selected area by the sem edx instrument the edx spectra of topefb is shown in figure s1 the topefb is contains c and o atoms with atomic percentage of 46 86 and 53 14 the elemental mapping image of s opefb confirms that the s opefb surfaces cover by the silica layer indicated by the presence of si kα signal the silica is well distributed on the surface of s opefb distinguished by blue dots the carbon atoms are predominantly spotted on the mapping image showed by red dots and followed by oxygen atom assigned as green dots this data is also supported by edx spectra as shown in fig 3 b the peaks at 0 28 0 52 and 1 75 kev correspond to c o and si signals with an atomic percentage of 76 8 22 0 and 1 2 respectively unfortunately the atomic percentage of nitrogen could not be measured due to its weak signal appeared at around 0 39 kev diarmand khalilabad et al 2019 vo et al 2014 thermal properties of pretreated and silylated opefb were evaluated by tga measurement and the result is given in fig 4 the tg curve reveals the thermal decomposition behavior of topefb and s opefb that are quietly similar generally the decomposition of both topefb and s opefb performed in three steps the first weight loss was started between 32 and 100 c related to the removal of water molecules bound to the material surfaces the amount of water released from both was different 11 for topefb and about 5 for s opefb assuming the silylation could potentially reduce the cellulose hydrophilicity the second degradation occurred at a temperature above 250 c corresponded to the decomposition of the cellulose polymer and followed a plateau curve after temperature 350 c the maximum thermal decomposition was achieved at 319 c for topefb and slightly increased by 4 c for s opefb a slight increasing of maximum thermal decomposition is also found by previous research which also modified the surface of cellulose with alkoxysilane compound khanjanzadeh et al 2018 the total weight loss of topefb was 95 that was incredibly higher than s opefb 49 which is presumably caused by the presence of siloxane networks covering the surface of opefb textural properties including surface area and pore characteristics are essential factors that dominantly influence the adsorption behavior of materials table 1 presents the bet brunauer emmet teller surface area pore volume and pore diameter of topefb and s opefb determined by the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm the bet surface area of topefb was found to be 50 64 m2 g 1 with a large pore volume of 7 06 10 2 cm3 g 1 the result exhibits higher compared to other works that extracted cellulose from various natural resources hussin et al 2016 2020 pujiasih et al 2018 zheng et al 2012 pretreatments of raw opefb mean to remove its unnecessary parts such as lignin and hemicellulose that could be interfered with the surface area and on the other side reduce the fiber dimension by breaking amorphous cellulose regions with strong acid this causes the topefb surfaces to serve a lot of active sites that facilitate high adsorption of n2 surface engineering of topefb surprisingly improved the bet surface area by 30 53 surface functionalization via silylation commonly decreased the surface area of porous materials due to pore blocking effect however it turns to be improved in our case which also found by zhang et al modifying lignocellulose material with aptes zhang et al 2019 silylation enriches not only the surfaces of topefb by additional functional groups but also improves the mesoporosity generated from ordered siloxane networks the presence of mesoporous channels d pore 3 27 nm of silica layers on the surface of s opefb provides more room for storing n2 gas molecules consequently the pore volume of s opefb was found to be 10 80 10 2 cm3 g 1 which is evidently much higher than topefb mesoporous properties high surface area and pore volume as well as enriched with functional groups are beneficial features provided by s opefb as adsorbent 3 3 evaluation of adsorption study experiments were carried out at different ph ranging from acid to base conditions the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe of each adsorbent for mb and pr is presented in fig 5 fig 5 a shows the qe of both topefb and s opefb toward the mb dye the qe of topefb was 99 54 mg g 1 at ph 9 and decreased at higher or lower ph cellulose is enriched with hydroxyl groups that are deprotonated in basic conditions inducing the negative surface charges ζ potential 28 9 mv at ph 9 presented in figure s2 these facilitate high interaction with mb which is a cationic dye peng et al 2016 saputra et al 2020 adsorption capacity of s opefb was much lower than topefb at ph 9 but it was slightly different for ph 10 qe 99 49 mg g 1 this decrease reflects a change in surface charges due to introducing an amine based organosilane compound as a silylating agent ζ potential 7 8 mv at ph 9 nevertheless the presence of hydroxyl groups on the silylating agent compound encourages the negative charges on the s opefb surfaces that could promote electrostatic attraction with cationic species of mb as shown in scheme 2 fig 5 b depicts the graph of the correlation between ph and qe value of adsorbents toward pr dye contrary to the cationic dye the adsorbents optimally worked to adsorb pr dye at the acidic condition the qe of topefb was much lower below 20 mg g 1 compared to the s opefb this is due to the surface functional groups of cellulose that tend to more negative ζ potential of topefb at ph 3 7 4 mv consequently an electrostatic repulsion occurs between negative surface charges of topefb and anionic species of pr dye molecules qe 0 78 mg g 1 at ph 11 even at low ph the topefb is not powerful enough to attract the anionic dyes which might be caused by the presence of excess h ions competing with dye molecules on the topefb adsorbent site batzias and sidiras 2007 buvaneswari and kannan 2011 the qe value at ph 4 significantly increased to be more than 400 after introducing a silylating agent at acidic condition the amine groups of s opefb are protonated to form positively charged nh3 which makes the dyes easily attaching on the surface of adsorbent through electrostatic attraction as illustrated in scheme 2 saputra et al 2017b this is also supported by ζ potential measurement in which the value was 32 5 mv recorded at ph 3 the qe of s opefb decreased at high ph due to a competition between anionic species of pr and oh ion to interact with active groups of s opefb via either hydrogen bond or electrostatic interactions this indicated by negative value of ζ potential at ph 9 7 8 mv 3 4 adsorption kinetic the adsorption capacity of each adsorbent toward mb or pr dye at t time is presented in fig 6 the results demonstrated in fig 6 a showed a high adsorption capacity of topefb toward mb achieved even at initial adsorption time qt 66 58 mg g 1 for 5 min adsorption moreover the adsorption of mb onto topefb reached equilibrium state at t 30 min having qt 99 45 mg g 1 meanwhile the adsorption equilibrium of s opefb was observed at 60 min this indicates that the adsorption of mb onto s opefb is slower than topefb during the adsorption process dye molecules are transferred from solutions to the surface of adsorbent via van der waals interaction at certain distances the dyes molecules are subsequently attracted to the adsorbent active sites via electrostatic interactions and continuously accumulated until reaching equilibrium state liu et al 2015 saputra et al 2017a the adsorption equilibrium state is highly dependent on the presence of adsorbent active sites which is associated with the ease of the adsorbent interacting with dye molecules as mentioned topefb cellulose is rich in hydroxyl groups acted as active sites for adsorbing cationic species the silylation process directly reduces the number of the hydroxyl group of topefb as a consequence of chemical reaction via si o cellulose linkage this causes the adsorption equilibrium state of s opefb quite longer than topefb the anionic pr dye molecules are difficult to adsorb onto topefb and mostly repulsed due to their charges similarity therefore the qt of topefb at equilibrium state initially started at t 60 min was found no more than 20 mg l 1 as depicted in fig 6 b however it is surprisingly given that s opefb has qt value many times higher than topefb besides the equilibrium state was achieved at 15 min of adsorption contact time the s opefb is not only powerful in adsorbing cationic dye but also highly capable of adsorbing anionic dye a plausible reason behind this phenomenon is that surface engineering of topefb introduces the amine groups as another active site besides hydroxyl groups this apparently causes s opefb to have double active sites hydroxyl groups as cationic dye active site and amine groups for the anionic species adsorption contact time plays an important role in determining adsorption kinetic it was studied by fitting pseudo first order and pseudo second order models using eq 2 and eq 3 respectively li et al 2018 saputra et al 2020 the values of each parameter are summarized in table 2 and the linear fitting plots of each model are given in figure s3 s6 accordingly the adsorption kinetics of both adsorbents is apparent following pseudo second order kinetic models based on the adsorption profiles as shown in fig 6 it is fully supported by the linear fitting analysis of the adsorption data to the adsorption kinetic model equations the data revealed that the pseudo second order adsorption kinetics was fitted to describe the kinetic adsorption mechanism which was indicated by a higher correlation coefficient r2 among all models moreover the calculated qe qe cal obtained from the pseudo second order model was in good agreement with the experimental data for example the qe cal values of topefb were 102 04 mg g 1 and 19 27 mg g 1 for mb and pr respectively closed to their qe experiment which were 99 79 mg g 1 and 18 02 mg g 1 the same result was also found in s opefb adsorption data the pseudo second order rate constant k2 of topefb on the adsorption of mb was slightly higher than s opefb however it was oppositely found for adsorption pr the k2 of s opefb was 0 94 10 2 g mg 1 min 1 meanwhile it was found to be 0 70 10 2 g mg 1 min 1 for topefb even though they have a not too significant difference in the k2 value the qe cal values between both adsorbents however are magnificently altered table 2 also reveals the initial adsorption rate h0 of pseudo second order which calculated according to eq 4 the h0 of topefb on adsorption of mb decreased from 51 02 mg g 1 min 1 24 57 mg g 1 min 1 after performing surface modification however the h0 of s opefb was 37 times faster on adsorption of pr compared to topefb demonstrating its powerfulness on adsorption both anionic and cationic dyes 2 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e c a l 2 t q e c a l 4 h 0 k 2 q e c a l 2 in order to thoroughly understand the adsorption mechanism of either mb or pr onto the adsorbents the intra particle diffusion was studied according to weber morris approach as calculated using eq 5 metin et al 2013 fig 7 shows the t1 2 versus qt plots of intra particle diffusion model exhibiting a multi linear plot which indicates more than one steps involved in the adsorption process at least there are two linear plots vividly observed i three dots line up at initial adsorption and ii a plateau state is reached afterward in the initial adsorption the intra particle rate constant at beginning adsorption kt 1 determines the adsorption mechanism in this state the adsorption is rapidly occurred which indicates a fast mass transfer of dyes from the bulk solution to external adsorbent surfaces and continue to diffuse into internal surfaces of the adsorbents the kt 1 of topefb adsorbing mb dye was about 13 81 mg g 1 min 1 2 higher than that of s opefb kt 1 12 52 mg g 1 min 1 2 as revealed in table 2 in contrast the kt 1 of s opefb was remarkably higher than topefb for the case of pr dyes this explains the result in which s opefb has a high h0 value toward pr dyes compared to topefb the intra particle diffusion rate at the second step kt 2 was lower than the kt 1 indicating a gradual adsorption process caused by the adsorbents reaching their equilibrium state based on the results the adsorption mechanism of dye molecules onto the adsorbents could be outlined as i a fast transfer of pr dye molecules driven from the bulk system into the surface of s opefb adsorbent is taken in the first step and ii finally the active sites of adsorbents are fully occupied by dyes molecules and reach the equilibrium state which is indicated by a slow rate of adsorption 5 q t k t t 1 2 c 3 5 adsorption isotherm interaction between dyes molecules with adsorbent surfaces can be described by studying the adsorption isotherm in this study two common models were employed i e langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the langmuir isotherm model expressed in eq 6 generally relates to chemisorption in which the adsorbate dye molecules occupied one site in adsorbent surfaces to form a monolayer tang et al 2016 the freundlich model eq 7 meanwhile describes a multilayer formation of adsorbate on the adsorbent surfaces which physical interaction is predominant zhao et al 2017 6 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m 7 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where qm is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 kl is langmuir equilibrium constant l mg 1 kf and n are freundlich isotherm constant and the constant describing the adsorption intensity of the adsorbent fig 8 depicts the adsorption isotherm fitting linear of both topefb and s opefb toward pr and mb dyes the results indicated that the langmuir isotherm could be better to explain the adsorption behavior implying the monolayer adsorption of dyes occurred on the surface of the adsorbent however the adsorption of pr onto s opefb is more favorable to freundlich with r2 higher than langmuir fitting linear indicating multilayer adsorption formed on the surface of the s opefb this could be due to the presence of an amine functional group as well as the pore structure of the siloxane layer on the surface of topefb which facilitated a strong electrostatic or even chemical interaction with the anionic dyes molecules since high h0 and kt 1 kinetic rates the dyes are diffused into the pore channels and favorably form a multilayer instead chemically active functional group high surface area and porous structures of s opefb make the dye molecules interact via not only chemically but also physically causing this adsorbent has high qm value unexpectedly reaching 208 33 mg g 1 compared to topefb qm 20 70 mg g 1 the qm of s opefb was more than ten times higher indicated this chemically surface engineering greatly improved the ability of such cellulose based adsorbent the fitting results of both langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are presented in table 3 the qm of topefb was 192 31 mg g 1 and 20 70 mg g 1 for adsorbing mb and pr respectively this result shows the unmodified cellulose enriched with hydroxyl group powerfully capable of adsorbing cationic dye but getting weak on anionic dyes this issue resolves by surface engineering through the silylation technique such outstanding adsorption properties are generated by s opefb having qm about 149 25 and 208 33 mg g 1 for mb and pr respectively indeed the qm of mb adsorbed within s opefb decreased compared to topefb however its ability to adsorb both cationic and anionic dyes is demanded to provide outstanding features for future environmental applications the results obtained from this experiment are also comparable with previous findings as shown in table 4 this suggests that our material can be effectively used for adsorbing dyes either cationic or anionic additionally this low cost adsorbent could be potentially developed as valuable materials having a positive impact on environmental due to its advantages 4 conclusion the cellulose was successfully extracted from oil palm empty fruit bunches opefb through chemically treatement and was further modified by an alkoxysilane compound synthesized though aminolysis of gptm the presence of amines group on the surface of s opefb acted as active sites for entrapping cationic and anionic dyes molecules the ph kinetic and isotherm adsorption were studied in order to evaluate the adsorption performance the adsorption of mb was suitable in basic condition meanwhile it was acidic for pr the kinetic study revealed that the adsorption mechanism was followed pseudo second order for both dyes the topefb has better performance in adsorbing mb qmax 192 31 mg g 1 but weak to adsorb pr qmax 20 70 mg g 1 the surface modification improved the adsorption performance toward pr dye 10 times qmax 208 33 mg g 1 but slightly degreased for mb dye 149 25 mg g 1 nevertheless the s opefb was comparable with bio based adsorbents reported in previous studies

required of water for supply depends largely on the intended purpose i e water quality required for drinking industrial or irrigation use are not the same hence the quality of groundwater should be given the same attention as the quantity todd and mays 2005 the approaches for assessing the quality of water for use involves measurement of water quality parameters and using them to compute the relevant water quality indices for comparison with approved standards in relation to the desired usage of the water the who guideline values for drinking water are commonly used in assessing the suitability of water for human consumption and has been applied successfully in many studies worldwide including ghana e g gyamfi et al 2019 appiah adjei et al 2016 annapoorna and janadharna 2015 similarly water quality indices have successfully been adopted and used to assess groundwater quality for drinking and other industrial purposes in many parts of the world al hadithi 2012 boateng et al 2016 anim gyampo et al 2019 on the other hand indices such as permeability index pi langelier saturation index magnesium hazard sodium adsorption ratio sar and percent sodium na are used in assessing the suitability of water for irrigation and have been used effectively in several studies e g dhembare 2012 wanda et al 2013 this study therefore uses a combination of who guideline values water quality index wqi and other selected indices to evaluate the quality of groundwater in communities along the coast of the central region of ghana for domestic and irrigation purposes water supply in the region is mainly dependent on groundwater due to limited availability of fresh surface water leading to modest groundwater development investments by governmental and non governmental agencies aimed at meeting water demands however the investments especially along the coastal communities do not appear to be yielding the desired benefits due to high saline contents in some of the boreholes developed in the communities ganyaglo et al 2017 ganyaglo 2015 leading to loss of investments thus this study is envisaged to provide spatial information on groundwater quality in the communities taking into account the underlying geology and coastal boundary for efficient development of the groundwater resource and ensure value for investments the detailed physico chemical evaluation of the groundwater within the study area would also add up to the existing knowledge on the general groundwater quality along coastal towns 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area is the coastal line of the central region of ghana fig 1 covering an area of approximately 230 km2 and bounded by latitudes 5 0 and 5 50 n and longitudes 0 20 and 1 40 w the region shares boundaries with the ashanti and eastern regions to the north greater accra region to the east western region to the west and the atlantic ocean gulf of guinea to the south the vegetation cover of the study area is predominantly coastal savannah comprising grassland and few trees with semi deciduous forest going inlands from the coast the study area lies within the dry equatorial and moist semi equatorial zones and has a bimodal rainfall pattern the annual rainfall ranges from 1000 mm along the coast to about 2000 mm in the interior the wettest months are may july and september october with the driest period occurring from december to february and a brief period in august mean monthly temperatures range from 24 c in the coolest month august to about 30 c in the hottest months march april ghana statistical service 2013 ground elevation ranges from sea level to about 379 m which rises with distance away from the sea with approximately 70 of the land area below 30 m adams et al 2017 the study area is underlain by the birimian supergroup which is intruded by the basin granitoids and to some extent the sandstones and shales of sekondian origin at the tail end of elmina asiedu 2005 which lies unconformably on the ajua shales fig 1 there is also a biotite gneiss formation within the western part of the study area the granitoids exhibit some foliations and all the rocks are crisscrossed by mafic dykes of predominantly doleritic composition grenholm 2011 some of the rock types in the area include quartz diorite tonalite trondhjemite granodiorite adamellite and granites the main ferromagnesian mineral found in the basin type granitoids is biotite which is commonly accompanied by muscovite the basin granitoids occur as synorogenic foliated batholiths chiefly in the central portions of the birimian sedimentary basins they are peraluminous and generally granodioritic in composition leube et al 1990 primary porosity and permeability are absent in the rocks due to their mode of formations thus groundwater accumulation and movement are mainly controlled by secondary porosity due to chemical weathering and development of secondary structures such as fissures and fractures available drilling logs from the study area suggest that there are approximately three hydrostratigraphic units viz topsoil completely weathered to slightly weathered and the fresh bedrock the drilling logs also show an average overburden thickness weathered zone of 15 m ranging between 3 and 32 m groundwater occurrence is controlled mainly by secondary porosity in the weathered overburden forming shallow unconfined aquifer and fractures and or fissures within the fresh basement rocks groundwater abstraction borehole depths range between 31 and 80 m with an average depth of 60 m the depth to water level ranges from 1 8 to 20 m with an average of 9 33 m average borehole yields determined from available pumping test data is about 22 l min ranging between 6 and 60 l min 2 2 acquisition of data groundwater data for the study was compiled from hydrogeological reports submitted to the community water and sanitation agency cwsa cape coast between 2013 and 2016 sixty nine 69 water quality datasets from different boreholes were collated from the reports for the study area fig 1 the boreholes were within distances ranging from 2 to 40 km from the seashore with the closest at esikafoamnantem in the cape coast metropolis and the farthest at kwaku fio community in the agona east district the physico chemical parameters extracted from the datasets for this study were the ph ec and the concentrations of the major cations and anions i e ca2 na mg2 k hco3 no3 cl and so4 2 the groundwater sampling method and analysis employed in this study followed the standard procedure described in apha 1995 and appelo and postma 2005 the laboratory analyses of the major ions were done at water research institute wri laboratory in accra while the electrical conductivity ec and ph were measured in situ using the portable hq40d18 series meter concentrations of na and k ions were determined using the flame photometer whilst ca2 and mg2 were measured using atomic absorption spectrometry aas chloride cl and bicarbonate hco 3 concentrations were determined by titrimetry sulphate so 4 2 was analysed using ultra violet spectrometer and nitrate no 3 concentrations with the brucine reagent 2 3 data analyses prior to analyses of the data the accuracy of the water quality data was assessed using the anion cation balance approach which assumes that water should be neutral through computation of the charge balance error cbe domenico and schwartz 1997 expressed as 1 c b e c a c a 100 the cbe values showed majority of the water quality data were within the acceptable cbe value range of 5 with just 7 of the data outside the range thus the accuracy of the water quality data was assumed to be generally good for the subsequent analyses in the study also the arcgis version 10 4 1 software was used for the spatial analysis of the water quality data which allowed interpolations of the groundwater quality parameters determined and the various computed water quality indices over the study area using the inverse distance weighted idw spatial interpolation method this method has been used widely to study the spatial variations of groundwater quality in several similar studies ismail et al 2020 kawo and karuppannan 2018 kumar and sangeetha 2020 sena et al 2019 2 4 groundwater quality assessment for domestic purposes the water quality data was analysed statistically using the statistical package for the social sciences spss this was done by first making the data analysis ready using ms excel spreadsheet and transferring it into the spss platform for determining the descriptive statistics the parameters considered in this analysis were the mean maximum minimum standard deviation sd and the skewness of the measured concentrations of the water quality parameters also the concentrations of the measured water quality parameters were compared with the guideline values for assessing the general suitability of water for drinking purposes who 2017 the groundwater quality within the study area was also assessed for domestic use using the water quality index wqi which was first proposed by horton 1965 and has been used widely for groundwater quality assessment anim gyampo et al 2019 dunca 2018 zotou et al 2018 shahid et al 2017 boateng et al 2016 tiwari et al 2014 singh et al 2011 brown et al 1972 the method considers the relative contributions of physico chemical parameters to the overall health risk of groundwater seeking to turn complex water quality data into information that is easily understandable and or useable by the public horton s 1965 equation was used for the wqi computation in this study in this equation weights were assigned to the individual parameters of interest eight 8 parameters were considered and used in this current study based on the available data these include ec ph cl so4 hco no3 ca and mg weights were assigned to each parameter based on their relative influence on the general groundwater quality with the most influential parameters having higher weights the assigned weights w i and who 2017 guideline values are given in table 1 based on this a maximum weight of 5 was assigned to nitrate due to its high importance in water quality assessment boateng et al 2016 srinivasamoorthy et al 2008 whilst ph ec cl and so4 were assigned a weight of 4 because of their moderate significance in the overall assessment of the water quality for drinking purposes tiwari et al 2014 calcium and magnesium are given a weight of 2 each due to their low significance in quality of water bicarbonate is given a minimum weight of 1 as its significance is very low in the water quality assessment the relative weight w i is then determined by equation 2 thus 2 w i w i i 1 n w i where w i is the relative weight w i is the weight of each physico chemical parameter and n is the number of parameters considered in accordance with who 2017 guidelines the quality rating q for each parameter was calculated using equation 3 3 q i c i s i 100 where q i is the quality rating c i is the concentration mg l of each chemical parameter and s i is the who 2017 standard for each chemical parameter afterwards the wqi for each groundwater sample from the communities was determined using equation 4 and analysed following the wqi classification in table 2 4 w q i n i 1 w i q i where wi is the relative weight of the ith parameter and qi is the water quality rating for the ith parameter the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater within any given area may be determined by plotting the major ions present in the groundwater on a piper diagram piper 1944 which aids in classifying groundwater into different water types the measured relative percentages of the major ions i e na k mg2 ca2 cl so4 2 co3 2 and hco3 in the groundwater quality data of the area were therefore plotted on the piper diagram using the grapher 15 software to identify the water types making up the groundwater of the study area 2 5 groundwater quality assessment for irrigation groundwater quality for irrigation was investigated from the ionic concentrations of the soluble salts found in groundwater using indices such as the sar sodium percent ec value and permeability index generally groundwater potential in supporting plant growth and subsequent crop yields depends highly on its sar and soluble sodium percent na properties the sar is a measure of the amount of the sodium ion relative to calcium and magnesium in the water extract from a saturated soil paste and it is a very important parameter for determining groundwater suitability for irrigation this was estimated for all the sampling points using the relationship 5 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where the concentrations of the ions are in meq l also higher amounts of sodium ions in the groundwater for irrigation can displace ca2 and mg2 in the same soil leading to the decrease in the soil s ability to form stable aggregates and subsequent loss of soil structure it may also lead to decrease in infiltration and permeability capacities of the soil which may damage crop yield thus it is very essential in assessing the suitability of irrigation water sadashivaiah et al 2008 and was estimated in the study using the relation 6 n a n a k c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 likewise the permeability index pi of irrigated water has been used in several studies to estimate how long usage of some mineral rich groundwater affects the permeability of soil doneen 1975 khalid 2018 the permeability of a soil is affected when irrigation water rich in ca hco3 na and mg is used for a long time equation 7 doneen 1975 was used to compute the pi for the assessment of the suitability of the groundwater for irrigation in this study 7 p i n a h c o 3 m g n a c a 100 where the ion concentrations are all in meq l 2 6 ionic ratio seawater intrusion has been detected from some ionic ratios of the major ions in the analysis of groundwater quality results in several studies lee 2007 kim et al 2003 sanchez martos et al 2002 some of these ionic ratios are cl br na cl ca mg and ca hco3 and so4 it was established by bear et al 1999 that if the na cl ratio is less than 0 86 then the groundwater may have been contaminated by seawater since the chloride content is far more than that of the sodium in the water on the other hand if the ratio is greater than 1 00 then the groundwater may have been contaminated by anthropogenic sources sudaryanto and naily 2018 in this study different ionic ratios were calculated to help determine the source of salinity in the groundwater the ionic ratios considered are na cl ca mg ca hco3 so4 and ca hco3 so4 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical parameters table 3 shows the results of the chemical analyses and indicates that the ph varies between 5 65 and 9 61 with an average of 6 67 approximately 85 of the samples recorded ph values less than the 7 which indicates that groundwater in the study area is slightly acidic geologic formations containing granitoids usually give acidic groundwaters and may therefore be the contributing factor for the acidity however there were areas like gyangyenadze in the efutu municipality that recorded abnormally high ph values i e 9 61 making the water basic abamkrom in the gomoa west district had the lowest ph value of 5 65 and it is about 32 km away from the sea despite these anomalies the ph of the groundwater in the study area may generally be considered suitable for domestic use the electrical conductivity ec which is one of the important water quality parameters measured in the field in the area range from 182 μs cm at esiamotan mfantsiman district to 10 910 μs cm in domekyi agona east district with an average of about 2010 μs cm fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of ec in the groundwater of the study area about 56 of the groundwater samples table 3 show abnormally high ec values above the permissible who 2017 guideline values for drinking water and may be unsuitable for domestic use some geochemical processes including rock water interaction silicate weathering ionic exchange evaporation sulphate reduction and oxidation processes and anthropogenic activities contribute to the general variations in the ec values ramesh and elango 2011 high ec values were recorded in communities close to the sea fig 2 and may be due to saline intrusion or dissolution of halite ganyaglo et al 2017 however domekyi a community about 20 km away from the sea recorded the highest ec value this could probably be due to sea aerosol and rock water interactions ganyaglo 2015 the lowest ec value was recorded in the groundwater occurring within the same distance from the sea as domekyi and may support the claim by park and kim 2012 that there is a poor correlation between lateral distance from the sea and measured ec values groundwater samples along the coast exhibited high concentrations of the major cations while boreholes farther away from the coast showed lower concentrations and the relative percentages of the cations in the groundwater showed that sodium na is the dominant cation within the study area with more than 50 contents na is about the sixth most abundant element on earth and it is widely distributed in soils water plants and foods on earth fig 3 shows the distribution of na concentrations in groundwaters within the study area again it is observed that boreholes closer to the sea show high concentrations of na cation exchange reaction may have taken place where the ca in the fresh groundwater is replaced by the na from the saline water intruding from the sea however there are other sources that may contribute to elevated levels of the sodium ions in the groundwater these sources include dissolution of some elements in the underlying geological units sewage industrial wastes fertilizers and water softener discharges sayyed and bhosle 2011 the underlying geology of the area contains na rich feldspars e g albite as the dominant mineral asare et al 2016 ganyaglo 2015 thus the weathering of albite could result in the release of na as shown in equation 8 into the soil zone which may eventually join the groundwater

studied have abnormally high na concentrations for potable use and hence the groundwater is unsuitable for human consumption in significant parts of the study area the high sodium concentrations in the groundwater may interfere with taste watering of certain plants and may increase the corrosiveness of the water which can affect household plumbing on the other hand adequate amount of sodium in water is an important nutrient for good health despite the health benefits from the consumption of sodium studies suggest that consuming high levels of sodium can result in some health implications like hypertension the average calcium ion concentration in the groundwater of the area is 6 38 meq l and ranges from 0 02 at kofi addo community agona east district to 44 36 meq l at domekyi agona east district ca concentrations in about 36 of the communities fall outside the permissible range of the who guidelines 2017 as shown in table 3 the underlying geologic formation contains ca feldspar caal2si2o8 which may break down through chemical weathering when in contact with carbonic acid h2co3 generated in the soil zone to release ca2 and resulting in the elevated concentrations in groundwater fig 4 when minerals like hornblende ca2 mgfeal 5 alsi 8o22 and pyroxenes na ca mg fe al al si2o6 come into contact with groundwater calcium ions may be leached into the groundwater the high concentrations of ca2 may also increase groundwater hardness magnesium ion concentration analysis shows a mean of 72 mg l and ranging between 4 6 at kofi addo and 531 mg l at domekyi about 43 of the water samples have high magnesium ion concentrations above the who guideline value of 30 mg l the abnormally high concentrations of the mg2 table 3 in some of the groundwaters may be resulting from the weathering of biotite k mg fe 3 alsi3 o10 oh f 2 and hornblende ca na 2 3 mg fe al 5 al si 8o22 oh 2 minerals that are abundant in the underlying geological formations within the study area some studies cappuccio and macgregor 1991 reddy et al 2015 filippini et al 2016 show that higher potassium concentrations in drinking water may have effect on blood pressure potassium ion k concentrations were the lowest in the groundwater of the area with a mean of 9 mg l and ranging from 0 6 at agona duotu to 126 mg l at eduafo only one groundwater sample eduafo showed higher k concentrations than the who guideline value of 100 mg l the hydrochemical data analysis from this study shows that groundwater at all the locations is of good quality with respect to this parameter except at eduafo in the mfantsiman municipality the order of magnitude in the occurrence of the cations is na ca2 mg2 k concentrations of the four most abundant anions in the groundwater samples in the study area show higher proportion for the cl than the other anions the order of magnitude of the anionic concentrations as cl so4 2 hco3 no3 the chloride ion concentrations range between 15 and 3673 mg l with an average of 530 mg l table 3 the highest concentration was recorded in the domekyi community and the lowest in esiamotan the spatial distribution map of the cl concentrations fig 5 shows high values in communities closer to the sea these high recorded concentrations may be due to sea water intrusion and or halite dissolution as suggested by ganyaglo et al 2017 also bear et al 1999 suggested that high chloride content in groundwater is an indication that there is intrusion of seawater and or contact with connate water has taken place in the underlying aquifer chloride classification of the groundwater within the study area shows that about 48 of the communities have abnormally high cl concentrations making their groundwater unsuitable for potable use table 4 shows the different classes of groundwater based on the chloride concentration in meq l compared with the concentrations recorded from the study area scheidleder 2003 thinks that saltwater intrusion may be the main cause of the high chloride contents in groundwaters found in many coastal aquifers other sources may be attributed to anthropogenic causes such as waste water effluents sameer et al 2011 the spatial variation of so4 2 in the groundwater of the area is shown in fig 6 and indicates that high concentrations are recorded in samples taken close to the sea and reside in the volcaniclastic sediments sulphate ion so4 2 concentrations averaged about 3 17 meq l ranging between 0 01 at dwendama mfantsiman district and 22 49 meq l at domekyi however 23 of the sampled areas recorded values outside the who 2017 permissible limit of so4 2 concentration for potable water bicarbonate ion hco3 concentrations ranged between 0 1 at essakrom and 508 mg l community health school efutu municipal area with an average of about 148 mg l bicarbonate is formed from the chemical reaction between carbon dioxide co2 which results from the oxidation of organic matter in the soil and water james 1984 groundwater in approximately 30 of the communities have bicarbonate ion concentrations above the who 2017 permissible limit of 200 mg l for drinking water fig 6 these high concentrations may be due to high oxidation of many organic matters within the soil material on the other hand the nitrate concentrations within the sampled waters were all within the who guideline value of less than 10 mg l these low nitrate concentrations may be due to non application of nitrogen fertilizers by the farmers within the study area 3 2 water quality index assessment the computed wqi analysis shows that 43 of the samples have excellent water quality wqi 50 for domestic use 17 have good water wqi between 50 and 100 16 have poor water quality wqi between 200 and 300 10 shows very poor water quality and 13 have unsuitable quality for human consumption concentrations of the influential parameter nitrate were all within the acceptable limit given in who 2017 gv fig 7 also shows the spatial distribution of the wqi values in the various geological units indicating that the groundwater in the volcaniclastics has poor to unsuitable water for drinking purposes some of the groundwater samples within the granitoid shows excellent water quality however the samples were all far from the sea reducing the influence of the seawater intrusion 3 3 groundwater water types the piper plot of the samples fig 8 shows 3 distinct classes of the water types in the study area viz nacl 43 which may be from ancient marine and seawater intrusion sources mghco3 20 from freshwater sources and mixed camgcl 20 and cacl 12 may be a result of cation exchange reactions and deep gypsum source there was no nahco3 water type found in the samples this may be due to cation exchange processes where the ca from the freshwater cahco3 replaces na from the intruding saline water which may have led to the dominance of the mixed camgcl water type in some of the wells however the abundance of nacl may be an indication of high salinity in the groundwater due to seawater intrusion since most of the nacl water types were observed in boreholes close within 2 5 km to the seashore clark 2015 re emphasized that low salinity groundwaters are dominated by ca2 and hco3 resulting from mineral weathering by carbonic acid while salinity in seawater contaminated waters is dominated by highly soluble na and cl the ec characterisation of the water types revealed that about 50 of the nacl water type samples also had high ec values above 1000 μs cm based on the chemical constituents in the groundwater the dominant ions have been categorised into 8 groups with 4 each in the two triangles fig 8 geochemical analysis by leube et al 1990 on some sedimentary basin granitoids cape coast type revealed that na2o element is the fourth most abundant element making up approximately 4 37 of the elemental composition with k2o contributing approximately 3 by weight to the elemental composition of rocks the abundances of these elements na2o and k2o support the high proportions of the sodium and potassium concentrations in the groundwater from the study area sodium and potassium may have been released slowly upon dissolution of these elements ca2o is the fifth most abundant element in the granitoids found within the study area and therefore the dissolution of the rocks by the groundwater increases their contribution to the calcium content in the water the spatial distribution fig 5 shows high concentrations of chloride in the southern part of the study area which is closest to the sea the piper plots also show that about 35 of the samples occurring within the northern part of the region have higher concentrations of bicarbonate hco3 than chloride this could add up to the existing phenomenon where the closer an abstraction point is to the sea the higher the chloride concentrations 3 4 suitability of the groundwater for irrigation the suitability of groundwater for irrigation is dependent on the effect of the mineral constituents of the water on both the soil and the plants high salinity in water can harm plant growth physically by limiting the water uptake capability through modification of osmotic processes or chemically by metabolic reactions such as those caused by toxic constituents the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes is therefore evaluated on the basis of their potential to create soil conditions which may be hazardous to crop growth and subsequently to animals or humans consuming those crops rhoades et al 1992 sar na pi and other classification schemes were used to assess the groundwater of the study area for irrigation purposes fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of sodium adsorption ratio sar in the study area determined from chemical analyses of the samples it indicates that almost all the samples about 99 may be classified as excellent for irrigation water except the sample from esikafoamantem in the cape coast metropolis where the sar was below 10 points egbi et al 2018 shah and mistry 2013 classification of water suitability for irrigation was also done following the wilcox 1955 scheme which categorizes different waters into five classes fig 10 by combining the soluble sodium percent of the water to its corresponding ec measure high soluble sodium percent depicts soft water while low percent shows hard water thus combining the net effect of the na and ec of the groundwater in the study area it was observed that groundwater from 56 of communities may be suitable for irrigation purposes while 33 may be deemed as doubtful to unsuitable for irrigation table 5 these communities with unsuitable groundwater for irrigation had slightly high to very high ec values and were mostly close to the shore fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of the sodium percent in the groundwater and reveals very large number of the samples having high sodium content which may be due to seawater intrusion using the classification of waters for irrigation purposes by rhoades et al 1992 the groundwater in the study area may be put into 2 groups as shown in fig 12 the groundwater within area 1 constituting 40 of the samples is suitable for irrigation while the rest in area 2 is unsuitable as irrigation water most of the samples picked from communities closer to the sea showed higher ec values and corresponding low to high sar values the groundwater within communities close about 60 to the sea may not be suitable for irrigation due to the elevated salt contents which may reduce plant stand and growth rate as stated by rhoades et al 1992 the classification scheme by doneen 1975 was also used in analysing computed pi values of the groundwater and it was observed that about 29 of the samples had pi values above 75 and are most suitable for irrigation use while 47 out of 69 samples 68 fall between 25 and 75 and are classified as moderately suitable for irrigation only 2 samples were unsuitable to be used as irrigation water since their pi values were less than 25 3 5 ionic ratio the na cl ionic ratio from this study shows that 62 of the groundwater may have been contaminated by seawater since their na cl ratios were less than 0 86 while 27 may have been contaminated through some anthropogenic activities the groundwater samples showing lower na cl ionic ratios also had ec values higher than the threshold value of 1000 μs cm the combination of the ca mg and ca hco3 so4 ionic ratios indicate that approximately 48 of the sampled communities have groundwater that has been influenced by seawater intrusion the higher ratio of the ca hco3 so4 is an indication of the formation of ca cl brines rosenthal 1988 about 20 out of 43 samples with na cl ratios below 0 86 also showed ca hco3 so4 ratios greater than 1 chloride and bicarbonate ratios were also used to classify the groundwaters within the study area higher ratio values greater than 15 are classified as having salinity levels close to seawater 12 had such quality on the other hand low values less than 0 5 have no seawater influence the computed ratio results show that approximately 31 of the groundwaters have been influenced by the seawater intrusion resulting in their elevated salinity while approximately 8 have no influence from the seawater these 31 groundwater samples also showed high ec values greater than 1000 μs cm thus the results from the ionic ratios support the hypothesis that seawater intrusion is a contributing factor to contamination of freshwaters in the coastal aquifers 4 conclusion the study has assessed groundwater quality in some communities along the coastal areas of the central region of ghana for domestic and irrigation purposes using a combination of who guideline values wqi salinity indices and ionic ratios results from the combined use of the wqi and who guideline values analyses show that about 61 of the communities have excellent to good groundwater quality for domestic use whereas the remaining communities have unsuitable groundwater quality the unsuitable groundwater quality was observed to be mostly in boreholes drilled within the volcaniclastic sediments also irrigation suitability assessment of the groundwater based on sar na pi and ec versus na analyses show the groundwater in about 70 of the sampled communities in the study area were suitable for irrigation high ec and chloride concentrations were observed in the communities in proximity to the sea with the highest recorded at about 20 km away from the shore alkali elements na and k were the dominant cations while cl dominated over the other anions the groundwater in the study area is dominated by nacl water type 43 followed by the mghco3 20 water type and the mixed camgcl water type 20 which may be due to cation exchange as seawater encroaches the fresh coastal aquifers further analyses of na cl ca hco3 so4 and ca cl ionic ratios showed the high salinity in groundwater in some communities in the study area may be the result of seawater intrusion into the fresh coastal groundwater aquifers thus seawater intrusion may have affected the general groundwater quality in some communities of the study area and made them unsuitable for use these areas of unsuitable groundwater quality in the communities have been delineated through this study which may serve as useful information for practical application in the development of groundwater resources in the communities for water supply declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11946,groundwater as a source of water supply plays an important role in the socio economic development of most communities worldwide however its potability in most coastal communities is often threatened by seawater intrusion this study employed a combination of methods including the world health organization who guideline values water quality index wqi ionic ratios sodium adsorption ratio sar percent sodium na permeability index pi and electrical conductivity ec to assess the quality of groundwater in some coastal communities of the central region of ghana for domestic and irrigation purposes physico chemical data from sixty nine 69 boreholes in the communities were acquired for the study nacl 43 mghco3 20 and mixed camgcl 20 were found to be the dominant water types in the groundwater of the study area about 61 of the communities had excellent to good groundwater quality for domestic use per who guideline values and wqi analyses whereas 43 had suitable groundwater to support plant growth and crop yield based on the pi sar na and ec analyses however there were elevated concentrations of the major ions close to the sea and the ionic ratios revealed that seawater intrusion may be the cause of the high salinity in the groundwater of most communities in the area this study has delineated areas in the communities with poor groundwater quality that may have to be avoided in the development of the resource for water supply graphical abstract image 1 keywords ghana groundwater physico chemical salinity seawater drinking quality irrigation 1 introduction groundwater is a very important natural resource and serves as a reliable source of water supply for domestic agriculture and industrial use for many people all over the world it plays an important role in the socio economic development of both rural and urban population it is available near the point of use generally possesses excellent quality and could be developed at low cost compared with surface water todd and mays 2005 in ghana about 70 of the population depend entirely on groundwater abstracted via hand dug wells boreholes etc as their source of potable water generally groundwater quality is deemed better than surface water due to the latter s transport and storage in geologic media which protects it from direct surface contamination macdonald and calow 2009 and the filtering action of the geologic media unfortunately groundwater within the coastal belts across the world are widely characterised as problematic due to its high salinity olufemi et al 2010 omonona et al 2014 mokadem et al 2015 mclachlan et al 2017 najib et al 2016 mountadar et al 2018 salinization of groundwater in coastal aquifers may represent a considerable threat to the freshwater resources and it is recognised as a global issue affecting groundwater quality within the coastal communities werner et al 2013 eissa et al 2015 high salinity in groundwater may be associated with seawater intrusion and anthropogenic activities including overexploitation leading to induced intrusion of saline waters and injection wells this high salinity problem has caused boreholes in some communities within ghana especially along the coast to be abandoned ganyaglo et al 2017 groundwater quality is as important as its quantity when assessing its suitability as a source of water supply for an area the quality required of water for supply depends largely on the intended purpose i e water quality required for drinking industrial or irrigation use are not the same hence the quality of groundwater should be given the same attention as the quantity todd and mays 2005 the approaches for assessing the quality of water for use involves measurement of water quality parameters and using them to compute the relevant water quality indices for comparison with approved standards in relation to the desired usage of the water the who guideline values for drinking water are commonly used in assessing the suitability of water for human consumption and has been applied successfully in many studies worldwide including ghana e g gyamfi et al 2019 appiah adjei et al 2016 annapoorna and janadharna 2015 similarly water quality indices have successfully been adopted and used to assess groundwater quality for drinking and other industrial purposes in many parts of the world al hadithi 2012 boateng et al 2016 anim gyampo et al 2019 on the other hand indices such as permeability index pi langelier saturation index magnesium hazard sodium adsorption ratio sar and percent sodium na are used in assessing the suitability of water for irrigation and have been used effectively in several studies e g dhembare 2012 wanda et al 2013 this study therefore uses a combination of who guideline values water quality index wqi and other selected indices to evaluate the quality of groundwater in communities along the coast of the central region of ghana for domestic and irrigation purposes water supply in the region is mainly dependent on groundwater due to limited availability of fresh surface water leading to modest groundwater development investments by governmental and non governmental agencies aimed at meeting water demands however the investments especially along the coastal communities do not appear to be yielding the desired benefits due to high saline contents in some of the boreholes developed in the communities ganyaglo et al 2017 ganyaglo 2015 leading to loss of investments thus this study is envisaged to provide spatial information on groundwater quality in the communities taking into account the underlying geology and coastal boundary for efficient development of the groundwater resource and ensure value for investments the detailed physico chemical evaluation of the groundwater within the study area would also add up to the existing knowledge on the general groundwater quality along coastal towns 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area is the coastal line of the central region of ghana fig 1 covering an area of approximately 230 km2 and bounded by latitudes 5 0 and 5 50 n and longitudes 0 20 and 1 40 w the region shares boundaries with the ashanti and eastern regions to the north greater accra region to the east western region to the west and the atlantic ocean gulf of guinea to the south the vegetation cover of the study area is predominantly coastal savannah comprising grassland and few trees with semi deciduous forest going inlands from the coast the study area lies within the dry equatorial and moist semi equatorial zones and has a bimodal rainfall pattern the annual rainfall ranges from 1000 mm along the coast to about 2000 mm in the interior the wettest months are may july and september october with the driest period occurring from december to february and a brief period in august mean monthly temperatures range from 24 c in the coolest month august to about 30 c in the hottest months march april ghana statistical service 2013 ground elevation ranges from sea level to about 379 m which rises with distance away from the sea with approximately 70 of the land area below 30 m adams et al 2017 the study area is underlain by the birimian supergroup which is intruded by the basin granitoids and to some extent the sandstones and shales of sekondian origin at the tail end of elmina asiedu 2005 which lies unconformably on the ajua shales fig 1 there is also a biotite gneiss formation within the western part of the study area the granitoids exhibit some foliations and all the rocks are crisscrossed by mafic dykes of predominantly doleritic composition grenholm 2011 some of the rock types in the area include quartz diorite tonalite trondhjemite granodiorite adamellite and granites the main ferromagnesian mineral found in the basin type granitoids is biotite which is commonly accompanied by muscovite the basin granitoids occur as synorogenic foliated batholiths chiefly in the central portions of the birimian sedimentary basins they are peraluminous and generally granodioritic in composition leube et al 1990 primary porosity and permeability are absent in the rocks due to their mode of formations thus groundwater accumulation and movement are mainly controlled by secondary porosity due to chemical weathering and development of secondary structures such as fissures and fractures available drilling logs from the study area suggest that there are approximately three hydrostratigraphic units viz topsoil completely weathered to slightly weathered and the fresh bedrock the drilling logs also show an average overburden thickness weathered zone of 15 m ranging between 3 and 32 m groundwater occurrence is controlled mainly by secondary porosity in the weathered overburden forming shallow unconfined aquifer and fractures and or fissures within the fresh basement rocks groundwater abstraction borehole depths range between 31 and 80 m with an average depth of 60 m the depth to water level ranges from 1 8 to 20 m with an average of 9 33 m average borehole yields determined from available pumping test data is about 22 l min ranging between 6 and 60 l min 2 2 acquisition of data groundwater data for the study was compiled from hydrogeological reports submitted to the community water and sanitation agency cwsa cape coast between 2013 and 2016 sixty nine 69 water quality datasets from different boreholes were collated from the reports for the study area fig 1 the boreholes were within distances ranging from 2 to 40 km from the seashore with the closest at esikafoamnantem in the cape coast metropolis and the farthest at kwaku fio community in the agona east district the physico chemical parameters extracted from the datasets for this study were the ph ec and the concentrations of the major cations and anions i e ca2 na mg2 k hco3 no3 cl and so4 2 the groundwater sampling method and analysis employed in this study followed the standard procedure described in apha 1995 and appelo and postma 2005 the laboratory analyses of the major ions were done at water research institute wri laboratory in accra while the electrical conductivity ec and ph were measured in situ using the portable hq40d18 series meter concentrations of na and k ions were determined using the flame photometer whilst ca2 and mg2 were measured using atomic absorption spectrometry aas chloride cl and bicarbonate hco 3 concentrations were determined by titrimetry sulphate so 4 2 was analysed using ultra violet spectrometer and nitrate no 3 concentrations with the brucine reagent 2 3 data analyses prior to analyses of the data the accuracy of the water quality data was assessed using the anion cation balance approach which assumes that water should be neutral through computation of the charge balance error cbe domenico and schwartz 1997 expressed as 1 c b e c a c a 100 the cbe values showed majority of the water quality data were within the acceptable cbe value range of 5 with just 7 of the data outside the range thus the accuracy of the water quality data was assumed to be generally good for the subsequent analyses in the study also the arcgis version 10 4 1 software was used for the spatial analysis of the water quality data which allowed interpolations of the groundwater quality parameters determined and the various computed water quality indices over the study area using the inverse distance weighted idw spatial interpolation method this method has been used widely to study the spatial variations of groundwater quality in several similar studies ismail et al 2020 kawo and karuppannan 2018 kumar and sangeetha 2020 sena et al 2019 2 4 groundwater quality assessment for domestic purposes the water quality data was analysed statistically using the statistical package for the social sciences spss this was done by first making the data analysis ready using ms excel spreadsheet and transferring it into the spss platform for determining the descriptive statistics the parameters considered in this analysis were the mean maximum minimum standard deviation sd and the skewness of the measured concentrations of the water quality parameters also the concentrations of the measured water quality parameters were compared with the guideline values for assessing the general suitability of water for drinking purposes who 2017 the groundwater quality within the study area was also assessed for domestic use using the water quality index wqi which was first proposed by horton 1965 and has been used widely for groundwater quality assessment anim gyampo et al 2019 dunca 2018 zotou et al 2018 shahid et al 2017 boateng et al 2016 tiwari et al 2014 singh et al 2011 brown et al 1972 the method considers the relative contributions of physico chemical parameters to the overall health risk of groundwater seeking to turn complex water quality data into information that is easily understandable and or useable by the public horton s 1965 equation was used for the wqi computation in this study in this equation weights were assigned to the individual parameters of interest eight 8 parameters were considered and used in this current study based on the available data these include ec ph cl so4 hco no3 ca and mg weights were assigned to each parameter based on their relative influence on the general groundwater quality with the most influential parameters having higher weights the assigned weights w i and who 2017 guideline values are given in table 1 based on this a maximum weight of 5 was assigned to nitrate due to its high importance in water quality assessment boateng et al 2016 srinivasamoorthy et al 2008 whilst ph ec cl and so4 were assigned a weight of 4 because of their moderate significance in the overall assessment of the water quality for drinking purposes tiwari et al 2014 calcium and magnesium are given a weight of 2 each due to their low significance in quality of water bicarbonate is given a minimum weight of 1 as its significance is very low in the water quality assessment the relative weight w i is then determined by equation 2 thus 2 w i w i i 1 n w i where w i is the relative weight w i is the weight of each physico chemical parameter and n is the number of parameters considered in accordance with who 2017 guidelines the quality rating q for each parameter was calculated using equation 3 3 q i c i s i 100 where q i is the quality rating c i is the concentration mg l of each chemical parameter and s i is the who 2017 standard for each chemical parameter afterwards the wqi for each groundwater sample from the communities was determined using equation 4 and analysed following the wqi classification in table 2 4 w q i n i 1 w i q i where wi is the relative weight of the ith parameter and qi is the water quality rating for the ith parameter the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater within any given area may be determined by plotting the major ions present in the groundwater on a piper diagram piper 1944 which aids in classifying groundwater into different water types the measured relative percentages of the major ions i e na k mg2 ca2 cl so4 2 co3 2 and hco3 in the groundwater quality data of the area were therefore plotted on the piper diagram using the grapher 15 software to identify the water types making up the groundwater of the study area 2 5 groundwater quality assessment for irrigation groundwater quality for irrigation was investigated from the ionic concentrations of the soluble salts found in groundwater using indices such as the sar sodium percent ec value and permeability index generally groundwater potential in supporting plant growth and subsequent crop yields depends highly on its sar and soluble sodium percent na properties the sar is a measure of the amount of the sodium ion relative to calcium and magnesium in the water extract from a saturated soil paste and it is a very important parameter for determining groundwater suitability for irrigation this was estimated for all the sampling points using the relationship 5 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where the concentrations of the ions are in meq l also higher amounts of sodium ions in the groundwater for irrigation can displace ca2 and mg2 in the same soil leading to the decrease in the soil s ability to form stable aggregates and subsequent loss of soil structure it may also lead to decrease in infiltration and permeability capacities of the soil which may damage crop yield thus it is very essential in assessing the suitability of irrigation water sadashivaiah et al 2008 and was estimated in the study using the relation 6 n a n a k c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 likewise the permeability index pi of irrigated water has been used in several studies to estimate how long usage of some mineral rich groundwater affects the permeability of soil doneen 1975 khalid 2018 the permeability of a soil is affected when irrigation water rich in ca hco3 na and mg is used for a long time equation 7 doneen 1975 was used to compute the pi for the assessment of the suitability of the groundwater for irrigation in this study 7 p i n a h c o 3 m g n a c a 100 where the ion concentrations are all in meq l 2 6 ionic ratio seawater intrusion has been detected from some ionic ratios of the major ions in the analysis of groundwater quality results in several studies lee 2007 kim et al 2003 sanchez martos et al 2002 some of these ionic ratios are cl br na cl ca mg and ca hco3 and so4 it was established by bear et al 1999 that if the na cl ratio is less than 0 86 then the groundwater may have been contaminated by seawater since the chloride content is far more than that of the sodium in the water on the other hand if the ratio is greater than 1 00 then the groundwater may have been contaminated by anthropogenic sources sudaryanto and naily 2018 in this study different ionic ratios were calculated to help determine the source of salinity in the groundwater the ionic ratios considered are na cl ca mg ca hco3 so4 and ca hco3 so4 3 results and discussion 3 1 physico chemical parameters table 3 shows the results of the chemical analyses and indicates that the ph varies between 5 65 and 9 61 with an average of 6 67 approximately 85 of the samples recorded ph values less than the 7 which indicates that groundwater in the study area is slightly acidic geologic formations containing granitoids usually give acidic groundwaters and may therefore be the contributing factor for the acidity however there were areas like gyangyenadze in the efutu municipality that recorded abnormally high ph values i e 9 61 making the water basic abamkrom in the gomoa west district had the lowest ph value of 5 65 and it is about 32 km away from the sea despite these anomalies the ph of the groundwater in the study area may generally be considered suitable for domestic use the electrical conductivity ec which is one of the important water quality parameters measured in the field in the area range from 182 μs cm at esiamotan mfantsiman district to 10 910 μs cm in domekyi agona east district with an average of about 2010 μs cm fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of ec in the groundwater of the study area about 56 of the groundwater samples table 3 show abnormally high ec values above the permissible who 2017 guideline values for drinking water and may be unsuitable for domestic use some geochemical processes including rock water interaction silicate weathering ionic exchange evaporation sulphate reduction and oxidation processes and anthropogenic activities contribute to the general variations in the ec values ramesh and elango 2011 high ec values were recorded in communities close to the sea fig 2 and may be due to saline intrusion or dissolution of halite ganyaglo et al 2017 however domekyi a community about 20 km away from the sea recorded the highest ec value this could probably be due to sea aerosol and rock water interactions ganyaglo 2015 the lowest ec value was recorded in the groundwater occurring within the same distance from the sea as domekyi and may support the claim by park and kim 2012 that there is a poor correlation between lateral distance from the sea and measured ec values groundwater samples along the coast exhibited high concentrations of the major cations while boreholes farther away from the coast showed lower concentrations and the relative percentages of the cations in the groundwater showed that sodium na is the dominant cation within the study area with more than 50 contents na is about the sixth most abundant element on earth and it is widely distributed in soils water plants and foods on earth fig 3 shows the distribution of na concentrations in groundwaters within the study area again it is observed that boreholes closer to the sea show high concentrations of na cation exchange reaction may have taken place where the ca in the fresh groundwater is replaced by the na from the saline water intruding from the sea however there are other sources that may contribute to elevated levels of the sodium ions in the groundwater these sources include dissolution of some elements in the underlying geological units sewage industrial wastes fertilizers and water softener discharges sayyed and bhosle 2011 the underlying geology of the area contains na rich feldspars e g albite as the dominant mineral asare et al 2016 ganyaglo 2015 thus the weathering of albite could result in the release of na as shown in equation 8 into the soil zone which may eventually join the groundwater

studied have abnormally high na concentrations for potable use and hence the groundwater is unsuitable for human consumption in significant parts of the study area the high sodium concentrations in the groundwater may interfere with taste watering of certain plants and may increase the corrosiveness of the water which can affect household plumbing on the other hand adequate amount of sodium in water is an important nutrient for good health despite the health benefits from the consumption of sodium studies suggest that consuming high levels of sodium can result in some health implications like hypertension the average calcium ion concentration in the groundwater of the area is 6 38 meq l and ranges from 0 02 at kofi addo community agona east district to 44 36 meq l at domekyi agona east district ca concentrations in about 36 of the communities fall outside the permissible range of the who guidelines 2017 as shown in table 3 the underlying geologic formation contains ca feldspar caal2si2o8 which may break down through chemical weathering when in contact with carbonic acid h2co3 generated in the soil zone to release ca2 and resulting in the elevated concentrations in groundwater fig 4 when minerals like hornblende ca2 mgfeal 5 alsi 8o22 and pyroxenes na ca mg fe al al si2o6 come into contact with groundwater calcium ions may be leached into the groundwater the high concentrations of ca2 may also increase groundwater hardness magnesium ion concentration analysis shows a mean of 72 mg l and ranging between 4 6 at kofi addo and 531 mg l at domekyi about 43 of the water samples have high magnesium ion concentrations above the who guideline value of 30 mg l the abnormally high concentrations of the mg2 table 3 in some of the groundwaters may be resulting from the weathering of biotite k mg fe 3 alsi3 o10 oh f 2 and hornblende ca na 2 3 mg fe al 5 al si 8o22 oh 2 minerals that are abundant in the underlying geological formations within the study area some studies cappuccio and macgregor 1991 reddy et al 2015 filippini et al 2016 show that higher potassium concentrations in drinking water may have effect on blood pressure potassium ion k concentrations were the lowest in the groundwater of the area with a mean of 9 mg l and ranging from 0 6 at agona duotu to 126 mg l at eduafo only one groundwater sample eduafo showed higher k concentrations than the who guideline value of 100 mg l the hydrochemical data analysis from this study shows that groundwater at all the locations is of good quality with respect to this parameter except at eduafo in the mfantsiman municipality the order of magnitude in the occurrence of the cations is na ca2 mg2 k concentrations of the four most abundant anions in the groundwater samples in the study area show higher proportion for the cl than the other anions the order of magnitude of the anionic concentrations as cl so4 2 hco3 no3 the chloride ion concentrations range between 15 and 3673 mg l with an average of 530 mg l table 3 the highest concentration was recorded in the domekyi community and the lowest in esiamotan the spatial distribution map of the cl concentrations fig 5 shows high values in communities closer to the sea these high recorded concentrations may be due to sea water intrusion and or halite dissolution as suggested by ganyaglo et al 2017 also bear et al 1999 suggested that high chloride content in groundwater is an indication that there is intrusion of seawater and or contact with connate water has taken place in the underlying aquifer chloride classification of the groundwater within the study area shows that about 48 of the communities have abnormally high cl concentrations making their groundwater unsuitable for potable use table 4 shows the different classes of groundwater based on the chloride concentration in meq l compared with the concentrations recorded from the study area scheidleder 2003 thinks that saltwater intrusion may be the main cause of the high chloride contents in groundwaters found in many coastal aquifers other sources may be attributed to anthropogenic causes such as waste water effluents sameer et al 2011 the spatial variation of so4 2 in the groundwater of the area is shown in fig 6 and indicates that high concentrations are recorded in samples taken close to the sea and reside in the volcaniclastic sediments sulphate ion so4 2 concentrations averaged about 3 17 meq l ranging between 0 01 at dwendama mfantsiman district and 22 49 meq l at domekyi however 23 of the sampled areas recorded values outside the who 2017 permissible limit of so4 2 concentration for potable water bicarbonate ion hco3 concentrations ranged between 0 1 at essakrom and 508 mg l community health school efutu municipal area with an average of about 148 mg l bicarbonate is formed from the chemical reaction between carbon dioxide co2 which results from the oxidation of organic matter in the soil and water james 1984 groundwater in approximately 30 of the communities have bicarbonate ion concentrations above the who 2017 permissible limit of 200 mg l for drinking water fig 6 these high concentrations may be due to high oxidation of many organic matters within the soil material on the other hand the nitrate concentrations within the sampled waters were all within the who guideline value of less than 10 mg l these low nitrate concentrations may be due to non application of nitrogen fertilizers by the farmers within the study area 3 2 water quality index assessment the computed wqi analysis shows that 43 of the samples have excellent water quality wqi 50 for domestic use 17 have good water wqi between 50 and 100 16 have poor water quality wqi between 200 and 300 10 shows very poor water quality and 13 have unsuitable quality for human consumption concentrations of the influential parameter nitrate were all within the acceptable limit given in who 2017 gv fig 7 also shows the spatial distribution of the wqi values in the various geological units indicating that the groundwater in the volcaniclastics has poor to unsuitable water for drinking purposes some of the groundwater samples within the granitoid shows excellent water quality however the samples were all far from the sea reducing the influence of the seawater intrusion 3 3 groundwater water types the piper plot of the samples fig 8 shows 3 distinct classes of the water types in the study area viz nacl 43 which may be from ancient marine and seawater intrusion sources mghco3 20 from freshwater sources and mixed camgcl 20 and cacl 12 may be a result of cation exchange reactions and deep gypsum source there was no nahco3 water type found in the samples this may be due to cation exchange processes where the ca from the freshwater cahco3 replaces na from the intruding saline water which may have led to the dominance of the mixed camgcl water type in some of the wells however the abundance of nacl may be an indication of high salinity in the groundwater due to seawater intrusion since most of the nacl water types were observed in boreholes close within 2 5 km to the seashore clark 2015 re emphasized that low salinity groundwaters are dominated by ca2 and hco3 resulting from mineral weathering by carbonic acid while salinity in seawater contaminated waters is dominated by highly soluble na and cl the ec characterisation of the water types revealed that about 50 of the nacl water type samples also had high ec values above 1000 μs cm based on the chemical constituents in the groundwater the dominant ions have been categorised into 8 groups with 4 each in the two triangles fig 8 geochemical analysis by leube et al 1990 on some sedimentary basin granitoids cape coast type revealed that na2o element is the fourth most abundant element making up approximately 4 37 of the elemental composition with k2o contributing approximately 3 by weight to the elemental composition of rocks the abundances of these elements na2o and k2o support the high proportions of the sodium and potassium concentrations in the groundwater from the study area sodium and potassium may have been released slowly upon dissolution of these elements ca2o is the fifth most abundant element in the granitoids found within the study area and therefore the dissolution of the rocks by the groundwater increases their contribution to the calcium content in the water the spatial distribution fig 5 shows high concentrations of chloride in the southern part of the study area which is closest to the sea the piper plots also show that about 35 of the samples occurring within the northern part of the region have higher concentrations of bicarbonate hco3 than chloride this could add up to the existing phenomenon where the closer an abstraction point is to the sea the higher the chloride concentrations 3 4 suitability of the groundwater for irrigation the suitability of groundwater for irrigation is dependent on the effect of the mineral constituents of the water on both the soil and the plants high salinity in water can harm plant growth physically by limiting the water uptake capability through modification of osmotic processes or chemically by metabolic reactions such as those caused by toxic constituents the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes is therefore evaluated on the basis of their potential to create soil conditions which may be hazardous to crop growth and subsequently to animals or humans consuming those crops rhoades et al 1992 sar na pi and other classification schemes were used to assess the groundwater of the study area for irrigation purposes fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of sodium adsorption ratio sar in the study area determined from chemical analyses of the samples it indicates that almost all the samples about 99 may be classified as excellent for irrigation water except the sample from esikafoamantem in the cape coast metropolis where the sar was below 10 points egbi et al 2018 shah and mistry 2013 classification of water suitability for irrigation was also done following the wilcox 1955 scheme which categorizes different waters into five classes fig 10 by combining the soluble sodium percent of the water to its corresponding ec measure high soluble sodium percent depicts soft water while low percent shows hard water thus combining the net effect of the na and ec of the groundwater in the study area it was observed that groundwater from 56 of communities may be suitable for irrigation purposes while 33 may be deemed as doubtful to unsuitable for irrigation table 5 these communities with unsuitable groundwater for irrigation had slightly high to very high ec values and were mostly close to the shore fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of the sodium percent in the groundwater and reveals very large number of the samples having high sodium content which may be due to seawater intrusion using the classification of waters for irrigation purposes by rhoades et al 1992 the groundwater in the study area may be put into 2 groups as shown in fig 12 the groundwater within area 1 constituting 40 of the samples is suitable for irrigation while the rest in area 2 is unsuitable as irrigation water most of the samples picked from communities closer to the sea showed higher ec values and corresponding low to high sar values the groundwater within communities close about 60 to the sea may not be suitable for irrigation due to the elevated salt contents which may reduce plant stand and growth rate as stated by rhoades et al 1992 the classification scheme by doneen 1975 was also used in analysing computed pi values of the groundwater and it was observed that about 29 of the samples had pi values above 75 and are most suitable for irrigation use while 47 out of 69 samples 68 fall between 25 and 75 and are classified as moderately suitable for irrigation only 2 samples were unsuitable to be used as irrigation water since their pi values were less than 25 3 5 ionic ratio the na cl ionic ratio from this study shows that 62 of the groundwater may have been contaminated by seawater since their na cl ratios were less than 0 86 while 27 may have been contaminated through some anthropogenic activities the groundwater samples showing lower na cl ionic ratios also had ec values higher than the threshold value of 1000 μs cm the combination of the ca mg and ca hco3 so4 ionic ratios indicate that approximately 48 of the sampled communities have groundwater that has been influenced by seawater intrusion the higher ratio of the ca hco3 so4 is an indication of the formation of ca cl brines rosenthal 1988 about 20 out of 43 samples with na cl ratios below 0 86 also showed ca hco3 so4 ratios greater than 1 chloride and bicarbonate ratios were also used to classify the groundwaters within the study area higher ratio values greater than 15 are classified as having salinity levels close to seawater 12 had such quality on the other hand low values less than 0 5 have no seawater influence the computed ratio results show that approximately 31 of the groundwaters have been influenced by the seawater intrusion resulting in their elevated salinity while approximately 8 have no influence from the seawater these 31 groundwater samples also showed high ec values greater than 1000 μs cm thus the results from the ionic ratios support the hypothesis that seawater intrusion is a contributing factor to contamination of freshwaters in the coastal aquifers 4 conclusion the study has assessed groundwater quality in some communities along the coastal areas of the central region of ghana for domestic and irrigation purposes using a combination of who guideline values wqi salinity indices and ionic ratios results from the combined use of the wqi and who guideline values analyses show that about 61 of the communities have excellent to good groundwater quality for domestic use whereas the remaining communities have unsuitable groundwater quality the unsuitable groundwater quality was observed to be mostly in boreholes drilled within the volcaniclastic sediments also irrigation suitability assessment of the groundwater based on sar na pi and ec versus na analyses show the groundwater in about 70 of the sampled communities in the study area were suitable for irrigation high ec and chloride concentrations were observed in the communities in proximity to the sea with the highest recorded at about 20 km away from the shore alkali elements na and k were the dominant cations while cl dominated over the other anions the groundwater in the study area is dominated by nacl water type 43 followed by the mghco3 20 water type and the mixed camgcl water type 20 which may be due to cation exchange as seawater encroaches the fresh coastal aquifers further analyses of na cl ca hco3 so4 and ca cl ionic ratios showed the high salinity in groundwater in some communities in the study area may be the result of seawater intrusion into the fresh coastal groundwater aquifers thus seawater intrusion may have affected the general groundwater quality in some communities of the study area and made them unsuitable for use these areas of unsuitable groundwater quality in the communities have been delineated through this study which may serve as useful information for practical application in the development of groundwater resources in the communities for water supply declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11947,lower rainfall coupled with higher evapotranspiration leads to enhanced salinity and inorganic contamination of groundwater in arid and semi arid regions in this study 100 groundwater samples were collected from a part of the thar desert of india and analysed for various physico chemical water quality parameters for quality assurance for potable water supply the electrical conductivity of the samples showed an ion enriched aquifer environment with high alkalinity the concentration of na so4 2 cl no3 and f ions in most of the samples were above the world health organization who guidelines for drinking water posing a major public health concern saturation indices si indicates that the dissolution of calcite bearing minerals and ion exchange were major processes controlling the groundwater chemistry in the region most of the samples are oversaturated with aragonite calcite chalcedony and dolomite while undersaturated with anhydrite gypsum halite the results suggest that weathering of aquifer minerals and salinization due to high evaporation controls the quality and origin of major ions the na cl and na hco3 water facies indicates the influence of evaporation and thus conducive condition for f enrichment in groundwater while no3 is mostly due to anthropogenic activities the health index hi for risk assessment suggests both f and no3 contribute to the health risk of the residing population as the hi values were found to be 1 in 97 and 93 for children and adults respectively the treatment technologies should be adopted to remove the multiple contaminants present in the groundwater of this region graphical abstract image 1 keywords contaminants desert nitrate saturation indices phreeqc health risk assessment 1 introduction groundwater resource has multiple dimensions characterized by its location occurrence size accessibility and therefore must be contemplated from the perspective of its demand and vulnerability to both anthropogenic and natural activities the occurrence of inorganic contaminants such as arsenic as fluoride f nitrate no3 and other heavy metals have both acute and chronic health implications singh et al 2017 adimalla et al 2018 while anthropogenic pursuits for instance excessive use of fertilizers unplanned urbanization overexploitation and untreated industrial discharge has the potential to alter the quality of groundwater lafthouhi et al 2003 the health impact of the contaminants also depends on the exposure dose frequency and the dietary intake of the exposed individuals kumar and singh 2020 in desertic aquifers apart from the topography and climatic conditions the overall hydrochemistry and genetic nature of groundwater is determined by geochemical processes such as soil water rock water interactions weathering and dissolution of aquifer minerals redox processes internal mixing and retention time due to constrained surface water availability in desertic regions groundwater augments most of the potable water supply and hence the quality assurance of groundwater is essential to meet the freshwater demand in such regions due to extreme climate evaporation rates are 20 30 times

among the major ions their ionic ratio and the mineral phases to decipher the major geochemical processes occurring in the desertic region of india further the groundwater contaminants and their associated health risk were assessed using health indices 2 study area 2 1 location and climate the study area is the part of the thar desert of india covering an area of around 9850 km2 fig 1 the study area is located between 70 80 e and 72 09 e longitude and between 26 32 w and 27 54 w latitude of the total rainfall received 90 is received during the monsoon season rest 10 in winter rainfall the annual precipitation in the region varies from 450 mm to 100 mm from east to west respectively huge variation in the mean annual temperature is observed during the summers it varies between 40 c and 50 c and during the winter s it varies between 3 c and 10 c because of very high temperatures and less rainfall the rate of evapotranspiration is very high the climatic variability is related to the dynamics of the south west monsoon the variability of the monsoon in this region is often linked with the expansion of eurasian tibetan snow cover which is linked with a change in albedo and weakens the monsoonal circulation roy et al 2008 based on the annual rainfall the study area falls under the semi arid to arid climatic region and towards west the aridity of the area increases 2 2 hydrogeology geologically the region is dominated by both mesozoic and tertiary formations the rocks in this region are mainly of delhi supergroup which mainly consist of mica schist quartzite and gneiss roy and smykatz kloss 2007 whereas the alwar and ajabgarh group consists of calcsilicates quartzite sand and schistose rocks a series of sedimentary rocks composed of sandstone limestone and shale is present along with the sand alluvium calcium nodules and blown sand igneous and metamorphic formations belonging to the lower proterozoic are also present in the region these igneous formations comprise of basalt and rhyolite the palaeozoic bap boulder bed along with dolomite and minor shale are also found in some regions deotare et al 2004 pokharan beds of the upper carboniferous age are exploited for groundwater groundwater occurs in unconfined condition in fractured granite rhyolite limestone and sandstone whereas it is semiconfined to confined in deeper aquifers the consolidated formations include granites and malani rhyolite and the sandstone and chacha limestone the semi consolidated formations are lathi jaisalmer bhadesar parewar sandstone groundwater in granites and rhyolites occur under unconfined conditions in joints fractures and are poor in yield of all aquifer forming materials younger alluvium is most prominent occupying about 37 of the area followed by different sandstones accounting for about 54 area spread over most of central southern and eastern parts 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling and analysis altogether 100 groundwater samples were randomly collected from the region the samples were collected in two separate polypropylene bottles with one of them acidified with hno3 ultrapure merck for cation analysis the sampling location was recorded using a handheld gps garmin gpsmap 60csx ph and ec electrical conductivity were measured using a combined oakton pcs tester 35 probe which was calibrated with 84 μs cm 1413 μs cm 12 8 ms cm conductivity standard and 4 0 7 0 and 10 0 ph standards respectively the acidified samples were analysed for major cations mg2 ca2 na and k using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific m series the detection limit was 0 1 μg l and the reproducibility was of the order of 5 unacidified unfiltered samples were analysed for the anions f cl so4 2 no3 using a dionex dx2000 ion chromatograph in gradient mode equipped with an as 11hc column dionex sunnyvale ca the bicarbonate hco3 anion was determined by titrimetric method as described in apha 2007 the commercially available standard stock solution analytical grade merck was repetitively used to check the instrument accuracy and was analysed after every 10 samples the analytical precision was determined by ncbi normalized ionic charge balance which ranged between 5 3 2 inverse geochemical modeling the saturation index si for the aqueous mineral phases were determined using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 the inverse geochemical modeling derives the saturation indices based on certain assumptions such as 1 the groundwater flow path is the same for two groundwater samples initial and the final 2 the role of diffusion process and the dispersion process does not have noteworthy role in defining the hydrogeochemistry 3 chemical steady state prevails aquifer system and 4 the mineral phases considered for inverse modeling are present in the region under study zhu and anderson 2002 the processes such as evaporation precipitation temperature mineralogical composition of rocks and geochemical reactions such as ion exchange adsorption dissolution and precipitation control the chemical nature of groundwater saturation indexes si evaluate the degree of equilibrium between water and respective mineral the saturation state can define the distinct phases of hydrochemical progression and thus geochemical reactions which plays important role in determining the geochemical nature of groundwater yidana et al 2011 the si of a mineral phase can be achieved by using equation 1 1 si log10 iap ksp where iap ion activity product of the dissociated mineral kt equilibrium solubility at mineral temperature positive values of si imply precipitation of minerals phases or outgassing of gaseous phase negative values indicate dissolution of mineral phases 3 3 health risk assessment exposure risk due to the presence of contaminants has been calculated using the established method provided by united state environmental protection agency usepa major components of this model include hazards identification dose response exposure and risk assessment in present study no3 and f have been considered as the major contaminants and the associated risk has been calculated for children and adults using the following formula 2 c d i e c i n g r e f e d a t b w where cdi is the chronic daily intake ec elemental concentration mg l ingr ingestion rate lit day ef exposure frequency days year ed exposure duration year at average time ed 365 bw body weight kg the conversion factors along with the details of the data obtained is presented in table 1 3 h q c d i r f d the reference dose for both no3 and f have been used to calculate the hazardous quotient hq the values for rfd no3 has been used 1 6 mg kg day while for f it has been considered as 0 06 mg kg day usepa 2014 adimalla et al 2018 li et al 2018 4 h i h q i the hazardous index hi has been calculated by adding the values of hq obtained for f and no3 using equation 4 both the contaminants i e f and no3 are considered as non carcinogenic however hi 1 indicates that the non carcinogenic health risk of the contaminant exceeds the permissible limit while hi 1 suggests that it is under acceptable limit usepa 2014 3 4 geospatial database for spatial distribution of water quality parameters the geospatial database was prepared by importing the gps locations of the collected samples in gis environment the attribute consisting of lab analysed parameters were inserted into respective samples based on its location the spatial distribution of the groundwater quality parameters was studied using the spatial analyst extension of arcgis 10 1 we used the inverse distance weighing idw method for interpolation of water quality variables in idw the weights are calculated by the inverse distance from an observed position to the point being approximated 4 results and discussion 4 1 genetic origin and distribution of major ions the ph in the region ranged between 7 4 and 8 6 mean 7 9 depicting the alkaline nature of groundwater the ec values ranged between 890 and 12000 μs cm mean 2886 μs cm and tds values ranged between 449 and 5296 mg l 1787 87 mg l the region experiences high temperature most of the time in the year and therefore has high rate of evaporation thus salt encrustations are common on the soil surface these might percolate with surface water during rainfall thus high values of ec and tds are observed based on the mean concentration the order of cations is na ca2 mg2 k na ca2 and mg2 contribute 74 37 14 10 and 8 43 of total cations respectively high rates of evaporation due to semi arid climate poor drainage density and longer residence time of water contributes high concentration of ions in groundwater kamolpornwijit et al 2003 kumar et al 2018 4 1 1 genetic origin of anions the dominance of anions follows the order cl hco3 so4 2 no3 f of the total anions they contribute 42 32 14 11 1 respectively cl varies between 70 and 2233 mg l mean of 541 mg l cl is highly soluble is chemically conservative passes and interacts with soil and rock cl in groundwater is a result of dissolution of halites dry fallout from the atmosphere due to aridity in the region walker et al 1991 huang et al 2017 due to the existence of a number of saline lakes playas in the region and the movement percolation or recharge of groundwater through sedimentary bedrock minerals cl concentration is enhanced in the subsurface aquifers the presence of hco3 is an indicator of alkalinity ranging between 158 and 1220 mg l mean of 414 mg l the high concentration of hco3 can be attributed to the presence of carbonate rocks dolomite and limestone in the region the carbonate and silicate weathering feldspar and micas along with the root respiration and organic matter mineralization can contribute hco3 in groundwater robert and berthelin 1986 however in present study there is very negligible chance of root respiration and organic matter mineralization as vegetation in this region consists of scattered shrubs and thorny bushes high hco3 dominance is observed in the central and southern part of the study region due to the presence of calcium carbonate nodules shales dolomite singh et al 2013 ahmad et al 2020 so4 2 varied between 19 and 852 mg l mean of 183 1 mg l fig 2 marine deposits are also considered as the major contributor of so4 2 mineralogically gypsum and anhydrite minerals would also be a contributor towards high so4 2 in the region when so4 2 concentrations in groundwater exceed 100 mg l evaporitic so4 2 minerals or oxidation of pyrite often predominates which can be considered as lithogenic sources of so4 2 the so4 2 concentration varies between 481 and 851 mg l which is indicative of the gypsum dissolution the region towards the north of study area phalsund is rich in gypsum deposits with prevalence of gypsum mines in the region the gypsum occurs both in amorphous and crystalline form at the depth varying from few centimetres to 5 cm in the region joshi 1999 the no3 varies from 5 to 1050 mg l mean of 149 mg l waste disposal network animal wastes and livestock and human excreta are a few anthropogenic sources that indirectly enriches nitrate in groundwater suthar et al 2009 indicated that livestock rearing is occupation of rural communities in this region and therefore animal excreta could be an important contributor of groundwater no3 the total livestock population in the region is comparatively high and might be contributing n equivalent to 42 055 07 tones year the livestock excreta are dumped in open areas which might slowly leach no3 in groundwater during wet season however natural phenomena such as lightning during rainfall over very long periods might have accumulated the nitrate in the aquifers which is common in desertic regions walvoord et al 2003 the spatial distribution of f depicts that except in central and the western region it is found to be greater than permissible limits of 1 5 mg l fig 2 the f ranged between 0 1 and 6 6 mg l mean of 2 2 mg l 4 1 2 origin of major cations the dissolution of minerals in a granitic aquifer yields the major cations ca2 mg2 na k the na ranged between 67 and 1534 mg l mean of 446 mg l feldspar the most dominant phase in silicate weathering albite anorthite contributes na to the groundwater freeze and cherry 1979 as 5 2 n a a l s i 3 o 8 a l b i t e 9

in some areas of western and eastern part fig 2 the area has large deposits of malani granite and rhyolite rhyollite contains minerals such as quartz feldspar and plagioclase with some amount of biotite and hornblende dissolution of all these minerals contributes ca2 and na along with hco3 calcretes are prominent in arid environment of hot deserts where evaporation exceeds precipitation the occurrence of carbonate nodules in the soil reflects precipitation of calcium carbonate due to the continuous process of evapotranspiration that takes place through the thorny shrubs in the region datta et al 1996 nevertheless during ion exchange ca2 ions react with the clay minerals such as sodium montmorillonite to release na ions and enriching them in groundwater argamasilla et al 2017 the region is known for commercial bentonitic clay extraction the bentonitic clay in the region consists of 75 of montmorillonite and 25 of it comprised of other clay minerals such as kaolinite illite atapalgite quartz and feldspar similarly the region is also known for its mineral resources such as fullers earth white clay and dolomitic clay apart from these clay resources the region is rich in rock phosphate limestone yellow marble ca2 ranged between 20 and 228 mg l mean of 84 mg l k concentration ranged between 2 7 and 117 4 mg l mean of 18 5 mg l the spatial distribution of k shows high presence in the northern most part of the region fig 2 the source of k in groundwater is likely to be the weathering of k feldspar and to some extent the use of synthetic fertilizers however resistance of k minerals towards weathering and its fixation in clay minerals are accountable for low k in groundwater 4 2 geochemical modeling 4 2 1 geochemical facies the water facies indicate the signature of natural water recharge and soil rock mineralization the cations na ca2 and mg2 and anions cl hco3 dominate in the groundwater the major water facies are na cl hco3 na ca cl hco3 na cl or na ca mg cl hco3 the water facies indicate a strong influence of evaporation in the region fig 3 the na cl hco3 water type indicates the interaction of water with rocks comprising of schist granites and quartzites the enrichment of na ca2 and mg2 from schist and granite to groundwater leads to alkali enrichment in the aquifer ca2 mg2 and na are liberated from silicates minerals when surface water is charged with atmospheric and biogenic co2 which infiltrates with water recharge a rise in ph and hco3 is observed in groundwater freeze and cherry 1979 due to incongruent dissolution weathering of silicates and dissolution of calcite gypsum along with the ion exchange process are accountable for dominance of na mg2 ca2 and hco3 in groundwater the dissolution of gases and minerals particularly co2 and co3 2 related compounds in atmosphere and in the unsaturated zone during precipitation average annual rainfall is 209 mm and infiltration impart hco3 type signature to water shanyengana et al 2004 4 2 2 saturation indices saturation indices are useful indicators to determine the reactivity of the minerals in groundwater dissolved atmospheric co2 in the rainwater along with the co2 available in the soil zone due to microbial and root respiration acts as a buffering agent and contributes both alkalinity and acidity in groundwater system silicate hydrolysis processes act as one of the external sources of co2 g banks and frengstad 2006 the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in the soil is greater than the atmospheric partial pressure of co2 g pco2 of 10 3 5 bar mirtov 1961 thus solubilizing co2 from different sources in the aquifer environment the increased p co2 for soil pore water impacts the interaction with carbonate minerals present in surface and sub surface sediments partial pressures of co2 pco2 in the groundwater were calculated from ph and alkalinity using equation 6 7 log p c o 2 7 9 log a h 2 c o 3 p h partial pressure of co2 in the study area ranged from 10 1 63 to 10 3 09 the dissolved co2 enters the water table through void spaces in soil it is observed that all samples are undersaturated with anhydrite gypsum halite and co2 thus significantly contributing ca2 mg2 and other ions to the groundwater by dissolution of these minerals the samples are oversaturated with minerals aragonite calcite chalcedony and dolomite suggesting alternative source of ca2 fig s1 the empirical relation between calcite precipitation and aragonite dissolution indicates these two processes to be majorly controlling the ca2 and hco3 in groundwater the dissolved co2 due to partial pressure difference forms carbonic acid h2co3 which dissociates releasing h and thus a subsequent fall in the ph is observed the carbonate minerals dissolve calcite and dolomite in an acidic environment in comparison to dolomite dissolution of calcite is a relatively rapid reaction plummer et al 1979 drever 1982 and thus ca2 ion rapidly acquired in the aquifer environment a high ca2 environment on reacting with dolomite acquires mg2 during infiltration and increases its content of ca2 co3 2 and hco3 this leads to supersaturation of calcite and thus to retain the equilibrium the calcite precipitates the increasing loss of ca2 and co3 2 ions then lead to dissolution of more dolomite this is the sequential dissolution of dolomite calcite or incongruent dissolution of dolomite freeze and cherry 1979 drever 1982 appelo and postma 1996 on the other hand generally much of carbonate weathering occurs under open system conditions where the soil co2 reservoir and organics replenish the acidity consumed by mineral dissolution this results in maintaining constant pco2 and restrains ph to neutral range when meets soil co2 but in closed system condition like in this study area co2 gained during infiltration through the soil will prevent excessive carbonate weathering and maintaining low pco2 with alkaline environment the region under study has an arid climate thus low rainfall and high temperature which leads to precipitation of calcite minerals and that the groundwater has enough residence time for mineral to reach equilibrium 4 3 hydro geochemical process 4 3 1 weathering and dissolution the relationships of molar and ionic ratio reveal the source of solutes and the mechanisms that develop the geochemical nature of groundwater the hydro chemical data was subjected to several conventional ionic ration and graphical plots to identify the major hydro geochemical processes occurring in the region in a scatter plot of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 fig 4 a most of the samples are present above the equiline indicating excess of ca2 mg2 over hco3 so4 2 thus indicating dominance of carbonate weathering and ion exchange srinivasamoorthy et al 2008 kumar and singh 2015 clift et al 2020 the samples below the equiline indicates silicate weathering and reverse ion exchange as dominant process the plot of na na ca2 ratio vs log of tds values depicts dominance of rock weathering and the salinization the salinization in the arid climate conditions results due to frequent evaporation and crystallization of salt components blinkhorn et al 2020 ion exchange and reverse ion exchange are simultaneously occurring in the groundwater system the carbonic acid h2co3 initiates the dissolution of aquifer minerals in the flow path of groundwater a general reaction for weathering of silicate rocks with h2co3 can be written as 8 n a m g 2 c a 2 k s i l i c a t e h 2 c o 3 h 4 s i o 4 h c o 3 n a m g 2 c a 2 k c l a y ca2 mg2 ratio depicts the dissolution of dolomite and calcite in groundwater and the ratio 1 indicates dissolution of dolomite while ratio 1 indicates calcite dissolution 61 out of 100 samples have ca2 mg2 values 1 indicating dissolution of calcite is dominant in study region 4 3 2 evaporation the molar ratio of na cl of groundwater ranged from 0 48 to 3 69 fig 4b the na cl molar ratio is 1 when na is contributed due to halite dissolution however a value greater than 1 depicts the na being contributed due to silicate weathering singh et al 2017 the molar ratio of na cl for the groundwater samples shows values greater than 1 indicating dominance of silicate weathering in geochemical character of groundwater whereas a handful of samples shows the molar ratio less than 1 indicating prominence of halite dissolution rafique et al 2015 the scatter plot of na k vs cl shows most of the samples falling above the equiline and thus formation of alkali carbonates or alkali sulphate due to abundance of alkalies fig 4c the na is dominant alkali compared to k in the groundwater samples because the k offers higher resistance towards chemical weathering due to its strong adsorption over clay minerals sunkari et al 2020 high concentration of cations might also be due to the silicate weathering or saline soil present in the study area singh et al 2017 4 3 3 ion exchange the na vs cl plot suggestive of na from silicate weathering for samples above the equiline and those below the equiline indicate dominance of evaporation fig 4d most of the groundwater samples are above the equiline thus indicating silicate weathering which is also a source of na cation exchange might also add na into groundwater as alkaline soil is common in the study region and na is abundant in ca2 mg2 vs cl plot samples below the equiline indicates evaporation while those falling above the equiline implies dominance of ion exchange fig 4e 4 3 4 sea water influences the so4 2 mg l cl mg l ratio is used as a proxy to identify the mixing of freshwater and seawater steinich et al 1996 boumaiza et al 2020 the so4 2 cl 1000 with a value of 103 4 signifies likelihood of seawater steinich et al 1996 proposed two categories 1 samples with so4 2 cl ratio similar to seawater and 2 samples with ratio of so4 2 cl greater than 300 affected evaporites dissolution the spatial distribution of above formulation of sea water depicts category 1 according to above classification in north ne and se of study area i e the samples are similar in composition to seawater the western nw and sw part of study region which are underlain by sandstones and siltstones shows category 2 of the classification mainly impacted by evaporites 5 public health 5 1 nitrate contamination the who guidelines for no3 45 mg l in groundwater is found to be of public health concern in the study region out of 100 samples 70 samples have no3 above who limits whereas almost 13 samples were found to have no3 above 300 mg l the replicate and duplicate readings of the samples were taken and was found to be within the range of 3 46 samples show the contamination of both no3 and f however the sources for both are entirely different the no3 contamination is majorly due to anthropogenic sources and f contamination is mainly geogenic in nature high spatial variation in no3 concentration indicates effect of point and non point sources the central part of the study area is affected with high no3 fig 2 which is mostly under the agricultural activities along with agriculture fertilizers use sewage drainage leakage from the septic tanks and human and animal wastes are considered as the major anthropogenic source of nitrate singh et al 2017 in these semi arid arid regions the high no3 are also due to land used for cattle grazing manure lafthouhi et al 2003 the region is also dominated by fauna such as prosopis acacia zyziphus calotropis salvadora these plants species are highly productive and can accumulate an average of 25 35 kgn ha yr rundel et al 1982 while once dead and decomposed it can also contribute high no3 in groundwater system natural sources such as presence of no3 and ammonium nh4 in precipitation evaporative enrichment of dry and wet deposition and natural assimilation of atmospheric n2 by nitrogen fixing bacteria also contributes no3 in groundwater walvoord et al 2003 5 2 fluoride contamination fluoride is micronutrient required for development of bones and tooth in humans while its excess intake may cause several skeletal health problems resulting into fluorosis 62 out of 100 samples showed high f above who limits of 1 5 mg l in semi arid environment dissolution of f bearing minerals is often consider as a major factor governing the f mobilization in groundwater saxena and ahmed 2003 the fluoride contamination has been discussed in singh et al 2013 singh and mukherjee 2015 the si values of fluorite mineral is found to be less than 1 thus indicating fluorite dissolution as one of the possible sources of high f in groundwater fig 5 a high ph along with high hco3 na favours the release of f into aquifer matrix fluorite dissolution has been observed in sandstone granitic terrain leading to f enrichment in groundwater the si values indicate that the groundwater is saturated with calcite and dolomite while undersaturated with fluorite fig 5a b 5c 5d the presence of hco3 can also enhance fluorite dissolution 5 3 human health risk high concentration of no3 and f in drinking water can cause serious health problem in adults and children in present study non carcinogenic health impact of both inorganic contaminants has been calculated and presented in fig 6 hazardous quotient hq values suggest that the health risk of no3 and f is high for both the age group considered in the study as the hq for adult ranges from 0 1 to 23 4 and 0 04 3 9 whereas for children it ranges from 0 1 to 30 6 and 0 06 5 13 the values of hazardous indices vary from 0 7 to 25 1 for adults and 93 out of 100 collected samples have hi values 1 however for children the hi ranges from 0 9 to 32 8 and all except 2 samples 98 have hi 1 indicating severe contamination and thus the water should be treated before consumption children are more susceptible to chronic and critical effects of intake of inorganic organic contaminants given that they consume more of these contaminants per unit of their body weight compared to adults the degree of health risk is found much higher in children as it depends on the contaminant concentration body weight and reference dosages no3 was found to pose more serious problem due to its high concentration in groundwater and associated health risks in children 6 conclusion the source of potable water supply in the study area is only groundwater results indicate that the dissolution of calcium bearing minerals i e calcite gypsum and ion exchange process are major processes responsible for dominance of na mg2 ca2 and hco3 in groundwater while exchange of na k by ca2 and mg2 sorbed on the surface of clay minerals enhances the concentration of these ions in aquifer the extreme climate coupled with the dissolution and precipitation of minerals ion exchange seems as the major factor controlling in determining the genetic origin of groundwater salinity is found as the problem in this region along with high no3 and f which are major health concern the immediate intervention could be testing of groundwater sources in the region so that the identified high risk sources could be avoided for drinking and cooking the high fluoride and no3 handpumps tubewells should be marked and an awareness should be raised within the communities to use safe handpumps tubewells preferably villages with high tds no3 and f problems should be supplied with community based reverse osmosis systems filtration unit the groundwater matrix is very complex and therefore the technologies to remove these contaminants should be implemented and modified according to the regional hydrogeological settings the remediation measure mostly implemented in rajasthan is defluoridation plants however it seems the regions is impacted by multiple contaminants in water and therefore the mitigation options should be exercised only after proper verification of the groundwater contamination funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors findings dissolution and ion exchange coupled with climatic factors plays important role in hydrogeochemistry high tds no3 and f in groundwater are major health concern indicating high risk for both children and adults availability of data and material there are no linked research data sets for this

11947,lower rainfall coupled with higher evapotranspiration leads to enhanced salinity and inorganic contamination of groundwater in arid and semi arid regions in this study 100 groundwater samples were collected from a part of the thar desert of india and analysed for various physico chemical water quality parameters for quality assurance for potable water supply the electrical conductivity of the samples showed an ion enriched aquifer environment with high alkalinity the concentration of na so4 2 cl no3 and f ions in most of the samples were above the world health organization who guidelines for drinking water posing a major public health concern saturation indices si indicates that the dissolution of calcite bearing minerals and ion exchange were major processes controlling the groundwater chemistry in the region most of the samples are oversaturated with aragonite calcite chalcedony and dolomite while undersaturated with anhydrite gypsum halite the results suggest that weathering of aquifer minerals and salinization due to high evaporation controls the quality and origin of major ions the na cl and na hco3 water facies indicates the influence of evaporation and thus conducive condition for f enrichment in groundwater while no3 is mostly due to anthropogenic activities the health index hi for risk assessment suggests both f and no3 contribute to the health risk of the residing population as the hi values were found to be 1 in 97 and 93 for children and adults respectively the treatment technologies should be adopted to remove the multiple contaminants present in the groundwater of this region graphical abstract image 1 keywords contaminants desert nitrate saturation indices phreeqc health risk assessment 1 introduction groundwater resource has multiple dimensions characterized by its location occurrence size accessibility and therefore must be contemplated from the perspective of its demand and vulnerability to both anthropogenic and natural activities the occurrence of inorganic contaminants such as arsenic as fluoride f nitrate no3 and other heavy metals have both acute and chronic health implications singh et al 2017 adimalla et al 2018 while anthropogenic pursuits for instance excessive use of fertilizers unplanned urbanization overexploitation and untreated industrial discharge has the potential to alter the quality of groundwater lafthouhi et al 2003 the health impact of the contaminants also depends on the exposure dose frequency and the dietary intake of the exposed individuals kumar and singh 2020 in desertic aquifers apart from the topography and climatic conditions the overall hydrochemistry and genetic nature of groundwater is determined by geochemical processes such as soil water rock water interactions weathering and dissolution of aquifer minerals redox processes internal mixing and retention time due to constrained surface water availability in desertic regions groundwater augments most of the potable water supply and hence the quality assurance of groundwater is essential to meet the freshwater demand in such regions due to extreme climate evaporation rates are 20 30 times higher in desertic regions promoting highly alkaline conditions and salinization of soil and groundwater jalali 2007 singh et al 2013 singh and mukherjee 2015 the residence time of groundwater the ratio of quantity in storage to the average rate of recharge or discharge ranges from months in shallow aquifers to million years in deep aquifers sturchio et al 2004 several methods such as chemometric analysis singh et al 2017 kumar et al 2020 trace element structural equation modeling belkhiri et al 2018 mineral phase equilibrium el alfy et al 2017 hydro geochemical modeling mallick et al 2018 ionic ratio along with the traditional graphical plots has been widely used to understand the geochemical evolution of groundwater health indices have been extensively used for human health risk assessment to estimate contaminant exposure zhang et al 2017 singh and kumar 2017 adimalla et al 2018 kumar and singh 2020 the health risk assessment of the contaminants in groundwater can be done using health indices such as chronic daily intake through ingestion cdi hazardous quotient hq and hazardous index hi using the us epa standards in this study we evaluate the inter relationship among the major ions their ionic ratio and the mineral phases to decipher the major geochemical processes occurring in the desertic region of india further the groundwater contaminants and their associated health risk were assessed using health indices 2 study area 2 1 location and climate the study area is the part of the thar desert of india covering an area of around 9850 km2 fig 1 the study area is located between 70 80 e and 72 09 e longitude and between 26 32 w and 27 54 w latitude of the total rainfall received 90 is received during the monsoon season rest 10 in winter rainfall the annual precipitation in the region varies from 450 mm to 100 mm from east to west respectively huge variation in the mean annual temperature is observed during the summers it varies between 40 c and 50 c and during the winter s it varies between 3 c and 10 c because of very high temperatures and less rainfall the rate of evapotranspiration is very high the climatic variability is related to the dynamics of the south west monsoon the variability of the monsoon in this region is often linked with the expansion of eurasian tibetan snow cover which is linked with a change in albedo and weakens the monsoonal circulation roy et al 2008 based on the annual rainfall the study area falls under the semi arid to arid climatic region and towards west the aridity of the area increases 2 2 hydrogeology geologically the region is dominated by both mesozoic and tertiary formations the rocks in this region are mainly of delhi supergroup which mainly consist of mica schist quartzite and gneiss roy and smykatz kloss 2007 whereas the alwar and ajabgarh group consists of calcsilicates quartzite sand and schistose rocks a series of sedimentary rocks composed of sandstone limestone and shale is present along with the sand alluvium calcium nodules and blown sand igneous and metamorphic formations belonging to the lower proterozoic are also present in the region these igneous formations comprise of basalt and rhyolite the palaeozoic bap boulder bed along with dolomite and minor shale are also found in some regions deotare et al 2004 pokharan beds of the upper carboniferous age are exploited for groundwater groundwater occurs in unconfined condition in fractured granite rhyolite limestone and sandstone whereas it is semiconfined to confined in deeper aquifers the consolidated formations include granites and malani rhyolite and the sandstone and chacha limestone the semi consolidated formations are lathi jaisalmer bhadesar parewar sandstone groundwater in granites and rhyolites occur under unconfined conditions in joints fractures and are poor in yield of all aquifer forming materials younger alluvium is most prominent occupying about 37 of the area followed by different sandstones accounting for about 54 area spread over most of central southern and eastern parts 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling and analysis altogether 100 groundwater samples were randomly collected from the region the samples were collected in two separate polypropylene bottles with one of them acidified with hno3 ultrapure merck for cation analysis the sampling location was recorded using a handheld gps garmin gpsmap 60csx ph and ec electrical conductivity were measured using a combined oakton pcs tester 35 probe which was calibrated with 84 μs cm 1413 μs cm 12 8 ms cm conductivity standard and 4 0 7 0 and 10 0 ph standards respectively the acidified samples were analysed for major cations mg2 ca2 na and k using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific m series the detection limit was 0 1 μg l and the reproducibility was of the order of 5 unacidified unfiltered samples were analysed for the anions f cl so4 2 no3 using a dionex dx2000 ion chromatograph in gradient mode equipped with an as 11hc column dionex sunnyvale ca the bicarbonate hco3 anion was determined by titrimetric method as described in apha 2007 the commercially available standard stock solution analytical grade merck was repetitively used to check the instrument accuracy and was analysed after every 10 samples the analytical precision was determined by ncbi normalized ionic charge balance which ranged between 5 3 2 inverse geochemical modeling the saturation index si for the aqueous mineral phases were determined using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 the inverse geochemical modeling derives the saturation indices based on certain assumptions such as 1 the groundwater flow path is the same for two groundwater samples initial and the final 2 the role of diffusion process and the dispersion process does not have noteworthy role in defining the hydrogeochemistry 3 chemical steady state prevails aquifer system and 4 the mineral phases considered for inverse modeling are present in the region under study zhu and anderson 2002 the processes such as evaporation precipitation temperature mineralogical composition of rocks and geochemical reactions such as ion exchange adsorption dissolution and precipitation control the chemical nature of groundwater saturation indexes si evaluate the degree of equilibrium between water and respective mineral the saturation state can define the distinct phases of hydrochemical progression and thus geochemical reactions which plays important role in determining the geochemical nature of groundwater yidana et al 2011 the si of a mineral phase can be achieved by using equation 1 1 si log10 iap ksp where iap ion activity product of the dissociated mineral kt equilibrium solubility at mineral temperature positive values of si imply precipitation of minerals phases or outgassing of gaseous phase negative values indicate dissolution of mineral phases 3 3 health risk assessment exposure risk due to the presence of contaminants has been calculated using the established method provided by united state environmental protection agency usepa major components of this model include hazards identification dose response exposure and risk assessment in present study no3 and f have been considered as the major contaminants and the associated risk has been calculated for children and adults using the following formula 2 c d i e c i n g r e f e d a t b w where cdi is the chronic daily intake ec elemental concentration mg l ingr ingestion rate lit day ef exposure frequency days year ed exposure duration year at average time ed 365 bw body weight kg the conversion factors along with the details of the data obtained is presented in table 1 3 h q c d i r f d the reference dose for both no3 and f have been used to calculate the hazardous quotient hq the values for rfd no3 has been used 1 6 mg kg day while for f it has been considered as 0 06 mg kg day usepa 2014 adimalla et al 2018 li et al 2018 4 h i h q i the hazardous index hi has been calculated by adding the values of hq obtained for f and no3 using equation 4 both the contaminants i e f and no3 are considered as non carcinogenic however hi 1 indicates that the non carcinogenic health risk of the contaminant exceeds the permissible limit while hi 1 suggests that it is under acceptable limit usepa 2014 3 4 geospatial database for spatial distribution of water quality parameters the geospatial database was prepared by importing the gps locations of the collected samples in gis environment the attribute consisting of lab analysed parameters were inserted into respective samples based on its location the spatial distribution of the groundwater quality parameters was studied using the spatial analyst extension of arcgis 10 1 we used the inverse distance weighing idw method for interpolation of water quality variables in idw the weights are calculated by the inverse distance from an observed position to the point being approximated 4 results and discussion 4 1 genetic origin and distribution of major ions the ph in the region ranged between 7 4 and 8 6 mean 7 9 depicting the alkaline nature of groundwater the ec values ranged between 890 and 12000 μs cm mean 2886 μs cm and tds values ranged between 449 and 5296 mg l 1787 87 mg l the region experiences high temperature most of the time in the year and therefore has high rate of evaporation thus salt encrustations are common on the soil surface these might percolate with surface water during rainfall thus high values of ec and tds are observed based on the mean concentration the order of cations is na ca2 mg2 k na ca2 and mg2 contribute 74 37 14 10 and 8 43 of total cations respectively high rates of evaporation due to semi arid climate poor drainage density and longer residence time of water contributes high concentration of ions in groundwater kamolpornwijit et al 2003 kumar et al 2018 4 1 1 genetic origin of anions the dominance of anions follows the order cl hco3 so4 2 no3 f of the total anions they contribute 42 32 14 11 1 respectively cl varies between 70 and 2233 mg l mean of 541 mg l cl is highly soluble is chemically conservative passes and interacts with soil and rock cl in groundwater is a result of dissolution of halites dry fallout from the atmosphere due to aridity in the region walker et al 1991 huang et al 2017 due to the existence of a number of saline lakes playas in the region and the movement percolation or recharge of groundwater through sedimentary bedrock minerals cl concentration is enhanced in the subsurface aquifers the presence of hco3 is an indicator of alkalinity ranging between 158 and 1220 mg l mean of 414 mg l the high concentration of hco3 can be attributed to the presence of carbonate rocks dolomite and limestone in the region the carbonate and silicate weathering feldspar and micas along with the root respiration and organic matter mineralization can contribute hco3 in groundwater robert and berthelin 1986 however in present study there is very negligible chance of root respiration and organic matter mineralization as vegetation in this region consists of scattered shrubs and thorny bushes high hco3 dominance is observed in the central and southern part of the study region due to the presence of calcium carbonate nodules shales dolomite singh et al 2013 ahmad et al 2020 so4 2 varied between 19 and 852 mg l mean of 183 1 mg l fig 2 marine deposits are also considered as the major contributor of so4 2 mineralogically gypsum and anhydrite minerals would also be a contributor towards high so4 2 in the region when so4 2 concentrations in groundwater exceed 100 mg l evaporitic so4 2 minerals or oxidation of pyrite often predominates which can be considered as lithogenic sources of so4 2 the so4 2 concentration varies between 481 and 851 mg l which is indicative of the gypsum dissolution the region towards the north of study area phalsund is rich in gypsum deposits with prevalence of gypsum mines in the region the gypsum occurs both in amorphous and crystalline form at the depth varying from few centimetres to 5 cm in the region joshi 1999 the no3 varies from 5 to 1050 mg l mean of 149 mg l waste disposal network animal wastes and livestock and human excreta are a few anthropogenic sources that indirectly enriches nitrate in groundwater suthar et al 2009 indicated that livestock rearing is occupation of rural communities in this region and therefore animal excreta could be an important contributor of groundwater no3 the total livestock population in the region is comparatively high and might be contributing n equivalent to 42 055 07 tones year the livestock excreta are dumped in open areas which might slowly leach no3 in groundwater during wet season however natural phenomena such as lightning during rainfall over very long periods might have accumulated the nitrate in the aquifers which is common in desertic regions walvoord et al 2003 the spatial distribution of f depicts that except in central and the western region it is found to be greater than permissible limits of 1 5 mg l fig 2 the f ranged between 0 1 and 6 6 mg l mean of 2 2 mg l 4 1 2 origin of major cations the dissolution of minerals in a granitic aquifer yields the major cations ca2 mg2 na k the na ranged between 67 and 1534 mg l mean of 446 mg l feldspar the most dominant phase in silicate weathering albite anorthite contributes na to the groundwater freeze and cherry 1979 as 5 2 n a a l s i 3 o 8 a l b i t e 9

in some areas of western and eastern part fig 2 the area has large deposits of malani granite and rhyolite rhyollite contains minerals such as quartz feldspar and plagioclase with some amount of biotite and hornblende dissolution of all these minerals contributes ca2 and na along with hco3 calcretes are prominent in arid environment of hot deserts where evaporation exceeds precipitation the occurrence of carbonate nodules in the soil reflects precipitation of calcium carbonate due to the continuous process of evapotranspiration that takes place through the thorny shrubs in the region datta et al 1996 nevertheless during ion exchange ca2 ions react with the clay minerals such as sodium montmorillonite to release na ions and enriching them in groundwater argamasilla et al 2017 the region is known for commercial bentonitic clay extraction the bentonitic clay in the region consists of 75 of montmorillonite and 25 of it comprised of other clay minerals such as kaolinite illite atapalgite quartz and feldspar similarly the region is also known for its mineral resources such as fullers earth white clay and dolomitic clay apart from these clay resources the region is rich in rock phosphate limestone yellow marble ca2 ranged between 20 and 228 mg l mean of 84 mg l k concentration ranged between 2 7 and 117 4 mg l mean of 18 5 mg l the spatial distribution of k shows high presence in the northern most part of the region fig 2 the source of k in groundwater is likely to be the weathering of k feldspar and to some extent the use of synthetic fertilizers however resistance of k minerals towards weathering and its fixation in clay minerals are accountable for low k in groundwater 4 2 geochemical modeling 4 2 1 geochemical facies the water facies indicate the signature of natural water recharge and soil rock mineralization the cations na ca2 and mg2 and anions cl hco3 dominate in the groundwater the major water facies are na cl hco3 na ca cl hco3 na cl or na ca mg cl hco3 the water facies indicate a strong influence of evaporation in the region fig 3 the na cl hco3 water type indicates the interaction of water with rocks comprising of schist granites and quartzites the enrichment of na ca2 and mg2 from schist and granite to groundwater leads to alkali enrichment in the aquifer ca2 mg2 and na are liberated from silicates minerals when surface water is charged with atmospheric and biogenic co2 which infiltrates with water recharge a rise in ph and hco3 is observed in groundwater freeze and cherry 1979 due to incongruent dissolution weathering of silicates and dissolution of calcite gypsum along with the ion exchange process are accountable for dominance of na mg2 ca2 and hco3 in groundwater the dissolution of gases and minerals particularly co2 and co3 2 related compounds in atmosphere and in the unsaturated zone during precipitation average annual rainfall is 209 mm and infiltration impart hco3 type signature to water shanyengana et al 2004 4 2 2 saturation indices saturation indices are useful indicators to determine the reactivity of the minerals in groundwater dissolved atmospheric co2 in the rainwater along with the co2 available in the soil zone due to microbial and root respiration acts as a buffering agent and contributes both alkalinity and acidity in groundwater system silicate hydrolysis processes act as one of the external sources of co2 g banks and frengstad 2006 the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in the soil is greater than the atmospheric partial pressure of co2 g pco2 of 10 3 5 bar mirtov 1961 thus solubilizing co2 from different sources in the aquifer environment the increased p co2 for soil pore water impacts the interaction with carbonate minerals present in surface and sub surface sediments partial pressures of co2 pco2 in the groundwater were calculated from ph and alkalinity using equation 6 7 log p c o 2 7 9 log a h 2 c o 3 p h partial pressure of co2 in the study area ranged from 10 1 63 to 10 3 09 the dissolved co2 enters the water table through void spaces in soil it is observed that all samples are undersaturated with anhydrite gypsum halite and co2 thus significantly contributing ca2 mg2 and other ions to the groundwater by dissolution of these minerals the samples are oversaturated with minerals aragonite calcite chalcedony and dolomite suggesting alternative source of ca2 fig s1 the empirical relation between calcite precipitation and aragonite dissolution indicates these two processes to be majorly controlling the ca2 and hco3 in groundwater the dissolved co2 due to partial pressure difference forms carbonic acid h2co3 which dissociates releasing h and thus a subsequent fall in the ph is observed the carbonate minerals dissolve calcite and dolomite in an acidic environment in comparison to dolomite dissolution of calcite is a relatively rapid reaction plummer et al 1979 drever 1982 and thus ca2 ion rapidly acquired in the aquifer environment a high ca2 environment on reacting with dolomite acquires mg2 during infiltration and increases its content of ca2 co3 2 and hco3 this leads to supersaturation of calcite and thus to retain the equilibrium the calcite precipitates the increasing loss of ca2 and co3 2 ions then lead to dissolution of more dolomite this is the sequential dissolution of dolomite calcite or incongruent dissolution of dolomite freeze and cherry 1979 drever 1982 appelo and postma 1996 on the other hand generally much of carbonate weathering occurs under open system conditions where the soil co2 reservoir and organics replenish the acidity consumed by mineral dissolution this results in maintaining constant pco2 and restrains ph to neutral range when meets soil co2 but in closed system condition like in this study area co2 gained during infiltration through the soil will prevent excessive carbonate weathering and maintaining low pco2 with alkaline environment the region under study has an arid climate thus low rainfall and high temperature which leads to precipitation of calcite minerals and that the groundwater has enough residence time for mineral to reach equilibrium 4 3 hydro geochemical process 4 3 1 weathering and dissolution the relationships of molar and ionic ratio reveal the source of solutes and the mechanisms that develop the geochemical nature of groundwater the hydro chemical data was subjected to several conventional ionic ration and graphical plots to identify the major hydro geochemical processes occurring in the region in a scatter plot of ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 fig 4 a most of the samples are present above the equiline indicating excess of ca2 mg2 over hco3 so4 2 thus indicating dominance of carbonate weathering and ion exchange srinivasamoorthy et al 2008 kumar and singh 2015 clift et al 2020 the samples below the equiline indicates silicate weathering and reverse ion exchange as dominant process the plot of na na ca2 ratio vs log of tds values depicts dominance of rock weathering and the salinization the salinization in the arid climate conditions results due to frequent evaporation and crystallization of salt components blinkhorn et al 2020 ion exchange and reverse ion exchange are simultaneously occurring in the groundwater system the carbonic acid h2co3 initiates the dissolution of aquifer minerals in the flow path of groundwater a general reaction for weathering of silicate rocks with h2co3 can be written as 8 n a m g 2 c a 2 k s i l i c a t e h 2 c o 3 h 4 s i o 4 h c o 3 n a m g 2 c a 2 k c l a y ca2 mg2 ratio depicts the dissolution of dolomite and calcite in groundwater and the ratio 1 indicates dissolution of dolomite while ratio 1 indicates calcite dissolution 61 out of 100 samples have ca2 mg2 values 1 indicating dissolution of calcite is dominant in study region 4 3 2 evaporation the molar ratio of na cl of groundwater ranged from 0 48 to 3 69 fig 4b the na cl molar ratio is 1 when na is contributed due to halite dissolution however a value greater than 1 depicts the na being contributed due to silicate weathering singh et al 2017 the molar ratio of na cl for the groundwater samples shows values greater than 1 indicating dominance of silicate weathering in geochemical character of groundwater whereas a handful of samples shows the molar ratio less than 1 indicating prominence of halite dissolution rafique et al 2015 the scatter plot of na k vs cl shows most of the samples falling above the equiline and thus formation of alkali carbonates or alkali sulphate due to abundance of alkalies fig 4c the na is dominant alkali compared to k in the groundwater samples because the k offers higher resistance towards chemical weathering due to its strong adsorption over clay minerals sunkari et al 2020 high concentration of cations might also be due to the silicate weathering or saline soil present in the study area singh et al 2017 4 3 3 ion exchange the na vs cl plot suggestive of na from silicate weathering for samples above the equiline and those below the equiline indicate dominance of evaporation fig 4d most of the groundwater samples are above the equiline thus indicating silicate weathering which is also a source of na cation exchange might also add na into groundwater as alkaline soil is common in the study region and na is abundant in ca2 mg2 vs cl plot samples below the equiline indicates evaporation while those falling above the equiline implies dominance of ion exchange fig 4e 4 3 4 sea water influences the so4 2 mg l cl mg l ratio is used as a proxy to identify the mixing of freshwater and seawater steinich et al 1996 boumaiza et al 2020 the so4 2 cl 1000 with a value of 103 4 signifies likelihood of seawater steinich et al 1996 proposed two categories 1 samples with so4 2 cl ratio similar to seawater and 2 samples with ratio of so4 2 cl greater than 300 affected evaporites dissolution the spatial distribution of above formulation of sea water depicts category 1 according to above classification in north ne and se of study area i e the samples are similar in composition to seawater the western nw and sw part of study region which are underlain by sandstones and siltstones shows category 2 of the classification mainly impacted by evaporites 5 public health 5 1 nitrate contamination the who guidelines for no3 45 mg l in groundwater is found to be of public health concern in the study region out of 100 samples 70 samples have no3 above who limits whereas almost 13 samples were found to have no3 above 300 mg l the replicate and duplicate readings of the samples were taken and was found to be within the range of 3 46 samples show the contamination of both no3 and f however the sources for both are entirely different the no3 contamination is majorly due to anthropogenic sources and f contamination is mainly geogenic in nature high spatial variation in no3 concentration indicates effect of point and non point sources the central part of the study area is affected with high no3 fig 2 which is mostly under the agricultural activities along with agriculture fertilizers use sewage drainage leakage from the septic tanks and human and animal wastes are considered as the major anthropogenic source of nitrate singh et al 2017 in these semi arid arid regions the high no3 are also due to land used for cattle grazing manure lafthouhi et al 2003 the region is also dominated by fauna such as prosopis acacia zyziphus calotropis salvadora these plants species are highly productive and can accumulate an average of 25 35 kgn ha yr rundel et al 1982 while once dead and decomposed it can also contribute high no3 in groundwater system natural sources such as presence of no3 and ammonium nh4 in precipitation evaporative enrichment of dry and wet deposition and natural assimilation of atmospheric n2 by nitrogen fixing bacteria also contributes no3 in groundwater walvoord et al 2003 5 2 fluoride contamination fluoride is micronutrient required for development of bones and tooth in humans while its excess intake may cause several skeletal health problems resulting into fluorosis 62 out of 100 samples showed high f above who limits of 1 5 mg l in semi arid environment dissolution of f bearing minerals is often consider as a major factor governing the f mobilization in groundwater saxena and ahmed 2003 the fluoride contamination has been discussed in singh et al 2013 singh and mukherjee 2015 the si values of fluorite mineral is found to be less than 1 thus indicating fluorite dissolution as one of the possible sources of high f in groundwater fig 5 a high ph along with high hco3 na favours the release of f into aquifer matrix fluorite dissolution has been observed in sandstone granitic terrain leading to f enrichment in groundwater the si values indicate that the groundwater is saturated with calcite and dolomite while undersaturated with fluorite fig 5a b 5c 5d the presence of hco3 can also enhance fluorite dissolution 5 3 human health risk high concentration of no3 and f in drinking water can cause serious health problem in adults and children in present study non carcinogenic health impact of both inorganic contaminants has been calculated and presented in fig 6 hazardous quotient hq values suggest that the health risk of no3 and f is high for both the age group considered in the study as the hq for adult ranges from 0 1 to 23 4 and 0 04 3 9 whereas for children it ranges from 0 1 to 30 6 and 0 06 5 13 the values of hazardous indices vary from 0 7 to 25 1 for adults and 93 out of 100 collected samples have hi values 1 however for children the hi ranges from 0 9 to 32 8 and all except 2 samples 98 have hi 1 indicating severe contamination and thus the water should be treated before consumption children are more susceptible to chronic and critical effects of intake of inorganic organic contaminants given that they consume more of these contaminants per unit of their body weight compared to adults the degree of health risk is found much higher in children as it depends on the contaminant concentration body weight and reference dosages no3 was found to pose more serious problem due to its high concentration in groundwater and associated health risks in children 6 conclusion the source of potable water supply in the study area is only groundwater results indicate that the dissolution of calcium bearing minerals i e calcite gypsum and ion exchange process are major processes responsible for dominance of na mg2 ca2 and hco3 in groundwater while exchange of na k by ca2 and mg2 sorbed on the surface of clay minerals enhances the concentration of these ions in aquifer the extreme climate coupled with the dissolution and precipitation of minerals ion exchange seems as the major factor controlling in determining the genetic origin of groundwater salinity is found as the problem in this region along with high no3 and f which are major health concern the immediate intervention could be testing of groundwater sources in the region so that the identified high risk sources could be avoided for drinking and cooking the high fluoride and no3 handpumps tubewells should be marked and an awareness should be raised within the communities to use safe handpumps tubewells preferably villages with high tds no3 and f problems should be supplied with community based reverse osmosis systems filtration unit the groundwater matrix is very complex and therefore the technologies to remove these contaminants should be implemented and modified according to the regional hydrogeological settings the remediation measure mostly implemented in rajasthan is defluoridation plants however it seems the regions is impacted by multiple contaminants in water and therefore the mitigation options should be exercised only after proper verification of the groundwater contamination funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors findings dissolution and ion exchange coupled with climatic factors plays important role in hydrogeochemistry high tds no3 and f in groundwater are major health concern indicating high risk for both children and adults availability of data and material there are no linked research data sets for this

11948,the increase of antibiotic resistant strains of escherichia coli in the groundwater has become a permanent risk that threat human life in rural areas in morocco this study aims to quantify the presence of resistant strains in wells water in the irrigated perimetrs of beni aamir and beni moussa to assess the contamination 200 samples was collected during four seasonal campaigns 43 samples per season between 2017 and 2018 the samples are analyzed to identify the escherichia coli and then the resistance of the detected e coli against 16 antibiotics is tested the result shows that out of 153 samples a total of 48 isolated strains are identified as escherichia coli which represent 31 37 of the present total coliforms the antimicrobial resistance shows that 68 75 of e coli strains are multidrug resistant where 12 50 of strains resist at least to 7 antibiotics 10 42 resist at least to 10 antibiotics 8 33 resist at least to 5 antibiotics 6 25 resist at least to 4 antibiotics and 2 08 resist at least to 15 antibiotics the result shows a high level of resistance against amoxicillin ceftazidime and ticarcillin the fact that increases the risk of groundwater contamination and threats the life of people in this area graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality escherichia coli antibiotics resistance well groundwater 1 introduction the escherichia coli is a facultative anaerobic symbiont which is exist in mammalian gastrointestinal tracts since the first hours of birth the e coli is the dominant species of the anaerotolerant aerobic flora päivärinta et al 2020 runcharoen et al 2017 however some types cause intestinal and extra intestinal infections where phylogenetic groups contain many e coli pathogens that could cause serious infections the e coli is the predominant pathogen responsible for urinary tract infections utis and could also cause meningitis the e coli is the most common cause of bloodstream infections in humans de luca rebello and regua mangia 2014 kumar et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 many essential antibacterial agents do not treat diseases with antibiotic resistant bacteria arm and the e coli still susceptible to a few antibiotics because of that the strains resistance is described as one of the greatest threats to health bhagat et al 2021 elsherif et al 2016 there is also evidence that the ingestion of waters that contains antibiotic resistant e coli is associated with intestinal colonization by this bacteria where the swimming in the contaminated water risk the urinary tract infections caused by esbl producing bacteria

of e coli that produce it esbl have become particularly important due to the high probability of failure with empirical use of antibiotics in the absence of an antibiogram ekwanzala et al 2018 widiastuti and faiqoh 2020 resistance can arise by mutation or can be acquired by transfer of resistance genes to mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmids from one bacterium to other members of the community kumar et al 2020b o flaherty et al 2018 antibiotic resistant genes which enter the environmental ecosystems could increase public health risks and could have an ecological impact on population dynamics and interactions between bacterial communities b suttner et al 2020 agricultural urban and industrial activities have contributed in recent decades to increase the potential bacteriological contamination of groundwater resources antibiotics are widely used in agriculture to prevent and treat disease as well as to promote growth therefore animal wastes may contain resistant bacteria animal wastes may also contain concentrations of antimicrobials which lead to selective pressures and affect communities in the external environment azizullah et al 2011 weller et al 2020 the rapid emergence and spread of esbls poses a significant threat to public health because infections caused by esbl producing bacteria do not respond to several antibiotics including third generation cephalosporins 3gcs hafiane et al 2019 while the manure is applied to land the pollutants such as antimicrobial compounds the resistant bacteria or the resistance genes are concentrated and mobilized in the soil and then end up in the water by runoff chmiel and lenart boroń 2019 it is not a surprise that many studies have found the e coli in aquatic environments chen et al 2017 davis et

bacteria in water sources is important because the water is the link between the tree main reservoirs human animal soil felis et al 2020 lamia et al 2015 ulstad et al 2016 the purpose of this work is to increase our knowledge about the antibiotic resistant escherichia coli distribution in the irrigated perimeter the e coli is chosen because it presents an indicator of contamination that is transient in aquatic environments and survives in the water the study is also designed to investigate the resistance to antibiotics and the used agricultural practices in the study area in order to take all measures to ensure the quality of groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 location and hydrological setting the study area is belong to tadla basin in beni mellal khenifra region fig 1 the study occupies an area of approximately 10 000 km2 the zone is formed by the phosphate plateau in the north and the tadla plain in the south and limited by the eastern bahira in the west on the primary base of the meseta lie a major unconformity of cretaceous and tertiary marine formations which is largely extended to the south and gradually thickening under the detrital filling of the mio plio quaternary of the tadla plain in the south a large overlapping tectonic accident brings the atlas structures armed by a thick series of liasic limestones on the subsisting basin of the tadla in the tadla plain the underground water resources are constituted by a multilayer aquifer system the volume of the captive water tables of the eocene and turonian are estimated at 440 million m3 divided between beni aamir 190 million m3 and beni moussa 250 million m3 the tadla aquifer system takes the form of a superposition of several aquifers which are presented from the bottom to the top as follows the paleozoic aquifer formed by schists and quartzites the turonian aquifer formed by limestones the senonian aquifer formed by dolomitic limestones the eocene aquifer formed by limestones marls and phosphatic sands the alluvial mio plio quaternary aquifers of the tadla beni aamir aquifer beni moussa aquifer beni moussa dir aquifer the thickness of the tadla aquifers is highly variable over the entire tadla plain which makes the availability of groundwater resources heterogenic the depth of the water table exceeds 80 m over the entire perimeter of tadla with a maximum value of 300 m in the vicinity of the oum er rbia river water samples have been collected directly from 43 wells in the irrigated area during four campaigns all samples are conserved at 4 c in the laboratory until analysis time hafiane et al 2020 2 2 isolation and identification of the escherichia coli strains from each water sample escherichia coli is isolated and characterized according to the official moroccan method mn 2012 the enumeration of e coli is performed after the process of filtration then the membrane is deposited on ttc 2 3 5 triphenylterazoliumchloride tergitol 7 agar oxoid cm0793 medium agar the incubation time is 48 h at 44 c the appearance of yellow colonies surrounded by a yellow halo are gram negative bacilli after confirmation of e coli by emb medium emb oxoid cm0069 with the presence of metallic luster the escherichia coli strains are biochemically identified with the api 20 e system bio mérieux 2 3 strains sensitivity to antibiotics an antibiogram is performed for each isolated strain by the muller hinton agar diffusion method according to the recommendations of the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing eucast 2018 the tested antibiotics are shown in table 1 the interpretative reading of the susceptibility test permits the detection of several resistance phenotypes 2 4 detection of broad spectrum beta lactamase all strains are tested for the production of broad spectrum beta lactamase using the double halo method which is described by philippon and arlet 2012 a positive test results in potentiation of the inhibition zone around

eucast 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 prevalence of resistant e coli in well water a total of n 48 153 has identified as escherichia coli the antimicrobial activity of e coli strains reveals a high level of resistance among all antibiotics tested all e coli strains are tested against 16 antibiotic molecules belonging to 7 different families including 1 fluoroquinolones 5 cephalosporins 6 penicillins 1 carbapenems 1 monobactams 1 oxacephems and fosfomycin the results illustrated by fig 2 and fig 3 show the emergence of e coli strains resistant to the most of tested antibiotics except for latamoxef imipenem and aztreonam i e 93 6 96 4 95 7 and respectively sensitive strains imipenem remains the antibiotic of choice which inhibits the growth of all strains of the isolated e coli escherichia coli strains show a resistance to many antibiotics the rates of resistance are as follows ceftazidime 85 amoxicillin 86 4 amoxicillin clavulanic acid 76 4 ticarcillin 77 8 ticarcillin clavulanic acid 65 piperacillin 58 6 piperacillin tazobactam 20 7 cefalotin 62 8 ciprofloxacin 58 6 cefoxitin 29 3 cefamandole 44 3 cefotaxime 44 3 fosfomycin 47 1 as shown in fig 3 3 2 multi resistant escherichia coli strains table 2 shows that among 48 of the isolated and tested e coli 25 of the strains are sensitive 6 25 exhibited an intermediate activity while 68 75 of the e coli strains are resistant to the tested antibiotics the high frequency of resistance to the tested antibiotics has proved the existence of multi resistant strains including 33 samples that are resistant to four or more antibiotics as shown in table 3 a multi resistant strain of e coli is defined as a strain that resists to more than four antibiotics the results reveal a multi resistant of 68 75 of the strains while 12 50 of the strains are resistant to 7 antibiotics 10 42 of the strains are resistant to 10 antibiotics 8 33 of the strains are resistant to 5 8 and then 12 antibiotics 6 25 of the strains are resistant to 4 9 and then 11 antibiotics and 2 08 of the strains are resistant to 15 antibiotics 3 3 escherichia coli resistance phenotype as shown in fig 4 according to bush jacoby the behavior of enterobacteriaceae with respect to beta lactam makes the strains classification according to their resistance phenotype possible the resistance to beta lactamases in this study refers to the acquired phenotypes that can be qualified as high level esbl c ase and mixed phenotype of which the phenotypic analysis of e coli is in favor of an extended spectrum class a beta lactamases esbl 54 17 the resistance to class c beta lactamases hyper production of cephalosporinase c ase exists in 5 strains with a rate of 8 33 also the 8 strains of e coli that produce an associated cephalosporinase mixed phenotype are dominant with a rate of 10 42 resulting from the resistance against all quinolones followed by class a beta lactamases production of penicillinase that exists in 3 strains the p ase are the phenotypes with the lowest frequency 6 25 while the wild phenotypes including 26 e coli strains comes with the highest frequency 20 83 the survey in both dry and wet seasons between 2017 and 2018 has detected the escherichia coli in the majority of wells drilled into beni aamir and beni moussa aquifers the outbreak of e coli contamination is increasingly associated with the consumption of water fruits and vegetables kumar et al 2020c mohanta and goel 2014 o flaherty et al 2018 the contamination may be due to the contact with the droppings of domestic or wild animals at any stage of cultivation or handling flores ribeiro et al 2012 hafijur rahaman khan 2017 b suttner et al 2020 in fact the waterborne transmission is reported as the main transmission factor in drinking water and waste water hafiane et al 2019 setiyawan et al 2014 typically the interpersonal contact is an important mode of fecal oral transmission dyar et al 2012 the study of antibiotic susceptibility shows a significant resistance of e coli strains against all tested antibiotics these resistances are mainly against aminopenicillins amoxicillin 86 4 carboxypenicillins ticarcillin 77 8 and ureidopenicillins piperacillin 58 6 the resistances are acquired and would be the consequence of the pressure related to the abusive consumption of these antibiotics al badaii and shuhaimi othman 2015 muraleedharan et al 2019 b j suttner et al 2019 and this is due to the fact that these molecules are often prescribed empirically particularly in ambulatory and veterinary medicine liu et al 2018 moreover this resistance could be explained by a decrease in the activity of the beta lactamase inhibitor as a result of the overproduction of penicillinases or the inactivation of the inhibitor itself eucast 2018 the antibiotic resistant bacteria are transferred between ecosystems through faecal discharges davis et al 2018 flores ribeiro et al 2012 kumar et al 2020b muraleedharan et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 multiple antibiotic resistance against the gram negative bacteria and the e coli has been reported in the literature kumar et al 2020c li et al 2014 maal bared et al 2013 other studies conducted on beach marine spring and lake waters bhagat et al 2021 dyar et al 2012 vieira et al 2017 show that the waters were a major reservoir of antibiotic resistant e coli where the ability to be multi antibiotic resistant has also been reported in many studies al badaii and shuhaimi othman 2015 bhagat et al 2020 b j suttner et al 2019 to clarify the antibiotic resistance is a natural phenomenon that the bacteria use to protect themselves against competitors duff et al 2019 ekwanzala et al 2018 kumar et al 2020a li et al 2014 and the use of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture influences the frequency and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria in many aquatic environments bai et al 2015 erb et al 2007 li et al 2014 mackowiak et al 2018 mohanta and goel 2014 in this study the water samples are collected from a rural area where the untreated wastewater overflows can be a significant source of fecal pollution and e coli esbl 74 17 with a high concentration during the dry season dyar et al 2012 kumar et al 2020a also feces from wild animals such as birds can contribute to the production of e coli esbl in surface waters which makes the e coli produces the esbl in water surfaces and also in animal origin liu et al 2018 mackowiak et al 2018 therefore significant proportion of these e coli that produce the esbls are multi resistant which are produced in both seasons in irrigated areas with the same frequency on the other hand the piperacillin tazobactam seems to be more effective 20 7 resistance the emergence of strains resistant to ceftazidime 85 and cefotaxime 44 3 and ticarcilin 77 6 can reflect the continued increase in the frequency of esbl producing strains in groundwater these results are also reported by some authors bai et al 2015 muraleedharan et al 2019 since the resistance against antibiotics could be influenced by the presence of bacterial biofilms on groundwater which leads to improve the multidrug resistant strains and their dissemination in well water hafiane et al 2019 maal bared et al 2013 mohanta and goel 2014 the study of the sensitivity of e coli to 3rd generation cephalosporins c3g shows an average rate of acquired resistance in well water where the resistance levels are considered lower than those observed in some studies muraleedharan et al 2019 wang et al 2018 and higher than those reported in others kumar et al 2020b liu et al 2018 for more than 20 years the resistance of e coli to 3rd generation cephalosporins c3g has increased notably through the acquisition of beta extended spectrum lactamases esbls while 54 17 of the studied strains are producers of extended spectrum beta lactamases esbls this value is clearly higher than the values in other studies al badaii and shuhaimi othman 2015 chen et al 2017 ekwanzala et al 2018 erb et al 2007 felis et al 2020 setiyawan et al 2014 vieira et al 2017 also another finding indicates that the coexistence of different beta lactamases in the same bacterium can cause a diagnostic and therapeutic problem al badaii and shuhaimi othman 2015 these associations lead to a co selection of resistance genes and the pandemic scenario in the hospital and in the community chen et al 2017 b j suttner et al 2019 in addition carbapenems are the most used antibiotics against severe infections caused by e coli that produces the esbls al badaii and shuhaimi othman 2015 ma et al 2020 wu et al 2020 this point has been reported by some authors who claim that the resistance of e coli against these molecules is still a marginal phenomenon the fact that is proved by epidemiological data obtained from a large number of strains which show a resistance against imipenem with a rate of 3 6 consequently this decrease in resistance could be the result of a modification of the porin associated with the production of β lactamases of the esbl type therefore a decrease of the permeability of the outer membrane bai et al 2015 felis et al 2020 mohanta and goel 2014 philippon and arlet 2012 for instance the production of carbapenemases is a process of very high concern since the carbapenem activity can be compromised by the emergence of these enzymes hafiane et al 2019 li et al 2014 ma et al 2020 mcarthur et al 2016 4 conclusion a large number of multi resistant strains of e coli have phenotypes of resistance against one or more families of antibiotics particularly the beta lactam antibiotics the levels of the beta lactam resistance achieved are associated with numerous resistance mechanisms with predominance of extended spectrum beta lactam production esbl 54 17 penicillinase production 6 25 and a minority hyperproduced cephalosporinase 8 33 efforts must be concentrated on the distribution and consumption sectors it is then essential to identify animal reservoirs and to study the ecology of e coli in order to reduce the effect of dissemination by water therefore the challenge is to achieve an uninfected water and food an approache of risk analysis based on a partnership between the private public sectors and consumer organizations should take place where the control is needed to enable the collection of essential

11948,the increase of antibiotic resistant strains of escherichia coli in the groundwater has become a permanent risk that threat human life in rural areas in morocco this study aims to quantify the presence of resistant strains in wells water in the irrigated perimetrs of beni aamir and beni moussa to assess the contamination 200 samples was collected during four seasonal campaigns 43 samples per season between 2017 and 2018 the samples are analyzed to identify the escherichia coli and then the resistance of the detected e coli against 16 antibiotics is tested the result shows that out of 153 samples a total of 48 isolated strains are identified as escherichia coli which represent 31 37 of the present total coliforms the antimicrobial resistance shows that 68 75 of e coli strains are multidrug resistant where 12 50 of strains resist at least to 7 antibiotics 10 42 resist at least to 10 antibiotics 8 33 resist at least to 5 antibiotics 6 25 resist at least to 4 antibiotics and 2 08 resist at least to 15 antibiotics the result shows a high level of resistance against amoxicillin ceftazidime and ticarcillin the fact that increases the risk of groundwater contamination and threats the life of people in this area graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality escherichia coli antibiotics resistance well groundwater 1 introduction the escherichia coli is a facultative anaerobic symbiont which is exist in mammalian gastrointestinal tracts since the first hours of birth the e coli is the dominant species of the anaerotolerant aerobic flora päivärinta et al 2020 runcharoen et al 2017 however some types cause intestinal and extra intestinal infections where phylogenetic groups contain many e coli pathogens that could cause serious infections the e coli is the predominant pathogen responsible for urinary tract infections utis and could also cause meningitis the e coli is the most common cause of bloodstream infections in humans de luca rebello and regua mangia 2014 kumar et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 many essential antibacterial agents do not treat diseases with antibiotic resistant bacteria arm and the e coli still susceptible to a few antibiotics because of that the strains resistance is described as one of the greatest threats to health bhagat et al 2021 elsherif et al 2016 there is also evidence that the ingestion of waters that contains antibiotic resistant e coli is associated with intestinal colonization by this bacteria where the swimming in the contaminated water risk the urinary tract infections caused by esbl producing bacteria lopes et al 2016 the intensive use of antimicrobial causes the multidrug resistant strains production particularly those resistant to beta lactam antibiotics which are found in the urinary tract lung pus septicaemia and water osińska et al 2017 wu et al 2020 with the advent of extended spectrum beta lactamases esbls in the 1980s and their wide distribution worldwide osińska et al 2017 the strains of e coli that produce it esbl have become particularly important due to the high probability of failure with empirical use of antibiotics in the absence of an antibiogram ekwanzala et al 2018 widiastuti and faiqoh 2020 resistance can arise by mutation or can be acquired by transfer of resistance genes to mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmids from one bacterium to other members of the community kumar et al 2020b o flaherty et al 2018 antibiotic resistant genes which enter the environmental ecosystems could increase public health risks and could have an ecological impact on population dynamics and interactions between bacterial communities b suttner et al 2020 agricultural urban and industrial activities have contributed in recent decades to increase the potential bacteriological contamination of groundwater resources antibiotics are widely used in agriculture to prevent and treat disease as well as to promote growth therefore animal wastes may contain resistant bacteria animal wastes may also contain concentrations of antimicrobials which lead to selective pressures and affect communities in the external environment azizullah et al 2011 weller et al 2020 the rapid emergence and spread of esbls poses a significant threat to public health because infections caused by esbl producing bacteria do not respond to several antibiotics including third generation cephalosporins 3gcs hafiane et al 2019 while the manure is applied to land the pollutants such as antimicrobial compounds the resistant bacteria or the resistance genes are concentrated and mobilized in the soil and then end up in the water by runoff chmiel and lenart boroń 2019 it is not a surprise that many studies have found the e coli in aquatic environments chen et al 2017 davis et al 2018 of which the aquatic ecosystem could play an ecological and evolutionary role in driving the persistence emergence and spread of mrd understanding the distribution of antibiotic resistant bacteria in water sources is important because the water is the link between the tree main reservoirs human animal soil felis et al 2020 lamia et al 2015 ulstad et al 2016 the purpose of this work is to increase our knowledge about the antibiotic resistant escherichia coli distribution in the irrigated perimeter the e coli is chosen because it presents an indicator of contamination that is transient in aquatic environments and survives in the water the study is also designed to investigate the resistance to antibiotics and the used agricultural practices in the study area in order to take all measures to ensure the quality of groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 location and hydrological setting the study area is belong to tadla basin in beni mellal khenifra region fig 1 the study occupies an area of approximately 10 000 km2 the zone is formed by the phosphate plateau in the north and the tadla plain in the south and limited by the eastern bahira in the west on the primary base of the meseta lie a major unconformity of cretaceous and tertiary marine formations which is largely extended to the south and gradually thickening under the detrital filling of the mio plio quaternary of the tadla plain in the south a large overlapping tectonic accident brings the atlas structures armed by a thick series of liasic limestones on the subsisting basin of the tadla in the tadla plain the underground water resources are constituted by a multilayer aquifer system the volume of the captive water tables of the eocene and turonian are estimated at 440 million m3 divided between beni aamir 190 million m3 and beni moussa 250 million m3 the tadla aquifer system takes the form of a superposition of several aquifers which are presented from the bottom to the top as follows the paleozoic aquifer formed by schists and quartzites the turonian aquifer formed by limestones the senonian aquifer formed by dolomitic limestones the eocene aquifer formed by limestones marls and phosphatic sands the alluvial mio plio quaternary aquifers of the tadla beni aamir aquifer beni moussa aquifer beni moussa dir aquifer the thickness of the tadla aquifers is highly variable over the entire tadla plain which makes the availability of groundwater resources heterogenic the depth of the water table exceeds 80 m over the entire perimeter of tadla with a maximum value of 300 m in the vicinity of the oum er rbia river water samples have been collected directly from 43 wells in the irrigated area during four campaigns all samples are conserved at 4 c in the laboratory until analysis time hafiane et al 2020 2 2 isolation and identification of the escherichia coli strains from each water sample escherichia coli is isolated and characterized according to the official moroccan method mn 2012 the enumeration of e coli is performed after the process of filtration then the membrane is deposited on ttc 2 3 5 triphenylterazoliumchloride tergitol 7 agar oxoid cm0793 medium agar the incubation time is 48 h at 44 c the appearance of yellow colonies surrounded by a yellow halo are gram negative bacilli after confirmation of e coli by emb medium emb oxoid cm0069 with the presence of metallic luster the escherichia coli strains are biochemically identified with the api 20 e system bio mérieux 2 3 strains sensitivity to antibiotics an antibiogram is performed for each isolated strain by the muller hinton agar diffusion method according to the recommendations of the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing eucast 2018 the tested antibiotics are shown in table 1 the interpretative reading of the susceptibility test permits the detection of several resistance phenotypes 2 4 detection of broad spectrum beta lactamase all strains are tested for the production of broad spectrum beta lactamase using the double halo method which is described by philippon and arlet 2012 a positive test results in potentiation of the inhibition zone around

11949,groundwater gw quality deterioration is one of the main water security issues in qatar gw in qatar is over exploited for agriculture activities that caused saltwater intrusion in the coastal areas and some inland gw the selection of an appropriate interpolation method is crucial for producing a reliable map of spatial variability in environmental research and the decision making process in this study 41 gw samples were used to produce interpolated maps and reveal the spatial variability of gw parameters namely ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds sodium adsorption ratio sar major cations and anions and some trace elements using spatial interpolated methods in geostatistical tool arcgis software multiple mapping methods were used to compare the current results with the national and international guidelines to give a relevant decision three different interpolated methods namely inverse distance weighted interpolation idw radial basis functions rbfs and simple kriging sk were used to produce interpolated maps cross validation was applied to assess the best fit interpolation method the result shows that the sk model was the optimum interpolated method for the most of the variable data while the rbfs model was the best interpolation method for selenium and boron data the idw model was the best interpolated method for sodium tds sar and potassium

quality the state of qatar is a semi arid country and gw is the only natural freshwater resource and is mainly used for irrigation mdps 2015 qatar has about 80 mm average annual rainfall mdps 2018 the total water in qatar comes from three sources about 59 from desalination of seawater 30 from gw and 11 from treated wastewater ahmad and al ghouti 2020 fresh gw in qatar infiltrates from the local

recharge from rainfall is about 25 million m3 per year baalousha et al 2015 whereas gw extraction is about 252 1 million m3 per year which caused an annual water deficit of about 100 158 million m3

is for agricultural activities which is about 230 million m3 year the study by darwish et al 2014 concluded that gw quality and quantity in qatar have deteriorated the gw depletion has increased due to the population growth and the associated water demand with the extreme climate conditions like low local rainfall and high temperature with an increasing demand for irrigation water farmers are encouraged to use treated wastewater for irrigation gw quality requires sustainable management and spatial variability investigation and monitoring geostatistics is broadly used in various disciplines such as geological hydrological and environmental studies nas 2009 geo statistical and spatial interpolation methods are used in monitoring and assessing gw quality and quantity chung et al 2019 for example balakrishnan 2011 assessed and mapped gw quality in india using gis spatial interpolation techniques such as idw and kriging baalousha 2016 demonstrated the gw vulnerability maps in qatar geo statistical and gis analyses are incorporated in arcgis software elumalai et al 2017 the spatial interpolation is used to estimate or predict values for unsampled points from finite sampled observations at known locations that will save sampling time money and labor chung et al 2019 spatial interpolation analysis reveals the spatial variation in space and time of the attribute data

placed over a uniform limestone bed mdps 2015 there are a lot of karst formations in qatar such as depressions sinkholes and caves due to mineral dissolution such as gypsum rocks sadiq and nasir 2002 the number of northern basin wells about 70 of total wells in qatar is significantly higher than the wells in the southern basin about 28 of total wells in qatar darwish et al 2014 2 2 sampling and physicochemical analysis a detailed description of the sampling and physicochemical analysis is given in a study by ahmad et al 2020 the sampling is conducted based on accessibility to farm wells according to darwish et al 2014 the number of pumping farm wells is 3525 about 56 of total farm wells fig 1 shows the locations of the 41 gw sampled wells the location coordinates are taken using a handheld global positioning system gps the gw samples were taken from a faucet at the wellhead during may 2019 the wells were pumped until the stabilization of temperature and conductivity measurements polyethylene bottles of 1 l size were rinsed 3 to 4 times before filling them duplicate samples are used to assess the variance of the total method including sampling and analysis the samples were preserved in an icebox prior to their transfer to the lab for analysis electrical conductivity μs cm and ph were measured in the field and lab using a pre calibrated portable conductivity meter and ph meter handheld ysi model 63 the relationships between total dissolved solids tds mg l and ec of the gw were calculated using the formula proposed by schlumberger 2009 as shown in formula

as shown in equation 3 3 sar n a c a 2 m g 2 2 2 3 comparing interpolation methods spatial interpolation techniques are classified into deterministic or non geostatistical interpolation and geostatistical interpolation idw and rbfs are deterministic interpolation methods which use simple mathematical models to determine an unknown point from the surrounding known points while geostatistical interpolation such as kriging uses more complex geostatistical models that include the statistical correlations between the sampled points also known as spatial autocorrelation xiao et al 2016 the comparisons between the spatial interpolation methods according to several criteria have been conducted by li and heap 2011 as shown in table 1 variations in natural resources like gw and associated environmental issues have been studied spatially and temporally applying deterministic and geostatistical techniques of interpolation in arcgis gunaalan et al 2018 simple kriging sk is a geostatistical technique whereas idw and rbfs methods are deterministic interpolation techniques gidey et al 2018 the arcgis geostatistical analyst extension has been employed for a detailed analysis of alterations in different spatial variables and found to bridge geostatistics and gis analysis with tangible results uyan and cay 2013 the boundaries need to be demarcated precisely for an accurate interpolation gunaalan et al 2018 effective prediction of unknown factors of locations using available values and sample sizes stahl et al 2006 acceptable spatial sample locations güler 2014 normality of the existing sets of data wu et al 2016 attained spatial resolution hengl 2007 and the method of interpolation xie et al 2011 the ambiguity in the analysis will be amplified if the spatial variation in water quality measurements is not represented properly by the well locations or sampling sites wagner et al 2012 xie et al 2011 found that the size of the polluted area affected the efficacy of the interpolation methods used to describe the presence of heavy metals in soil spatially seyedmohammadi et al 2016 found ordinary kriging ok to be better than five other spatial interpolation methods for estimating the spatial dissemination of electrical conductivity ec in gw comparing different spatial interpolation methods employed to predict ec tds and ph empirical bayesian kriging was found to be superior to other methods gunarathna et al 2016a b to estimate a point for an unsampled location idw employs the sampled points at the neighborhood of the predicted location and that the sampled point nearest to the predicted locations have more effect on the estimated point idw is an interpolation method in which each point value has a weight that diminishes as a function of distance magesh and elango 2019 idw is an estimation method in which each point value has a weight that reduces with distance which is calculated using equation 4 4 z p i 1 n z i d i p i 1 n 1 d i p where zi is the value of the known point numeric attributed di is the distance to a known point zp is the unknown point numeric attributed to be interpolated n is the number of observations and p is a user selected exponent powers of the distance paramasivam and venkatramanan 2019 the optimization of the idw model could be achieved by selecting the lowest root mean square rms by changing the power value thus idw will never generate a value that is higher than the maximum value bashir and fouli 2015 the disadvantages of idw are that it is sensitive to outliers clustering and sampling configuration li and heap 2011 in comparison between rbf with idw the rbfs may estimate points outside the measured points range balakrishnan 2011 however they are both an exact interpolator the advantage of rbfs is that it creates a smooth output surface for gradually changing surfaces such as elevation whereas the disadvantage of rbfs is that it is unfit with the significant changes in the sampled points within short distances and with the sample data that contains uncertainty measurement of error or outliers chung et al 2019 similar to idw interpolation kriging gives weights from the distance around measured points to estimate unmeasured locations however kriging weights are determined by the distance and the spatial orientation of the known points or semi variograms li and heap 2011 the most common semi variogram model is the spherical which is used in this study the simple idea of spherical semi variogram models is that unsampled points can be predicted by the weighted sum of the sampled points within a certain radius chung et al 2019 because the variogram alters with distance the weights rely on the distribution of the sampled points distribution an empirical variogram can be quantified from sampled points by the following equation 5 chung et al 2019 5 γ h 1 2 n i 1 n z x i z x i h 2 where γ h is the predicted semi variance at a separation distance or lag h h is the distance among sampled values n is the number of pairs of samples separated by h and z is the measured points thus kriging models depend on semi variogram models of spatial autocorrelation to quantify weights which decreases the variance in the estimated value in terms of distance and direction to predict points and uncertainty associated with the predictions balakrishnan 2011 the performance of kriging models is better than non geostatistical models that kriging estimates uncertainty associated with the predictions li and heap 2011 the geostatistical interpolation is believed to be an unbiased optimized estimation model for depicting regionalized variables xiao et al 2016 however kriging is an inexact model such that the output surface does not contain the exact values of the input data and the interpolated values may exceed the minimum and maximum measured point li and heap 2011 kriging is a smoothing process because the variance of the kriged values is lower than that of the original data myers 1991 however it has some smoothing deficiency xiao et al 2016 besides kriging needs more computing and modeling time balakrishnan 2011 generally different interpolation techniques will produce unalike outputs with the same input data thus no interpreter is more accurate than others under all circumstances arslan and turan 2015 the accuracy should be judged by the sample quantity and the understanding of the study area with the spatial arrangement of the sample locations cross validation is a tool to evaluate how well the model estimates points at locations with no data and it helps to decide the best model that performs better than another model on a particular data set davis 1987 it does not imply that the model in general will always perform better syed et al 2003 also it helps to optimize and search several possibilities of models parameters such as power neighborhood and the order of detrending to better utilize the data liu et al 2012 according to falivene et al 2010 cross validation omits one measured sample point and uses the rest of the data to estimate a value at that location the point is then returned into the dataset and a different point is omitted all data points are estimated by the same steps to assess the model pairs of the original data value and predicted values they are compared by subtracting them then squared and added the resulting sum is known as a least squares fit thus cross validation produces three values for each location the original data point the predicted point and the minimized estimation variance xiao et al 2016 a variety of cross validation statistics are used to examine how close the predicted values are to the known values to explore how well the variogram fits the data and to assess the performance of the interpolation methods for this particular analysis syed et al 2003 for idw and rbfs methods results are usually stated as mean error me and root mean squared error rmse their root mean square standardized error must be near to one if the standard errors are valid if the root mean square standardized error is higher than one it indicates underestimating while if it is lower than one it indicates overestimating singh verma 2019 the comparison between interpolation methods was made based on the cross validation results evaluation of different interpolation methods is established from the rmse which are obtained from the integrated interpolation model and cross validation results the optimization process is conducted by finding the kernel parameter values for the rbfs model the power and neighborhood values for the idw model and for the sk parameters that give the model with the lowest rmse rmse is used as a cross validation indicator to assess how well the model fits for the representation of input data the lowest rmse results are obtained with the largest number of neighbors 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing interpolation methods in this study different values of power values and neighborhood types were examined then the rmse values were obtained balakrishnan 2011 as shown in tables 2 4 the best fit interpolated model for the input data representation is the one with the least rmse value arslan and turan 2015 similarly falivene et al 2010 illustrated that interpolation smoothing is primarily controlled by the number of neighbors averaged and by the model parameters table 2 shows rmse for idw parameters with the lowest rmse value and the best parameters tables 3 and 4 show the optimized rbfs parameters and the optimized kriging parameters respectively some cross validation statistics such as rmse average standard error mean standardized and root mean square standardized values were also shown the result shows that the sk model performed better than idw and rbfs models for ph chloride selenium strontium potassium sar molybdenum lithium and nitrate date while the rbfs model was the best for sodium and calcium idw model worked better for tds boron sulfate nevertheless rmse values between idw and rbf are not significantly different in this study rmse values were generally high one possible explanation is the uneven distribution of the data configuration as large spacing intervals between sample locations generated high rmse values another explanation is the presence of outliers in the original data in the current study the sampling points are not well distributed and the sample size is low due to the limitation to access the private farms that contained some gw wells this resulted in high spatial variation in some attribute data thus to enhance the performance of spatial interpolation and to allow estimation of short range variance the sample size needs to be increased the current study showed that each of the three spatial interpolation methods has unique advantages and produced different output surfaces the sk produced smooth and relatively continuous surfaces that contained irregular changes in the data because sk is an unbiased interpreter that has fitted a semi variogram model sk provides the measurement of prediction uncertainty however sk is an inexact interpolator as the output data did not include the exact input values being exact interpolators idw and rbf have output surface values exactly equal to that of the input data values therefore idw and rbf models gave better interpolation maps that help to visualize the location of gw within and above the guidelines however the idw model is better than rbf as it does not produce values above or below the range of the measured values furthermore the smoothness of the output surface is also an important factor for assessing the performance of the interpolation methods it was noticed that rbfs gave smoother interpolation maps than idw and kriging methods the inferior smoothness of the interpolated maps is due to the uneven distribution of sample points and some extreme value points 3 2 spatial variability analysis fig 2a shows the interpolated map for ph using the sk method the ph values are changed within a range of 6 8 7 9 with an average of 7 3 which meets the world health organization who standard 6 5 8 5 revealing geochemical equilibrium who 2017 only two samples were slightly acidic ph 6 9 and 6 8 that could be correlated to the use of the fertilizer in the farms fig 2 b shows the spatial variation of tds using the idw method ec ranged from 0 92 μs cm to 22 33 μs cm with an average of 7 29 μs cm tds ranged from 598 to 15 633 mg l with an average of 5038 mg l ec is classified as low saline ec 1500 μs cm medium saline 1500 μs cm 3000 μs cm and high saline ec 3000 μs cm ghalib 2017 using this classification there were no samples with ec 500 μs cm which is similar to freshwater ec only two samples are characterized as low salinity one sample as moderately saline and 38 samples as highly saline which is considered unfit for drinking and irrigation who 2017 fao 1994 high tds and ec enhance the corrosion and salinity of the gw the spatial variation in tds maps is due to the type of aquifer rock and the residence time of the gw in addition to the extreme weather condition such as high temperature and low rainfall alsuhaimi et al 2019 in the current study the high ec and the high salinity values are attributed to the aridity of qatar due to the low rainfall and high evaporation also the use of the high salinity gw for irrigation caused salts leaching in addition overexploitation of gw caused the intrusion of the deep brackish gw or the seawater high tds values are shown along the coastal areas due to the seawater intrusion while high ec in the south is due to low rainfall and deep brackish gw intrusion the high tds problem with gw is also shown in hadi and al ruwaith 2008 in kuwait where tds is ranged from 200 mg l to 800 mg l and 14 500 mg l for some locations while in saudi tds is ranged from 13 mg l to 6000 mg l abdel satar et al 2017 saltwater intrusion from coastal areas is also reported by other studies such as the study by nwankwo et al 2020 the order of the major cation in the gw was na ca2 mg2

most dominant cation the range of the ions was 64 2 mg l 5547 mg l with an average of 1466 mg l the natural source of na in the gw is the weathering minerals such as halite and feldspar minerals na high levels more than the natural levels are mainly correlated to the anthropogenic sources such as sewage effluent and leaching from landfills and saltwater intrusion ghalib 2017 sodium levels above

and cardiac problems who 2017 39 samples were inappropriate for drinking due to high na concentration na 200 mg l cl ions were the most dominant anion ranging from 203 6 mg l to 30 806 mg l with an average of 6289 mg l fig 4 b shows cl interpolated map using the sk method high cl in drinking water results in a salty taste adimalla and venkatayogi 2018 the spatial distribution of sodium and chloride in groundwater is similar to the distribution of tds which increases from inland to coast as shown by the interpolation maps thus tds can be used as a surrogate for sodium and chloride so4 2 ions ranged from 53 4 mg l to 11 596 mg l with an average of 4977 mg l the gypsum caso4 2h2o and anhydrite caso4 are a natural source of metallic sulfate fig 4c shows the spatial variation of so4 2 using the idw method the interpolation map of so4 2 ions illustrates that the highest levels are in the southern area due to the dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite and leached water from agriculture activities alsuhaimi et al 2019 water with high cl and so4 2 result in hypertension laxative effect diarrhea asthma dehydration and gastrointestinal irritation who 2017 no3 ions ranged from 5 2 mg l to 113 3 mg l with an average of 37 2 mg l fig 4d shows the interpolation map for no3 using the sk method no3 ions are important for plant growth as a main nutrient fertilizers agricultural municipal waste and leaching of sewage might contribute to high no3 in the gw mallick et al 2018 the high concentration of nitrate in drinking water results in methemoglobinemia in infants furthermore it causes cyanosis goiter oral cancer cancer of the colon gastrointestinal cancers lymphoma who 2017 the average value of no3 in the gw is 36 32 mg l the interpolation map shows the highest values of no3 in the northern and central of qatar high no3 in the current study is related to inorganic and organic fertilizers manure application in the private farms especially in the shallow gw and domestic effluents

higher than the us epa irrigation guidelines chromium levels in the two samples are higher than the qatar irrigation guidelines in jordan selenium concentration exceeded the permitted level of 10 μg l al taani et al 2012 4 conclusion a clear understanding of the spatial distribution of gw quality parameters is the key issue for agricultural and environmental management in the current analysis unsampled points are interpolated by three interpolation methods using arc gis along with the mapping of spatial variability sk predicts values at unsampled points and assesses the uncertainty associated with the predicted value however idw and rbfs do not make explicit predictions about the statistical properties of the input data most of the analyzed gw samples in qatar are characterized by high salinity due to the climate conditions including low rainfall and high temperature besides overexploitation of the gw caused saltwater intrusion from seawater or the deep brackish gw the northern parts of the study area have the lowest salinity while the highly saline locations are within the coastal areas due to seawater intrusion and within some south inland farms due to the mixing with deep brackish water gw with high nitrate is found in some farms that might intensively use nitrogen fertilizers intensively thus the interpolated maps show two types of distributions of analytes as distributions consistent with salinity and clustered distributions independent of salinity that could be related to localize hydro stratigraphic geochemical conditions anthropogenic causes such as fertilizer impacts the results should be supported with more field sampling and investigation to give more divulging results using a multi method interpolation analysis is a significant tool to support the decision makers and to enhance gw management gis linked monitoring system could be used for easier and faster determination of the gw quality it can be inferred from the analysis that gw in qatar requires treatment before being used for irrigation regulations and gis based monitoring systems should be implemented to control gw exploitation and to monitor water quality improvement for

for the most of the variable data while the rbfs model was the best interpolation method for selenium and boron data the idw model was the best interpolated method for sodium tds sar and potassium

as shown in equation 3 3 sar n a c a 2 m g 2 2 2 3 comparing interpolation methods spatial interpolation techniques are classified into deterministic or non geostatistical interpolation and geostatistical interpolation idw and rbfs are deterministic interpolation methods which use simple mathematical models to determine an unknown point from the surrounding known points while geostatistical interpolation such as kriging uses more complex geostatistical models that include the statistical correlations between the sampled points also known as spatial autocorrelation xiao et al 2016 the comparisons between the spatial interpolation methods according to several criteria have been conducted by li and heap 2011 as shown in table 1 variations in natural resources like gw and associated environmental issues have been studied spatially and temporally applying deterministic and geostatistical techniques of interpolation in arcgis gunaalan et al 2018 simple kriging sk is a geostatistical technique whereas idw and rbfs methods are deterministic interpolation techniques gidey et al 2018 the arcgis geostatistical analyst extension has been employed for a detailed analysis of alterations in different spatial variables and found to bridge geostatistics and gis analysis with tangible results uyan and cay 2013 the boundaries need to be demarcated precisely for an accurate interpolation gunaalan et al 2018 effective prediction of unknown factors of locations using available values and sample sizes stahl et al 2006 acceptable spatial sample locations güler 2014 normality of the existing sets of data wu et al 2016 attained spatial resolution hengl 2007 and the method of interpolation xie et al 2011 the ambiguity in the analysis will be amplified if the spatial variation in water quality measurements is not represented properly by the well locations or sampling sites wagner et al 2012 xie et al 2011 found that the size of the polluted area affected the efficacy of the interpolation methods used to describe the presence of heavy metals in soil spatially seyedmohammadi et al 2016 found ordinary kriging ok to be better than five other spatial interpolation methods for estimating the spatial dissemination of electrical conductivity ec in gw comparing different spatial interpolation methods employed to predict ec tds and ph empirical bayesian kriging was found to be superior to other methods gunarathna et al 2016a b to estimate a point for an unsampled location idw employs the sampled points at the neighborhood of the predicted location and that the sampled point nearest to the predicted locations have more effect on the estimated point idw is an interpolation method in which each point value has a weight that diminishes as a function of distance magesh and elango 2019 idw is an estimation method in which each point value has a weight that reduces with distance which is calculated using equation 4 4 z p i 1 n z i d i p i 1 n 1 d i p where zi is the value of the known point numeric attributed di is the distance to a known point zp is the unknown point numeric attributed to be interpolated n is the number of observations and p is a user selected exponent powers of the distance paramasivam and venkatramanan 2019 the optimization of the idw model could be achieved by selecting the lowest root mean square rms by changing the power value thus idw will never generate a value that is higher than the maximum value bashir and fouli 2015 the disadvantages of idw are that it is sensitive to outliers clustering and sampling configuration li and heap 2011 in comparison between rbf with idw the rbfs may estimate points outside the measured points range balakrishnan 2011 however they are both an exact interpolator the advantage of rbfs is that it creates a smooth output surface for gradually changing surfaces such as elevation whereas the disadvantage of rbfs is that it is unfit with the significant changes in the sampled points within short distances and with the sample data that contains uncertainty measurement of error or outliers chung et al 2019 similar to idw interpolation kriging gives weights from the distance around measured points to estimate unmeasured locations however kriging weights are determined by the distance and the spatial orientation of the known points or semi variograms li and heap 2011 the most common semi variogram model is the spherical which is used in this study the simple idea of spherical semi variogram models is that unsampled points can be predicted by the weighted sum of the sampled points within a certain radius chung et al 2019 because the variogram alters with distance the weights rely on the distribution of the sampled points distribution an empirical variogram can be quantified from sampled points by the following equation 5 chung et al 2019 5 γ h 1 2 n i 1 n z x i z x i h 2 where γ h is the predicted semi variance at a separation distance or lag h h is the distance among sampled values n is the number of pairs of samples separated by h and z is the measured points thus kriging models depend on semi variogram models of spatial autocorrelation to quantify weights which decreases the variance in the estimated value in terms of distance and direction to predict points and uncertainty associated with the predictions balakrishnan 2011 the performance of kriging models is better than non geostatistical models that kriging estimates uncertainty associated with the predictions li and heap 2011 the geostatistical interpolation is believed to be an unbiased optimized estimation model for depicting regionalized variables xiao et al 2016 however kriging is an inexact model such that the output surface does not contain the exact values of the input data and the interpolated values may exceed the minimum and maximum measured point li and heap 2011 kriging is a smoothing process because the variance of the kriged values is lower than that of the original data myers 1991 however it has some smoothing deficiency xiao et al 2016 besides kriging needs more computing and modeling time balakrishnan 2011 generally different interpolation techniques will produce unalike outputs with the same input data thus no interpreter is more accurate than others under all circumstances arslan and turan 2015 the accuracy should be judged by the sample quantity and the understanding of the study area with the spatial arrangement of the sample locations cross validation is a tool to evaluate how well the model estimates points at locations with no data and it helps to decide the best model that performs better than another model on a particular data set davis 1987 it does not imply that the model in general will always perform better syed et al 2003 also it helps to optimize and search several possibilities of models parameters such as power neighborhood and the order of detrending to better utilize the data liu et al 2012 according to falivene et al 2010 cross validation omits one measured sample point and uses the rest of the data to estimate a value at that location the point is then returned into the dataset and a different point is omitted all data points are estimated by the same steps to assess the model pairs of the original data value and predicted values they are compared by subtracting them then squared and added the resulting sum is known as a least squares fit thus cross validation produces three values for each location the original data point the predicted point and the minimized estimation variance xiao et al 2016 a variety of cross validation statistics are used to examine how close the predicted values are to the known values to explore how well the variogram fits the data and to assess the performance of the interpolation methods for this particular analysis syed et al 2003 for idw and rbfs methods results are usually stated as mean error me and root mean squared error rmse their root mean square standardized error must be near to one if the standard errors are valid if the root mean square standardized error is higher than one it indicates underestimating while if it is lower than one it indicates overestimating singh verma 2019 the comparison between interpolation methods was made based on the cross validation results evaluation of different interpolation methods is established from the rmse which are obtained from the integrated interpolation model and cross validation results the optimization process is conducted by finding the kernel parameter values for the rbfs model the power and neighborhood values for the idw model and for the sk parameters that give the model with the lowest rmse rmse is used as a cross validation indicator to assess how well the model fits for the representation of input data the lowest rmse results are obtained with the largest number of neighbors 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparing interpolation methods in this study different values of power values and neighborhood types were examined then the rmse values were obtained balakrishnan 2011 as shown in tables 2 4 the best fit interpolated model for the input data representation is the one with the least rmse value arslan and turan 2015 similarly falivene et al 2010 illustrated that interpolation smoothing is primarily controlled by the number of neighbors averaged and by the model parameters table 2 shows rmse for idw parameters with the lowest rmse value and the best parameters tables 3 and 4 show the optimized rbfs parameters and the optimized kriging parameters respectively some cross validation statistics such as rmse average standard error mean standardized and root mean square standardized values were also shown the result shows that the sk model performed better than idw and rbfs models for ph chloride selenium strontium potassium sar molybdenum lithium and nitrate date while the rbfs model was the best for sodium and calcium idw model worked better for tds boron sulfate nevertheless rmse values between idw and rbf are not significantly different in this study rmse values were generally high one possible explanation is the uneven distribution of the data configuration as large spacing intervals between sample locations generated high rmse values another explanation is the presence of outliers in the original data in the current study the sampling points are not well distributed and the sample size is low due to the limitation to access the private farms that contained some gw wells this resulted in high spatial variation in some attribute data thus to enhance the performance of spatial interpolation and to allow estimation of short range variance the sample size needs to be increased the current study showed that each of the three spatial interpolation methods has unique advantages and produced different output surfaces the sk produced smooth and relatively continuous surfaces that contained irregular changes in the data because sk is an unbiased interpreter that has fitted a semi variogram model sk provides the measurement of prediction uncertainty however sk is an inexact interpolator as the output data did not include the exact input values being exact interpolators idw and rbf have output surface values exactly equal to that of the input data values therefore idw and rbf models gave better interpolation maps that help to visualize the location of gw within and above the guidelines however the idw model is better than rbf as it does not produce values above or below the range of the measured values furthermore the smoothness of the output surface is also an important factor for assessing the performance of the interpolation methods it was noticed that rbfs gave smoother interpolation maps than idw and kriging methods the inferior smoothness of the interpolated maps is due to the uneven distribution of sample points and some extreme value points 3 2 spatial variability analysis fig 2a shows the interpolated map for ph using the sk method the ph values are changed within a range of 6 8 7 9 with an average of 7 3 which meets the world health organization who standard 6 5 8 5 revealing geochemical equilibrium who 2017 only two samples were slightly acidic ph 6 9 and 6 8 that could be correlated to the use of the fertilizer in the farms fig 2 b shows the spatial variation of tds using the idw method ec ranged from 0 92 μs cm to 22 33 μs cm with an average of 7 29 μs cm tds ranged from 598 to 15 633 mg l with an average of 5038 mg l ec is classified as low saline ec 1500 μs cm medium saline 1500 μs cm 3000 μs cm and high saline ec 3000 μs cm ghalib 2017 using this classification there were no samples with ec 500 μs cm which is similar to freshwater ec only two samples are characterized as low salinity one sample as moderately saline and 38 samples as highly saline which is considered unfit for drinking and irrigation who 2017 fao 1994 high tds and ec enhance the corrosion and salinity of the gw the spatial variation in tds maps is due to the type of aquifer rock and the residence time of the gw in addition to the extreme weather condition such as high temperature and low rainfall alsuhaimi et al 2019 in the current study the high ec and the high salinity values are attributed to the aridity of qatar due to the low rainfall and high evaporation also the use of the high salinity gw for irrigation caused salts leaching in addition overexploitation of gw caused the intrusion of the deep brackish gw or the seawater high tds values are shown along the coastal areas due to the seawater intrusion while high ec in the south is due to low rainfall and deep brackish gw intrusion the high tds problem with gw is also shown in hadi and al ruwaith 2008 in kuwait where tds is ranged from 200 mg l to 800 mg l and 14 500 mg l for some locations while in saudi tds is ranged from 13 mg l to 6000 mg l abdel satar et al 2017 saltwater intrusion from coastal areas is also reported by other studies such as the study by nwankwo et al 2020 the order of the major cation in the gw was na ca2 mg2 k as illustrated in fig 3 a while the major anion s order was cl so4 2 hco3 no3 as shown in fig 3b ahmad et al 2020 fig 4a shows na interpolated map using the rbfs method na ions were found as the most dominant cation the range of the ions was 64 2 mg l 5547 mg l with an average of 1466 mg l the natural source of na in the gw is the weathering minerals such as halite and feldspar minerals na high levels more than the natural levels are mainly correlated to the anthropogenic sources such as sewage effluent and leaching from landfills and saltwater intrusion ghalib 2017 sodium levels above

and cardiac problems who 2017 39 samples were inappropriate for drinking due to high na concentration na 200 mg l cl ions were the most dominant anion ranging from 203 6 mg l to 30 806 mg l with an average of 6289 mg l fig 4 b shows cl interpolated map using the sk method high cl in drinking water results in a salty taste adimalla and venkatayogi 2018 the spatial distribution of sodium and chloride in groundwater is similar to the distribution of tds which increases from inland to coast as shown by the interpolation maps thus tds can be used as a surrogate for sodium and chloride so4 2 ions ranged from 53 4 mg l to 11 596 mg l with an average of 4977 mg l the gypsum caso4 2h2o and anhydrite caso4 are a natural source of metallic sulfate fig 4c shows the spatial variation of so4 2 using the idw method the interpolation map of so4 2 ions illustrates that the highest levels are in the southern area due to the dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite and leached water from agriculture activities alsuhaimi et al 2019 water with high cl and so4 2 result in hypertension laxative effect diarrhea asthma dehydration and gastrointestinal irritation who 2017 no3 ions ranged from 5 2 mg l to 113 3 mg l with an average of 37 2 mg l fig 4d shows the interpolation map for no3 using the sk method no3 ions are important for plant growth as a main nutrient fertilizers agricultural municipal waste and leaching of sewage might contribute to high no3 in the gw mallick et al 2018 the high concentration of nitrate in drinking water results in methemoglobinemia in infants furthermore it causes cyanosis goiter oral cancer cancer of the colon gastrointestinal cancers lymphoma who 2017 the average value of no3 in the gw is 36 32 mg l the interpolation map shows the highest values of no3 in the northern and central of qatar high no3 in the current study is related to inorganic and organic fertilizers manure application in the private farms especially in the shallow gw and domestic effluents

2020 using salty gw for irrigation over the long term reduces the soil fertility and hinders crop yield elumalai et al 2017 irrigation with high salinity gw results in salt accumulation in the crop root zone and reduces the osmotic ability of plants machado and serralheiro 2017 ranking of water suitability for irrigation is conducted based on specific ec and sar uses the irrigation hazard diagram as shown by the wilcox plot in fig 6 a only 16 samples 39 have ec less than 5000 μs cm which is not used in the irrigation hazard diagram the irrigation hazard analysis shows that 60 9 of the gw samples with ec 5000 μs cm should not be used for irrigation the gw found to be with high salinity and ec gw in the study is inappropriate for irrigation and it could be used to irrigate salt tolerance and semi tolerant crops if the soil is irrigated with water of high sar then the soil will need amendments ghalib 2017 stated that gw samples falling into the c4 category are inappropriate for irrigation of all soil types they are only appropriate for high permeable soil which is not the case in qatar fig 6b shows the spatial distribution of sar using the sk method which reveals high

al taani et al 2012 4 conclusion a clear understanding of the spatial distribution of gw quality parameters is the key issue for agricultural and environmental management in the current analysis unsampled points are interpolated by three interpolation methods using arc gis along with the mapping of spatial variability sk predicts values at unsampled points and assesses the uncertainty associated with the predicted value however idw and rbfs do not make explicit predictions about the statistical properties of the input data most of the analyzed gw samples in qatar are characterized by high salinity due to the climate conditions including low rainfall and high temperature besides overexploitation of the gw caused saltwater intrusion from seawater or the deep brackish gw the northern parts of the study area have the lowest salinity while the highly saline locations are within the coastal areas due to seawater intrusion and within some south inland farms due to the mixing with deep brackish water gw with high nitrate is found in some farms that might intensively use nitrogen fertilizers intensively thus the interpolated maps show two types of distributions of analytes as distributions consistent with salinity and clustered distributions independent of salinity that could be related to localize hydro stratigraphic geochemical conditions anthropogenic causes such as fertilizer impacts the results should be supported with more field sampling and investigation to give more divulging results using a multi method interpolation analysis is a significant tool to support the decision makers and to enhance gw management gis linked monitoring system could be used for easier and faster determination of the gw quality it can be inferred from the analysis that gw in qatar requires treatment before being used for irrigation regulations and gis based monitoring systems should be implemented to control gw exploitation and to monitor water quality improvement for
