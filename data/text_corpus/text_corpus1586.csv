data are provided in this article other requests on data used in this study can be sent to the corresponding author 1 introduction flood potential focuses on defining the propensity for flooding based on the assessment of various conditioning factors which are usually represented by physical geographical factors such as slope river density lithology soils and land use land cover jacinto et al 2015 zaharia et al 2015 2017 costache 2019 costache et al 2021 various approaches and methods exist for flood potential mapping and assessment these approaches can be grouped into three basic groups multi criteria statistical and machine learning the degree of subjectivity is usually higher in case of multi criteria methods such as analytical hierarchy process souissi et al 2019 vojtek et al 2021a 2021b analytical network process dano et al 2019 weighted linear combination kourgialas and karatzas 2011 visekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje vikor arabameri et al 2019 technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis entropy weighting malekinezhad et al 2021 or simple additive weighting khosravi et al 2019 which mostly rely on the expert judgments regarding the role and weight of individual flood conditioning factors or their classes on the other hand the statistical i e bivariate khosravi et al 2016 and multivariate statistics tehrany et al 2014 and machine learning methods like artificial neural networks kia et al 2012 adaptive neuro fuzzy interference systems bui et al 2018 support vector machines tehrany et al 2015 decision trees lee et al 2017 mosavi et al 2020 janizadeh et al 2021a or extreme gradient boosting janizadeh et al 2021b are considered more objective in this respect the vast majority of flood potential studies deal with the raster based approaches especially the already mentioned statistical and machine learning models which also heavily rely on the flood inventory databases arabameri et al 2022 liu et al 2022 sachdeva and kumar 2022 these databases contain information on the spatial location of past floods in the form of flood extent polygons or seeds of raster cells however it happens many times that these databases include only single flood points representing individual flood locations which is considered problematic when the models are to be properly trained or tested on the real extent of past floods as long as obtaining reliable data on past floods can be difficult we preferred to focus on the municipal level in this study this however requires using a different approach which is represented by a vector based multi criteria analysis the reason for choosing the municipal level is based on the fact that each municipality manages its own territory and can thus influence various aspects of flood prevention mitigation protection or adaptation for example through local spatial plans grants for non structural and structural flood protection measures involvement of local inhabitants and other stakeholders and so on in slovakia there have been very few attempts to assess the flood potential at municipal level so far in particular it was the work of solín and rusnák 2020 and solín et al 2014 however the first mentioned work analyzed only 20 municipalities while the second work analyzed municipalities located in headwater basins of slovakia due to this fact this study represents a first attempt to define the riverine flood potential at national level which includes all municipalities of slovakia flood potential hazard exposure vulnerability or risk were analyzed at municipal or other administrative unit or catchment level also in other countries either covering the whole country or only selected region santos et al 2019 assessed the riverine flood potential at municipal level in portugal using the multi criteria analysis while santos et al 2020 analyzed the flood risk which also contained flood potential hazard and vulnerability analysis in the same portuguese municipalities pathak et al 2020 analyzed flood risk at catchment level in mumbai city while tang et al 2021 focused on the flood risk assessment in nine districts located in southeastern china wing et al 2022 analyzed current flood risk and future projections under the climate change using the county level in u s furthermore the application of spatial statistics to analyze the spatial clusters i e degree to which values at one place are similar to those in surrounding areas was proved to be an efficient tool in few flood studies which focused on administrative scale such as municipalities tate et al 2021 applied spatial autocorrelation for analyzing the hotspots of high flood exposure and social vulnerability in u s counties sajjad et al 2020 analyzed hurricane flood risk along the united states u s atlantic and gulf coasts using different techniques of spatial statistics roder and sofia 2017 assessed social vulnerability to floods in 2772 municipalities of northern italy using the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation röthlisberger et al 2017 analyzed flood exposure in the municipalities of switzerland using the local spatial autocorrelation statistic g however it has to be noted that no study focused on spatial statistical analysis of flood potential so far which makes this study innovative from this aspect understanding the role of flood conditioning factors which contribute to the occurrence of floods and the overall level of flood potential can help municipal self governments to better prepare for future flood situations furthermore flood potential assessment represents a basic input for creating flood management plans and strategies apollonio et al 2018 this is stressed also in the eu floods directive 2007 where this kind of flood mapping should play a crucial role within the preliminary flood risk assessment pfra in which the goal is to identify areas with existing potentially significant flood risk or areas likely to have a potentially significant flood risk in slovakia the first pfra document was published in 2011 its update in 2018 and this document should be further re evaluated every six years regarding the novelty of this study the whole methodology can be considered innovative for the flood potential research and especially the pfra the main outcome of the second cycle of pfra 2018 in slovakia was a list of 192 areas with potentially significant flood risk however the methodology applied to determine these areas at the national scale lacks conceptual basis clarifying the identification of the critical areas which was also criticized by solín 2014 in this study the novelty and innovative elements pertain to the use of a comprehensive methodology for identifying the municipalities with different level of riverine flood potential it is represented by the vector based and weighting approach for calculating the flood potential index and spatial clustering of municipalities to determine high and low spatial dependence among the neighboring municipalities using the spatial autocorrelation furthermore this study focuses on national scale mapping based on the readily available data which enable systematical mapping of the present riverine flood potential and its comparison with past years or future scenarios which is also planned for future research tasks the aim of this study is i to assess the riverine flood potential in municipalities of slovakia using the spatial multi criteria analysis and geographic information systems gis and ii to analyze the spatial clusters of riverine flood potential at municipal level using the spatial autocorrelation i e the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation the riverine flood potential was determined based on eight flood conditioning factors slope curvature maximum 5 day rainfall river density land cover soil texture lithology and flood frequency except the flood frequency all other factors were correlated against the database of flood events in municipalities during the years 1997 2021 in order to derive the weights of factors the resulting map of riverine flood potential in municipalities was spatially analyzed using the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation in order to determine the municipalities with the highest potential to riverine flooding challenges which were addressed in this study pertain to the following most of the flood potential studies focus on the raster based approaches and pixel level where the major difficulty is to have reliable flood inventory database moreover the limitation for raster based and national scale mapping with machine learning methods is seen in the number of pixels points used for modeling which is limited depending on the computer hardware and relevant software this study tries to overcome the mentioned issues using the vector based approach and municipal level where the flood frequency database and vector layers of flood factors were used instead from the aspect of integrated and decentralized flood risk management it seems more meaningful to assess the riverine flood potential at municipal level as the municipal self governments are very important subjects and their greater involvement in flood risk management and governance can be expected if they have knowledge on flood potential for the territory they manage regarding the national scale mapping the identification of flood potential in municipalities as well as spatial clusters of municipalities with high and or low spatial dependence can bring a new concept to the methodology of preparing the pfra document which is being revisited in six year cycles under the eu floods directive 2 study area the study area is represented by the territory of slovakia which belongs to central europe and covers 49034 km2 slovakia shares the western border with czechia south western border with austria southern border with hungary eastern border with ukraine and northern border with poland based on the nomenclature of territorial units for statistics nuts the country contains one nuts 1 region four nuts 2 regions eight nuts 3 regions 79 lau 1 local administrative units nuts 4 regions and 2927 lau 2 local administrative units nuts 5 which are called municipalities this study focuses on the lau 2 level i e 2927 municipalities which also represent local self governments all geomorphological units in slovakia belong to the alpine himalayan system alpide belt which is divided into carpathians sub system mountains and pannonian basin sub system lowlands basins the lowest elevation point has 94 m while the highest elevation point has 2655 m the climate of slovakia is characterized by temperate climatic conditions based on lapin et al 2002 the country is divided into three climatic regions warm region with more than 50 summer days and average daily maximum temperature of more than 25 c the moderately warm region is characterized by less than 50 summer days average daily maximum temperature of more than 25 c and july mean temperature of 16 c or more the cool region is characterized by july mean temperature of less than 16 c the main european divide passes through the territory of slovakia and it is represented by the danube river basin which drains most of surface waters into the black sea 96 of all waters and poprad and dunajec rivers tributaries of the vistula river which drain surface waters into the baltic sea 4 of all waters there are three types of river runoff regime i temporary snow regime ii snow rain combined regime and iii rain snow combined regime šimo and zaťko 2002 zeleňáková and fendeková 2018 the total length of rivers in slovakia is 59320 km and the longest is the váh river 360 km fig 1 shows the location of slovakia in europe and its division into nuts 3 and lau 2 administrative units the most important riverine floods occurred in summer months of 2010 when 1235 flood events affected altogether 939 municipalities across the whole territory of slovakia another significant flood years were 2006 when 452 flood events occurred in 415 municipalities 2014 when 327 flood events occurred in 310 municipalities 2020 when 259 flood events occurred in 238 municipalities 2008 when 235 flood events occurred in 233 municipalities or 2009 when 201 flood events occurred in 194 municipalities reports on the course and consequences of floods in the slovak republic 2001 2021 pfra 2018 3 data and methods the methodological workflow used in this study is graphically explained in fig 2 the main steps of the methodology are the following i selection of flood conditioning factors ii preparation and processing of flood conditioning factors in gis iii weighting and aggregation of factor classes into the normalized factor values iv weighted linear combination of factors into the final flood potential index fpi and v using the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation to determine statistically significant spatial clusters of riverine flood potential the following sub sections describe the data and methods used in this study 3 1 flood conditioning factors in order to determine the fpi eight flood conditioning factors were processed slope curvature maximum 5 day rainfall river density land cover soil texture lithology and flood frequency the selected factors represent four basic groups of factors morphometric slope curvature rainfall maximum 5 day rainfall hydrographic river density infiltration land cover soil texture and lithology which influence the runoff conditions i e surface runoff the selected factors are considered relevant and important for riverine flood potential mapping as evidenced also in similar studies for example solín et al 2014 santos et al 2019 or solín and rusnák 2020 moreover these factors are considered primary for the riverine flood potential mapping in particular the factors of slope and curvature represent primary morphometric factors influencing the movement or accumulation of water down the slope i e the concave forms of terrain represent higher riverine flood potential while the lower the slope the greater the riverine flood potential some other factors like topographic wetness index twi stream power index spi sediment transport index sti or topographic position index tpi were also used in raster based flood potential studies e g costache 2019 costache et al 2021 ekmekcioğlu et al 2022 however these factors are considered secondary derivatives of primary factors of slope or flow accumulation in addition the factor of elevation was not considered important for riverine flood potential mapping at municipal level since there are very small differences in elevations in some of the municipalities furthermore we used one representative factor of rainfall maximum 5 day rainfall and one representative factor of hydrography river density where the increase in their values represents the greater riverine flood potential the rest of the factors lithology soil texture and land cover influence the infiltration of water and thus the runoff conditions the applied rule was the lower the infiltration capability permeability of rocks soil texture and land cover the greater the potential for riverine floods it has to be also noted that it is not appropriate to use too many factors when applying the weighting multi criteria methods because the calculated weights are not differentiated adequately and some factors can have the same weights all in all the process of choosing flood conditioning factors is usually done subjectively as there are no generally accepted guidelines for this issue the basic input for morphometric factors of slope and curvature was a digital elevation model dem with the resolution of 10 m labeled as dmr3 5 the dem was provided by the geodetic and cartographic institute in bratislava since the applied analysis is vector based the factors in raster format slope and curvature had to be converted into the vector format using gis the maximum 5 day rainfall was calculated from the average annual maximum values of 5 day rainfall during a period 1981 2010 and the source data are available in the climate atlas of slovakia bochníček et al 2015 the original map of average annual maximum values of 5 day rainfall was created based on the daily values of rainfall at the available rainfall stations during the period 1981 2010 and then interpolated using the geographically weighted regression the river density in each municipality was calculated in gis based on the vector layer of river network which was provided by the geodetic and cartographic institute in bratislava the factors influencing the water infiltration were represented by the land cover soil texture and lithology the land cover map was derived from the corine land cover clc vector database for the year 2018 soil texture was derived from the vector layers of bonited soil ecological units bpej provided by the soil science and conservation research institute in bratislava and forest soil units provided by the national forest centre in zvolen which were both originally mapped at a scale of 1 10 000 the source for lithology factor was a vector map of engineering geological zones at a scale of 1 50 000 which is provided by the state geological institute of dionýz štúr in bratislava the flood frequency factor is represented by the database of past flood events in the municipalities for the period 1997 2021 which was manually created from the annual reports on the course and consequences of floods in the slovak republic for the years 2001 2021 published by the ministry of environment of the slovak republic and documents of the pfra 2018 which were also published by the ministry of environment of the slovak republic although the flood frequency can be considered the effect of the previously mentioned flood conditioning factors this factor was necessary in this study to differentiate the riverine flood potential among the municipalities and define the spatial clusters of municipalities having similar spatial dependence for example there can be a municipality with very high or high riverine flood potential due to physical geographical factors and land cover but with no occurrence of flood events on the other hand there can be a municipality with very low or low riverine flood potential due to physical geographical factors and land cover but with some occurrence of flood events due to these reasons we included the flood frequency as a factor implying that the riverine flood potential in a certain municipality increases with the increasing number of flood events in addition the flood frequency was used as a factor in other similar studies for example solín and rusnák 2020 or solín et al 2014 the sources for input data used in this study are presented in table 1 3 2 weighting of factor classes and riverine flood potential determination before assigning the weights to factor classes we calculated the percentage of factor classes in each municipality except for the flood frequency and river density using gis the factor classes are presented in table 2 in case of the flood frequency and river density these factors were scaled to the range 0 1 using the maximum value method where the minimum value of the factor is transformed into 0 the maximum value is transformed into 1 and every other value is transformed into a decimal between 0 and 1 using eq 1 1 x j x j max x j where x j is the scaled value of the j th factor x j is the original value of the j th factor and max x j is the original maximum value of the j th factor the percentage of factors classes was subsequently multiplied by the weights these weights were calculated with the use of the rank sum method which is expressed by eq 2 malczewski 1999 zardari et al 2015 2 w j n r j 1 k 1 n n r k 1 where w j is the normalized weight for the j th factor class n is the number of factor classes under consideration and r j is the rank position of the j th factor class which was determined on the basis of expert judgment and literature review the value of w j is in the 0 1 interval after that the weighted factor classes were summed together and the values of factors were normalized to the range 0 1 based on eq 1 in order to derive the weights for factors the pearson correlation coefficient was used to correlate individual flood conditioning factors with the flood frequency number of flood events using eq 3 3 r x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where r xy is the pearson correlation coefficient n is the number of municipalities x i and y i are the values of individual municipalities and x and y are the mean values of n based on the strength of the correlation the factors were ranked from the most important to the least important and the final weights were assigned to each factor using the rank sum method as presented in eq 2 using the weighted linear combination technique individual flood factors were multiplied with their normalized weights and summation of weighted factors determined the final flood potential index fpi the weighted linear combination is expressed by eq 4 malczewski 2000 4 fpi j x j w j where fpi is the flood potential index w j is the normalized weight of the j th factor and x j is the j th factor transformed into the scale 0 1 3 3 spatial autocorrelation the spatial autocorrelation was used in order to determine spatial patterns clusters in the resulting riverine flood potential where neighboring spatial units municipalities have similar values or particular municipalities are different from their neighbors for identifying the spatial patterns we used the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation anselin 1995 which is expressed by eq 5 5 i x i x j 1 j 1 n w ij n 1 x 2 j 1 j 1 n w ij x j x where n is the number of spatial units municipalities w ij is the spatial weight between the i th and j th spatial units municipalities x i i 1 2 n is the value of the riverine flood potential in the spatial unit municipality i and x i is the arithmetic mean of the riverine flood potential spatial unit the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation i can be used for spatial units which are represented by various types of data such as nominal ordinal or interval data the coefficient i can have the values in the range 1 1 the closer the value of the coefficient is to 0 the more randomness is indicated which means that there is a statistical insignificance of a given factor in space on the other hand the closer the value of the coefficient is to 1 the more positive spatial autocorrelation is indicated furthermore the closer the value of the coefficient is to 1 the more negative spatial autocorrelation is indicated fotheringham et al 2002 the resulting local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation has to be tested in terms of its statistical significance in this study the null hypothesis h0 was tested that there is no spatial autocorrelation between the values of riverine flood potential in n spatial units the statistics z i score for testing the statistical significance of the coefficient has an asymptotically normal distribution and is expressed by eq 6 6 z i i e i v i where e i 1 n 1 v i e i 2 e i 2 are the mean value and variance of the local moran s coefficient i after obtaining the value of z i score this value is then compared to the p value the closer the value of z i score is to 1 there is a higher level of confidence that the riverine flood potential is spatially autocorrelated furthermore if the probability p value is less than 0 05 or 0 01 the null hypothesis is rejected at one of the significance levels if the probability p value is more than 0 05 or 0 01 the null hypothesis cannot be rejected in this study the assumption of homogeneity was adopted for calculating the global characteristics of spatial autocorrelation however there may be a case when this assumption is not valid and global statistics can erroneously indicate the absence of spatial autocorrelation although there can be a strong positive or negative autocorrelation in different parts of spatial units to overcome these possible problems we used the local indicators of spatial association lisa which are site specific and the sum of all lisa indicators is proportional to the global value of moran s statistics anselin 1995 to visualize the results of the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation i we used the moran s scatter plot which was created in the geoda software the quadrants in the moran s scatter plot upper right high high hot spots lower left low low cold spots upper left low high spatial outliers lower right high low spatial outliers show how much each type of spatial dependence influences the generation of the moran s coefficient i anselin 1996 4 results and discussion 4 1 weights of factors classes the resulting weights of factor classes using the rank sum method are presented in table 3 the highest rank r j i e highest potential for riverine flooding equals 1 the highest normalized weights w j were assigned to the following classes slopes from 0 to 2 concave forms of curvature very low permeability of rocks clayey and clay soil texture urban fabric land cover and maximum 5 day rainfall of more than 90 mm choosing the mentioned classes as having the highest potential to riverine flooding is in line with other flood potential studies for example nguyen et al 2020 solín and rusnák 2020 or yariyan et al 2020 in the next steps the share of the factor classes was multiplied by the corresponding normalized weight the weighted percentages were summed together and then normalized to the range 0 1 in addition the factors of flood frequency and river density were directly normalized to the range 0 1 as they were not classified into intervals classes in the next sub section we present the values of flood conditioning factors in each municipality as well as the original input values of these factors 4 2 flood conditioning factors the original values of flood conditioning factors as well as the calculated normalized values at municipal level are presented in figs 3 10 the classes of calculated flood conditioning factors at municipal level were divided based on the natural breaks jenks classification the slope factor was classified based on the work of demek 1972 as can be seen in fig 3a low slopes are typical for lowlands and basins while higher slopes can be usually found in mountains or highlands fig 3b shows that the highest slope potential for flooding is in western southern and eastern slovakia which are characterized by lowlands podunajská nížina lowland východoslovenská nížina lowland and záhorská lowland and low lying basins like košická kotlina basin or juhoslovenská kotlina basin the curvature factor includes concave linear and convex forms of terrain based on fig 4a b we can see that concave forms of terrain have higher shares in municipalities located in central northern eastern and partly southern slovakia fig 5a b shows that the maximum 5 day rainfall generally increases with the elevation i e from low values in lowland areas to high values in mountainous areas as for the river density factor fig 6a b the highest values can be seen in the municipalities of northern eastern and central slovakia where they create clusters of different size based on the maps of clc 2018 fig 7a b we can see that the highest values were recorded in municipalities which are located in lowlands especially podunajská nížina lowland and východoslovenská nížina lowland and where the share of arable land is higher than the share of forest which highly influences the water infiltration into soil horizons as for the soil texture the highest values can be found again in lowlands as well as basins where the clayey or clayey loamy soils have higher shares than in other municipalities fig 8a b the lithological conditions are the most unfavorable in northern eastern and central slovakia where rocks with very low or low permeability prevail such as flyschoid conglomerate sandstone metamorphosed or volcanic types of rocks on the other hand municipalities located mostly in lowlands of western eastern and southern slovakia have higher share of highly permeable rocks such as various types of quaternary sediments e g aeolian sands gravel loess but there are also municipalities with higher share of highly permeable dolomite and limestone rocks fig 9a b as for the flood frequency factor fig 10a b the total number of flood events between the years 1997 and 2021 was 4090 while no flood occurred in 1310 municipalities one flood event was recorded in 643 municipalities from two to four flood events occurred in 739 municipalities from five to seven flood events occurred in 192 municipalities and more than eight flood events were recorded in 43 municipalities the highest values of flood frequency were recorded in municipalities of northern eastern and partly western slovakia in particular the highest number of flood events regards the myjava basin in western slovakia kysuca basin in northern slovakia hornád basin dunajec and poprad basin topľa basin ondava basin and bodva basin in eastern slovakia 4 3 weights of factors and riverine flood potential as can be seen in table 4 the correlation between individual factors and the number of flood events is small which was to be expected since flood frequency not only accounts for the natural constraints of flood events but also other factors which were not considered in the calculation of riverine flood potential such as flood protection measures or vulnerability of people and assets despite this the rank and weights of factors can be derived as there are certain differences between the correlations the highest positive correlation 0 17 was recorded between the lithology and number of flood events the findings of solín and sládeková madajová 2019 suggest that basin attributes that have a significant influence on the flood frequency are mainly the soil texture lithology permeability and the forest cover of the basins in slovakia when comparing their findings with our results we can see a similar result regarding the importance of lithology rock permeability factor which contributes significantly to the occurrence of floods similar value of positive pearson correlation was recorded also for the factors of river density 0 15 and maximum 5 day rainfall 0 14 as well as curvature 0 08 furthermore the negative correlation can be seen between the flood frequency and factors of slope 0 11 land cover 0 05 and soil texture 0 03 based on the strength of pearson correlation coefficient we ranked the factors from the most important to the least important and assigned the factor weights using the rank sum method the highest normalized weights were assigned to flood frequency 0 222 lithology 0 194 and river density 0 167 while the lowest normalized value was assigned to soil texture 0 028 table 4 to determine the riverine flood potential the weighted factors were aggregated the resulting flood potential map is presented in fig 11 in which the flood potential classes were divided based on the natural breaks jenks classification the highest riverine flood potential was recorded mostly in municipalities of northern and eastern slovakia as well as in several municipalities of central and western slovakia especially myjava region along the border with czechia in particular similar results were obtained in the study by solín and rusnák 2020 who investigated the flood potential in municipalities of the myjava region which has one of the highest potential to flooding in slovakia furthermore solín and sládeková madajová 2019 defined flood hazard for the municipalities located in headwater basins of slovakia based on the factors of average annual precipitation soil texture lithology permeability percentage of forests average slope and altitude of the basins in which the municipalities are located similar results high riverine flood potential were obtained in case of the municipalities located in the myjava region and municipalities located in northern slovakia particularly the orava region kysuce region and eastern slovakia especially the šariš region spiš region or horný zemplín region different results were obtained especially in case of the tekov region hont region and novohrad region central slovakia where many municipalities recorded high or medium flood potential while in this study they recorded low or very low values of flood potential in general very low and low riverine flood potential defined in this study dominates in western and southern slovakia while moderate riverine flood potential was mainly recorded in the municipalities of central slovakia and partly in eastern and western slovakia the distribution of municipalities and number of flood events in flood potential classes is presented in table 5 the highest number of flood events was recorded in high 1263 flood events and very high 1076 flood events flood potential classes and then it decreases from moderate 951 flood events and low 631 flood events to very low flood potential 169 flood events 4 4 spatial clusters of riverine flood potential the value of the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation was 0 767048 and the z i score recorded the value of 70 635451 in addition the p value equals 0 0000 which is less than 0 01 therefore the null hypothesis was rejected at the level of significance α 0 01 and the hypothesis h1 there is a spatial autocorrelation between the values of riverine flood potential was accepted this means that the spatial distribution of riverine flood potential values is not random but it is clustered furthermore the statistical significance of the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation was tested using the moran s scatter plot which is presented in fig 12 in this figure it can be seen that there is a statistically significant dependence among municipalities depending on the values of riverine flood potential in a given municipality and neighboring municipalities moreover we can see high values that are grouped spatially close quadrant high high and low values that are grouped spatially close quadrant low low it has to be noted that there are no high low and low high clusters spatial outliers which means that there are no municipalities where significantly higher or lower flood potential values were recorded in respect to the neighboring municipalities the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation confirmed that there are municipalities next to each other that are closer to each other with respect to the riverine flood potential values in other words the riverine flood potential values are influenced by the location of a given municipality the statistically significant municipalities at different confidence levels are presented in fig 13a and table 6 while municipalities belonging to different types of spatial dependence are presented in fig 13b and tables 7 and 8 as can be seen in table 6 and fig 13a the highest number of municipalities with high high spatial dependence falls within the confidence level of 0 0001 the number of municipalities with high high spatial dependence which are included in the confidence level of 0 001 0 01 and 0 05 is 56 90 and 100 respectively in case of the number of municipalities with low low spatial dependence the highest number 158 was recorded in the confidence level of 0 05 while the other confidence levels of 0 0001 0 001 and 0 01 were recorded in 153 67 and 109 municipalities respectively based on table 7 and fig 13b the high high clusters representing the positive spatial autocorrelation i e municipalities with the highest potential to riverine flooding are mostly located in northern and eastern slovakia one cluster is located in western slovakia and seven clusters in central slovakia this is caused mainly by very low or low permeability of rocks especially flyschoid rocks high values of average annual maximum 5 day rainfall higher river density soil texture types with lower degree of infiltration especially clayey loamy soils as well as relatively high number of flood events in these clusters the highest number of municipalities with high high spatial dependence is in cluster 10 with 355 municipalities which are located in eastern slovakia while the second largest is cluster 2 with 127 municipalities which are located in northern slovakia the smallest high high clusters contain only one municipality the total number of municipalities located in high high clusters is 524 which is 17 9 of all municipalities in addition the total number of flood events in these municipalities is 1684 which is 41 1 out of all flood events recorded in the studied period 1997 2021 moreover table 8 and fig 13b show low low clusters representing the negative spatial autocorrelation i e spatial clusters of municipalities with low values of riverine flood potential they are mostly located in western and southern slovakia and three clusters are located in eastern slovakia the low low clusters of municipalities have the very low or low potential to riverine flooding which can be interpreted by very high and high permeability of rocks e g various quaternary sediments low values of average annual maximum 5 day rainfall lower values of river density as well as relatively low number of flood events or municipalities with no flood occurrence the largest low low cluster is cluster 6 in western slovakia which includes 275 municipalities the second largest low low cluster is cluster 15 in southern slovakia which contains 75 municipalities the total number of municipalities located in low low clusters is 487 which is 16 6 of all municipalities in case of these municipalities the total number of flood events recorded in the studied period 1997 2021 is only 153 which is 3 8 out of all flood events there is also a large number of municipalities where no statistically significant spatial clusters were found the total number of flood events in these municipalities is 2253 which is 55 1 out of all flood events recorded in the studied period 1997 2021 the total number of statistically insignificant municipalities is 1916 which represents 65 5 of all municipalities in terms of spatial clustering of municipalities based on similarity measures there are also other methods like fuzzy clustering or k means clustering which were used in few previous studies focused on flood risk assessment for example he and wan 2021 used a hybrid method of chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm with a fuzzy clustering iterative model for flood hazard assessment in the sichuan province china or wang et al 2018 used coupled fuzzy c means clustering for defining the flood risk in 15 townships of the anhui province china xu et al 2018 applied integrated k means cluster algorithm for urban flood risk mapping in the haikou region china however the advantage of spatial autocorrelation method is related to the fact that it is perfectly suited for polygon vector format of data moreover the results of this method provide the information not only on the statistically significant high high high flood potential clusters but also on the low low low flood potential low high or high low spatial outliers or statistically insignificant spatial clusters this is very important especially from the aspect of prioritizing the municipalities for the adoption of appropriate risk reduction and management strategies xiong et al 2019 tate et al 2021 4 5 relevance for flood risk management and the eu floods directive the calculated fpi provides useful information for adopting various types of flood risk management measures and decision making at the municipal level for instance municipalities with high values of fpi or high values of individual flood conditioning factors should focus primarily on the reduction of unfavorable conditions for flood occurrence by diversified measures not only along the critical river segments but also within the territory of whole municipality through various tools and measures such as spatial urban and landscape planning as well as cooperation with neighboring municipalities either upstream or downstream vojtek and vojteková 2018 2019 grežo et al 2020 regarding the flood risk management decision making at municipal level this study places each municipality also into a national context in other words the municipal leaders can compare their situation with similar municipalities regarding the fpi and how they manage the flood risk as for the eu floods directive 2007 the presented approach is relevant for the phase of pfra the official two cycles of pfra 2011 2018 assessments were already carried out by the slovak water management enterprise which is a state enterprise under the ministry of environment of the slovak republic the main output of the first cycle of pfra 2011 represents a list of critical river sections where potentially significant flood risk exists or is likely to occur in the last cycle of pfra 2018 the list of critical river sections was supplemented with the areas having potentially significant flood risk and the list of municipalities which are located along the critical river sections in this regard our effort was to propose different approach on defining the potentially significant flood risk areas using the comprehensive and detailed in terms of scale and resolution of input data fpi directly at municipal level which has been underestimated so far in flood risk management strategies in slovakia due to centralized flood risk governance solín 2020 diversification and decentralization of flood risk management and governance is being already implemented across some european countries such as united kingdom germany and france and the effort for complementing the structural flood measures with non structural ones is being put forth fournier et al 2016 bubeck et al 2017 hegger et al 2018 a prerequisite for achieving this type of flood risk governance is the clear specification of actors and their roles at local municipalities lau 2 in slovakia regional nut 3 in slovakia national level and also a change in the approach to flood risk mapping and assessment the currently used approach in the pfra 2018 is not effective and detailed enough to provide reasonable basis for the application of diversified and decentralized flood prevention protection and adaptation measures 5 conclusion in this study an attempt was to present the methodology for riverine flood potential mapping at municipal level and identifying the statistically significant clusters of municipalities which have the highest potential for riverine flooding based on the results 524 municipalities which are located mostly in northern and eastern slovakia but also some in western and central slovakia had the highest potential to riverine flooding this result was expected since these areas have very low or low permeability of rocks high values of average annual maximum 5 day rainfall higher river density soil texture types with lower infiltration as well as relatively high number of flood events possible limitations in the presented methods and data may arise from the rank sum weighting method applied this method is generally not suitable for flood potential mapping with many flood conditioning factors which may cause that the calculated weights are not differentiated enough and some factors can have the same weights simultaneously another possible limitation can arise from the selection of flood conditioning factors which was done subjectively in this study however it has to be mentioned that there is no consensus among researchers on how many and which factors should be used in flood potential studies regarding the data used a limitation can be seen in the maximum 5 day rainfall factor which was derived for the period 1981 2010 as well as the original map is more generalized in comparison to the other factors although the clc 2018 was mapped based on the sentinel 2 satellite images it can also be considered more generalized because the minimum mapping unit was 25 ha 100 m with geometric accuracy of less than 100 m in this regard the overall source data limitation can be seen in the original map scales or spatial resolution which are not consistent and thus affected by different level of generalization however this problem can be seen in each flood potential study where it is difficult to have consistent input data in practice recommendations from this study are the following in terms of the integrated decentralized flood risk assessment this study recommends focusing on the municipal level which provides relevant information on flood potential not only for the local self governments but more importantly for national scale pfra in particular the presented approach provides useful information on the municipalities which are potentially endangered by the riverine floods while spatial differentiation of municipalities using the spatial autocorrelation enables to prioritize the municipalities with high high spatial dependence in terms of flood risk management and apply diversified flood measures firstly to these municipalities the presented methodology and choice of the factors are primarily applicable for potential fluvial riverine flooding in order to include also other types of flood such as flash flood pluvial flood or sheetflood the methodology and mainly selection of factors should be modified and adapted using the same methodology the flood potential index can be determined in other similar study areas at different spatial scales local regional national and different types of administrative units districts counties etc furthermore this study uses readily and publicly available data which enables systematical mapping of riverine flood potential index over the time therefore future research will be directed towards the spatio temporal changes in riverine flood potential in municipalities of slovakia and will be focused on the historical perspective as well as on the future scenarios as a result our effort is to establish systematic mapping of flood potential but also flood risk and its components hazard and vulnerability at municipal level in slovakia funding this work was supported by the scientific grant agency of the ministry of education

7930,study region slovakia 2927 municipalities study focus this study maps and assesses the riverine flood potential in municipalities of slovakia using the vector based spatial multi criteria analysis and geographic information systems gis the flood potential index fpi in municipalities was computed based on eight flood factors which were normalized weighted and aggregated into the fpi index furthermore we analyzed the spatial clusters of riverine flood potential using the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation new hydrological insights for the region the very high and high fpi 767 municipalities was recorded mostly in municipalities of northern and eastern slovakia very low and low fpi 1452 municipalities dominates in western and southern slovakia while moderate fpi 708 municipalities was mainly recorded in municipalities of central slovakia the number of statistically significant high high and low low spatial clusters of riverine flood potential was 16 524 municipalities and 18 487 municipalities respectively clusters of positive spatial autocorrelation are mostly located in the northern and eastern slovakia one cluster in western slovakia and seven clusters in central slovakia clusters of negative spatial autocorrelation are mostly located in western and southern slovakia and three clusters in eastern slovakia the proposed methodology can be useful for regular updating of preliminary flood risk assessment pfra in slovakia under the eu floods directive graphical abstract ga1 keywords riverine flood potential municipality spatial multi criteria analysis gis spatial autocorrelation slovakia data availability statement all of the source data which support the findings of this article are publicly available and the weblinks for source data are provided in this article other requests on data used in this study can be sent to the corresponding author 1 introduction flood potential focuses on defining the propensity for flooding based on the assessment of various conditioning factors which are usually represented by physical geographical factors such as slope river density lithology soils and land use land cover jacinto et al 2015 zaharia et al 2015 2017 costache 2019 costache et al 2021 various approaches and methods exist for flood potential mapping and assessment these approaches can be grouped into three basic groups multi criteria statistical and machine learning the degree of subjectivity is usually higher in case of multi criteria methods such as analytical hierarchy process souissi et al 2019 vojtek et al 2021a 2021b analytical network process dano et al 2019 weighted linear combination kourgialas and karatzas 2011 visekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje vikor arabameri et al 2019 technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis entropy weighting malekinezhad et al 2021 or simple additive weighting khosravi et al 2019 which mostly rely on the expert judgments regarding the role and weight of individual flood conditioning factors or their classes on the other hand the statistical i e bivariate khosravi et al 2016 and multivariate statistics tehrany et al 2014 and machine learning methods like artificial neural networks kia et al 2012 adaptive neuro fuzzy interference systems bui et al 2018 support vector machines tehrany et al 2015 decision trees lee et al 2017 mosavi et al 2020 janizadeh et al 2021a or extreme gradient boosting janizadeh et al 2021b are considered more objective in this respect the vast majority of flood potential studies deal with the raster based approaches especially the already mentioned statistical and machine learning models which also heavily rely on the flood inventory databases arabameri et al 2022 liu et al 2022 sachdeva and kumar 2022 these databases contain information on the spatial location of past floods in the form of flood extent polygons or seeds of raster cells however it happens many times that these databases include only single flood points representing individual flood locations which is considered problematic when the models are to be properly trained or tested on the real extent of past floods as long as obtaining reliable data on past floods can be difficult we preferred to focus on the municipal level in this study this however requires using a different approach which is represented by a vector based multi criteria analysis the reason for choosing the municipal level is based on the fact that each municipality manages its own territory and can thus influence various aspects of flood prevention mitigation protection or adaptation for example through local spatial plans grants for non structural and structural flood protection measures involvement of local inhabitants and other stakeholders and so on in slovakia there have been very few attempts to assess the flood potential at municipal level so far in particular it was the work of solín and rusnák 2020 and solín et al 2014 however the first mentioned work analyzed only 20 municipalities while the second work analyzed municipalities located in headwater basins of slovakia due to this fact this study represents a first attempt to define the riverine flood potential at national level which includes all municipalities of slovakia flood potential hazard exposure vulnerability or risk were analyzed at municipal or other administrative unit or catchment level also in other countries either covering the whole country or only selected region santos et al 2019 assessed the riverine flood potential at municipal level in portugal using the multi criteria analysis while santos et al 2020 analyzed the flood risk which also contained flood potential hazard and vulnerability analysis in the same portuguese municipalities pathak et al 2020 analyzed flood risk at catchment level in mumbai city while tang et al 2021 focused on the flood risk assessment in nine districts located in southeastern china wing et al 2022 analyzed current flood risk and future projections under the climate change using the county level in u s furthermore the application of spatial statistics to analyze the spatial clusters i e degree to which values at one place are similar to those in surrounding areas was proved to be an efficient tool in few flood studies which focused on administrative scale such as municipalities tate et al 2021 applied spatial autocorrelation for analyzing the hotspots of high flood exposure and social vulnerability in u s counties sajjad et al 2020 analyzed hurricane flood risk along the united states u s atlantic and gulf coasts using different techniques of spatial statistics roder and sofia 2017 assessed social vulnerability to floods in 2772 municipalities of northern italy using the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation röthlisberger et al 2017 analyzed flood exposure in the municipalities of switzerland using the local spatial autocorrelation statistic g however it has to be noted that no study focused on spatial statistical analysis of flood potential so far which makes this study innovative from this aspect understanding the role of flood conditioning factors which contribute to the occurrence of floods and the overall level of flood potential can help municipal self governments to better prepare for future flood situations furthermore flood potential assessment represents a basic input for creating flood management plans and strategies apollonio et al 2018 this is stressed also in the eu floods directive 2007 where this kind of flood mapping should play a crucial role within the preliminary flood risk assessment pfra in which the goal is to identify areas with existing potentially significant flood risk or areas likely to have a potentially significant flood risk in slovakia the first pfra document was published in 2011 its update in 2018 and this document should be further re evaluated every six years regarding the novelty of this study the whole methodology can be considered innovative for the flood potential research and especially the pfra the main outcome of the second cycle of pfra 2018 in slovakia was a list of 192 areas with potentially significant flood risk however the methodology applied to determine these areas at the national scale lacks conceptual basis clarifying the identification of the critical areas which was also criticized by solín 2014 in this study the novelty and innovative elements pertain to the use of a comprehensive methodology for identifying the municipalities with different level of riverine flood potential it is represented by the vector based and weighting approach for calculating the flood potential index and spatial clustering of municipalities to determine high and low spatial dependence among the neighboring municipalities using the spatial autocorrelation furthermore this study focuses on national scale mapping based on the readily available data which enable systematical mapping of the present riverine flood potential and its comparison with past years or future scenarios which is also planned for future research tasks the aim of this study is i to assess the riverine flood potential in municipalities of slovakia using the spatial multi criteria analysis and geographic information systems gis and ii to analyze the spatial clusters of riverine flood potential at municipal level using the spatial autocorrelation i e the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation the riverine flood potential was determined based on eight flood conditioning factors slope curvature maximum 5 day rainfall river density land cover soil texture lithology and flood frequency except the flood frequency all other factors were correlated against the database of flood events in municipalities during the years 1997 2021 in order to derive the weights of factors the resulting map of riverine flood potential in municipalities was spatially analyzed using the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation in order to determine the municipalities with the highest potential to riverine flooding challenges which were addressed in this study pertain to the following most of the flood potential studies focus on the raster based approaches and pixel level where the major difficulty is to have reliable flood inventory database moreover the limitation for raster based and national scale mapping with machine learning methods is seen in the number of pixels points used for modeling which is limited depending on the computer hardware and relevant software this study tries to overcome the mentioned issues using the vector based approach and municipal level where the flood frequency database and vector layers of flood factors were used instead from the aspect of integrated and decentralized flood risk management it seems more meaningful to assess the riverine flood potential at municipal level as the municipal self governments are very important subjects and their greater involvement in flood risk management and governance can be expected if they have knowledge on flood potential for the territory they manage regarding the national scale mapping the identification of flood potential in municipalities as well as spatial clusters of municipalities with high and or low spatial dependence can bring a new concept to the methodology of preparing the pfra document which is being revisited in six year cycles under the eu floods directive 2 study area the study area is represented by the territory of slovakia which belongs to central europe and covers 49034 km2 slovakia shares the western border with czechia south western border with austria southern border with hungary eastern border with ukraine and northern border with poland based on the nomenclature of territorial units for statistics nuts the country contains one nuts 1 region four nuts 2 regions eight nuts 3 regions 79 lau 1 local administrative units nuts 4 regions and 2927 lau 2 local administrative units nuts 5 which are called municipalities this study focuses on the lau 2 level i e 2927 municipalities which also represent local self governments all geomorphological units in slovakia belong to the alpine himalayan system alpide belt which is divided into carpathians sub system mountains and pannonian basin sub system lowlands basins the lowest elevation point has 94 m while the highest elevation point has 2655 m the climate of slovakia is characterized by temperate climatic conditions based on lapin et al 2002 the country is divided into three climatic regions warm region with more than 50 summer days and average daily maximum temperature of more than 25 c the moderately warm region is characterized by less than 50 summer days average daily maximum temperature of more than 25 c and july mean temperature of 16 c or more the cool region is characterized by july mean temperature of less than 16 c the main european divide passes through the territory of slovakia and it is represented by the danube river basin which drains most of surface waters into the black sea 96 of all waters and poprad and dunajec rivers tributaries of the vistula river which drain surface waters into the baltic sea 4 of all waters there are three types of river runoff regime i temporary snow regime ii snow rain combined regime and iii rain snow combined regime šimo and zaťko 2002 zeleňáková and fendeková 2018 the total length of rivers in slovakia is 59320 km and the longest is the váh river 360 km fig 1 shows the location of slovakia in europe and its division into nuts 3 and lau 2 administrative units the most important riverine floods occurred in summer months of 2010 when 1235 flood events affected altogether 939 municipalities across the whole territory of slovakia another significant flood years were 2006 when 452 flood events occurred in 415 municipalities 2014 when 327 flood events occurred in 310 municipalities 2020 when 259 flood events occurred in 238 municipalities 2008 when 235 flood events occurred in 233 municipalities or 2009 when 201 flood events occurred in 194 municipalities reports on the course and consequences of floods in the slovak republic 2001 2021 pfra 2018 3 data and methods the methodological workflow used in this study is graphically explained in fig 2 the main steps of the methodology are the following i selection of flood conditioning factors ii preparation and processing of flood conditioning factors in gis iii weighting and aggregation of factor classes into the normalized factor values iv weighted linear combination of factors into the final flood potential index fpi and v using the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation to determine statistically significant spatial clusters of riverine flood potential the following sub sections describe the data and methods used in this study 3 1 flood conditioning factors in order to determine the fpi eight flood conditioning factors were processed slope curvature maximum 5 day rainfall river density land cover soil texture lithology and flood frequency the selected factors represent four basic groups of factors morphometric slope curvature rainfall maximum 5 day rainfall hydrographic river density infiltration land cover soil texture and lithology which influence the runoff conditions i e surface runoff the selected factors are considered relevant and important for riverine flood potential mapping as evidenced also in similar studies for example solín et al 2014 santos et al 2019 or solín and rusnák 2020 moreover these factors are considered primary for the riverine flood potential mapping in particular the factors of slope and curvature represent primary morphometric factors influencing the movement or accumulation of water down the slope i e the concave forms of terrain represent higher riverine flood potential while the lower the slope the greater the riverine flood potential some other factors like topographic wetness index twi stream power index spi sediment transport index sti or topographic position index tpi were also used in raster based flood potential studies e g costache 2019 costache et al 2021 ekmekcioğlu et al 2022 however these factors are considered secondary derivatives of primary factors of slope or flow accumulation in addition the factor of elevation was not considered important for riverine flood potential mapping at municipal level since there are very small differences in elevations in some of the municipalities furthermore we used one representative factor of rainfall maximum 5 day rainfall and one representative factor of hydrography river density where the increase in their values represents the greater riverine flood potential the rest of the factors lithology soil texture and land cover influence the infiltration of water and thus the runoff conditions the applied rule was the lower the infiltration capability permeability of rocks soil texture and land cover the greater the potential for riverine floods it has to be also noted that it is not appropriate to use too many factors when applying the weighting multi criteria methods because the calculated weights are not differentiated adequately and some factors can have the same weights all in all the process of choosing flood conditioning factors is usually done subjectively as there are no generally accepted guidelines for this issue the basic input for morphometric factors of slope and curvature was a digital elevation model dem with the resolution of 10 m labeled as dmr3 5 the dem was provided by the geodetic and cartographic institute in bratislava since the applied analysis is vector based the factors in raster format slope and curvature had to be converted into the vector format using gis the maximum 5 day rainfall was calculated from the average annual maximum values of 5 day rainfall during a period 1981 2010 and the source data are available in the climate atlas of slovakia bochníček et al 2015 the original map of average annual maximum values of 5 day rainfall was created based on the daily values of rainfall at the available rainfall stations during the period 1981 2010 and then interpolated using the geographically weighted regression the river density in each municipality was calculated in gis based on the vector layer of river network which was provided by the geodetic and cartographic institute in bratislava the factors influencing the water infiltration were represented by the land cover soil texture and lithology the land cover map was derived from the corine land cover clc vector database for the year 2018 soil texture was derived from the vector layers of bonited soil ecological units bpej provided by the soil science and conservation research institute in bratislava and forest soil units provided by the national forest centre in zvolen which were both originally mapped at a scale of 1 10 000 the source for lithology factor was a vector map of engineering geological zones at a scale of 1 50 000 which is provided by the state geological institute of dionýz štúr in bratislava the flood frequency factor is represented by the database of past flood events in the municipalities for the period 1997 2021 which was manually created from the annual reports on the course and consequences of floods in the slovak republic for the years 2001 2021 published by the ministry of environment of the slovak republic and documents of the pfra 2018 which were also published by the ministry of environment of the slovak republic although the flood frequency can be considered the effect of the previously mentioned flood conditioning factors this factor was necessary in this study to differentiate the riverine flood potential among the municipalities and define the spatial clusters of municipalities having similar spatial dependence for example there can be a municipality with very high or high riverine flood potential due to physical geographical factors and land cover but with no occurrence of flood events on the other hand there can be a municipality with very low or low riverine flood potential due to physical geographical factors and land cover but with some occurrence of flood events due to these reasons we included the flood frequency as a factor implying that the riverine flood potential in a certain municipality increases with the increasing number of flood events in addition the flood frequency was used as a factor in other similar studies for example solín and rusnák 2020 or solín et al 2014 the sources for input data used in this study are presented in table 1 3 2 weighting of factor classes and riverine flood potential determination before assigning the weights to factor classes we calculated the percentage of factor classes in each municipality except for the flood frequency and river density using gis the factor classes are presented in table 2 in case of the flood frequency and river density these factors were scaled to the range 0 1 using the maximum value method where the minimum value of the factor is transformed into 0 the maximum value is transformed into 1 and every other value is transformed into a decimal between 0 and 1 using eq 1 1 x j x j max x j where x j is the scaled value of the j th factor x j is the original value of the j th factor and max x j is the original maximum value of the j th factor the percentage of factors classes was subsequently multiplied by the weights these weights were calculated with the use of the rank sum method which is expressed by eq 2 malczewski 1999 zardari et al 2015 2 w j n r j 1 k 1 n n r k 1 where w j is the normalized weight for the j th factor class n is the number of factor classes under consideration and r j is the rank position of the j th factor class which was determined on the basis of expert judgment and literature review the value of w j is in the 0 1 interval after that the weighted factor classes were summed together and the values of factors were normalized to the range 0 1 based on eq 1 in order to derive the weights for factors the pearson correlation coefficient was used to correlate individual flood conditioning factors with the flood frequency number of flood events using eq 3 3 r x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where r xy is the pearson correlation coefficient n is the number of municipalities x i and y i are the values of individual municipalities and x and y are the mean values of n based on the strength of the correlation the factors were ranked from the most important to the least important and the final weights were assigned to each factor using the rank sum method as presented in eq 2 using the weighted linear combination technique individual flood factors were multiplied with their normalized weights and summation of weighted factors determined the final flood potential index fpi the weighted linear combination is expressed by eq 4 malczewski 2000 4 fpi j x j w j where fpi is the flood potential index w j is the normalized weight of the j th factor and x j is the j th factor transformed into the scale 0 1 3 3 spatial autocorrelation the spatial autocorrelation was used in order to determine spatial patterns clusters in the resulting riverine flood potential where neighboring spatial units municipalities have similar values or particular municipalities are different from their neighbors for identifying the spatial patterns we used the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation anselin 1995 which is expressed by eq 5 5 i x i x j 1 j 1 n w ij n 1 x 2 j 1 j 1 n w ij x j x where n is the number of spatial units municipalities w ij is the spatial weight between the i th and j th spatial units municipalities x i i 1 2 n is the value of the riverine flood potential in the spatial unit municipality i and x i is the arithmetic mean of the riverine flood potential spatial unit the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation i can be used for spatial units which are represented by various types of data such as nominal ordinal or interval data the coefficient i can have the values in the range 1 1 the closer the value of the coefficient is to 0 the more randomness is indicated which means that there is a statistical insignificance of a given factor in space on the other hand the closer the value of the coefficient is to 1 the more positive spatial autocorrelation is indicated furthermore the closer the value of the coefficient is to 1 the more negative spatial autocorrelation is indicated fotheringham et al 2002 the resulting local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation has to be tested in terms of its statistical significance in this study the null hypothesis h0 was tested that there is no spatial autocorrelation between the values of riverine flood potential in n spatial units the statistics z i score for testing the statistical significance of the coefficient has an asymptotically normal distribution and is expressed by eq 6 6 z i i e i v i where e i 1 n 1 v i e i 2 e i 2 are the mean value and variance of the local moran s coefficient i after obtaining the value of z i score this value is then compared to the p value the closer the value of z i score is to 1 there is a higher level of confidence that the riverine flood potential is spatially autocorrelated furthermore if the probability p value is less than 0 05 or 0 01 the null hypothesis is rejected at one of the significance levels if the probability p value is more than 0 05 or 0 01 the null hypothesis cannot be rejected in this study the assumption of homogeneity was adopted for calculating the global characteristics of spatial autocorrelation however there may be a case when this assumption is not valid and global statistics can erroneously indicate the absence of spatial autocorrelation although there can be a strong positive or negative autocorrelation in different parts of spatial units to overcome these possible problems we used the local indicators of spatial association lisa which are site specific and the sum of all lisa indicators is proportional to the global value of moran s statistics anselin 1995 to visualize the results of the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation i we used the moran s scatter plot which was created in the geoda software the quadrants in the moran s scatter plot upper right high high hot spots lower left low low cold spots upper left low high spatial outliers lower right high low spatial outliers show how much each type of spatial dependence influences the generation of the moran s coefficient i anselin 1996 4 results and discussion 4 1 weights of factors classes the resulting weights of factor classes using the rank sum method are presented in table 3 the highest rank r j i e highest potential for riverine flooding equals 1 the highest normalized weights w j were assigned to the following classes slopes from 0 to 2 concave forms of curvature very low permeability of rocks clayey and clay soil texture urban fabric land cover and maximum 5 day rainfall of more than 90 mm choosing the mentioned classes as having the highest potential to riverine flooding is in line with other flood potential studies for example nguyen et al 2020 solín and rusnák 2020 or yariyan et al 2020 in the next steps the share of the factor classes was multiplied by the corresponding normalized weight the weighted percentages were summed together and then normalized to the range 0 1 in addition the factors of flood frequency and river density were directly normalized to the range 0 1 as they were not classified into intervals classes in the next sub section we present the values of flood conditioning factors in each municipality as well as the original input values of these factors 4 2 flood conditioning factors the original values of flood conditioning factors as well as the calculated normalized values at municipal level are presented in figs 3 10 the classes of calculated flood conditioning factors at municipal level were divided based on the natural breaks jenks classification the slope factor was classified based on the work of demek 1972 as can be seen in fig 3a low slopes are typical for lowlands and basins while higher slopes can be usually found in mountains or highlands fig 3b shows that the highest slope potential for flooding is in western southern and eastern slovakia which are characterized by lowlands podunajská nížina lowland východoslovenská nížina lowland and záhorská lowland and low lying basins like košická kotlina basin or juhoslovenská kotlina basin the curvature factor includes concave linear and convex forms of terrain based on fig 4a b we can see that concave forms of terrain have higher shares in municipalities located in central northern eastern and partly southern slovakia fig 5a b shows that the maximum 5 day rainfall generally increases with the elevation i e from low values in lowland areas to high values in mountainous areas as for the river density factor fig 6a b the highest values can be seen in the municipalities of northern eastern and central slovakia where they create clusters of different size based on the maps of clc 2018 fig 7a b we can see that the highest values were recorded in municipalities which are located in lowlands especially podunajská nížina lowland and východoslovenská nížina lowland and where the share of arable land is higher than the share of forest which highly influences the water infiltration into soil horizons as for the soil texture the highest values can be found again in lowlands as well as basins where the clayey or clayey loamy soils have higher shares than in other municipalities fig 8a b the lithological conditions are the most unfavorable in northern eastern and central slovakia where rocks with very low or low permeability prevail such as flyschoid conglomerate sandstone metamorphosed or volcanic types of rocks on the other hand municipalities located mostly in lowlands of western eastern and southern slovakia have higher share of highly permeable rocks such as various types of quaternary sediments e g aeolian sands gravel loess but there are also municipalities with higher share of highly permeable dolomite and limestone rocks fig 9a b as for the flood frequency factor fig 10a b the total number of flood events between the years 1997 and 2021 was 4090 while no flood occurred in 1310 municipalities one flood event was recorded in 643 municipalities from two to four flood events occurred in 739 municipalities from five to seven flood events occurred in 192 municipalities and more than eight flood events were recorded in 43 municipalities the highest values of flood frequency were recorded in municipalities of northern eastern and partly western slovakia in particular the highest number of flood events regards the myjava basin in western slovakia kysuca basin in northern slovakia hornád basin dunajec and poprad basin topľa basin ondava basin and bodva basin in eastern slovakia 4 3 weights of factors and riverine flood potential as can be seen in table 4 the correlation between individual factors and the number of flood events is small which was to be expected since flood frequency not only accounts for the natural constraints of flood events but also other factors which were not considered in the calculation of riverine flood potential such as flood protection measures or vulnerability of people and assets despite this the rank and weights of factors can be derived as there are certain differences between the correlations the highest positive correlation 0 17 was recorded between the lithology and number of flood events the findings of solín and sládeková madajová 2019 suggest that basin attributes that have a significant influence on the flood frequency are mainly the soil texture lithology permeability and the forest cover of the basins in slovakia when comparing their findings with our results we can see a similar result regarding the importance of lithology rock permeability factor which contributes significantly to the occurrence of floods similar value of positive pearson correlation was recorded also for the factors of river density 0 15 and maximum 5 day rainfall 0 14 as well as curvature 0 08 furthermore the negative correlation can be seen between the flood frequency and factors of slope 0 11 land cover 0 05 and soil texture 0 03 based on the strength of pearson correlation coefficient we ranked the factors from the most important to the least important and assigned the factor weights using the rank sum method the highest normalized weights were assigned to flood frequency 0 222 lithology 0 194 and river density 0 167 while the lowest normalized value was assigned to soil texture 0 028 table 4 to determine the riverine flood potential the weighted factors were aggregated the resulting flood potential map is presented in fig 11 in which the flood potential classes were divided based on the natural breaks jenks classification the highest riverine flood potential was recorded mostly in municipalities of northern and eastern slovakia as well as in several municipalities of central and western slovakia especially myjava region along the border with czechia in particular similar results were obtained in the study by solín and rusnák 2020 who investigated the flood potential in municipalities of the myjava region which has one of the highest potential to flooding in slovakia furthermore solín and sládeková madajová 2019 defined flood hazard for the municipalities located in headwater basins of slovakia based on the factors of average annual precipitation soil texture lithology permeability percentage of forests average slope and altitude of the basins in which the municipalities are located similar results high riverine flood potential were obtained in case of the municipalities located in the myjava region and municipalities located in northern slovakia particularly the orava region kysuce region and eastern slovakia especially the šariš region spiš region or horný zemplín region different results were obtained especially in case of the tekov region hont region and novohrad region central slovakia where many municipalities recorded high or medium flood potential while in this study they recorded low or very low values of flood potential in general very low and low riverine flood potential defined in this study dominates in western and southern slovakia while moderate riverine flood potential was mainly recorded in the municipalities of central slovakia and partly in eastern and western slovakia the distribution of municipalities and number of flood events in flood potential classes is presented in table 5 the highest number of flood events was recorded in high 1263 flood events and very high 1076 flood events flood potential classes and then it decreases from moderate 951 flood events and low 631 flood events to very low flood potential 169 flood events 4 4 spatial clusters of riverine flood potential the value of the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation was 0 767048 and the z i score recorded the value of 70 635451 in addition the p value equals 0 0000 which is less than 0 01 therefore the null hypothesis was rejected at the level of significance α 0 01 and the hypothesis h1 there is a spatial autocorrelation between the values of riverine flood potential was accepted this means that the spatial distribution of riverine flood potential values is not random but it is clustered furthermore the statistical significance of the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation was tested using the moran s scatter plot which is presented in fig 12 in this figure it can be seen that there is a statistically significant dependence among municipalities depending on the values of riverine flood potential in a given municipality and neighboring municipalities moreover we can see high values that are grouped spatially close quadrant high high and low values that are grouped spatially close quadrant low low it has to be noted that there are no high low and low high clusters spatial outliers which means that there are no municipalities where significantly higher or lower flood potential values were recorded in respect to the neighboring municipalities the local moran s coefficient of spatial autocorrelation confirmed that there are municipalities next to each other that are closer to each other with respect to the riverine flood potential values in other words the riverine flood potential values are influenced by the location of a given municipality the statistically significant municipalities at different confidence levels are presented in fig 13a and table 6 while municipalities belonging to different types of spatial dependence are presented in fig 13b and tables 7 and 8 as can be seen in table 6 and fig 13a the highest number of municipalities with high high spatial dependence falls within the confidence level of 0 0001 the number of municipalities with high high spatial dependence which are included in the confidence level of 0 001 0 01 and 0 05 is 56 90 and 100 respectively in case of the number of municipalities with low low spatial dependence the highest number 158 was recorded in the confidence level of 0 05 while the other confidence levels of 0 0001 0 001 and 0 01 were recorded in 153 67 and 109 municipalities respectively based on table 7 and fig 13b the high high clusters representing the positive spatial autocorrelation i e municipalities with the highest potential to riverine flooding are mostly located in northern and eastern slovakia one cluster is located in western slovakia and seven clusters in central slovakia this is caused mainly by very low or low permeability of rocks especially flyschoid rocks high values of average annual maximum 5 day rainfall higher river density soil texture types with lower degree of infiltration especially clayey loamy soils as well as relatively high number of flood events in these clusters the highest number of municipalities with high high spatial dependence is in cluster 10 with 355 municipalities which are located in eastern slovakia while the second largest is cluster 2 with 127 municipalities which are located in northern slovakia the smallest high high clusters contain only one municipality the total number of municipalities located in high high clusters is 524 which is 17 9 of all municipalities in addition the total number of flood events in these municipalities is 1684 which is 41 1 out of all flood events recorded in the studied period 1997 2021 moreover table 8 and fig 13b show low low clusters representing the negative spatial autocorrelation i e spatial clusters of municipalities with low values of riverine flood potential they are mostly located in western and southern slovakia and three clusters are located in eastern slovakia the low low clusters of municipalities have the very low or low potential to riverine flooding which can be interpreted by very high and high permeability of rocks e g various quaternary sediments low values of average annual maximum 5 day rainfall lower values of river density as well as relatively low number of flood events or municipalities with no flood occurrence the largest low low cluster is cluster 6 in western slovakia which includes 275 municipalities the second largest low low cluster is cluster 15 in southern slovakia which contains 75 municipalities the total number of municipalities located in low low clusters is 487 which is 16 6 of all municipalities in case of these municipalities the total number of flood events recorded in the studied period 1997 2021 is only 153 which is 3 8 out of all flood events there is also a large number of municipalities where no statistically significant spatial clusters were found the total number of flood events in these municipalities is 2253 which is 55 1 out of all flood events recorded in the studied period 1997 2021 the total number of statistically insignificant municipalities is 1916 which represents 65 5 of all municipalities in terms of spatial clustering of municipalities based on similarity measures there are also other methods like fuzzy clustering or k means clustering which were used in few previous studies focused on flood risk assessment for example he and wan 2021 used a hybrid method of chaotic particle swarm optimization algorithm with a fuzzy clustering iterative model for flood hazard assessment in the sichuan province china or wang et al 2018 used coupled fuzzy c means clustering for defining the flood risk in 15 townships of the anhui province china xu et al 2018 applied integrated k means cluster algorithm for urban flood risk mapping in the haikou region china however the advantage of spatial autocorrelation method is related to the fact that it is perfectly suited for polygon vector format of data moreover the results of this method provide the information not only on the statistically significant high high high flood potential clusters but also on the low low low flood potential low high or high low spatial outliers or statistically insignificant spatial clusters this is very important especially from the aspect of prioritizing the municipalities for the adoption of appropriate risk reduction and management strategies xiong et al 2019 tate et al 2021 4 5 relevance for flood risk management and the eu floods directive the calculated fpi provides useful information for adopting various types of flood risk management measures and decision making at the municipal level for instance municipalities with high values of fpi or high values of individual flood conditioning factors should focus primarily on the reduction of unfavorable conditions for flood occurrence by diversified measures not only along the critical river segments but also within the territory of whole municipality through various tools and measures such as spatial urban and landscape planning as well as cooperation with neighboring municipalities either upstream or downstream vojtek and vojteková 2018 2019 grežo et al 2020 regarding the flood risk management decision making at municipal level this study places each municipality also into a national context in other words the municipal leaders can compare their situation with similar municipalities regarding the fpi and how they manage the flood risk as for the eu floods directive 2007 the presented approach is relevant for the phase of pfra the official two cycles of pfra 2011 2018 assessments were already carried out by the slovak water management enterprise which is a state enterprise under the ministry of environment of the slovak republic the main output of the first cycle of pfra 2011 represents a list of critical river sections where potentially significant flood risk exists or is likely to occur in the last cycle of pfra 2018 the list of critical river sections was supplemented with the areas having potentially significant flood risk and the list of municipalities which are located along the critical river sections in this regard our effort was to propose different approach on defining the potentially significant flood risk areas using the comprehensive and detailed in terms of scale and resolution of input data fpi directly at municipal level which has been underestimated so far in flood risk management strategies in slovakia due to centralized flood risk governance solín 2020 diversification and decentralization of flood risk management and governance is being already implemented across some european countries such as united kingdom germany and france and the effort for complementing the structural flood measures with non structural ones is being put forth fournier et al 2016 bubeck et al 2017 hegger et al 2018 a prerequisite for achieving this type of flood risk governance is the clear specification of actors and their roles at local municipalities lau 2 in slovakia regional nut 3 in slovakia national level and also a change in the approach to flood risk mapping and assessment the currently used approach in the pfra 2018 is not effective and detailed enough to provide reasonable basis for the application of diversified and decentralized flood prevention protection and adaptation measures 5 conclusion in this study an attempt was to present the methodology for riverine flood potential mapping at municipal level and identifying the statistically significant clusters of municipalities which have the highest potential for riverine flooding based on the results 524 municipalities which are located mostly in northern and eastern slovakia but also some in western and central slovakia had the highest potential to riverine flooding this result was expected since these areas have very low or low permeability of rocks high values of average annual maximum 5 day rainfall higher river density soil texture types with lower infiltration as well as relatively high number of flood events possible limitations in the presented methods and data may arise from the rank sum weighting method applied this method is generally not suitable for flood potential mapping with many flood conditioning factors which may cause that the calculated weights are not differentiated enough and some factors can have the same weights simultaneously another possible limitation can arise from the selection of flood conditioning factors which was done subjectively in this study however it has to be mentioned that there is no consensus among researchers on how many and which factors should be used in flood potential studies regarding the data used a limitation can be seen in the maximum 5 day rainfall factor which was derived for the period 1981 2010 as well as the original map is more generalized in comparison to the other factors although the clc 2018 was mapped based on the sentinel 2 satellite images it can also be considered more generalized because the minimum mapping unit was 25 ha 100 m with geometric accuracy of less than 100 m in this regard the overall source data limitation can be seen in the original map scales or spatial resolution which are not consistent and thus affected by different level of generalization however this problem can be seen in each flood potential study where it is difficult to have consistent input data in practice recommendations from this study are the following in terms of the integrated decentralized flood risk assessment this study recommends focusing on the municipal level which provides relevant information on flood potential not only for the local self governments but more importantly for national scale pfra in particular the presented approach provides useful information on the municipalities which are potentially endangered by the riverine floods while spatial differentiation of municipalities using the spatial autocorrelation enables to prioritize the municipalities with high high spatial dependence in terms of flood risk management and apply diversified flood measures firstly to these municipalities the presented methodology and choice of the factors are primarily applicable for potential fluvial riverine flooding in order to include also other types of flood such as flash flood pluvial flood or sheetflood the methodology and mainly selection of factors should be modified and adapted using the same methodology the flood potential index can be determined in other similar study areas at different spatial scales local regional national and different types of administrative units districts counties etc furthermore this study uses readily and publicly available data which enables systematical mapping of riverine flood potential index over the time therefore future research will be directed towards the spatio temporal changes in riverine flood potential in municipalities of slovakia and will be focused on the historical perspective as well as on the future scenarios as a result our effort is to establish systematic mapping of flood potential but also flood risk and its components hazard and vulnerability at municipal level in slovakia funding this work was supported by the scientific grant agency of the ministry of education

units of the earth s biochemical cycles and energy exchange water conservation is an important ecosystem service function daily 1997 it indicates the process and ability of ecosystems to maintain water reserves during a certain temporal and spatial range in areas with higher vegetation cover the regional water cycle varies flood intensity reduces in the rainy season and river flows continuously during the dry season mainly because of the developed root system and loose soil pores it is of great significance to study water conservation function for regulating runoff preventing

focused on soil and water conservation and its impact on crop yield these results were then considered to guide agricultural production the scope of these studies is mainly focused on the plains as an important ecological security barrier in western china it is necessary to analyse the spatiotemporal variation and influencing factors of water conservation it is not only promote the rational development of regional water resources but also provide theoretical support for sustainable development the study region is located in the northeastern of the qinghai tibet plateau which is characterized by a high altitude low temperature and a simple and sensitive ecological system structure more importantly the qinghai tibet plateau is the key barrier region for maintaining china s ecological security and stability in recent years under the combined effects of climate change and human activities this region has experienced reduced stability and increased vulnerability the yellow river yangtze river and lancang river have originated from this region and are deemed important for water storage and conservation these rivers are also considered important water sources for the terrestrial ecosystems therefore the water storage and conservation capacities of the study region not only exert a direct impact on the water resources of the qinghai tibet plateau but also play a key role in the water security of the middle and lower reaches of several rivers accordingly in this study we discussed several aspects of the water conservation the main aims of this study were to i quantify spatial and temporal distribution of water conservation ii explore influencing factors of water conservation iii predict future changes in water conservation under different climate scenarios

the average annual unit water yield was 321 mm and the average annual unit water conservation was 93 mm in the study region 321 mm fig 2 the average annual unit water conservation in the qilian mountains was 27 mm and average annual water conservation was 48 108 m3 the three river source region s average annual unit water conservation was 66 mm and average annual water conservation was 206 108 m3 the minimum and maximum values were observed in 1994 71 mm and 2019 153 mm resepectively during the past 40 years both water yield and water conservation showed fluctuations with an increasing trend at rates of 2 mm a and 0 7 108 m3 a by pettitt testing we found that there was a mutation point in 2002 thus the year 2002 was considered as the boundary for analysis the results showed that average water conservation from 1980 to 2002 was 184 mm with a change rate of 1 9 mm a whereas the average water conservation from 2002 to 2019 was 218 mm demonstrating an increase of 18 76 over the previous period with a change rate of 3 mm a this increase was likely because of in the last century the awareness about environment protection was low and the development of agriculture and animal husbandry exerted a negative impact on the ecological environment since 2000 a series of ecological restoration projects have been implemented in the study region and the environment quality has improved additionally this trend is similar to the trend of precipitation where the rate of change in precipitation was 0 02 mm a before 2002 and was 5 76 mm a during 2002 2019 4 1 2 spatial distribution the spatial distribution of water conservation was found to significantly differ in different areas of the study region fig 3 water conservation in qilian mountains accounted for 25 of the total conservation and the three river source accounted for 75 of the total conservation the distribution characteristics of water conservation decreased from northwest to southeast regions in the qilian mountains the high value areas were mainly concentrated in the regions around the qilian menyuan and gangcha counties whereas the low value areas were distributed in the northwestern region climate and topography jointly help establish such a distribution pattern the eastern of the qilian mountains is located at the edge of the summer monsoon influence resulting in a gradual reduction in the water vapor content from east to west with a dry climate is formed in the west the qinghai lake basin belongs to a low altitude area and the open terrain is conducive to the growth of vegetation which leads to an increase in water conservation capacity thus this area is characterized by a high water conservation potential for the three river source the areas with high water conservation value are mainly located in the southeast region of the source of the yellow river and the south of the lancang river source including ruoergai hongyuan and zaduo counties these areas have a low altitude humid climate and abundant lakes and wetlands which are favorable for water conservation moreover these areas are densely forested and have high vegetation cover which is conducive to regulating runoff and increasing infiltration with high potential for water conservation eight sub basins were selected from the study region and a significant difference was observed in unit water conservation between different regions the unit water conservation varied as follows lancang river source 72 mm yellow river source 69 mm yangtze river source 68 mm datong river basin 27 mm qinghai lake basin 25 mm upper reaches of shiyang river 21 mm upper reaches of heihe river 15 mm upper reaches of shule river 6 mm the total water conservation varied as follows yangtze river source 99 108 m3 yellow river source 74 108 m3 datong river basin 22 108 m3 lancang river source 21 108 m3 qinghai lake basin 14 108 m3 upper reaches of shiyang river 11 108 m3 upper reaches of heihe river 7 108 m3 upper reaches of shule river 3 108 m3 since the source of lancang river receiced the most precipitation its unit water conservation was the highest the datong river and qinghai lake basins have a flat terrain high vegetation coverage and substantial runoff the upper reaches of the shule shiyang and heihe rivers are situated near the western qilian mountains the climate is dry the ecological environment is fragile and sensitive the growth of surface vegetation is poor and the soil is relatively barren and the capacity of water storage is weak therefore there exists spatial heterogeneity in distribution characteristics in terms of total water conservation the yangtze river source had the highest total water conservation as it covered the largest area the area of the lancang river source is small and there are many high mountains and canyons in the region the steep terrain will also have a certain impact on water conservation function precipitation of the upper reaches of shule river heihe river and shiyang river basin is scarce on the other hand the basin s area is small so the total water conservation was found to be very low 4 1 3 counties districts distribution to explore the water conservation function of different counties 40 major counties in the study region were selected for statistical analysis water conservation in most counties displayed an increasing trend over the past 40 years the counties with a substantial increase were yongdeng sunan xining maqu dari maqin nangqian and ruoergei aksai yumen dulan and xinghai displayed a decreasing trend of water conservation the counties with a comparatively faster increase in water conservation had sufficient precipitation which could be influenced by the continuous increase in precipitation and the recovery of vegetation over the time period ultimately leading to an increase in water conservation in contrast the counties with a decrease in water conservation had a relatively dry climate less precipitation a fragile ecological environment and may have been influenced by human activities thereby resulting in a decrease in their water conservation function the restoration of the ecological environment and treatment of key counties with a declining water conservation function should be strengthened on the basis of maintaining the existing water conservation function further counties with lower water conservation levels should learn from the treatment experience of counties with higher water conservation levels gradually improve the vegetation coverage area and reasonably plan human activities 4 2 influencing factors 4 2 1 climatic factors the changes in climatic factors have a profound impact on water conservation the changes in precipitation potential evapotranspiration and temperature in the study region from 1980 to 2019 are shown in fig 4 the average annual precipitation in the study region was 729 73 mm showing a significant increasing trend with a rate of change of 3 82 mm a p 0 05 the average annual potential evapotranspiration in the study region was 2577 22 mm with a rate of change of 1 82 mm a p 0 05 under the background of global warming the average temperature in the study region showed a significantly increasing trend 0 04 c a p 0 05 these results are similar to those reported by pan et al 2013 and jin et al 2020 a significantly positive correlation was found between precipitation and water conservation table 2 with the exception of 1980 1990 there was no significantly negative correlation between potential evapotranspiration and temperature and water conservation first after the condensation water vapor reached the surface in the form of precipitation forming surface runoff then a portion of this forms underground runoff through infiltration and a certain proportion returned to the atmosphere in the form of evapotranspiration the rest is stored in the soil and roots therefore precipitation is the key factor affecting surface water conservation and the increase of precipitation in the study region over the past 40 years has played an important role in improving water conservation potential evapotranspiration was the theoretical upper limit of the actual evapotranspiration and is deemed an important part of the regional hydrological cycle the increase in potential evapotranspiration represented an increase in the water available for evapotranspiration ultimately leading to an increase in actual evapotranspiration and decrease in water accumulation increasing temperatures also enhanced the actual evapotranspiration 4 2 2 land use type besides climatic factors land use type is an important factor that affects water conservation in this study land use data from the 1980 s 1990 s 2000 s and 2010 s were used to analyze the water conservation status during different time periods the study region had six primary land use types the main land use types in the study region were grassland and other land overall during the past 40 years the land types with a net increase in area were cultivated land grassland and water bodies with an increase of 385 83 km2 18 977 81 km2 and 884 09 km2 respectively the types of land areas that have a net decrease including forest land construction land and other land with a decrease of 705 69 km2 809 76 km2and 8 732 27 km2 forest land is mainly distribute to the southeast of the qilian mountains and the part of the yellow river source and lancang river source the area of cultivated land was found to be small which is also concentrated to the southeast of the qilian mountains and the northeast of the yellow river source other land widely distributed to the northwest of the qilian mountains and the part of the yangtze river source the above distribution pattern was mainly influenced by climate areas with abundant precipitation are conducive to the growth of forests and grasslands while areas with arid climate fragile ecosystems and scarce precipitation are easy to form other lands the spatial analysis tool arcgis was used to obtain the average annual water conservation data for the land use types as water bodies mainly serve to provide water water conservation of water bodies was not included in the analysis the results are shown in fig 5 the average unit water conservation of different land types in the study region from 1980 to 2019 presented the following order forest land 167 mm grassland 61 mm cultivated land 37 mm other land types 3 mm construction land 2 mm the average total water conservation of the six land use types presented the following order grassland 187 108 m3 forest land 49 108 m3 other land types 4 108 m3 cultivated land 3 108 m3 construction land 1 108 m3 the unit water conservation and total water conservation in grassland showed a fluctuating upward trend while the unit water conservation and total water conservation of forest land construction land and other land have a slight decrease and the change of cultivate land is not obvious forest land has developed roots and substantial soil porosity which can intercept surface water the root system in grasslands is shallow and the water conservation ability is weaker than forest land the root system of cultivated land is similarly shallow and its soil layer is profoundly affected by human activities resulting in a comparatively lower water holding capacity construction land and other land have low surface vegetation cover with considerably exposed areas thereby lacking the ability to store precipitation in terms of total water conservation grassland contributed most of the total water conservation because the area of forest land was markedly smaller than grassland forest land and grassland were the main contributors to the total water conservation in the study region collectively accounting for 90 of the total conservation 4 2 3 elevation and slope to further investigate the distribution of water conservation in the study region at different slopes and elevations we analyse the variation characteristics of water conservation through the regional statistical analysis tool as the average elevation of the three river source was higher than qilian mountains the elevation of qilian mountains is divided into four classes 2 500 m 2 500 3 500 m 3 500 4 500 m and 4 500 m and the elevation of the three river source region was divided into four classes 3 500 m 3 500 4 500 m 4 500 5 500 m and 5 500 m fig 6 based on the results it can be seen that the average unit water conservation of the qilian mountains gradually decreases with increasing elevation as follows 2 500 m 36 mm 2 500 3500 m 28 mm 3 500 4 500 m 25 mm 4 500 m 18 mm the total water conservation showed a variation characteristic with an increase followed by a decrease with elevation as follows 2 500 m 0 1 108 m3 2 500 3 500 m 22 108 m3 3 500 4 500 m 24 108 m3 4 500 m 0 02 108 m3 the total water conservation in the area of 3 500 4 500 m accounted for 52 of the total volume the trend of average unit water conservation of the three river source region with elevation was basically the same as qilian mountains with the following results 3 500 m 84 mm 3 500 4 500 m 76 mm 4 500 5 500 m 54 mm 5 500 m 31 mm the total water conservation increases and then decreases with the following results 3 500 m 14 108 m3 3 500 4 500 m 97 108 m3 4 500 5 500 m 92 108 m3 5 500 m 2 108 m3 the overall proportion of water conservation in the 3 500 4 500 m area was approximately 47 possible reasons for the decrease in unit water conservation of the study region with increasing elevation are as follows at low elevation area the ecosystem structure is more stable the temperature is higher the water and heat conditions are well configured the surface vegetation cover is high and the root systems of forest land and grassland can absorb and store water well however at high elevation area the climate is cold the ecosystem is very fragile and it is difficult to recover quickly once damaged and the vegetation cover is low the area of cold desert zone is large surface water is very easy to be lost and the potential of water storage is low evident differences in the water conservation were found for different slopes in the study region and we divided the slope of the study region into five levels according to the actual situation 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 fig 7 the results show that the average unit water conservation of qilian mountains has a trend of increasing and then decreasing with the increase of slope 5 26 mm 5 10 32 mm 10 15 30 mm 15 20 24 mm 20 18 mm the total water conservation continues to decrease with increasing slope 5 25 108 m3 5 10 15 108 m3 10 15 5 108 m3 15 20 1 108 m3 20 0 1 108 m3 the total water conservation in the area with a slope 5 contributed 55 of the total volume both the average unit water conservation and total water conservation of the three river source region gradually decrease with increasing slope 5 68 mm 153 108 m3 5 10 66 mm 41 108 m3 10 15 63 mm 9 108 m3 15 20 63 mm 1 108 m3 20 61 mm 0 5 108 m3 the slope in the 5 area has the largest proportion of total volume about 75 the gentle slope is flat and more conducive to the storage of surface water the areas with a large slope have a steep topography the scouring effect of rainwater on the surface is stronger and the risk of soil erosion is high so it is not conducive to water conservation 4 3 predictions we predicted the changes in water conservation in the study region under different scenarios four future scenarios namely ssp1 2 6 low forcing ssp2 4 5 medium forcing ssp3 7 0 medium to high forcing and ssp5 8 5 high forcing were considered in this study these scenarios are divided into two time series namely 2021 2060 and 2061 2100 by analyzing the spatial distribution characteristics of water conservation in the study region from 2021 to 2100 it is found that water conservation gradually decreases from the southeast to northwest in qilian mountains in the three river source area water conservation decreased gradually from south to north and its spatial distribution was similar to those of 1980 2019 fig 8 we used the average unit water conservation in the study region from 1980 to 2019 as a comparison standard during 2021 2060 under the ssp1 2 6 mode the unit water conservation of qilian mountains is expected to experience a greater decrease including yongchang subei gulang shandan menyuan gonghe dulan and wulan gulang was predicted to have a decrease of 0 99 mm which is the greater reduction in all counties unit water conservation in other counties is expected to increase with the largest increase is gangcha under the mode of ssp2 4 5 only yongchang subei gonghe and dulan counties unit water conservation is expected to decrease with yongchang expected to experience the greatest reduction in the counties where the unit water conservation is expected to increased tianjun has the greatest increase in the ssp3 7 0 mode only yongchang is expected to have a reduction in unit water conservation while other counties are expected to display an upward trend with the largest increase in xining in the ssp5 8 5 mode the unit water conservation of all counties is expected to increase significantly with the largest increase expected in tianjun from 2061 2100 under the ssp1 2 6 mode the unit water conservation of qilian mountains will increase in numerous counties including aksai yongdeng gulang minle sunan menyuan qilian and tianjun with sunan expected to have the largest increase unit water conservation in yongchng subei yumen liangzhou district tianzhu shandan gangcha gonghe delingha dulan wulan and xining is expected to show a decreasing trend with the largest decrease in gangcha in ssp2 4 5 mode only the unit water conservation in subei and delingha is expected to decrease and the unit water conservation of the remaining counties is expected to increase under ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 modes the water conservation in all counties and districts is expected to improve and the counties with the greatest increase is sunan fig 9 from 2021 2060 based on ssp1 2 6 mode the unit water conservation of the three river source region will decrease by more than the average from 1980 to 2019 including luqu maqu dari maduo gande maqin tongde xinghai geermu zeku aba hongyuan and changdu however the unit water conservation of jiuzhi nangqian qumalai yushu zaduo zhiduo and ruoergai will increase with nangqian experiencing the greatest increase 1 33 mm in ssp2 4 5 mode the counties expected to have a decrease in unit water conservation include luqu maqu dari tongde xinghai zeku aba hongyuan and changdu with luqu will decrease the most 1 95 mm the unit water conservation of jiuzhi maduo geermu nangqian qumalai yushu zaduo zhiduo ruoergai and changdu will show an upward trend and yushu will have the largest increase 1 62 mm under ssp3 7 0 mode the unit water conservation in luqu maqu dari gande maqin and xinghai will decrease and luqu 2 72 mm will have greatest decrease unit water conservation in other counties will increase to varying degrees with yushu will increase of 2 46 mm which will be the largest of all counties in ssp5 8 5 mode the unit water conservation in luqu maqu and gande will decrease and luqu will have the greatest decrease 3 44 mm unit water conservation in yushu is expected to have the greatest increase 2 87 mm during 2061 2100 under ssp1 2 6 mode the unit water conservation in luqu maqu dari maduo maqin tongde xinghai geermu zeku aba hongyuan and ruoergai will decrease other counties will increase nangqian s unit water conservation is expected to have the greatest increase of all counties under ssp2 4 5 mode the counties where the unit water conservation will decrease include luqu maqu dari gande maqin xinghai geermu zeku and hongyuan with luqu will decrease most in the counties where unit water conservation will increase nangqian will have the greatest increase under ssp3 7 0 mode the unit water conservation in luqu maqu and xinghai will decrease with luqu will have the greatest decrease in the counties where unit water conservation will increase nangqian s increase is the greatest under ssp5 8 5 mode the unit water conservation in luqu and maqu will continue to decrease the increase of nangqian is still the greatest fig 10 in general from 2021 to 2060 under ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 modes the water conservation in qilian mountains will decrease in several counties and the greatest decline will occur in yongchang under ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 modes the water conservation function will mostly increase in the three river source region the counties where the unit water conservation will decrease are mainly concentrated in the yellow river source and the counties where have a substantial reduction include luqu maqu and gande the unit water conservation in the yangtze river source and the lancang river source will mainly display an increasing trend the overall change in ssp1 2 6 mode will be the lowest while the change of ssp5 8 5 mode will be more intense from 2061 2100 the variation characteristics of water conservation in qilian mountains will be roughly the same as the previous period in the three river source region comparing with the previous period the unit water conservation in most counties will increase as a whole compared with that in the previous period and the decreasing trend in maqu and luqu will remain obvious the overall fluctuation in ssp1 2 6 mode is expected to small while the increase in ssp5 8 5 mode will be the greatest due to the strong emission scenario of ssp5 8 5 the precipitation increase rapidly so the water conservation in the study region will rise rapidly at this stage in the future the decrease in water conservation function in some counties of the yellow river source in the future may be due to the weakening of the summer monsoon which leads to the decrease in precipitation and an increase in evaporation causing an eventual decrease in surface runoff 5 discussion 5 1 spatiotemporal variation in this study we explored water conservation and its spatiotemporal pattern in the study region from 1980 to 2019 based on the application of the invest model to obtained a comprehensive understanding of water conservation in the study region the water conservation index can help reflect the change in water conservation service function the value of water conservation index in the study region ranges from 0 01 to 0 31 further the water conservation index of the qilian mountains was high in the southeast and the high value of the three river sources was mainly distributed in the south of the yellow river source and the lancang river source with scattered high values in the yangtze river source fig 11 the high water conservation index areas were characterized by abundant precipitation and a comparatively higher forest proportion moreover the soil texture of high value areas was mainly silty loam and silt in areas with low water conservation index values except for poor precipitation and vegetation conditions the soil texture was dominated by loam and the ability to conserve water was weak the average water conservation index of the qilian mountains during the four periods were 0 07 0 07 0 09 and 0 11 the average water conservation index of the three river source in the four periods were 0 14 0 13 0 14 and 0 15 consequently changes in the study region over the past 40 years reflected a gradual increase in water conservation function national policies also played an important role in increasing water conservation in 2005 china approved the overall planning of ecological protection and construction of three river source nature reserve in qinghai province included projects such as returning grazing to grassland returning farmland to forests and ecological relocation such measures were aimed at improving regional ecosystem services wu et al 2016 found that after the implementation of the three river source ecological project the average water conservation of the forest grass ecosystem increased by 15 6 compared with that reported in the previous period further the contribution rate of ecological projects to the improvement of water conservation services in the three river source was approximately 23 98 based on modis data it was found that the vegetation coverage in qilian mountains increased from 2000 to 2015 in addition to regional warming and humidification vegetation coverage was also related to the implementation of a series of policies such as afforesting the hillsides after the establishment of national nature reserves in the region which in turn promoted water conservation jiang et al 2017 it is believed that precipitation is mainly distributed in june to september in the alpine mountainous areas and the period from october to december can be regarded as a recession stage in the runoff process the change in runoff in this stage can be considered to reflect the water conservation status of terrestrial ecosystems in alpine mountainous areas to a certain extent wang et al 2009 therefore we verified the simulation results of water conservation obtained with the application of the model based on the measured runoff data and water resources bulletin statistics of few hydrological stations in the study region the water conservation indices in different areas of the study region decreased or remained unchanged from the 1980 s to the 1990 s and showed a significant upward trend after the year 2000 this result was consistent with the simulation results obtained in this study t j wang et al 2018 y c wang et al 2018 assessed the water conservation function of the shiyang river basin in 2015 and obtained a unit water conservation of 23 97 mm similar to our result at present studies on the spatial and temporal distribution patterns and influencing factors of water conservation in the qinghai tibet plateau qaidam basin yellow river basin loess plateau beijing tianjin hebei region dongting lake basin and beijiang basin have made good progress and the importance grades of water conservation in some regions have been evaluated wang et al 2022 li et al 2022a li et al 2022b jia et al 2022 bao et al 2016 li et al 2022a hu et al 2020 xu et al 2022 by comparison it can be found that the water conservation function in mainland china gradually decreased from east to west and the water conservation in the western region requires to be paid more attention therefore applying the results of this study to the protection and management of water resources in the ecological barrier region of western china is of great significance for the sustainable development of the ecological environment in the alpine region of western china 5 2 influencing factors water conservation is complex and is influenced by many factors this study analyzed the correlation between water conservation and climatic factors and found that precipitation presented a significantly positive correlation with water conservation during the past 40 years similar to the observations reported in other studies yang et al 2019 lang et al 2017 land use type is also an important factor in the study region high vegetation coverage areas intercept precipitation through forest canopy litter layer and soil which can store precipitation directly for example in the impermeable ground such as the cold desert zone precipitation is directly converted into runoff and evapotranspiration and water conservation is almost absent besides the surface runoff and evapotranspiration the remaining water stored in the soil is the amount of water conservation on average approximately 10 of the precipitation in the qilian mountains is converted to water conservation 32 of the precipitation is converted to surface runoff and evapotranspiration accounts for 58 of the precipitation in the three river source region approximately 14 of the precipitation is converted to water conservation and 29 of the precipitation is converted to surface runoff while evapotranspiration accounts for 57 of precipitation fig 12 as the qilian mountains is located in the northwestern arid region of china the influence of summer monsoon in the east of the mountains is weak and water vapor does not reach the hinterland as a result evaporation is very vigorous in the qilian mountains and the efficiency of conversion of precipitation into water conservation is low owing to the comprehensive influence of the westerly belt and south asian monsoon water vapor in the three river source region is abundant resulting in the generation of several rivers this increases the efficiency of conversion of precipitation into water conservation wang et al 2005 water conservation varies between regions owing to various factors j f wang et al 2021 x f wang et al 2021 studied the temporal and spatial changes of water conservation in the xilingol league and found that only 2 51 of the precipitation in this region was used in water conservation mainly due to an arid climate and abundant desert grassland j f wang et al 2021 x f wang et al 2021 also examined the factors influencing water conservation in the eastern loess plateau and found that the water conservation in forest land and grassland was relatively high and the decrease in water conservation was mainly attributed to human activities these analyses revealed that the water conservation of other regions in china is generally influenced by climate and vegetation changes in addition owing to the geographical location of each region water conservation is also influenced by factors such as altitude grazing land use type changes and urbanization lü et al 2022 z x liu et al 2021 g y liu et al 2021 liu et al 2022 wang et al 2022 singh et al 2021 studied water and soil conservation in six reservoirs in northern india and showed that the greater the flow frequency drainage density and drainage structure the higher was the soil and water loss marquèsa et al 2013 evaluated the water supply capacity of the francoli basin in spain they found that climate change led to a significant reduction in water production and drinking water they believed that mountainous areas were highly vulnerable to climate change in addition to the surface soil and vegetation the rich glacier and permafrost resources in the study region are also an important forms of water storage according to the second glacier inventory of china there are more than 4000 glaciers in the study region with a total area of approximately 2971 59 km2 and an ice reserves of approximately 157 11 km3 sun et al 2021 there is a considerable amount of underground ice exists in permafrost and its water content can exceed the saturated water content of the rock layer wu et al 2009 based on information reported in previous studies we used empirical formulas to simulate the underground ice reserves of permafrost in the study region and the volume was estimated to be more than 2000 km3 however because of the difficulty of drilling in the field and the complexity of monitoring no accurate information exists on the underground ice reserves of permafrost presently thus this aspect should be evaluated in future studies 5 3 multiple methods of predictions in this study it was found that the water conservation in the future study region increased under different modes combined with cmip6 precipitation data under the sres a2 and b2 scenarios the impact of an increase in precipitation on the ecological function of the qinghai tibet plateau was analyzed and the overall water conservation presented with an increase yin et al 2013 wang et al 2020 predicted the water conservation in the urban agglomeration of the golden triangle in southern fujian in 2030 from the perspective of land use change and found a slightly decreasing trend zeng et al 2018 combined the ca markov model with a bayesian belief network model to predict the probability of water conservation distribution in the weihe river basin in 2050 under different land use scenarios and found that the key factors influencing water conservation include precipitation evapotranspiration and land use li et al 2016 applied the clue s model to predict the water and soil conservation in 2030 under three different scenarios using the luan river basin as the study area their fingdings revealed that if ecological protection was to be prioritized increasing the area under forest land provided the highest benefit for water conservation ecosystem models are based on certain assumptions and helps simplify the complex mechanisms of the ecosystem uncertainties in ecosystem models can affect the accuracy of the simulation results combining of experiments and field observations optimizing of the ecological hydrological process of the model to improve the simulation ability of the model and reducing of uncertainties will be the focus of our future research 6 conclusions water conservation is vital for promote the rational allocation of water resources and sustainable development of ecosystems in the alpine mountains this study aimed to bridgge the gaps in water conservation studies in the alpine mountains using the invest model we estimated the water conservation function and the spatiotemporal variations from 1980 to 2019 analyzed its influencing factors and then predicted the changes in water conservation from 2021 to 2100 the main results are as follows firstly the annual total water conservation in the ecological barrier region was 254 108 m3 with an increasing trend the spatial distribution of water conservation showed significant differences decreasing roughly from the southeast to the northwest among the eight sub basins the lancang river source had the highest unit water conservation 72 mm and the yangtze river source has the highest total water conservation 74 108 m3 secondly precipitation land use type elevation and slope were identified as the main influencing factors in the ecological barrier region the correlation between precipitation and water conservation showed that the increase of precipitation will promote the increase of water conservation and the restoration of vegetation such as forest and grassland helps improve the water conservation function the water conservation function in the area with elevation between 3500 and 4500 m and slopes less than 10 was clearly better than other areas thirdly in the study region there is a clear trend of increasing water conservation from 2021 to 2100 further with the largest increase of water conservation in the ssp5 8 5 model while there was a trend of decreasing water conservation in some areas of the yellow river source future studies should focus on strengthening the restoration of forest land and grassland in areas with degraded water conservation function in the future and exploring a win win development model for ecological and economic interaction in areas where water conservation function will be significantly enhanced it is necessary to further explore the relationship between water conservation and local natural environmental carrying capacity in future research and strive to maximize the positive effects

keywords water conservation quantification future prediction ecological barrier region 1 introduction ecosystem services can provide a variety of raw materials for human life and serve as the basic units of the earth s biochemical cycles and energy exchange water conservation is an important ecosystem service function daily 1997 it indicates the process and ability of ecosystems to maintain water reserves during a certain temporal and spatial range in areas with higher vegetation cover the regional water cycle varies flood intensity reduces in the rainy season and river flows continuously during the dry season mainly because of the developed root system and loose soil pores it is of great significance to study water conservation function for regulating runoff preventing

2021 zhang et al 2021 li et al 2016 the water conservation potential of the forest ecosystem in the upper yangtze river was evaluated using arcgis li et al 2011 deng et al 2002 gong et al 2017 also calculated the water conservation function of terrestrial ecosystems throughout china thus the domestic studies about water conservation have mainly focused on the quantification and exploration of driving factors and substantial results have been obtained in various terrain types however only a few studies have been conducted on alpine regions internationally research on water conservation is well established and the results are usually used directly to guide production and life anon 2021 and kumar et al 2019 assessed the effects of water conservation in southwestern nigeria and western india on rice yield and the restoration of agricultural ecosystems in semi arid degraded lands the effects of agricultural production in texas and water conservation measures in northeast iran on sediment yield have also been evaluated using the swat model chen et al 2021 naseri et al 2021 amfo et al 2021 analyzed the relationship between soil water retention capacity and cocoa yield in ghana mahajan et al 2021 studied the effects of soil and water conservation measures on cashew yield in the western coast of india belachew et al 2020 determined the factors influencing soil and water conservation in ethiopia s highlands the water purification function of water conservation forests in guandong mountain area of japan has declined and human activities have been found to be the main contributing factor makino et al 2012 pessacg et al 2015 analyzed the impact of precipitation uncertainty on water supply in the cuub river basin of argentina marquèsa et al 2013 evaluated water production in the francolí basin in northeastern spain and analyzed the impacts of climate and precipitation patterns on water ecosystem services in the region collectively these studies mainly focused on soil and water conservation and its impact on crop yield these results were then considered to guide agricultural production the scope of these studies is mainly focused on the plains as an important ecological security barrier in western china it is necessary to analyse the spatiotemporal variation and influencing factors of water conservation it is not only promote the rational development of regional water resources but also provide theoretical support for sustainable development the study region is located in the northeastern of the qinghai tibet plateau which is characterized by a high altitude low temperature and a simple and sensitive ecological system structure more importantly the qinghai tibet plateau is the key barrier region for maintaining china s ecological security and stability in recent years under the combined effects of climate change and human activities this region has experienced reduced stability and increased vulnerability the yellow river yangtze river and lancang river have originated from this region and are deemed important for water storage and conservation these rivers are also considered important water sources for the terrestrial ecosystems therefore the water storage and conservation capacities of the study region not only exert a direct impact on the water resources of the qinghai tibet plateau but also play a key role in the water security of the middle and lower reaches of several rivers accordingly in this study we discussed several aspects of the water conservation the main aims of this study were to i quantify spatial and temporal distribution of water conservation ii explore influencing factors of water conservation iii predict future changes in water conservation under different climate scenarios

the average annual unit water yield was 321 mm and the average annual unit water conservation was 93 mm in the study region 321 mm fig 2 the average annual unit water conservation in the qilian mountains was 27 mm and average annual water conservation was 48 108 m3 the three river source region s average annual unit water conservation was 66 mm and average annual water conservation was 206 108 m3 the minimum and maximum values were observed in 1994 71 mm and 2019 153 mm resepectively during the past 40 years both water yield and water conservation showed fluctuations with an increasing trend at rates of 2 mm a and 0 7 108 m3 a by pettitt testing we found that there was a mutation point in 2002 thus the year 2002 was considered as the boundary for analysis the results showed that average water conservation from 1980 to 2002 was 184 mm with a change rate of 1 9 mm a whereas the average water conservation from 2002 to 2019 was 218 mm demonstrating an increase of 18 76 over the previous period with a change rate of 3 mm a this increase was likely because of in the last century the awareness about environment protection was low and the development of agriculture and animal husbandry exerted a negative impact on the ecological environment since 2000 a series of ecological restoration projects have been implemented in the study region and the environment quality has improved additionally this trend is similar to the trend of precipitation where the rate of change in precipitation was 0 02 mm a before 2002 and was 5 76 mm a during 2002 2019 4 1 2 spatial distribution the spatial distribution of water conservation was found to significantly differ in different areas of the study region fig 3 water conservation in qilian mountains accounted for 25 of the total conservation and the three river source accounted for 75 of the total conservation the distribution characteristics of water conservation decreased from northwest to southeast regions in the qilian mountains the high value areas were mainly concentrated in the regions around the qilian menyuan and gangcha counties whereas the low value areas were distributed in the northwestern region climate and topography jointly help establish such a distribution pattern the eastern of the qilian mountains is located at the edge of the summer monsoon influence resulting in a gradual reduction in the water vapor content from east to west with a dry climate is formed in the west the qinghai lake basin belongs to a low altitude area and the open terrain is conducive to the growth of vegetation which leads to an increase in water conservation capacity thus this area is characterized by a high water conservation potential for the three river source the areas with high water conservation value are mainly located in the southeast region of the source of the yellow river and the south of the lancang river source including ruoergai hongyuan and zaduo counties these areas have a low altitude humid climate and abundant lakes and wetlands which are favorable for water conservation moreover these areas are densely forested and have high vegetation cover which is conducive to regulating runoff and increasing infiltration with high potential for water conservation eight sub basins were selected from the study region and a significant difference was observed in unit water conservation between different regions the unit water conservation varied as follows lancang river source 72 mm yellow river source 69 mm yangtze river source 68 mm datong river basin 27 mm qinghai lake basin 25 mm upper reaches of shiyang river 21 mm upper reaches of heihe river 15 mm upper reaches of shule river 6 mm the total water conservation varied as follows yangtze river source 99 108 m3 yellow river source 74 108 m3 datong river basin 22 108 m3 lancang river source 21 108 m3 qinghai lake basin 14 108 m3 upper reaches of shiyang river 11 108 m3 upper reaches of heihe river 7 108 m3 upper reaches of shule river 3 108 m3 since the source of lancang river receiced the most precipitation its unit water conservation was the highest the datong river and qinghai lake basins have a flat terrain high vegetation coverage and substantial runoff the upper reaches of the shule shiyang and heihe rivers are situated near the western qilian mountains the climate is dry the ecological environment is fragile and sensitive the growth of surface vegetation is poor and the soil is relatively barren and the capacity of water storage is weak therefore there exists spatial heterogeneity in distribution characteristics in terms of total water conservation the yangtze river source had the highest total water conservation as it covered the largest area the area of the lancang river source is small and there are many high mountains and canyons in the region the steep terrain will also have a certain impact on water conservation function precipitation of the upper reaches of shule river heihe river and shiyang river basin is scarce on the other hand the basin s area is small so the total water conservation was found to be very low 4 1 3 counties districts distribution to explore the water conservation function of different counties 40 major counties in the study region were selected for statistical analysis water conservation in most counties displayed an increasing trend over the past 40 years the counties with a substantial increase were yongdeng sunan xining maqu dari maqin nangqian and ruoergei aksai yumen dulan and xinghai displayed a decreasing trend of water conservation the counties with a comparatively faster increase in water conservation had sufficient precipitation which could be influenced by the continuous increase in precipitation and the recovery of vegetation over the time period ultimately leading to an increase in water conservation in contrast the counties with a decrease in water conservation had a relatively dry climate less precipitation a fragile ecological environment and may have been influenced by human activities thereby resulting in a decrease in their water conservation function the restoration of the ecological environment and treatment of key counties with a declining water conservation function should be strengthened on the basis of maintaining the existing water conservation function further counties with lower water conservation levels should learn from the treatment experience of counties with higher water conservation levels gradually improve the vegetation coverage area and reasonably plan human activities 4 2 influencing factors 4 2 1 climatic factors the changes in climatic factors have a profound impact on water conservation the changes in precipitation potential evapotranspiration and temperature in the study region from 1980 to 2019 are shown in fig 4 the average annual precipitation in the study region was 729 73 mm showing a significant increasing trend with a rate of change of 3 82 mm a p 0 05 the average annual potential evapotranspiration in the study region was 2577 22 mm with a rate of change of 1 82 mm a p 0 05 under the background of global warming the average temperature in the study region showed a significantly increasing trend 0 04 c a p 0 05 these results are similar to those reported by pan et al 2013 and jin et al 2020 a significantly positive correlation was found between precipitation and water conservation table 2 with the exception of 1980 1990 there was no significantly negative correlation between potential evapotranspiration and temperature and water conservation first after the condensation water vapor reached the surface in the form of precipitation forming surface runoff then a portion of this forms underground runoff through infiltration and a certain proportion returned to the atmosphere in the form of evapotranspiration the rest is stored in the soil and roots therefore precipitation is the key factor affecting surface water conservation and the increase of precipitation in the study region over the past 40 years has played an important role in improving water conservation potential evapotranspiration was the theoretical upper limit of the actual evapotranspiration and is deemed an important part of the regional hydrological cycle the increase in potential evapotranspiration represented an increase in the water available for evapotranspiration ultimately leading to an increase in actual evapotranspiration and decrease in water accumulation increasing temperatures also enhanced the actual evapotranspiration 4 2 2 land use type besides climatic factors land use type is an important factor that affects water conservation in this study land use data from the 1980 s 1990 s 2000 s and 2010 s were used to analyze the water conservation status during different time periods the study region had six primary land use types the main land use types in the study region were grassland and other land overall during the past 40 years the land types with a net increase in area were cultivated land grassland and water bodies with an increase of 385 83 km2 18 977 81 km2 and 884 09 km2 respectively the types of land areas that have a net decrease including forest land construction land and other land with a decrease of 705 69 km2 809 76 km2and 8 732 27 km2 forest land is mainly distribute to the southeast of the qilian mountains and the part of the yellow river source and lancang river source the area of cultivated land was found to be small which is also concentrated to the southeast of the qilian mountains and the northeast of the yellow river source other land widely distributed to the northwest of the qilian mountains and the part of the yangtze river source the above distribution pattern was mainly influenced by climate areas with abundant precipitation are conducive to the growth of forests and grasslands while areas with arid climate fragile ecosystems and scarce precipitation are easy to form other lands the spatial analysis tool arcgis was used to obtain the average annual water conservation data for the land use types as water bodies mainly serve to provide water water conservation of water bodies was not included in the analysis the results are shown in fig 5 the average unit water conservation of different land types in the study region from 1980 to 2019 presented the following order forest land 167 mm grassland 61 mm cultivated land 37 mm other land types 3 mm construction land 2 mm the average total water conservation of the six land use types presented the following order grassland 187 108 m3 forest land 49 108 m3 other land types 4 108 m3 cultivated land 3 108 m3 construction land 1 108 m3 the unit water conservation and total water conservation in grassland showed a fluctuating upward trend while the unit water conservation and total water conservation of forest land construction land and other land have a slight decrease and the change of cultivate land is not obvious forest land has developed roots and substantial soil porosity which can intercept surface water the root system in grasslands is shallow and the water conservation ability is weaker than forest land the root system of cultivated land is similarly shallow and its soil layer is profoundly affected by human activities resulting in a comparatively lower water holding capacity construction land and other land have low surface vegetation cover with considerably exposed areas thereby lacking the ability to store precipitation in terms of total water conservation grassland contributed most of the total water conservation because the area of forest land was markedly smaller than grassland forest land and grassland were the main contributors to the total water conservation in the study region collectively accounting for 90 of the total conservation 4 2 3 elevation and slope to further investigate the distribution of water conservation in the study region at different slopes and elevations we analyse the variation characteristics of water conservation through the regional statistical analysis tool as the average elevation of the three river source was higher than qilian mountains the elevation of qilian mountains is divided into four classes 2 500 m 2 500 3 500 m 3 500 4 500 m and 4 500 m and the elevation of the three river source region was divided into four classes 3 500 m 3 500 4 500 m 4 500 5 500 m and 5 500 m fig 6 based on the results it can be seen that the average unit water conservation of the qilian mountains gradually decreases with increasing elevation as follows 2 500 m 36 mm 2 500 3500 m 28 mm 3 500 4 500 m 25 mm 4 500 m 18 mm the total water conservation showed a variation characteristic with an increase followed by a decrease with elevation as follows 2 500 m 0 1 108 m3 2 500 3 500 m 22 108 m3 3 500 4 500 m 24 108 m3 4 500 m 0 02 108 m3 the total water conservation in the area of 3 500 4 500 m accounted for 52 of the total volume the trend of average unit water conservation of the three river source region with elevation was basically the same as qilian mountains with the following results 3 500 m 84 mm 3 500 4 500 m 76 mm 4 500 5 500 m 54 mm 5 500 m 31 mm the total water conservation increases and then decreases with the following results 3 500 m 14 108 m3 3 500 4 500 m 97 108 m3 4 500 5 500 m 92 108 m3 5 500 m 2 108 m3 the overall proportion of water conservation in the 3 500 4 500 m area was approximately 47 possible reasons for the decrease in unit water conservation of the study region with increasing elevation are as follows at low elevation area the ecosystem structure is more stable the temperature is higher the water and heat conditions are well configured the surface vegetation cover is high and the root systems of forest land and grassland can absorb and store water well however at high elevation area the climate is cold the ecosystem is very fragile and it is difficult to recover quickly once damaged and the vegetation cover is low the area of cold desert zone is large surface water is very easy to be lost and the potential of water storage is low evident differences in the water conservation were found for different slopes in the study region and we divided the slope of the study region into five levels according to the actual situation 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 and 20 fig 7 the results show that the average unit water conservation of qilian mountains has a trend of increasing and then decreasing with the increase of slope 5 26 mm 5 10 32 mm 10 15 30 mm 15 20 24 mm 20 18 mm the total water conservation continues to decrease with increasing slope 5 25 108 m3 5 10 15 108 m3 10 15 5 108 m3 15 20 1 108 m3 20 0 1 108 m3 the total water conservation in the area with a slope 5 contributed 55 of the total volume both the average unit water conservation and total water conservation of the three river source region gradually decrease with increasing slope 5 68 mm 153 108 m3 5 10 66 mm 41 108 m3 10 15 63 mm 9 108 m3 15 20 63 mm 1 108 m3 20 61 mm 0 5 108 m3 the slope in the 5 area has the largest proportion of total volume about 75 the gentle slope is flat and more conducive to the storage of surface water the areas with a large slope have a steep topography the scouring effect of rainwater on the surface is stronger and the risk of soil erosion is high so it is not conducive to water conservation 4 3 predictions we predicted the changes in water conservation in the study region under different scenarios four future scenarios namely ssp1 2 6 low forcing ssp2 4 5 medium forcing ssp3 7 0 medium to high forcing and ssp5 8 5 high forcing were considered in this study these scenarios are divided into two time series namely 2021 2060 and 2061 2100 by analyzing the spatial distribution characteristics of water conservation in the study region from 2021 to 2100 it is found that water conservation gradually decreases from the southeast to northwest in qilian mountains in the three river source area water conservation decreased gradually from south to north and its spatial distribution was similar to those of 1980 2019 fig 8 we used the average unit water conservation in the study region from 1980 to 2019 as a comparison standard during 2021 2060 under the ssp1 2 6 mode the unit water conservation of qilian mountains is expected to experience a greater decrease including yongchang subei gulang shandan menyuan gonghe dulan and wulan gulang was predicted to have a decrease of 0 99 mm which is the greater reduction in all counties unit water conservation in other counties is expected to increase with the largest increase is gangcha under the mode of ssp2 4 5 only yongchang subei gonghe and dulan counties unit water conservation is expected to decrease with yongchang expected to experience the greatest reduction in the counties where the unit water conservation is expected to increased tianjun has the greatest increase in the ssp3 7 0 mode only yongchang is expected to have a reduction in unit water conservation while other counties are expected to display an upward trend with the largest increase in xining in the ssp5 8 5 mode the unit water conservation of all counties is expected to increase significantly with the largest increase expected in tianjun from 2061 2100 under the ssp1 2 6 mode the unit water conservation of qilian mountains will increase in numerous counties including aksai yongdeng gulang minle sunan menyuan qilian and tianjun with sunan expected to have the largest increase unit water conservation in yongchng subei yumen liangzhou district tianzhu shandan gangcha gonghe delingha dulan wulan and xining is expected to show a decreasing trend with the largest decrease in gangcha in ssp2 4 5 mode only the unit water conservation in subei and delingha is expected to decrease and the unit water conservation of the remaining counties is expected to increase under ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 modes the water conservation in all counties and districts is expected to improve and the counties with the greatest increase is sunan fig 9 from 2021 2060 based on ssp1 2 6 mode the unit water conservation of the three river source region will decrease by more than the average from 1980 to 2019 including luqu maqu dari maduo gande maqin tongde xinghai geermu zeku aba hongyuan and changdu however the unit water conservation of jiuzhi nangqian qumalai yushu zaduo zhiduo and ruoergai will increase with nangqian experiencing the greatest increase 1 33 mm in ssp2 4 5 mode the counties expected to have a decrease in unit water conservation include luqu maqu dari tongde xinghai zeku aba hongyuan and changdu with luqu will decrease the most 1 95 mm the unit water conservation of jiuzhi maduo geermu nangqian qumalai yushu zaduo zhiduo ruoergai and changdu will show an upward trend and yushu will have the largest increase 1 62 mm under ssp3 7 0 mode the unit water conservation in luqu maqu dari gande maqin and xinghai will decrease and luqu 2 72 mm will have greatest decrease unit water conservation in other counties will increase to varying degrees with yushu will increase of 2 46 mm which will be the largest of all counties in ssp5 8 5 mode the unit water conservation in luqu maqu and gande will decrease and luqu will have the greatest decrease 3 44 mm unit water conservation in yushu is expected to have the greatest increase 2 87 mm during 2061 2100 under ssp1 2 6 mode the unit water conservation in luqu maqu dari maduo maqin tongde xinghai geermu zeku aba hongyuan and ruoergai will decrease other counties will increase nangqian s unit water conservation is expected to have the greatest increase of all counties under ssp2 4 5 mode the counties where the unit water conservation will decrease include luqu maqu dari gande maqin xinghai geermu zeku and hongyuan with luqu will decrease most in the counties where unit water conservation will increase nangqian will have the greatest increase under ssp3 7 0 mode the unit water conservation in luqu maqu and xinghai will decrease with luqu will have the greatest decrease in the counties where unit water conservation will increase nangqian s increase is the greatest under ssp5 8 5 mode the unit water conservation in luqu and maqu will continue to decrease the increase of nangqian is still the greatest fig 10 in general from 2021 to 2060 under ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 modes the water conservation in qilian mountains will decrease in several counties and the greatest decline will occur in yongchang under ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 modes the water conservation function will mostly increase in the three river source region the counties where the unit water conservation will decrease are mainly concentrated in the yellow river source and the counties where have a substantial reduction include luqu maqu and gande the unit water conservation in the yangtze river source and the lancang river source will mainly display an increasing trend the overall change in ssp1 2 6 mode will be the lowest while the change of ssp5 8 5 mode will be more intense from 2061 2100 the variation characteristics of water conservation in qilian mountains will be roughly the same as the previous period in the three river source region comparing with the previous period the unit water conservation in most counties will increase as a whole compared with that in the previous period and the decreasing trend in maqu and luqu will remain obvious the overall fluctuation in ssp1 2 6 mode is expected to small while the increase in ssp5 8 5 mode will be the greatest due to the strong emission scenario of ssp5 8 5 the precipitation increase rapidly so the water conservation in the study region will rise rapidly at this stage in the future the decrease in water conservation function in some counties of the yellow river source in the future may be due to the weakening of the summer monsoon which leads to the decrease in precipitation and an increase in evaporation causing an eventual decrease in surface runoff 5 discussion 5 1 spatiotemporal variation in this study we explored water conservation and its spatiotemporal pattern in the study region from 1980 to 2019 based on the application of the invest model to obtained a comprehensive understanding of water conservation in the study region the water conservation index can help reflect the change in water conservation service function the value of water conservation index in the study region ranges from 0 01 to 0 31 further the water conservation index of the qilian mountains was high in the southeast and the high value of the three river sources was mainly distributed in the south of the yellow river source and the lancang river source with scattered high values in the yangtze river source fig 11 the high water conservation index areas were characterized by abundant precipitation and a comparatively higher forest proportion moreover the soil texture of high value areas was mainly silty loam and silt in areas with low water conservation index values except for poor precipitation and vegetation conditions the soil texture was dominated by loam and the ability to conserve water was weak the average water conservation index of the qilian mountains during the four periods were 0 07 0 07 0 09 and 0 11 the average water conservation index of the three river source in the four periods were 0 14 0 13 0 14 and 0 15 consequently changes in the study region over the past 40 years reflected a gradual increase in water conservation function national policies also played an important role in increasing water conservation in 2005 china approved the overall planning of ecological protection and construction of three river source nature reserve in qinghai province included projects such as returning grazing to grassland returning farmland to forests and ecological relocation such measures were aimed at improving regional ecosystem services wu et al 2016 found that after the implementation of the three river source ecological project the average water conservation of the forest grass ecosystem increased by 15 6 compared with that reported in the previous period further the contribution rate of ecological projects to the improvement of water conservation services in the three river source was approximately 23 98 based on modis data it was found that the vegetation coverage in qilian mountains increased from 2000 to 2015 in addition to regional warming and humidification vegetation coverage was also related to the implementation of a series of policies such as afforesting the hillsides after the establishment of national nature reserves in the region which in turn promoted water conservation jiang et al 2017 it is believed that precipitation is mainly distributed in june to september in the alpine mountainous areas and the period from october to december can be regarded as a recession stage in the runoff process the change in runoff in this stage can be considered to reflect the water conservation status of terrestrial ecosystems in alpine mountainous areas to a certain extent wang et al 2009 therefore we verified the simulation results of water conservation obtained with the application of the model based on the measured runoff data and water resources bulletin statistics of few hydrological stations in the study region the water conservation indices in different areas of the study region decreased or remained unchanged from the 1980 s to the 1990 s and showed a significant upward trend after the year 2000 this result was consistent with the simulation results obtained in this study t j wang et al 2018 y c wang et al 2018 assessed the water conservation function of the shiyang river basin in 2015 and obtained a unit water conservation of 23 97 mm similar to our result at present studies on the spatial and temporal distribution patterns and influencing factors of water conservation in the qinghai tibet plateau qaidam basin yellow river basin loess plateau beijing tianjin hebei region dongting lake basin and beijiang basin have made good progress and the importance grades of water conservation in some regions have been evaluated wang et al 2022 li et al 2022a li et al 2022b jia et al 2022 bao et al 2016 li et al 2022a hu et al 2020 xu et al 2022 by comparison it can be found that the water conservation function in mainland china gradually decreased from east to west and the water conservation in the western region requires to be paid more attention therefore applying the results of this study to the protection and management of water resources in the ecological barrier region of western china is of great significance for the sustainable development of the ecological environment in the alpine region of western china 5 2 influencing factors water conservation is complex and is influenced by many factors this study analyzed the correlation between water conservation and climatic factors and found that precipitation presented a significantly positive correlation with water conservation during the past 40 years similar to the observations reported in other studies yang et al 2019 lang et al 2017 land use type is also an important factor in the study region high vegetation coverage areas intercept precipitation through forest canopy litter layer and soil which can store precipitation directly for example in the impermeable ground such as the cold desert zone precipitation is directly converted into runoff and evapotranspiration and water conservation is almost absent besides the surface runoff and evapotranspiration the remaining water stored in the soil is the amount of water conservation on average approximately 10 of the precipitation in the qilian mountains is converted to water conservation 32 of the precipitation is converted to surface runoff and evapotranspiration accounts for 58 of the precipitation in the three river source region approximately 14 of the precipitation is converted to water conservation and 29 of the precipitation is converted to surface runoff while evapotranspiration accounts for 57 of precipitation fig 12 as the qilian mountains is located in the northwestern arid region of china the influence of summer monsoon in the east of the mountains is weak and water vapor does not reach the hinterland as a result evaporation is very vigorous in the qilian mountains and the efficiency of conversion of precipitation into water conservation is low owing to the comprehensive influence of the westerly belt and south asian monsoon water vapor in the three river source region is abundant resulting in the generation of several rivers this increases the efficiency of conversion of precipitation into water conservation wang et al 2005 water conservation varies between regions owing to various factors j f wang et al 2021 x f wang et al 2021 studied the temporal and spatial changes of water conservation in the xilingol league and found that only 2 51 of the precipitation in this region was used in water conservation mainly due to an arid climate and abundant desert grassland j f wang et al 2021 x f wang et al 2021 also examined the factors influencing water conservation in the eastern loess plateau and found that the water conservation in forest land and grassland was relatively high and the decrease in water conservation was mainly attributed to human activities these analyses revealed that the water conservation of other regions in china is generally influenced by climate and vegetation changes in addition owing to the geographical location of each region water conservation is also influenced by factors such as altitude grazing land use type changes and urbanization lü et al 2022 z x liu et al 2021 g y liu et al 2021 liu et al 2022 wang et al 2022 singh et al 2021 studied water and soil conservation in six reservoirs in northern india and showed that the greater the flow frequency drainage density and drainage structure the higher was the soil and water loss marquèsa et al 2013 evaluated the water supply capacity of the francoli basin in spain they found that climate change led to a significant reduction in water production and drinking water they believed that mountainous areas were highly vulnerable to climate change in addition to the surface soil and vegetation the rich glacier and permafrost resources in the study region are also an important forms of water storage according to the second glacier inventory of china there are more than 4000 glaciers in the study region with a total area of approximately 2971 59 km2 and an ice reserves of approximately 157 11 km3 sun et al 2021 there is a considerable amount of underground ice exists in permafrost and its water content can exceed the saturated water content of the rock layer wu et al 2009 based on information reported in previous studies we used empirical formulas to simulate the underground ice reserves of permafrost in the study region and the volume was estimated to be more than 2000 km3 however because of the difficulty of drilling in the field and the complexity of monitoring no accurate information exists on the underground ice reserves of permafrost presently thus this aspect should be evaluated in future studies 5 3 multiple methods of predictions in this study it was found that the water conservation in the future study region increased under different modes combined with cmip6 precipitation data under the sres a2 and b2 scenarios the impact of an increase in precipitation on the ecological function of the qinghai tibet plateau was analyzed and the overall water conservation presented with an increase yin et al 2013 wang et al 2020 predicted the water conservation in the urban agglomeration of the golden triangle in southern fujian in 2030 from the perspective of land use change and found a slightly decreasing trend zeng et al 2018 combined the ca markov model with a bayesian belief network model to predict the probability of water conservation distribution in the weihe river basin in 2050 under different land use scenarios and found that the key factors influencing water conservation include precipitation evapotranspiration and land use li et al 2016 applied the clue s model to predict the water and soil conservation in 2030 under three different scenarios using the luan river basin as the study area their fingdings revealed that if ecological protection was to be prioritized increasing the area under forest land provided the highest benefit for water conservation ecosystem models are based on certain assumptions and helps simplify the complex mechanisms of the ecosystem uncertainties in ecosystem models can affect the accuracy of the simulation results combining of experiments and field observations optimizing of the ecological hydrological process of the model to improve the simulation ability of the model and reducing of uncertainties will be the focus of our future research 6 conclusions water conservation is vital for promote the rational allocation of water resources and sustainable development of ecosystems in the alpine mountains this study aimed to bridgge the gaps in water conservation studies in the alpine mountains using the invest model we estimated the water conservation function and the spatiotemporal variations from 1980 to 2019 analyzed its influencing factors and then predicted the changes in water conservation from 2021 to 2100 the main results are as follows firstly the annual total water conservation in the ecological barrier region was 254 108 m3 with an increasing trend the spatial distribution of water conservation showed significant differences decreasing roughly from the southeast to the northwest among the eight sub basins the lancang river source had the highest unit water conservation 72 mm and the yangtze river source has the highest total water conservation 74 108 m3 secondly precipitation land use type elevation and slope were identified as the main influencing factors in the ecological barrier region the correlation between precipitation and water conservation showed that the increase of precipitation will promote the increase of water conservation and the restoration of vegetation such as forest and grassland helps improve the water conservation function the water conservation function in the area with elevation between 3500 and 4500 m and slopes less than 10 was clearly better than other areas thirdly in the study region there is a clear trend of increasing water conservation from 2021 to 2100 further with the largest increase of water conservation in the ssp5 8 5 model while there was a trend of decreasing water conservation in some areas of the yellow river source future studies should focus on strengthening the restoration of forest land and grassland in areas with degraded water conservation function in the future and exploring a win win development model for ecological and economic interaction in areas where water conservation function will be significantly enhanced it is necessary to further explore the relationship between water conservation and local natural environmental carrying capacity in future research and strive to maximize the positive effects

7932,study region burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world and hence very vulnerable to climate change it is covered by the kagera malagarasi and tanganyika river basins study focus we investigated the hydro climatic impacts of climate change over burundi projected by an ensemble of 19 regional climate models and an eco hydrological model in two future periods under the rcps 4 5 and 8 5 new hydro climatic insights we found a robust increase in annual and seasonal average temperature over burundi in all scenarios characterized by a significant annual rising trend along the 21st century and the increase in every single month especially in the dry season up to 5 2 c under rcp8 5 p2 precipitation would increase in the north except in february and september in the south precipitation would decrease throughout the year particularly in the onset and offset of the rainy season and from december to february this would entail the prolongation and severity of the long and short dry periods these changes generate increases in the long term annual mean discharges in north burundi up to 44 in small catchments and 29 in larger ones in southern burundi the discharge would decrease along the year up to 16 8 with exception of november december in the southeast up to 27 9 besides the higher daily extreme river discharges found over the ruvubu basin imply a higher risk of

does not affect all people equally existing and new risks induced by climate change are generally greater for disadvantaged people ipcc 2014 like those facing poverty and food insecurity burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world with about 65 of the population living below the poverty line fao un 2020 importantly the country suffers from alarming food insecurity almost one in two households around 4 6 million people are food insecure ifrc 2019 and about 56 of children suffer from chronic malnutrition there is very limited access to water and sanitation and less than 12 of the population has access to electricity world bank 2022 most of burundians 90 rely on subsistence agriculture fao un 2020 which counts barely with irrigation niyongabo 2018 and is insufficient to cover household demand burundi has sufficient rainfall with an annual average ranging from 700 to 2000 mm year however its distribution is uneven in space and time and due to its high population density the country is experiencing increasing pressure on water soil and land resources global water partnership 2011 additionally conflict for land emerges since the economic policy does not allow for the equitable distribution of resources kamungi et al 2005 the high dependence of burundians on agriculture makes them extremely sensitive to climate variability and extremes nationwide famines recorded in the 20th century and regionally in 1989 1990 2000 2005 and 2008 2010 were the results of extremely dry weather events fao un 2016 moreover many people were affected by heavy rains strong winds floods and related landslides along the period 1989 2015 world bank 2022 recently in 2015 2016 about 90 000 people were affected by el niño heavy rains strong winds followed by la niña late irregular and insufficient rainfall these events led to conflicts and internal displacements due to food insecurity in 2019 almost 80 of the displacements within burundi were caused by natural disasters iom 2019 over the 21st century temperature is projected to globally rise as well as the frequency and severity of extreme weather events ipcc 2014 with africa likely being the most affected continent niang et al 2015 therefore due to burundi s high vulnerability and dependence on climate variability it is very important to provide detailed information about the potential impacts of climate change to enhance adaptation options and preparedness ipcc 2014 in addition the sustainable development goals sdgs highlight the need to end poverty in all forms and dimensions by 2030 which involves targeting the most vulnerable and supporting communities affected by climate related disasters to reach this goal developing countries must prepare to cope with the impacts of climate change and manage their water resources efficiently which is key for guaranteeing food resources and human security there is little information about the hydrological impacts of climate change in burundi previous research within the white nile river has paid high attention to lake victoria sene et al 2001 phoon et al 2004 due to its socioeconomic importance as a source of drinking water such studies relate mainly to the change in precipitation over the lake thiery et al 2015 2016 its water level tungaraza et al 2012 or the stratification tierney et al 2010 yet information about the responses in upstream basins as represented by burundi s network is scarce kim et al 2021 ogiramoi nyeko 2011 one reason could be the difficulty to model this area due to the multiple swamps and high evaporation di baldassarre et al 2011 moreover the lack of investment in burundi due to the violence and conflict in the country since its independence in 1962 kamungi et al 2005 has probably contributed to the research gap in this region information about climate projections in burundi can be only found in few publications baramburiye et al 2013 kim et al 2021 or extracted from regional maps that illustrate such in central east africa endris et al 2013 2019 nikulin et al 2012 hence lacking accuracy despite the existence of a few national plans for adaptation to climate change napa 2007 the information about climate change impacts is not very detailed climate impact assessments on hydrology normally use atmosphere ocean general circulation models so called global climate models gcms and regional climate models rcms rcms have been proved to add value to the projections from gcms by reflecting the effects of local topographic or land feedback with the atmosphere that gcms are not able to capture due to their lower spatial resolution giorgi et al 2009 souverijns et al 2016 found that 77 of the drivers of future precipitation over east africa can be explained by local or mesoscale feedback and changes in moisture influx while 23 can be explained by the frequency of occurrence of circulation patterns even some rcms have been found to derive different climate signs in projected precipitation than their driving gcms due to their better representation of physical processes e g saeed et al 2004 dosio et al 2019 the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment initiative cordex provides high resolution regional climate projections endris et al 2013 based on a set of global model simulations in support of the ipcc fifth assessment report giorgi et al 2009 the ability of the cordex models to reproduce the characteristics of rainfall patterns at different scales over africa as well as the influence of the large scale climate circulation patterns on regional rainfall teleconnections has been proven in several studies endris et al 2013 2016 nikulin et al 2012 therefore given the added value of rcms over gcms and the ability of the cordex rcms to represent the climate in africa at a finer scale the models from the cordex initiative have been used in this study as input to a semi distributed eco hydrological model to assess future changes in river discharge and water availability in burundi to provide more insights on climate change impacts in burundi we 1 evaluated the representation of temperature and precipitation by bias adjusted cordex projections 2 analyzed the future variation and spatial distribution of average climate variables and 3 investigated the impact of climate change projections on average and extreme flow regimes in three river basins additionally with this study we intent to provide potential recommendations that may help environmental managers and policy makers to develop tools to adapt to anthropogenic climate change in burundi 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area burundi is a landlocked country in east africa covering an area of 27 834 km2 fig 1 it is located south of the equator between the latitudes 1 19 s and 4 27 s and the longitudes 29 00 e and 30 51 e the country in the heart of africa s great rift valley presents a diverse topography characterized by five zones these are the western plain 775 1000 m a s l which contains lake ruzizi its wetlands and lake tanganyika the mountain range crête congo nile that crosses the central western area from north to south with altitudes reaching 2670 m a s l mount heha the central meseta 1400 2000 m a s l the depression of kumoso in the south east 1200 1400 m a s l and the depression of bugesera in the north east 1200 1500 m a s l to better analyze and explain spatial differences of climate change in burundi the region was split in the following domains eastern 30 0 e 31 0 e 2 5 s 4 0 s western 29 0 e 30 0 e 2 5 s 4 0 s northern 29 5 e 31 0 e 2 0 s 3 5 s and 29 0 e 29 5 e 2 5 3 0 s and southern 29 0 e 30 5 e 3 5 s 4 5 s and 29 0 e 29 5 e 3 0 s 3 5 s which are shown in fig a 2d b and c 2 1 1 climate the climatology in the country follows a bimodal pattern with a dry season from june to september and a rainy season from september to may however due to the movement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz the wet season is formed by the short rains period that goes from september to december the long rains period from mid february or march to may and a short dry season with frequent dry spells in between icpac 2009 nkunzimana et al 2019 besides the variability of the precipitation and temperature in burundi is strongly related to the altitude napa 2007 nkunzimana et al 2019 consequently the congo nile mountain range receives the highest rainfall amounts between 1500 and 2000 mm and experiences the lowest mean temperatures of 14 15 c in the oriental plains bugesera and kumoso annual rainfall ranges between 750 and 1250 mm and annual mean temperatures between 20 and 22 c in the occidental plain imbo plain annual mean precipitation values are between 800 and 950 mm with annual mean temperatures above 23 c in the occidental escarpment of mumirwa precipitation values range from 1000 to 1400 mm per year and annual mean temperatures between 18 and 28 c whereas in the central high plains the annual average precipitation ranges between 1200 and 1500 mm and the annual mean temperature is between 17 and 20 c sunzu ntigambirizwa and ngenzebuhoro 2009 2 1 2 hydrology the rivers of burundi fig 1 belong to three main basins the tanganyika kagera and malagarasi river basins at the same time the kagera river belongs to the nile basin while the other two belong to the congo basin region the a kanyaru river flows along the northern border of burundi with rwanda where it joins the nyabarongo river rwanda the ruvubu river drains the central part of burundi and converges into the nyabarongo river at the rusumu falls where the kagera river starts the ruzizi river which flows along the d r congo rwanda burundi border and drains into lake tanganyika and the malagarasi river south east burundi belong to the congo river basin all the burundian river basins are trans boundary 2 1 3 population burundi has 11 89 million inhabitants and counts with one of the highest population densities 413 inhab km2 and growth rates 3 1 in the world world bank 2022 the population distribution is very diverse across the country and ranges between 20 and 8500 inhab km2 the latest is given in the capital city bujumbura 1 1 https en wikipedia org wiki bujumbura 2 1 4 agriculture burundi s economy relies heavily on the agricultural sector which despite the scarce arable land employs 80 of the population 90 of the population depends directly or indirectly on this sector which is mainly rain fed baramburiye et al 2013 2 2 climate data 2 2 1 watch forcing data era 40 daily meteorological data precipitation minimum mean and maximum temperature solar radiation and relative air humidity on a half a degree grid from the integrated project water and global change watch were used as reference 1970 1999 to adjust the bias of the cordex models see section 2 2 3 1 and to calibrate and validate the eco hydrological model as described by weedon et al 2011 watch forcing data wfd was created for 1958 2001 based on the 40 year ecmwf re analysis product era 40 to be used with land surface and hydrological models the wfd era40 data were interpolated bilinearly to 0 5 resolution corrected by elevation and monthly observations of temperature and cloud cover from the climatic research unit cru and precipitation from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc combined with adjustments for atmospheric aerosol loading and precipitation gauge corrections for rainfall and snowfall 2 2 1 1 performance of wfd era40 the performance of wfd era40 was evaluated based on observed meteorological data from 18 stations across burundi for seasonal precipitation and near surface mean temperature in the reference period p0 1970 1999 due to the differences in precipitation and temperature patterns in eastern and western burundi fig a 2d the evaluation was performed for both regions separately section 3 1 1 after filling the missing data in the observations see section 2 2 2 for more information the meteorological data were interpolated at half degree resolution by applying the inverse distance weight idw method to be compared with wfd era40 we accounted for the elevation along the crête congo nile mountain range by specifying a break line within the idw interpolation 2 2 2 observation data observed climate data served to check the reliability of wfd era40 see section 3 1 1 observed data for precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature were provided for 17 stations within burundi for 1970 2010 by igebu geographic institute of burundi via giz deutsche gesellschaft für internationale zusammenarbeit we also found meteorological data from igebu published on internet simone et al 2007 and selected precipitation minimum and maximum temperature for kinyinya station located in the south east of burundi where we had scarce information the observations were not complete so we filled manually the missing daily data by averaging values from adjacent days when possible we found years with less than 200 observed daily data and months with less than 15 dis continuous daily time steps that we had to discard table a 1 shows the percentage of missing data in each station for precipitation minimum and maximum temperature more than 70 of the stations show less than 25 missing data 2 2 3 cordex as climate projections we used in total 19 combinations of 10 driving gcms and 5 rcms from the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex 2 2 https cordex org for the africa cordex domain at a resolution of 0 44 degree afr 44 in this study table 1 summarizes the 19 gcm rcms combinations our study focuses on two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios the representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 the lower end concentration scenario rcp 2 6 was excluded due to the insufficient number of available projections when performing this study 2 2 3 1 bias adjustment of the cordex models in order to avoid the propagation of the uncertainty error from the climate models across the impacts modeling chain all climate projections were bias adjusted prior to run the eco hydrological model for it we used the inter sectoral inter model intercomparison project isimip www isimip org isimip3ba method lange 2019 as reference observation dataset and period for the bias adjustment we used wfd era40 and 1970 1999 for this task the cordex data were remapped to a half degree resolution geographic grid likewise wfd era40 the isimip3ba bias adjustment method is a quantile mapping method that fits the cumulative distribution function of the target data it is specifically tailored to reduce the bias in the tails of the distribution i e extremes while it preserves the trends in each quantile the bias adjustment was applied separately univariate to the variables needed for the hydrological model precipitation prec temperature tas relative humidity hurs and solar radiation rsds for the maximum tasmax and minimum tasmin temperature the isimip3ba method derives new values from the bias adjusted temperature its range and skewness whenever needed we converted the calendars of the cordex models to proleptic gregorian using linear regression of neighboring dates 2 2 4 climate scenarios the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 meinshausen 2011 moss et al 2010 were used to explore the change of meteorological variables in two 30 year periods in the 21st century p1 2030 2059 and p2 2069 2098 with reference to the historical period p0 1970 1999 the rcp 4 5 represents a medium low global anthropogenic radiative forcing that gets stabilized whereas the rcp 8 5 represents high radiative forcing as a result of increasing greenhouse gas emissions over time these two scenarios allow exploring the impacts of a warming world by providing a wide climate range that includes a soft mitigation scenario rcp 4 5 and the so called business as usual or unlikely worst case scenario rcp 8 5 the far future 30 year period was constraint to 2098 by the hadgem2 es model that provides simulation data until november 2099 for some combinations of rcms rcps 2 3 data for hydrological modeling the data used to set up calibrate and validate the hydrological model are a digital elevation

covering the area between 28 0 e 5 5 s and 32 0 e 1 0 s for the comparison of wfd era40 with observed data we calculated the long term monthly mean averages for the east and west of burundi fig a 2d while the anomalies in the future were calculated as the fractional coverage over the northern fig a 2b and southern fig a 2c regions of burundi such domains were defined by the pixels indicating opposite sign of change 3 results 3 1 past climate 3 1 1 past climate represented by wfd era40 in this section we analyze how long term annual mean temperature and precipitation are represented by wfd era40 over burundi in the reference period p0 1970 1999 compared to the observations the spatial distribution and value ranges indicated by wfd era40 agree with the climate described in national reports sunzu ntigambirizwa and ngenzebuhoro 2009 and with observed meteorological data the correlation of seasonal mean precipitation and temperature for east and west burundi between wfd era40 and observed meteorological data shows a very good fit with r2 above 0 99 fig 2 wfd era40 indicates slight deviations from the observations for seasonal mean precipitation during the rainy season december february in west burundi and in march and april in the east on the other side wfd era40 overestimates mean air temperature by less than 0 4 c in west burundi and about 1 c or less in the eastern part these differences could probably be due to the interpolation applied to the observed data since the idw method does not take into account for the elevation of the stations despite some differences due to the good fit of the long term monthly mean temperature and precipitation data its temporal continuity and the availability of more climate variables than in the observed data wfd era40 was used as meteorological input to calibrate and validate swim and to adjust the bias of the cordex projections with reference to p0 1970 1999 3 1 2 past climate represented by cordex the cumulative distribution function cdf of daily precipitation and temperature values simulated by 19 cordex models before and after adjusting the bias to wfd era40 in 1970 1999 with the isimip3ba method see section 2 2 3 can be seen in fig 3 a significant improvement can be observed in the distribution of the daily precipitation in the cordex data after bias adjustment cordex ba fig 3a like for instance in the lower and higher tails of the distribution the number of dry days in cordex ba has increased from 40 to 48 similarly than in wfd era40 47 and the maximum precipitation value has decreased from 301 mm to 171 mm in cordex ba idem for temperature fig 3b shows that most of the cordex models underestimated daily mean values in comparison to wfd era40 before the ba whereas the new distribution of the cordex values after ba fits very good the one from wfd era40 in the long term and after the bias adjustment the monthly average precipitation and temperature of the cordex climate data fits perfectly the values from wfd era40 see after and previous bias correction in figs 2 and a 3 respectively regarding the annual values after the ba the average of the annual total precipitation shown by the cordex ensemble median over the past period 1951 2001 is 2 lower than the wfd era40 average 1242 mm most of the single annual values from the gcms average of driven rcms oscillate between 900 and 1600 mm while the ones from wfd era40 are between 900 and 1538 mm figs 4a and 4c illustrate the projections in the north and south of burundi during the historical period we also found outlying annual precipitation values above 1800 mm in the north and south of burundi projected by miroc5 regarding the annual mean near surface temperature according to the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 the cordex models ensemble median as well as wfd era40 show significant increasing trends additionally figs 4e and 4f show that not only the median but all cordex gcms average of driven rcms project steadily increasing temperatures during the past 3 2 climate projections in this section the changes in the long term annual and monthly mean precipitation and temperature under the rcps 4 5 and 8 5 and for the 30 year periods p1 2030 2059 and p2 2069 2098 with reference to the period p0 1970 1999 are reported in the context of temperature we report absolute anomalies while for precipitation we report relative changes 3 2 1 annual anomalies we found a similar spatial pattern of change in the long term annual average precipitation across all scenarios that divide the whole domain into two parts fig 5 the eastern and central northern regions showing positive anomalies and the western and central southern areas showing negative changes this gets translated into a generalized increase of precipitation in the north of burundi projected by the median of cordex models between 1 2 and 3 6 this is the range of weighted spatial mean for all scenario periods reaching higher values under rcp8 5 p2 up to 20 7 in the cell with center in 30 25 e 2 25 s and a mean decrease in the south by 1 1 to 3 with maximum values up to 13 4 in the southwest of burundi at 29 25 e 4 25 s see grid cells for the north south of burundi in fig a 2b and c the area of burundi at the north of lake tanganyika pixel with center in 29 25 e 2 75 s and in the cell with center in 29 75 e 3 25 s show a decrease of precipitation in rcp4 5 p2 and practically no change in rcp8 5 p1 the magnitude of change rises gradually from rcp4 5 p1 fig 5a to rcp 8 5 p2 see 5d and geographically the more to the northeast southwest of burundi the higher the absolute anomalies moreover the values projected by single models are between 48 9 and 43 5 the model cnrm cm5 cclm projects the minimum anomalies for precipitation in three of the scenarios while miroc5 rca4 and ec earth racmo are the models projecting the maximum positive changes in the long term the cordex multi model median projects a significant increasing trend p value 0 05 for annual precipitation after the mk test in the north of burundi under rcp8 5 fig 4b and a significant decreasing trend in the south under both rcps see 4c and d regarding temperature all cordex models agree on an increase in the long term annual 30 year average for all scenarios and periods between 1 8 c rcp4 5 p1 and 4 3 c rcp8 5 p2 over burundi see table 2b and spatial plots in figure a 4 the anomalies projected over burundi remain similar to the average change over the whole domain and do not vary significantly across the country maximum spatial variation 0 3 c moreover single models project minimum and maximum changes in single cells over burundi of 1 1 c rcp4 5 p1 and 5 9 c rcp8 5 p2 we also found significant rising trends p value 0 00 in the annual mean temperature projected by the median of the cordex ensemble over burundi according to the mk test see fig 4e and f during the historical period 1951 2005 and the future period 2006 2099 under both rcps 4 5 and 8 5 these trends result in an approximate increase of 2 7 c under rcp4 5 and 5 3 c under rcp8 5 by the end of 21st century compared to 1951 difference between the 5 year average from both time ends 3 2 2 monthly anomalies fig 6a shows the relative change in long term monthly average precipitation in north and south burundi according to the cordex ensemble median the precipitation in north burundi is very likely to increase during both rainy seasons november january and march april especially in rcp8 5 p2 up to 10 7 in april 13 4 in november and 18 7 in december cordex projects as well a robust increase during the dry season june august mostly in intermediate scenarios rcp 4 5 p2 or rcp8 5 p1 with significative magnitudes of rise up to 20 9 in august on the other side the cordex models median project a robust decrease of precipitation in february except in rcp8 5 p2 and september up to 23 2 in rcp8 5 p2 all the anomalies highlighted count with a very high agreement from the cordex models above 78 in most of the cases in south burundi the multi model median indicates a general decrease of precipitation along most of the year with some exceptions found from april to august in different scenario periods more robust and meaningful magnitudes of decrease are projected in december february with up to 13 5 in january may up to 21 and september october with up to 32 8 in september and 14 2 in october with the largest magnitudes found in rcp8 5 p2 on the other side the exceptions showing the most significant increments occur in july up to 5 in rcp4 5 p1 and august 18 8 in rcp4 5 p2 and 12 2 in rcp8 5 p1 regarding the long term monthly mean temperature there is a unified agreement from the cordex models in an increase in every single month scenario and period a lower increase is projected over the rainy months november april while a higher increase would take place during the dry season june september extended to may and october the multi model median lies between 1 3 c december rcp4 5 p1 and 5 2 c june rcp8 5 p2 3 3 hydrological processes 3 3 1 model evaluation in this section we report the results of the model performance at the daily and monthly time steps for the daily time step we show the model rate for the stations for which daily discharge was available and we could success with the calibration and validation in swim kag 308 and kag 290 for monthly mean discharges we show the model results for eight gauge stations see fig 1 six gauge stations located in krb one in mrb and another one in ltb at lake tanganyika basin no observed discharge data was available at the outlet of kivu lake see fig 1 and therefore only the calibration of small streams draining into the lake tanganyika was possible the station tan 81 was the only one for which the model evaluation was satisfactory within tanganyika basin for other stations measuring discharges flowing into tanganyika lake the resolution of the wfd era40 climate 0 5 x 0 5 together with the location of the gauge stations in headwater sub basins and the small magnitudes of discharge 10 20 m3 s routed by those sub basins made the calibration of swim not possible for the daily time step table 4 we consider our results for kag 308 and kag 290 satisfactory based on the results from the literature presented by moriasi et al 2007 but also on the visual comparison of observed and simulated streamflow fig a 5 thus it can be seen that swim represents well the daily dynamics for average flows for both stations however for the low and high flows we find considerable over underestimation in some years e g for high flows in 1982 1985 and 1989 therefore we also evaluated the model performance for extreme flows for kag 290 and kag 308 table 4 shows the pbias between the observed and simulated annual percentiles of discharge qx calculated over the calibration and validation periods we consider a good performance for those indicators if the pbias is below 25 condition fulfilled for all the percentiles q99 q95 q90 q10 q5 and q1 for the both stations hence we include the anomalies for these percentiles in the climate impact assessment section 3 3 3 for the monthly time step according to moriasi et al 2007 our results of the model performance see table 3b range from satisfactory 0 5 nse 0 65 15 pbias 25 and 0 5 rsr 0 6 to very good 0 75 nse 1 pbias 10 and 0 rsr 0 5 the plots showing the comparison of the observed and simulated monthly and seasonal mean discharges for the calibration and validation periods for each station can be found in the annex figs a 6 a 7 and a 8 in the monthly plots figs a 6 a 7 and a 8 it can be observed that swim simulates properly the flow dynamics in all stations and meet quite well the monthly high and low flows with exception of some peaks e g in 1982 in kag 262 kag 308 and kag 290 1973 in mal 38 or 1988 in tan 81 3 3 2 long term annual and monthly average discharge anomalies swim projects an increase in the long term annual average discharge fig 7a for most of the stations in the kagera river basin krb under both rcps and for both future periods according to the median of the simulations driven by cordex with exception of kag 308 station covering the streamflow from the mountainous area in central southern burundi that shows a decrease and kag 290 in rcp8 5 p1 showing no change the stations showing a greater increment in discharge are the ones located northwards of the study area according to the higher rise found for precipitation see section 3 2 1 the changes indicated by the median of the cordex models for each station in descending order are kag 298 which registers increases in the ndurumu river tributary of the ruvubu river ranging from 7 2 rcp8 5 p1 to nearly 44 rcp8 5 p2 kag 153 located in rwanda that shows increases going from 11 8 rcp4 5 p1 to 29 0 rcp8 5 p2 kag 205 that registers an increase from nearly 11 rcp4 5 p1 to 23 5 rcp8 5 p2 and kag 262 showing an increment between 6 8 rcp4 5 p1 and 16 6 rcp8 5 p2 additionally to these stations kag 290 which drains the main central part of burundi belonging to the ruvubu river basin shows positive anomalies reaching up to 15 rcp8 5 p2 with exception of rcp8 5 p1 scenario and period for which the median of the cordex models simulates practically no change with respect to the reference period for the station kag 308 in krb malagarasi river mal 38 and lake tanganyika basin tan 81 the median of the hydrological simulations shows a general decrease in annual discharges in all scenario and periods however not significative in some cases the drop in discharge ranges from nearly 0 to 8 6 rcp8 5 p1 in kag 308 and tan 81 and from 2 2 to 7 1 rcp4 5 p2 in mal 38 regarding the degree of confidence in the simulated sign of change the increases in discharge count with a higher agreement from the cordex models from 52 6 to 84 2 especially for rcp8 5 p2 from 73 6 to 84 2 while the drops in discharge count with a lower agreement between 52 6 and 57 9 in most of the cases for more details please see table a 3 fig 7b displays the anomalies in the seasonal discharge as it can be observed the increments found in the long term annual discharges in the stations in the krb are explained by increases taking place along most of the year with a couple of exceptions found in kag 262 and kag 290 in general it can be seen that such increments are more pronounced during the core months of the short and long rainy seasons december january march april and of lower magnitude in the short dry season february march and in october in the northward stations kag 153 and kag 262 we also find larger increases over the long dry season june september the range of the monthly mean anomalies for each station as indicated by the median of the cordex models over the scenario periods are kag 298 from 2 8 to 53 1 kag 153 approx from 3 2 to 46 5 kag 205 from 5 0 to 39 6 kag 290 from 3 1 to 27 7 and kag 262 from 1 4 to 24 3 thus we can see some decreases in the stations kag 290 from january to march in rcp4 5 p2 and kag 262 in february rcp8 5 p1 the anomalies found in rcp8 5 p2 are much higher than the ones found in the other three scenario periods especially during both rainy seasons and are between approximately 32 51 in kag 298 above 14 in kag 153 and kag 205 11 27 7 in kag 290 and 2 6 24 3 in kag 262 on the other hand the station kag 308 shows a general decrease of discharge across the year reaching values up to 16 8 february rcp8 5 p1 there are a few exceptions of increase in the rainy months reaching more significative magnitudes above 7 in april and may under the most extreme scenario ltb tan 81 shows negative anomalies throughout the whole year with only a couple of exceptions indicating no change or an increment of discharge under the moderate emissions scenario the magnitude of the drop in discharge is higher in january february and may under both scenarios and from june to october under rcp8 5 with up to 13 9 in february rcp8 5 p1 for malagarasi river draining the south eastern territory of burundi station mal 38 the median of the simulations driven by the cordex models indicates a general reduction of monthly mean discharge from january to october up to 16 and an increase in november december by 1 3 27 9 the magnitude of decrease would be higher in february and march in all scenario periods 3 3 3 climate impact on extreme daily discharges in this section we describe the anomalies for the two stations located within kagera river basin for which we had daily data and calibrated swim successfully kag 308 and kag 290 kag 308 is located upstream of kag 290 see fig 1 and it drains the streamflows from the mountainous area in central southern burundi while kag 290 registers the discharge from the main central part of burundi which corresponds to the ruvubu river basin 3 3 3 1 low flows the cordex ensemble median indicates a decrement in extreme low flows for kag 308 with exception of rcp4 5 p2 that shows increases for the three percentiles under analysis and rcp4 5 p1 that shows no significant change for q99 and q95 the decreases are especially noticeable under rcp8 5 with larger magnitudes found for lower percentiles up to roughly 18 for q90 at the end of the century for kag 290 we found a general increment in low flows however with anomalies very close to 0 for rcp8 5 p1 for the rest of the scenario periods the median of the simulations show an increase especially by the end of the century roughly above 19 and 22 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively nonetheless the range of the magnitudes of change reaches much larger values when considering the models individually with e g anomalies between 75 7 and 108 6 for kag 290 q99 and rcp8 5 p2 these and other values regarding the anomalies in low flows can be found in table a 4 3 3 3 2 high flows we found robust increases in extreme high discharges for all stations percentiles scenarios and periods except for two cases q10 in kag 308 for rcp4 5 p2 and rcp8 5 p1 see fig 8b the magnitude of the anomalies is larger for more extreme discharges except under rcp8 5 p2 where the median of cordex models is similar for all percentiles hereby we found median anomalies between 3 7 and 14 3 in kag 308 and between 2 8 and 25 4 in kag 290 table a 5 shows detailed information per station scenario period and percentile moreover the minimum and maximum anomalies indicated by specific cordex models for kag 308 are 34 1 and 87 6 both found in q1 and for kag 290 32 7 q5 and 86 25 q1 with all extreme values found in rcp8 5 p2 the confidence of the sign of the anomalies is higher for kag 290 than for kag 308 as well as for rcp4 5 p1 and rcp8 5 p2 compared to the intermediate scenario periods see table a 5 for more details 4 discussion and outlook 4 1 changes in near surface mean temperature and precipitation the cordex models show a faster warming over burundi than the global mean as it is already known for east africa osima et al 2018 the projections analyzed in this study are coherent with the observed increasing trends in annual and seasonal mean temperature found since 1980 in equatorial and southern parts of east africa and with the long term annual mean anomalies projected by an ensemble of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 models under rcp 8 5 niang et al 2015 high temperatures have been reported to be the cause of the stratification and consequent decrease in nutrient recharge and primary production dynamics in lake tanganyika over the last decades tierney et al 2010 they are also responsible of shorter periods for mosquito s incubation which increase the transmission of malaria main cause of mortality in pregnant women and children under five years in burundi baramburiye et al 2013 also poverty in rural areas of burundi is due among other factors to persistent droughts baramburiye et al 2013 therefore the severe increase of temperatures found in this study would very likely increase the vulnerability of burundians and impact the well being and likelihoods of people regarding precipitation the opposite signals of change found in the northern and southern territory of burundi have been also reported in other studies based on cordex endris et al 2019 osima et al 2018 this pattern which gets extended over east africa has been associated to a stronger and weaker el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod related rainfall anomaly over the eastern and southern parts of east africa respectively endris et al 2019 such spatial differences have not been detected in studies using only gcms haensler et al 2013 nile basin initiative 2018 which supports the use of cordex rcms as a valuable tool to obtain more accurate results in regional studies the increment of precipitation in the north of burundi would need especial attention in areas like bujumbura prone to landslides and severe flash floods nkunzimana et al 2019 in opposition to the general increase of precipitation in the north of burundi we also found a decrement of precipitation in february in both the north and south of the country this would mean a more severe dry period between both rainy seasons than in the past fact that would require to take action for adaptation for instance in the provinces of kirundo and muyinga which are located in the north of burundi and have suffered severe droughts causing people to migrate due to famine nkunzimana et al 2019 the decrease of precipitation found in the onset months of the rainy season september october in north and south burundi and in the offset may in the south together with the increase of temperatures projected from may to october imply a prolongation of the long dry season in burundi as it has been likewise reported for east africa wainwright et al 2019 such an effect has been already observed in the recent past and farmers have started to adapt by selecting shorter season crops baramburiye et al 2013 moreover the general decrement of rainfall throughout the whole year in south burundi especially from december to february would compromise the use of water resources and need for water allocation 4 2 anomalies in mean river discharge we found a general increase in the average river discharge in north burundi and a general decrease in south burundi that agree with the anomalies found for precipitation in this study as well as by kim et al 2021 the later concludes about the rise of seasonal mean and extreme runoff in the ruvubu river basin station kag 290 in this study as an effect of the intensification of the hydrological cycle based on the projections from two earth system models in the sixth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 the krb shows a strong response to the projected rise in precipitation in northern burundi with discharges more than folding the reported changes for precipitation in some stations e g annual average change up to 44 in kag 298 in rcp8 5 p2 in response to an increment in precipitation by 20 7 at the most northern cell falling within burundi this suggests an increase in extreme precipitation events in krb as reported by kim et al 2021 that may result in an increment of the runoff due to a reduction of the infiltration of precipitation into the soils moreover higher temperatures would have an effect on the condition of the soils inducing higher volume of surface runoff from precipitation on the other side our results indicate water stress in the stations draining the southern half of burundi with some exceptions in the south center kag 308 and south east mal 38 of burundi in the long and short rainy seasons respectively here the magnitudes of change in discharge keep a direct relation with the changes in precipitation with for instance a maximum decrease of 13 9 in tan 81 in response to a drop in precipitation of 13 4 moreover discharge simulations based on single cordex models indicate higher magnitudes of change than the multi model median therefore such ranges of change should be considered when planning the management of water resources and adaptation strategies designed to combat climate change other factors like the high population density and high growth rate should be also taken into account since these may outweigh the potential higher water availability in burundi in the long term due to the expected increase in food demand and the inter annual variability of river discharge studies about the construction of weirs or small dams that could support crop irrigation during the onset and offset of the rainy season or in case of rainfall failure should be conducted in addition in order to prevent possible upstream downstream conflicts and to preserve the health of ecosystems in terms of structure and functioning the potential impacts should be previously explored 4 3 anomalies in extreme river discharge our simulations show substantial increases in extreme high flows in two stations within krb kag 308 located in the southern half of burundi and registering flows from the burundian montaneous area except for q10 and kag 290 which registers the flows of the ruvubu river basin and is located downstream of kag 308 for the extreme low flows the cordex models indicate a robust increase in kag 290 more significant in the far future and different signs of change in kag 308 an increase in rcp4 5 p2 and a decrease under rcp8 5 burundi has been prone to deadly river floods and landslides in the past especially in the capital city of bujumbura and its rural surroundings examples are the 2006 2014 and 2016 17 events em dat 2018 nkunzimana et al 2019 where hundreds of people were affected and many lives were lost the increase found in extreme high flows within ruvubu basin agree with the results of kim et al 2021 and implies a higher risk of flash floods and landslides in the main part of burundi in the future em dat 2018 such results could also involve bujumbura city and bujumbura rural provinces however due to the lack of daily discharge data we could not explore the extremes in discharge in the northern region of ltb in this regard thiery et al 2016 found that lake victoria and lake tanganyika are projected to be a hotspot of future extreme precipitation intensification over night which suggests that our results on extreme high flows could be extended to bujumbura region 4 4 uncertainties and limitations in order to reduce the error of the cordex data and the associated uncertainties due to the propagation of such error along the modeling chain in the current study we adjusted the bias of the models based on wfd era40 however the application of the parametrization done with the isimip ba method based on the projections in the reference period to the future projections imply some uncertainties that could play a role in the associated impacts following the swim model was calibrated at the daily and monthly time steps for different stations based on wfd era40 however we could not calibrate the discharge for gauge stations draining catchments of small size e g in ltb for other gauge stations than tan 81 probably due to the coarse resolution of wfd era40 climate data with higher resolution would help to better represent the climate in regions with such a complex topography like burundi and therefore to obtain more accurate results however when performing this study other datasets did not offer data prior to 1979 while wfd era40 data covered the full period required for the calibration and validation of swim according to the timeframe of the observations 1970 1999 regarding the resolution of the rcms used in this study the cordex provides nowadays climate data at 0 22 degree resolution however only for a few models and random rcps this is a common problem that could be solved through the fulfillment of the models matrix nikulin et al 2018 which would allow the application of climate projections with higher resolution for climate impact assessments and thus to obtain more accurate results another source of uncertainty in the results of this study could be the length and quality of the time series used for the calibration of swim the acquisition of discharge data for hydrological studies in african countries is a common problem in the case of burundi a civil war took place from 1993 to 2005 nantulya 2015 this is probably the reason why most of the provided time series ended in 1993 94 additionally we only could obtain daily data for three stations within krb therefore the calibration of swim was constraint to the availability of discharge data besides the data limitation the quality of the calibration of the hydrological model is another source of uncertainty in climate impact studies nonetheless they have been shown to contribute the least to the uncertainty of projected changes in mean and high flows in several studies vetter et al 2017 in this respect the swim represented properly the flow dynamics however it did not capture properly all the peaks and base flows existing in the observations therefore the results on streamflows should be treated with caution for the stations and quantiles presenting a large bias in comparison to observed data e g q99 in kag 308 likewise we acknowledge existing uncertainties in the sign of change projected by the different models with results becoming more spread towards rcp8 5 and at the end of the 21st century however on the other side we have also found a robust consensus from the cordex models on the sign of the projected changes for the hydro climatic variables here explored to summarize despite the uncertainties inherent to the modeling chain we have shown our results to be coherent with the observed trends and future projections reported in the literature which show the robustness of the methods and conclusions of this study 5 conclusion people highly dependent on weather patterns to make their living are more vulnerable to the effects from anthropogenic climate change and are in urgent need to cope with the outcome yet the information derived from impact studies is not always available or is less detailed than required identifying the potential impacts of climate change is important to implement adaptation actions addressed to reduce adverse consequences in this study we have contributed to filling the gap about the potential hydro climatic changes to be expected in the future over burundi by using a set of the state of the art bias adjusted cordex rcms and the eco hydrological model swim under two climate scenarios and for two future periods in the 21st century a warmer climate decreasing precipitation at the offset of the rainy season in north burundi and along most of the year in south burundi have been projected by the cordex climate models for burundi s future such changes pose a high risk to the agricultural production on which 90 of the population depends the history has shown that famine malnutrition mortality and related migration among others are direct consequences of such climate events on the other side increasing precipitation has been projected in north burundi throughout most of the year and in some exceptional months for some scenario periods in south burundi soil water conservation techniques and rainfall storage could be used to overcome some of the negative consequences from a warmer future climate nonetheless it should be kept in mind that under a high emission scenario difficulties to adapt will increase dramatically an increase in mean and extreme streamflow has been found in the northern and central part of burundi ruvubu basin while in the south a reduction of discharge would very likely take place along the year with exception of an increment in some rainy months these changes call urgently for an effective management of water resources which may help to mitigate harmful effects of climate warming while promoting livelihoods and human development in burundi in the south a better management could help to benefit from the rainfall fallen during the rainy season and balance the reduction of discharge during the rest of the year despite the inherent uncertainties of this study we have shown that the future anomalies found in the hydro meteorological indicators analyzed are robust and coherent between them and with other scientific work hence our results are useful for policy makers in the water and related sectors such as agriculture or energy the uncertainties should be treated carefully as should other socioeconomic factors such as population growth or land use changes be taken under consideration when planning water

7932,study region burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world and hence very vulnerable to climate change it is covered by the kagera malagarasi and tanganyika river basins study focus we investigated the hydro climatic impacts of climate change over burundi projected by an ensemble of 19 regional climate models and an eco hydrological model in two future periods under the rcps 4 5 and 8 5 new hydro climatic insights we found a robust increase in annual and seasonal average temperature over burundi in all scenarios characterized by a significant annual rising trend along the 21st century and the increase in every single month especially in the dry season up to 5 2 c under rcp8 5 p2 precipitation would increase in the north except in february and september in the south precipitation would decrease throughout the year particularly in the onset and offset of the rainy season and from december to february this would entail the prolongation and severity of the long and short dry periods these changes generate increases in the long term annual mean discharges in north burundi up to 44 in small catchments and 29 in larger ones in southern burundi the discharge would decrease along the year up to 16 8 with exception of november december in the southeast up to 27 9 besides the higher daily extreme river discharges found over the ruvubu basin imply a higher risk of

does not affect all people equally existing and new risks induced by climate change are generally greater for disadvantaged people ipcc 2014 like those facing poverty and food insecurity burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world with about 65 of the population living below the poverty line fao un 2020 importantly the country suffers from alarming food insecurity almost one in two households around 4 6 million people are food insecure ifrc 2019 and about 56 of children suffer from chronic malnutrition there is very limited access to water and sanitation and less than 12 of the population has access to electricity world bank 2022 most of burundians 90 rely on subsistence agriculture fao un 2020 which counts barely with irrigation niyongabo 2018 and is insufficient to cover household demand burundi has sufficient rainfall with an annual average ranging from 700 to 2000 mm year however its distribution is uneven in space and time and due to its high population density the country is experiencing increasing pressure on water soil and land resources global water partnership 2011 additionally conflict for land emerges since the economic policy does not allow for the equitable distribution of resources kamungi et al 2005 the high dependence of burundians on agriculture makes them extremely sensitive to climate variability and extremes nationwide famines recorded in the 20th century and regionally in 1989 1990 2000 2005 and 2008 2010 were the results of extremely dry weather events fao un 2016 moreover many people were affected by heavy rains strong winds floods and related landslides along the period 1989 2015 world bank 2022 recently in 2015 2016 about 90 000 people were affected by el niño heavy rains strong winds followed by la niña late irregular and insufficient rainfall these events led to conflicts and internal displacements due to food insecurity in 2019 almost 80 of the displacements within burundi were caused by natural disasters iom 2019 over the 21st century temperature is projected to globally rise as well as the frequency and severity of extreme weather events ipcc 2014 with africa likely being the most affected continent niang et al 2015 therefore due to burundi s high vulnerability and dependence on climate variability it is very important to provide detailed information about the potential impacts of climate change to enhance adaptation options and preparedness ipcc 2014 in addition the sustainable development goals sdgs highlight the need to end poverty in all forms and dimensions by 2030 which involves targeting the most vulnerable and supporting communities affected by climate related disasters to reach this goal developing countries must prepare to cope with the impacts of climate change and manage their water resources efficiently which is key for guaranteeing food resources and human security there is little information about the hydrological impacts of climate change in burundi previous research within the white nile river has paid high attention to lake victoria sene et al 2001 phoon et al 2004 due to its socioeconomic importance as a source of drinking water such studies relate mainly to the change in precipitation over the lake thiery et al 2015 2016 its water level tungaraza et al 2012 or the stratification tierney et al 2010 yet information about the responses in upstream basins as represented by burundi s network is scarce kim et al 2021 ogiramoi nyeko 2011 one reason could be the difficulty to model this area due to the multiple swamps and high evaporation di baldassarre et al 2011 moreover the lack of investment in burundi due to the violence and conflict in the country since its independence in 1962 kamungi et al 2005 has probably contributed to the research gap in this region information about climate projections in burundi can be only found in few publications baramburiye et al 2013 kim et al 2021 or extracted from regional maps that illustrate such in central east africa endris et al 2013 2019 nikulin et al 2012 hence lacking accuracy despite the existence of a few national plans for adaptation to climate change napa 2007 the information about climate change impacts is not very detailed climate impact assessments on hydrology normally use atmosphere ocean general circulation models so called global climate models gcms and regional climate models rcms rcms have been proved to add value to the projections from gcms by reflecting the effects of local topographic or land feedback with the atmosphere that gcms are not able to capture due to their lower spatial resolution giorgi et al 2009 souverijns et al 2016 found that 77 of the drivers of future precipitation over east africa can be explained by local or mesoscale feedback and changes in moisture influx while 23 can be explained by the frequency of occurrence of circulation patterns even some rcms have been found to derive different climate signs in projected precipitation than their driving gcms due to their better representation of physical processes e g saeed et al 2004 dosio et al 2019 the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment initiative cordex provides high resolution regional climate projections endris et al 2013 based on a set of global model simulations in support of the ipcc fifth assessment report giorgi et al 2009 the ability of the cordex models to reproduce the characteristics of rainfall patterns at different scales over africa as well as the influence of the large scale climate circulation patterns on regional rainfall teleconnections has been proven in several studies endris et al 2013 2016 nikulin et al 2012 therefore given the added value of rcms over gcms and the ability of the cordex rcms to represent the climate in africa at a finer scale the models from the cordex initiative have been used in this study as input to a semi distributed eco hydrological model to assess future changes in river discharge and water availability in burundi to provide more insights on climate change impacts in burundi we 1 evaluated the representation of temperature and precipitation by bias adjusted cordex projections 2 analyzed the future variation and spatial distribution of average climate variables and 3 investigated the impact of climate change projections on average and extreme flow regimes in three river basins additionally with this study we intent to provide potential recommendations that may help environmental managers and policy makers to develop tools to adapt to anthropogenic climate change in burundi 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area burundi is a landlocked country in east africa covering an area of 27 834 km2 fig 1 it is located south of the equator between the latitudes 1 19 s and 4 27 s and the longitudes 29 00 e and 30 51 e the country in the heart of africa s great rift valley presents a diverse topography characterized by five zones these are the western plain 775 1000 m a s l which contains lake ruzizi its wetlands and lake tanganyika the mountain range crête congo nile that crosses the central western area from north to south with altitudes reaching 2670 m a s l mount heha the central meseta 1400 2000 m a s l the depression of kumoso in the south east 1200 1400 m a s l and the depression of bugesera in the north east 1200 1500 m a s l to better analyze and explain spatial differences of climate change in burundi the region was split in the following domains eastern 30 0 e 31 0 e 2 5 s 4 0 s western 29 0 e 30 0 e 2 5 s 4 0 s northern 29 5 e 31 0 e 2 0 s 3 5 s and 29 0 e 29 5 e 2 5 3 0 s and southern 29 0 e 30 5 e 3 5 s 4 5 s and 29 0 e 29 5 e 3 0 s 3 5 s which are shown in fig a 2d b and c 2 1 1 climate the climatology in the country follows a bimodal pattern with a dry season from june to september and a rainy season from september to may however due to the movement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz the wet season is formed by the short rains period that goes from september to december the long rains period from mid february or march to may and a short dry season with frequent dry spells in between icpac 2009 nkunzimana et al 2019 besides the variability of the precipitation and temperature in burundi is strongly related to the altitude napa 2007 nkunzimana et al 2019 consequently the congo nile mountain range receives the highest rainfall amounts between 1500 and 2000 mm and experiences the lowest mean temperatures of 14 15 c in the oriental plains bugesera and kumoso annual rainfall ranges between 750 and 1250 mm and annual mean temperatures between 20 and 22 c in the occidental plain imbo plain annual mean precipitation values are between 800 and 950 mm with annual mean temperatures above 23 c in the occidental escarpment of mumirwa precipitation values range from 1000 to 1400 mm per year and annual mean temperatures between 18 and 28 c whereas in the central high plains the annual average precipitation ranges between 1200 and 1500 mm and the annual mean temperature is between 17 and 20 c sunzu ntigambirizwa and ngenzebuhoro 2009 2 1 2 hydrology the rivers of burundi fig 1 belong to three main basins the tanganyika kagera and malagarasi river basins at the same time the kagera river belongs to the nile basin while the other two belong to the congo basin region the a kanyaru river flows along the northern border of burundi with rwanda where it joins the nyabarongo river rwanda the ruvubu river drains the central part of burundi and converges into the nyabarongo river at the rusumu falls where the kagera river starts the ruzizi river which flows along the d r congo rwanda burundi border and drains into lake tanganyika and the malagarasi river south east burundi belong to the congo river basin all the burundian river basins are trans boundary 2 1 3 population burundi has 11 89 million inhabitants and counts with one of the highest population densities 413 inhab km2 and growth rates 3 1 in the world world bank 2022 the population distribution is very diverse across the country and ranges between 20 and 8500 inhab km2 the latest is given in the capital city bujumbura 1 1 https en wikipedia org wiki bujumbura 2 1 4 agriculture burundi s economy relies heavily on the agricultural sector which despite the scarce arable land employs 80 of the population 90 of the population depends directly or indirectly on this sector which is mainly rain fed baramburiye et al 2013 2 2 climate data 2 2 1 watch forcing data era 40 daily meteorological data precipitation minimum mean and maximum temperature solar radiation and relative air humidity on a half a degree grid from the integrated project water and global change watch were used as reference 1970 1999 to adjust the bias of the cordex models see section 2 2 3 1 and to calibrate and validate the eco hydrological model as described by weedon et al 2011 watch forcing data wfd was created for 1958 2001 based on the 40 year ecmwf re analysis product era 40 to be used with land surface and hydrological models the wfd era40 data were interpolated bilinearly to 0 5 resolution corrected by elevation and monthly observations of temperature and cloud cover from the climatic research unit cru and precipitation from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc combined with adjustments for atmospheric aerosol loading and precipitation gauge corrections for rainfall and snowfall 2 2 1 1 performance of wfd era40 the performance of wfd era40 was evaluated based on observed meteorological data from 18 stations across burundi for seasonal precipitation and near surface mean temperature in the reference period p0 1970 1999 due to the differences in precipitation and temperature patterns in eastern and western burundi fig a 2d the evaluation was performed for both regions separately section 3 1 1 after filling the missing data in the observations see section 2 2 2 for more information the meteorological data were interpolated at half degree resolution by applying the inverse distance weight idw method to be compared with wfd era40 we accounted for the elevation along the crête congo nile mountain range by specifying a break line within the idw interpolation 2 2 2 observation data observed climate data served to check the reliability of wfd era40 see section 3 1 1 observed data for precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature were provided for 17 stations within burundi for 1970 2010 by igebu geographic institute of burundi via giz deutsche gesellschaft für internationale zusammenarbeit we also found meteorological data from igebu published on internet simone et al 2007 and selected precipitation minimum and maximum temperature for kinyinya station located in the south east of burundi where we had scarce information the observations were not complete so we filled manually the missing daily data by averaging values from adjacent days when possible we found years with less than 200 observed daily data and months with less than 15 dis continuous daily time steps that we had to discard table a 1 shows the percentage of missing data in each station for precipitation minimum and maximum temperature more than 70 of the stations show less than 25 missing data 2 2 3 cordex as climate projections we used in total 19 combinations of 10 driving gcms and 5 rcms from the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex 2 2 https cordex org for the africa cordex domain at a resolution of 0 44 degree afr 44 in this study table 1 summarizes the 19 gcm rcms combinations our study focuses on two greenhouse gas concentration scenarios the representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 the lower end concentration scenario rcp 2 6 was excluded due to the insufficient number of available projections when performing this study 2 2 3 1 bias adjustment of the cordex models in order to avoid the propagation of the uncertainty error from the climate models across the impacts modeling chain all climate projections were bias adjusted prior to run the eco hydrological model for it we used the inter sectoral inter model intercomparison project isimip www isimip org isimip3ba method lange 2019 as reference observation dataset and period for the bias adjustment we used wfd era40 and 1970 1999 for this task the cordex data were remapped to a half degree resolution geographic grid likewise wfd era40 the isimip3ba bias adjustment method is a quantile mapping method that fits the cumulative distribution function of the target data it is specifically tailored to reduce the bias in the tails of the distribution i e extremes while it preserves the trends in each quantile the bias adjustment was applied separately univariate to the variables needed for the hydrological model precipitation prec temperature tas relative humidity hurs and solar radiation rsds for the maximum tasmax and minimum tasmin temperature the isimip3ba method derives new values from the bias adjusted temperature its range and skewness whenever needed we converted the calendars of the cordex models to proleptic gregorian using linear regression of neighboring dates 2 2 4 climate scenarios the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 meinshausen 2011 moss et al 2010 were used to explore the change of meteorological variables in two 30 year periods in the 21st century p1 2030 2059 and p2 2069 2098 with reference to the historical period p0 1970 1999 the rcp 4 5 represents a medium low global anthropogenic radiative forcing that gets stabilized whereas the rcp 8 5 represents high radiative forcing as a result of increasing greenhouse gas emissions over time these two scenarios allow exploring the impacts of a warming world by providing a wide climate range that includes a soft mitigation scenario rcp 4 5 and the so called business as usual or unlikely worst case scenario rcp 8 5 the far future 30 year period was constraint to 2098 by the hadgem2 es model that provides simulation data until november 2099 for some combinations of rcms rcps 2 3 data for hydrological modeling the data used to set up calibrate and validate the hydrological model are a digital elevation model dem with 3 arc second resolution about 90 m at the equator from the nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm jarvis et al 2008 a soil map merged obtained from two sources the harmonized world soil database v1 2 fischer et al 2008 which is a 30 arc second raster database and a more detailed map from the soil and terrain database of central africa sotercaf version 1 0 compiled for the democratic republic of congo rwanda and burundi counting with 20 soil profiles for burundi van engelen et al 2006 a land use map downloaded from the africover project from the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao called multipurpose landcover database for burundi at scales 1 250000 and 1 1 million kalensky 1998 counting with until 117 land cover classifiers later reclassified into the 15 land cover classes supported by the swim wfd era40 climate dataset described in section 2 2 1 and daily monthly observed discharge data for eight gauging stations obtained from igebu and the global runoff data centre grdc 3 3 http www bafg de grdc en home homepage node html for the evaluation of the performance of the hydrological model section 3 3 1 2 4 hydrological model the soil and water integrated model swim is a semi distributed eco hydrological model developed at the potsdam institute for climate impact research pik based on the previously developed models swat arnold et al 1993 and matsalu krysanova et al 1989 it operates on a daily time step and uses a 3 level dis aggregation scheme basin subbasin hydrotope or hydrological response unit hru defined as the smallest unit that belongs to the same subbasin characterized by the same soil and land use type and therefore presenting the same hydrologic behavior additional information about swim its characteristics applications and performance can be found in krysanova et al 1998 2015 swim was set up independently for the three river basins within burundi kagera river basin krb malagarasi river basin mrb and lake tanganyika basin ltb the minimum sub basin area was 50 km2 swim driven by wfd era40 was calibrated and validated with daily and monthly river discharge according to the available observed discharge data for eight gauge stations fig 1 under different time frames see table 3 the calibration was performed manually in a first step and then optimized using the automated algorithm pest 4 4 http www pesthomepage org a software for model independent parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis the representation of small lakes and wetlands was included indirectly within the parametrization of the model through e g higher delay applied to sub surface and groundwater flow or the correction of the saturated conductivity and curve number of the soils the performance of discharge simulations was evaluated using three common indicators the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the percent bias pbias and the ratio of the root mean square error rmse to the standard deviation of the observations rsr moriasi et al 2007 2 5 indicators of climate change we used the following indicators for the evaluation of the hydro meteorological impacts of climate change in burundi long term annual and monthly mean precipitation and near surface temperature over burundi long term annual and monthly mean river discharge calculated as the 30 year averages of daily sums daily low q90 q95 and q99 and high q10 q5 and q1 flows over 30 year periods q10 is the discharge that is equaled or exceeded 10 of the flow record idem for the rest 2 5 1 averages the climatic changes over burundi were computed as the fractional percent coverage by multiplying the 0 5 gridded climate data by a mask 5 5 https gitlab pik potsdam de isipedia countrymasks blob master countrymasks fractional nc indicating the area percentage covered by the country for each grid cell see fig a 2a obtained from isimip averages over the full domain are calculated over the rectangle covering the area between 28 0 e 5 5 s and 32 0 e 1 0 s for the comparison of wfd era40 with observed data we calculated the long term monthly mean averages for the east and west of burundi fig a 2d while the anomalies in the future were calculated as the fractional coverage over the northern fig a 2b and southern fig a 2c regions of burundi such domains were defined by the pixels indicating opposite sign of change 3 results 3 1 past climate 3 1 1 past climate represented by wfd era40 in this section we analyze how long term annual mean temperature and precipitation are represented by wfd era40 over burundi in the reference period p0 1970 1999 compared to the observations the spatial distribution and value ranges indicated by wfd era40 agree with the climate described in national reports sunzu ntigambirizwa and ngenzebuhoro 2009 and with observed meteorological data the correlation of seasonal mean precipitation and temperature for east and west burundi between wfd era40 and observed meteorological data shows a very good fit with r2 above 0 99 fig 2 wfd era40 indicates slight deviations from the observations for seasonal mean precipitation during the rainy season december february in west burundi and in march and april in the east on the other side wfd era40 overestimates mean air temperature by less than 0 4 c in west burundi and about 1 c or less in the eastern part these differences could probably be due to the interpolation applied to the observed data since the idw method does not take into account for the elevation of the stations despite some differences due to the good fit of the long term monthly mean temperature and precipitation data its temporal continuity and the availability of more climate variables than in the observed data wfd era40 was used as meteorological input to calibrate and validate swim and to adjust the bias of the cordex projections with reference to p0 1970 1999 3 1 2 past climate represented by cordex the cumulative distribution function cdf of daily precipitation and temperature values simulated by 19 cordex models before and after adjusting the bias to wfd era40 in 1970 1999 with the isimip3ba method see section 2 2 3 can be seen in fig 3 a significant improvement can be observed in the distribution of the daily precipitation in the cordex data after bias adjustment cordex ba fig 3a like for instance in the lower and higher tails of the distribution the number of dry days in cordex ba has increased from 40 to 48 similarly than in wfd era40 47 and the maximum precipitation value has decreased from 301 mm to 171 mm in cordex ba idem for temperature fig 3b shows that most of the cordex models underestimated daily mean values in comparison to wfd era40 before the ba whereas the new distribution of the cordex values after ba fits very good the one from wfd era40 in the long term and after the bias adjustment the monthly average precipitation and temperature of the cordex climate data fits perfectly the values from wfd era40 see after and previous bias correction in figs 2 and a 3 respectively regarding the annual values after the ba the average of the annual total precipitation shown by the cordex ensemble median over the past period 1951 2001 is 2 lower than the wfd era40 average 1242 mm most of the single annual values from the gcms average of driven rcms oscillate between 900 and 1600 mm while the ones from wfd era40 are between 900 and 1538 mm figs 4a and 4c illustrate the projections in the north and south of burundi during the historical period we also found outlying annual precipitation values above 1800 mm in the north and south of burundi projected by miroc5 regarding the annual mean near surface temperature according to the mann kendall mk test mann 1945 the cordex models ensemble median as well as wfd era40 show significant increasing trends additionally figs 4e and 4f show that not only the median but all cordex gcms average of driven rcms project steadily increasing temperatures during the past 3 2 climate projections in this section the changes in the long term annual and monthly mean precipitation and temperature under the rcps 4 5 and 8 5 and for the 30 year periods p1 2030 2059 and p2 2069 2098 with reference to the period p0 1970 1999 are reported in the context of temperature we report absolute anomalies while for precipitation we report relative changes 3 2 1 annual anomalies we found a similar spatial pattern of change in the long term annual average precipitation across all scenarios that divide the whole domain into two parts fig 5 the eastern and central northern regions showing positive anomalies and the western and central southern areas showing negative changes this gets translated into a generalized increase of precipitation in the north of burundi projected by the median of cordex models between 1 2 and 3 6 this is the range of weighted spatial mean for all scenario periods reaching higher values under rcp8 5 p2 up to 20 7 in the cell with center in 30 25 e 2 25 s and a mean decrease in the south by 1 1 to 3 with maximum values up to 13 4 in the southwest of burundi at 29 25 e 4 25 s see grid cells for the north south of burundi in fig a 2b and c the area of burundi at the north of lake tanganyika pixel with center in 29 25 e 2 75 s and in the cell with center in 29 75 e 3 25 s show a decrease of precipitation in rcp4 5 p2 and practically no change in rcp8 5 p1 the magnitude of change rises gradually from rcp4 5 p1 fig 5a to rcp 8 5 p2 see 5d and geographically the more to the northeast southwest of burundi the higher the absolute anomalies moreover the values projected by single models are between 48 9 and 43 5 the model cnrm cm5 cclm projects the minimum anomalies for precipitation in three of the scenarios while miroc5 rca4 and ec earth racmo are the models projecting the maximum positive changes in the long term the cordex multi model median projects a significant increasing trend p value 0 05 for annual precipitation after the mk test in the north of burundi under rcp8 5 fig 4b and a significant decreasing trend in the south under both rcps see 4c and d regarding temperature all cordex models agree on an increase in the long term annual 30 year average for all scenarios and periods between 1 8 c rcp4 5 p1 and 4 3 c rcp8 5 p2 over burundi see table 2b and spatial plots in figure a 4 the anomalies projected over burundi remain similar to the average change over the whole domain and do not vary significantly across the country maximum spatial variation 0 3 c moreover single models project minimum and maximum changes in single cells over burundi of 1 1 c rcp4 5 p1 and 5 9 c rcp8 5 p2 we also found significant rising trends p value 0 00 in the annual mean temperature projected by the median of the cordex ensemble over burundi according to the mk test see fig 4e and f during the historical period 1951 2005 and the future period 2006 2099 under both rcps 4 5 and 8 5 these trends result in an approximate increase of 2 7 c under rcp4 5 and 5 3 c under rcp8 5 by the end of 21st century compared to 1951 difference between the 5 year average from both time ends 3 2 2 monthly anomalies fig 6a shows the relative change in long term monthly average precipitation in north and south burundi according to the cordex ensemble median the precipitation in north burundi is very likely to increase during both rainy seasons november january and march april especially in rcp8 5 p2 up to 10 7 in april 13 4 in november and 18 7 in december cordex projects as well a robust increase during the dry season june august mostly in intermediate scenarios rcp 4 5 p2 or rcp8 5 p1 with significative magnitudes of rise up to 20 9 in august on the other side the cordex models median project a robust decrease of precipitation in february except in rcp8 5 p2 and september up to 23 2 in rcp8 5 p2 all the anomalies highlighted count with a very high agreement from the cordex models above 78 in most of the cases in south burundi the multi model median indicates a general decrease of precipitation along most of the year with some exceptions found from april to august in different scenario periods more robust and meaningful magnitudes of decrease are projected in december february with up to 13 5 in january may up to 21 and september october with up to 32 8 in september and 14 2 in october with the largest magnitudes found in rcp8 5 p2 on the other side the exceptions showing the most significant increments occur in july up to 5 in rcp4 5 p1 and august 18 8 in rcp4 5 p2 and 12 2 in rcp8 5 p1 regarding the long term monthly mean temperature there is a unified agreement from the cordex models in an increase in every single month scenario and period a lower increase is projected over the rainy months november april while a higher increase would take place during the dry season june september extended to may and october the multi model median lies between 1 3 c december rcp4 5 p1 and 5 2 c june rcp8 5 p2 3 3 hydrological processes 3 3 1 model evaluation in this section we report the results of the model performance at the daily and monthly time steps for the daily time step we show the model rate for the stations for which daily discharge was available and we could success with the calibration and validation in swim kag 308 and kag 290 for monthly mean discharges we show the model results for eight gauge stations see fig 1 six gauge stations located in krb one in mrb and another one in ltb at lake tanganyika basin no observed discharge data was available at the outlet of kivu lake see fig 1 and therefore only the calibration of small streams draining into the lake tanganyika was possible the station tan 81 was the only one for which the model evaluation was satisfactory within tanganyika basin for other stations measuring discharges flowing into tanganyika lake the resolution of the wfd era40 climate 0 5 x 0 5 together with the location of the gauge stations in headwater sub basins and the small magnitudes of discharge 10 20 m3 s routed by those sub basins made the calibration of swim not possible for the daily time step table 4 we consider our results for kag 308 and kag 290 satisfactory based on the results from the literature presented by moriasi et al 2007 but also on the visual comparison of observed and simulated streamflow fig a 5 thus it can be seen that swim represents well the daily dynamics for average flows for both stations however for the low and high flows we find considerable over underestimation in some years e g for high flows in 1982 1985 and 1989 therefore we also evaluated the model performance for extreme flows for kag 290 and kag 308 table 4 shows the pbias between the observed and simulated annual percentiles of discharge qx calculated over the calibration and validation periods we consider a good performance for those indicators if the pbias is below 25 condition fulfilled for all the percentiles q99 q95 q90 q10 q5 and q1 for the both stations hence we include the anomalies for these percentiles in the climate impact assessment section 3 3 3 for the monthly time step according to moriasi et al 2007 our results of the model performance see table 3b range from satisfactory 0 5 nse 0 65 15 pbias 25 and 0 5 rsr 0 6 to very good 0 75 nse 1 pbias 10 and 0 rsr 0 5 the plots showing the comparison of the observed and simulated monthly and seasonal mean discharges for the calibration and validation periods for each station can be found in the annex figs a 6 a 7 and a 8 in the monthly plots figs a 6 a 7 and a 8 it can be observed that swim simulates properly the flow dynamics in all stations and meet quite well the monthly high and low flows with exception of some peaks e g in 1982 in kag 262 kag 308 and kag 290 1973 in mal 38 or 1988 in tan 81 3 3 2 long term annual and monthly average discharge anomalies swim projects an increase in the long term annual average discharge fig 7a for most of the stations in the kagera river basin krb under both rcps and for both future periods according to the median of the simulations driven by cordex with exception of kag 308 station covering the streamflow from the mountainous area in central southern burundi that shows a decrease and kag 290 in rcp8 5 p1 showing no change the stations showing a greater increment in discharge are the ones located northwards of the study area according to the higher rise found for precipitation see section 3 2 1 the changes indicated by the median of the cordex models for each station in descending order are kag 298 which registers increases in the ndurumu river tributary of the ruvubu river ranging from 7 2 rcp8 5 p1 to nearly 44 rcp8 5 p2 kag 153 located in rwanda that shows increases going from 11 8 rcp4 5 p1 to 29 0 rcp8 5 p2 kag 205 that registers an increase from nearly 11 rcp4 5 p1 to 23 5 rcp8 5 p2 and kag 262 showing an increment between 6 8 rcp4 5 p1 and 16 6 rcp8 5 p2 additionally to these stations kag 290 which drains the main central part of burundi belonging to the ruvubu river basin shows positive anomalies reaching up to 15 rcp8 5 p2 with exception of rcp8 5 p1 scenario and period for which the median of the cordex models simulates practically no change with respect to the reference period for the station kag 308 in krb malagarasi river mal 38 and lake tanganyika basin tan 81 the median of the hydrological simulations shows a general decrease in annual discharges in all scenario and periods however not significative in some cases the drop in discharge ranges from nearly 0 to 8 6 rcp8 5 p1 in kag 308 and tan 81 and from 2 2 to 7 1 rcp4 5 p2 in mal 38 regarding the degree of confidence in the simulated sign of change the increases in discharge count with a higher agreement from the cordex models from 52 6 to 84 2 especially for rcp8 5 p2 from 73 6 to 84 2 while the drops in discharge count with a lower agreement between 52 6 and 57 9 in most of the cases for more details please see table a 3 fig 7b displays the anomalies in the seasonal discharge as it can be observed the increments found in the long term annual discharges in the stations in the krb are explained by increases taking place along most of the year with a couple of exceptions found in kag 262 and kag 290 in general it can be seen that such increments are more pronounced during the core months of the short and long rainy seasons december january march april and of lower magnitude in the short dry season february march and in october in the northward stations kag 153 and kag 262 we also find larger increases over the long dry season june september the range of the monthly mean anomalies for each station as indicated by the median of the cordex models over the scenario periods are kag 298 from 2 8 to 53 1 kag 153 approx from 3 2 to 46 5 kag 205 from 5 0 to 39 6 kag 290 from 3 1 to 27 7 and kag 262 from 1 4 to 24 3 thus we can see some decreases in the stations kag 290 from january to march in rcp4 5 p2 and kag 262 in february rcp8 5 p1 the anomalies found in rcp8 5 p2 are much higher than the ones found in the other three scenario periods especially during both rainy seasons and are between approximately 32 51 in kag 298 above 14 in kag 153 and kag 205 11 27 7 in kag 290 and 2 6 24 3 in kag 262 on the other hand the station kag 308 shows a general decrease of discharge across the year reaching values up to 16 8 february rcp8 5 p1 there are a few exceptions of increase in the rainy months reaching more significative magnitudes above 7 in april and may under the most extreme scenario ltb tan 81 shows negative anomalies throughout the whole year with only a couple of exceptions indicating no change or an increment of discharge under the moderate emissions scenario the magnitude of the drop in discharge is higher in january february and may under both scenarios and from june to october under rcp8 5 with up to 13 9 in february rcp8 5 p1 for malagarasi river draining the south eastern territory of burundi station mal 38 the median of the simulations driven by the cordex models indicates a general reduction of monthly mean discharge from january to october up to 16 and an increase in november december by 1 3 27 9 the magnitude of decrease would be higher in february and march in all scenario periods 3 3 3 climate impact on extreme daily discharges in this section we describe the anomalies for the two stations located within kagera river basin for which we had daily data and calibrated swim successfully kag 308 and kag 290 kag 308 is located upstream of kag 290 see fig 1 and it drains the streamflows from the mountainous area in central southern burundi while kag 290 registers the discharge from the main central part of burundi which corresponds to the ruvubu river basin 3 3 3 1 low flows the cordex ensemble median indicates a decrement in extreme low flows for kag 308 with exception of rcp4 5 p2 that shows increases for the three percentiles under analysis and rcp4 5 p1 that shows no significant change for q99 and q95 the decreases are especially noticeable under rcp8 5 with larger magnitudes found for lower percentiles up to roughly 18 for q90 at the end of the century for kag 290 we found a general increment in low flows however with anomalies very close to 0 for rcp8 5 p1 for the rest of the scenario periods the median of the simulations show an increase especially by the end of the century roughly above 19 and 22 for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively nonetheless the range of the magnitudes of change reaches much larger values when considering the models individually with e g anomalies between 75 7 and 108 6 for kag 290 q99 and rcp8 5 p2 these and other values regarding the anomalies in low flows can be found in table a 4 3 3 3 2 high flows we found robust increases in extreme high discharges for all stations percentiles scenarios and periods except for two cases q10 in kag 308 for rcp4 5 p2 and rcp8 5 p1 see fig 8b the magnitude of the anomalies is larger for more extreme discharges except under rcp8 5 p2 where the median of cordex models is similar for all percentiles hereby we found median anomalies between 3 7 and 14 3 in kag 308 and between 2 8 and 25 4 in kag 290 table a 5 shows detailed information per station scenario period and percentile moreover the minimum and maximum anomalies indicated by specific cordex models for kag 308 are 34 1 and 87 6 both found in q1 and for kag 290 32 7 q5 and 86 25 q1 with all extreme values found in rcp8 5 p2 the confidence of the sign of the anomalies is higher for kag 290 than for kag 308 as well as for rcp4 5 p1 and rcp8 5 p2 compared to the intermediate scenario periods see table a 5 for more details 4 discussion and outlook 4 1 changes in near surface mean temperature and precipitation the cordex models show a faster warming over burundi than the global mean as it is already known for east africa osima et al 2018 the projections analyzed in this study are coherent with the observed increasing trends in annual and seasonal mean temperature found since 1980 in equatorial and southern parts of east africa and with the long term annual mean anomalies projected by an ensemble of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 models under rcp 8 5 niang et al 2015 high temperatures have been reported to be the cause of the stratification and consequent decrease in nutrient recharge and primary production dynamics in lake tanganyika over the last decades tierney et al 2010 they are also responsible of shorter periods for mosquito s incubation which increase the transmission of malaria main cause of mortality in pregnant women and children under five years in burundi baramburiye et al 2013 also poverty in rural areas of burundi is due among other factors to persistent droughts baramburiye et al 2013 therefore the severe increase of temperatures found in this study would very likely increase the vulnerability of burundians and impact the well being and likelihoods of people regarding precipitation the opposite signals of change found in the northern and southern territory of burundi have been also reported in other studies based on cordex endris et al 2019 osima et al 2018 this pattern which gets extended over east africa has been associated to a stronger and weaker el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod related rainfall anomaly over the eastern and southern parts of east africa respectively endris et al 2019 such spatial differences have not been detected in studies using only gcms haensler et al 2013 nile basin initiative 2018 which supports the use of cordex rcms as a valuable tool to obtain more accurate results in regional studies the increment of precipitation in the north of burundi would need especial attention in areas like bujumbura prone to landslides and severe flash floods nkunzimana et al 2019 in opposition to the general increase of precipitation in the north of burundi we also found a decrement of precipitation in february in both the north and south of the country this would mean a more severe dry period between both rainy seasons than in the past fact that would require to take action for adaptation for instance in the provinces of kirundo and muyinga which are located in the north of burundi and have suffered severe droughts causing people to migrate due to famine nkunzimana et al 2019 the decrease of precipitation found in the onset months of the rainy season september october in north and south burundi and in the offset may in the south together with the increase of temperatures projected from may to october imply a prolongation of the long dry season in burundi as it has been likewise reported for east africa wainwright et al 2019 such an effect has been already observed in the recent past and farmers have started to adapt by selecting shorter season crops baramburiye et al 2013 moreover the general decrement of rainfall throughout the whole year in south burundi especially from december to february would compromise the use of water resources and need for water allocation 4 2 anomalies in mean river discharge we found a general increase in the average river discharge in north burundi and a general decrease in south burundi that agree with the anomalies found for precipitation in this study as well as by kim et al 2021 the later concludes about the rise of seasonal mean and extreme runoff in the ruvubu river basin station kag 290 in this study as an effect of the intensification of the hydrological cycle based on the projections from two earth system models in the sixth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 the krb shows a strong response to the projected rise in precipitation in northern burundi with discharges more than folding the reported changes for precipitation in some stations e g annual average change up to 44 in kag 298 in rcp8 5 p2 in response to an increment in precipitation by 20 7 at the most northern cell falling within burundi this suggests an increase in extreme precipitation events in krb as reported by kim et al 2021 that may result in an increment of the runoff due to a reduction of the infiltration of precipitation into the soils moreover higher temperatures would have an effect on the condition of the soils inducing higher volume of surface runoff from precipitation on the other side our results indicate water stress in the stations draining the southern half of burundi with some exceptions in the south center kag 308 and south east mal 38 of burundi in the long and short rainy seasons respectively here the magnitudes of change in discharge keep a direct relation with the changes in precipitation with for instance a maximum decrease of 13 9 in tan 81 in response to a drop in precipitation of 13 4 moreover discharge simulations based on single cordex models indicate higher magnitudes of change than the multi model median therefore such ranges of change should be considered when planning the management of water resources and adaptation strategies designed to combat climate change other factors like the high population density and high growth rate should be also taken into account since these may outweigh the potential higher water availability in burundi in the long term due to the expected increase in food demand and the inter annual variability of river discharge studies about the construction of weirs or small dams that could support crop irrigation during the onset and offset of the rainy season or in case of rainfall failure should be conducted in addition in order to prevent possible upstream downstream conflicts and to preserve the health of ecosystems in terms of structure and functioning the potential impacts should be previously explored 4 3 anomalies in extreme river discharge our simulations show substantial increases in extreme high flows in two stations within krb kag 308 located in the southern half of burundi and registering flows from the burundian montaneous area except for q10 and kag 290 which registers the flows of the ruvubu river basin and is located downstream of kag 308 for the extreme low flows the cordex models indicate a robust increase in kag 290 more significant in the far future and different signs of change in kag 308 an increase in rcp4 5 p2 and a decrease under rcp8 5 burundi has been prone to deadly river floods and landslides in the past especially in the capital city of bujumbura and its rural surroundings examples are the 2006 2014 and 2016 17 events em dat 2018 nkunzimana et al 2019 where hundreds of people were affected and many lives were lost the increase found in extreme high flows within ruvubu basin agree with the results of kim et al 2021 and implies a higher risk of flash floods and landslides in the main part of burundi in the future em dat 2018 such results could also involve bujumbura city and bujumbura rural provinces however due to the lack of daily discharge data we could not explore the extremes in discharge in the northern region of ltb in this regard thiery et al 2016 found that lake victoria and lake tanganyika are projected to be a hotspot of future extreme precipitation intensification over night which suggests that our results on extreme high flows could be extended to bujumbura region 4 4 uncertainties and limitations in order to reduce the error of the cordex data and the associated uncertainties due to the propagation of such error along the modeling chain in the current study we adjusted the bias of the models based on wfd era40 however the application of the parametrization done with the isimip ba method based on the projections in the reference period to the future projections imply some uncertainties that could play a role in the associated impacts following the swim model was calibrated at the daily and monthly time steps for different stations based on wfd era40 however we could not calibrate the discharge for gauge stations draining catchments of small size e g in ltb for other gauge stations than tan 81 probably due to the coarse resolution of wfd era40 climate data with higher resolution would help to better represent the climate in regions with such a complex topography like burundi and therefore to obtain more accurate results however when performing this study other datasets did not offer data prior to 1979 while wfd era40 data covered the full period required for the calibration and validation of swim according to the timeframe of the observations 1970 1999 regarding the resolution of the rcms used in this study the cordex provides nowadays climate data at 0 22 degree resolution however only for a few models and random rcps this is a common problem that could be solved through the fulfillment of the models matrix nikulin et al 2018 which would allow the application of climate projections with higher resolution for climate impact assessments and thus to obtain more accurate results another source of uncertainty in the results of this study could be the length and quality of the time series used for the calibration of swim the acquisition of discharge data for hydrological studies in african countries is a common problem in the case of burundi a civil war took place from 1993 to 2005 nantulya 2015 this is probably the reason why most of the provided time series ended in 1993 94 additionally we only could obtain daily data for three stations within krb therefore the calibration of swim was constraint to the availability of discharge data besides the data limitation the quality of the calibration of the hydrological model is another source of uncertainty in climate impact studies nonetheless they have been shown to contribute the least to the uncertainty of projected changes in mean and high flows in several studies vetter et al 2017 in this respect the swim represented properly the flow dynamics however it did not capture properly all the peaks and base flows existing in the observations therefore the results on streamflows should be treated with caution for the stations and quantiles presenting a large bias in comparison to observed data e g q99 in kag 308 likewise we acknowledge existing uncertainties in the sign of change projected by the different models with results becoming more spread towards rcp8 5 and at the end of the 21st century however on the other side we have also found a robust consensus from the cordex models on the sign of the projected changes for the hydro climatic variables here explored to summarize despite the uncertainties inherent to the modeling chain we have shown our results to be coherent with the observed trends and future projections reported in the literature which show the robustness of the methods and conclusions of this study 5 conclusion people highly dependent on weather patterns to make their living are more vulnerable to the effects from anthropogenic climate change and are in urgent need to cope with the outcome yet the information derived from impact studies is not always available or is less detailed than required identifying the potential impacts of climate change is important to implement adaptation actions addressed to reduce adverse consequences in this study we have contributed to filling the gap about the potential hydro climatic changes to be expected in the future over burundi by using a set of the state of the art bias adjusted cordex rcms and the eco hydrological model swim under two climate scenarios and for two future periods in the 21st century a warmer climate decreasing precipitation at the offset of the rainy season in north burundi and along most of the year in south burundi have been projected by the cordex climate models for burundi s future such changes pose a high risk to the agricultural production on which 90 of the population depends the history has shown that famine malnutrition mortality and related migration among others are direct consequences of such climate events on the other side increasing precipitation has been projected in north burundi throughout most of the year and in some exceptional months for some scenario periods in south burundi soil water conservation techniques and rainfall storage could be used to overcome some of the negative consequences from a warmer future climate nonetheless it should be kept in mind that under a high emission scenario difficulties to adapt will increase dramatically an increase in mean and extreme streamflow has been found in the northern and central part of burundi ruvubu basin while in the south a reduction of discharge would very likely take place along the year with exception of an increment in some rainy months these changes call urgently for an effective management of water resources which may help to mitigate harmful effects of climate warming while promoting livelihoods and human development in burundi in the south a better management could help to benefit from the rainfall fallen during the rainy season and balance the reduction of discharge during the rest of the year despite the inherent uncertainties of this study we have shown that the future anomalies found in the hydro meteorological indicators analyzed are robust and coherent between them and with other scientific work hence our results are useful for policy makers in the water and related sectors such as agriculture or energy the uncertainties should be treated carefully as should other socioeconomic factors such as population growth or land use changes be taken under consideration when planning water

7933,study region sweden study focus although sweden has historically been a country abundant with water observed changes in temperature and precipitation patterns during the past century have perturbed regional hydrologic regimes including the severity frequency and duration of streamflow droughts this study utilizes the standardized streamflow index ssi and the threshold level method to provide an unprecedented overview of spatiotemporal patterns of streamflow droughts in 50 swedish catchments over the past six decades the study catchments were categorized into five clusters of which each was analyzed for changes in various drought characteristics over the period 1961 2020 new hydrological insights for the region multiple severe streamflow drought events were detected over the past 60 years remarkably droughts in 1976 and 1996 were identified as the most extreme and wide spread events also compared to the latest 2018 drought southern catchments were generally more often and more severely affected than northern catchments our results suggest a wetting tendency over the past six decades across the entire country this occurs in conjunction with less severe shorter and less frequent droughts especially during colder winter months only in the southernmost regions a slight drying trend in spring and summer was found thus we argue that a better understanding and regional management of streamflow droughts is essential to secure the needs of the environment society and economy now and in the future graphical abstract ga1 keywords streamflow drought low flows

the negative deviation of surface and subsurface water supplies from average conditions at various points in time tallaksen and lanen 2004 wmo 2006 can cause problems for drinking water supply agriculture forestry industry energy production and can lead to a severe habitat damage swedish commission on climate and vulnerability 2007 hydrological droughts include groundwater droughts and streamflow droughts goyal et al 2017 while groundwater droughts are characterized by below normal groundwater levels streamflow droughts refer to periods when flows and water levels in a river are below a given threshold van loon 2015 hydrological droughts tend to gradually emerge over longer time scales than deficits in precipitation or soil moisture zaidman et al 2002 hydrological droughts are cumulative in nature because they become increasingly severe as long as water input into the system remains insufficient zaidman et al 2002 similar to the onset of droughts recovery from droughts is also slow due to long recharge times wmo 2006 streamflow droughts play a fundamental role in water resources management and influence the balance between in stream uses such as aquatic life and recreation and out of stream uses such as reservoir regulation smakhtin 2001 a reduction of in stream flow can cause interruptions in stream connectivity and loss of habitat lake 2003 lower stream velocities can trigger higher sedimentation rates wood and armitage 1997 which in combination with higher stream temperatures and higher concentrations of pollutants such as nitrogen lee et al 2021 also lead to deterioration of water quality van vliet and zwolsman 2008 these effects inevitably result in a loss of biodiversity which eventually alters food resources for other animals lake 2003 crop production during drought years can be substantially reduced up to 50 if irrigation is not provided campana et al 2018 droughts can severely affect hydropower production including in nordic regions jääskeläinen et al 2018 for example hydropower production by swedish hydropower stations dropped by more than 30 during droughts conditions van vliet et al 2016 negative impacts of droughts on forestry in nordic countries have frequently been reported stahl et al 2016 these severe consequences clearly illustrate the importance of knowledge about streamflow droughts for many aspects of water resources management including hydropower planning determining allowable water transfers and withdrawals or decisions regarding environmental flows it is thus essential to better understand simulate and predict streamflow droughts to secure the needs of the environment society and economy now and in the future although sweden has historically been a region abound with water it is not exempt of streamflow droughts fig 1 upper panels the 1976 northwest european drought the drought of 1996 and the 2003 european heatwave drought will long be remembered for their devastating effects in europe including scandinavia bradford 2000 fink et al 2004 the slowly developing drought in 1976 smashed records nationwide it had a relatively slow onset and resulted from a warm and dry summer following a dry winter with record rain deficits bradford 2000 stagge et al 2004 this led to reductions of annual streamflow of roughly 20 in northern sweden fig 1a center panel and 58 in southern sweden fig 1a bottom panel the 1996 streamflow drought started with precipitation deficits in late 1995 in the uk followed by an ever expanding meteorological drought in scandinavia continuing into spring 1996 this led to a considerable reduction in available water for northern europe in the early spring of 1996 which in turn caused streamflow to decrease on average by 25 in northern sweden fig 1a center panel and by 35 in southern sweden fig 1a bottom panel that year in 2003 drought conditions developed rather quickly due to a heat wave accompanied by a lack of summer rainfall euraqua 2004 annual streamflow was on average 24 below normal 20 in the north 32 in the south which caused substantial reductions in hydroelectric production energimyndigheten 2012 more recently 2016 and 2017 were rather dry years especially in southern sweden streamflow was 28 below normal and many regions issued local water use restrictions geological survey of sweden 2017 this drought continued and culminated in 2018 fig 1b which was yet another dry and unusually warm year swedish board of agriculture 2019 that led to the most serious wildfires in modern history the local 2018 this latest drought event had the epicenter over the uk and scandinavia peters et al 2020 in all cases however there were large seasonal and spatial variations in streamflow across the country fig 1a b which was likely caused by a large spatiotemporal variability in hydro climatic patterns and a complex interplay of meteorological conditions and catchment properties yet research on drought conditions and resulting hydrological impacts in sweden is still in its infancy and scientific studies dedicated to streamflow droughts in sweden are lacking even though hydropower forest industry and drinking water supply depend largely on a sufficient quantity of surface water anderegg et al 2013 barthel et al 2021 lehner et al 2005 given the large observed change in mean air temperature fig 2a accompanied by changes in mean precipitation patterns fig 2b over the past six decades we hypothesize that streamflow droughts in sweden have become more common and that not all regions are affected by streamflow droughts to the same extent to test this hypothesis we computed drought indices for 50 swedish catchments over a period of 60 years from january 1961 to december 2020 the scientific literature provides two types of indices which can be used to identify and characterize streamflow droughts from existing streamflow series 1 standardized indices that provide standardized information on drought strength and 2 threshold based indices that allow for the estimation of deficit volumes as an additional severity measure van loon 2015 in our study we combined both types of indicators we used a standardized index to compute spatiotemporal streamflow anomalies in 50 swedish catchments over a period of 60 years from january 1961 to december 2020 identified the most severe droughts and analyzed spatial prevalence of these events section 4 1 we then clustered the 50 catchments into spatially contiguous regions based on their streamflow anomalies section 4 2 to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of multiple threshold based drought characteristics across sweden section 4 3 and their patterns over time in a changing climate section 4 4 2 study area sweden spans an area of approximately 408 000 km2 slu 2015 with an elevation range of 2 2100 m a s l fig 3a more than two thirds 69 of the land area are currently covered by forests slu 2015 9 by wetlands and water bodies 8 by shrubs and grass land 8 by agriculture mostly in southern sweden 3 by human settlements urban areas and the remaining 3 are open land and glaciers fig 3b the dominant soil class is till which covers about 75 of the land area fig 3c sweden has three major climate zones fig 3d according to the köppen geiger classification beck et al 2018 the scandinavian mountains in northwestern sweden are located in the polar tundra climate zone et with monthly mean temperatures below 10 c central and northern sweden experiences a subarctic boreal climate dfc with cool summers very cold winter persistent seasonal snow cover and soil frost during winters and southern sweden is located within the warm summer hemiboreal climate zone dfb during the period 1961 2020 annual mean temperature in sweden was on average 2 6 c 3 2 c in the selected catchments while the annual precipitation averaged 784 mm 800 mm in the selected catchments during this period annual temperature has been significantly rising at a rate of 0 037 c per year at 5 significance level which adds up to a total warming of 2 2 c from 1961 to 2020 fig 2a at the same time precipitation has been increasing at a significant rate of 2 4 mm per year fig 2b which corresponds to a total increase of 144 mm or 20 for the same period average annual streamflow showed spatial variations fig 3e with the highest runoff 810 1300 mm year in the scandinavian mountains in northwestern sweden and the lowest 168 300 mm year in southeastern sweden fig 3a which reflected the spatial variations in topography fig 3a land use fig 3b soil types fig 3c and climate zone fig 3d table 1 for the subsequent analysis catchments were divided into northern catchments above 60 n and southern catchments below 60 n which corresponds to the prevailing climate conditions and streamflow regimes northern catchments featured et or dfc climates were characterized by temperature based snowmelt driven regimes with a clear snowmelt peak i e spring flood in the spring or early summer and low streamflow in the winter due to snow accumulation on the ground in contrast southern catchments exhibited a dfb climate and rainfall driven regimes with higher flows in the winter and lower flows in the summer due to high evapotranspiration demands 3 data 3 1 streamflow data daily streamflow measurements were downloaded from a publicly accessible streamflow database http vattenwebb smhi se provided by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi the data has been quality checked and is commonly used for hydrological studies in sweden as well as for national predictions warnings and statistical assessments geospatial data for the streamflow stations and their catchments was obtained from smhi s svar database eklund 2011 which offers information on more than 100 000 lakes 28 000 streams and roughly 52 000 catchments henestål et al 2015 from all these catchments we selected only 50 for this study table 1 fig 3e which had continuous streamflow measurements with gaps up to 14 days that were filled through linear interpolation during the period january 1961 to december 2020 and which were not affected by bifurcations or backwater effects 3 2 meteorological data for each of the 50 catchments gridded daily mean temperature and daily precipitation were obtained from smhi s pthbv database smhi 2005 which provides a spatially interpolated 4 km x 4 km national grid for the period 1961 2020 johansson 2002 catchment specific temperature and precipitation values table 1 were calculated by an area weighted average of all grid cells partly or fully lying within the catchment boundaries 4 methods 4 1 streamflow anomalies over space and time 4 1 1 computation of streamflow anomalies to identify spatiotemporal streamflow anomalies i e drought periods over sweden we used the standardized streamflow index ssi that was originally developed by shukla and wood 2008 and later improved by vicente serrano et al 2011 the ssi quantifies streamflow anomalies as dimensionless deviations from normal conditions it is computed by fitting a probability distribution function to the monthly streamflow series to estimate cumulative probabilities which are then transformed into so called z scores based on a normal distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation of one the ssi equals these z scores which implies that it represents the number of standard deviations away from the mean positive ssi values indicate streamflow conditions above normal while negative values represent below normal conditions the magnitude of streamflow anomalies can also be described qualitatively e g following the classification scheme originally introduced lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 for precipitation anomalies table 2 according to mishra and singh 2010 ssi is a powerful tool to characterize streamflow droughts because it can be calculated for different aggregation periods e g for 1 3 6 12 or 24 months and because it enables comparison of events across regions short aggregation periods 3 months can be useful to capture short term hydrological responses to droughts while longer aggregation periods reflect longer lasting streamflow anomalies seibert et al 2017 here we applied the ssi to identify the most severe drought periods and to identify the overall spatiotemporal patterns it should however be noted that the estimated ssi is strongly affected by the length of the streamflow record wu et al 2005 and by the chosen probability distribution function stagge et al 2015b in the literature a number of different probability distributions has been fitted to streamflow soľáková et al 2013 svensson et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2011 concluded that the use of any single distribution is inappropriate in regions with highly variable streamflow regimes given the wide north south span of our study area and the associated regional differences in streamflow regimes snow melt driven in the north versus rainfall driven in the south we tested a variety of probability distributions for each considered series obtained for 50 gauging stations 12 months of the year and 5 different aggregation periods separately we selected 16 distributions including several one two and three parameter distributions see table 3 to fit to the monthly streamflow series and applied the kuiper s goodness of fit test kuiper 1960 to decide on the best fitting distribution the kuiper test statistic is the sum of maximum negative d and maximum positive d distances between two cumulative distribution functions this test is similar to the widely known two sample kolmogorov smirnov test massey 1951 but is generally considered superior louter and koerts 1970 because it is equally sensitive at the mean and at the tails this feature makes the kuiper test especially useful in analyzing extreme events such as droughts and floods we calculated the ssi based on the following procedure i first mean monthly flows in mm month were obtained from the observed daily streamflow series this represented the one month aggregation period equaling ssi 1 ii these monthly series were further averaged over 3 6 12 and 24 months using a moving average to obtain ssi 3 ssi 6 ssi 12 and ssi 24 svensson et al 2017 for example the 3 month streamflow ssi 3 in june 1990 is the average streamflow over april may and june 1990 iii these monthly time series were split by calendar month resulting in 12 monthly series one for each month from january to december each consisting of 60 values from 1961 to 2020 for each of the five considered aggregation periods ssi 1 ssi 3 ssi 6 ssi 12 and ssi 24 for each of the 50 catchments thus a total of 3000 series were created iv sixteen candidate probability distribution functions table 3 were fitted to each of the 3000 monthly streamflow series v kuiper s test kuiper 1960 was used to decide on the best fitting distribution for every series independently vi the selected best fitting distribution for a particular series was transformed into z scores i e a normal distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation equal to 1 which directly provided the ssi values in each catchment for each calendar month and each aggregation period drought periods were identified by applying the scheme given in table 2 over the ssi values it should be noted that the ssi is based on monthly streamflow series and does not allow for a high temporal resolution i e identification of drought events of shorter durations thus in this study the ssi was used only to explore the overall large scale spatiotemporal patterns of droughts across sweden from 1961 to 2020 4 1 2 detection of spatiotemporal patterns across sweden we analyzed general spatiotemporal patterns in droughts by considering the ssi values obtained from the 5 aggregation periods jointly over the entire record period 1961 2020 and across all catchments as a result we were able to identify droughts and to analyze their spatial prevalence special emphasis in our analyses was put on evaluating potential north south patterns which we expected to emerge due to variations in evaporation as well as snow accumulation and snow melt for example we analyzed if the magnitude of a specific severe drought event was the same in the northern and in the southern catchments comparisons between drought severity in the northern catchments to the severity in the southern ones were performed based on the non parametric wilcoxon rank sum test asadzadeh et al 2014 the null hypothesis of this test is that the samples medians are equal under the underlying assumption that the two distributions have the same shape and variance montgomery and runger 2010 the test statistic is considered normally distributed for sample sizes greater than 15 kottegoda and rosso 2008 most of these analyses were based on the ssi 6 obtained from 6 month moving average flows as this particular aggregation period reflects seasonal anomalies and is regularly considered for assessment of drought impacts on freshwater ecosystems water supply hydropower production and industry faiz et al 2022 stagge et al 2015a 4 2 clustering of catchments based on streamflow anomalies to facilitate comprehensive analyses of drought characteristics across sweden a cluster analysis cattell 1943 was performed to generate five groups out of the 50 catchments five was chosen as the optimal number of groups based on the silhouette method rousseeuw 1987 which is an approach to graphically detect how close each point in a cluster is to other points within the same cluster and to points in other clusters we applied the k means clustering algorithm kaufman and rousseeuw 2009 to the 50 ssi 6 time series 6 month aggregation to generate clusters on the basis of similarity in streamflow anomalies i e general streamflow drought behavior in a preliminary analysis the clustering was also tested based on the other aggregation periods ssi 1 to ssi 24 however using a different aggregation period resulted only in minor differences 2 4 catchments ending up in another neighboring cluster and thus we deemed the clustering based on ssi 6 sufficiently robust and representative analyses of temporal patterns in the ssi values and in drought characteristics were subsequently conducted on a per cluster basis 4 3 characterization of streamflow drought events 4 3 1 identification of drought events to assess characteristics of individual drought events such as drought duration severity magnitude and frequency wanders and van lanen 2015 and to enable a statistical analysis of drought properties across sweden we applied the threshold level method originally developed by yevjevich 1967 this method is based on a predefined streamflow level below which flows are considered to be insufficient and thus to cause drought conditions this approach can be used to compute various drought properties such as drought durations deficit volumes minimum flow and time of occurrence hisdal et al 2001 van loon 2015 these estimates strongly depend on the selected threshold level fleig et al 2006 mishra and singh 2010 which is typically derived from non exceedance probabilities usually 5th 25th percentile of the flow duration curve in sweden the threshold levels are often calculated by averaging all annual minimum values based on daily streamflow over a period of 30 years naturvårdsverket 2003 this approach results in a constant value for the entire year i e no seasonal variability which is often used for long term planning of drinking water supply or irrigation and as a target for minimum environmental flows at hydropower stations vattenfall 2012 it has however been suggested that the minimum required environmental flow in sweden should be increased considerably up to a non exceedance probability of 20 q80 to support the preservation of aquatic organisms länsstyrelsen värmland 2007 as the q80 is also the most frequently applied threshold in the scientific literature heudorfer and stahl 2017 we computed the q80 in each catchment separately over the entire period 1961 2020 as a threshold for streamflow drought definition in this study however instead of calculating one fixed threshold we utilized a variable threshold for each day of the year using a moving window to account for seasonal patterns van loon 2015 as follows for each day of the year we gathered the streamflow values of the 15 days before and 15 days after that day resulting in 31 streamflow values for a single day in a specific year in a particular catchment these 31 values were selected from each year of the record period 1961 2020 providing us with 1860 values in total then the 20th percentile was computed from these 1860 values to serve as the threshold value of streamflow for that particular day in a considered catchment consequently every day of the year had a distinct streamflow threshold based on the 20th percentile of streamflow in that particular catchment on that specific day and the 15 days before and after a drought event was identified if streamflows were below the given threshold it is crucial to note that even during a longer dry period streamflow can shortly exceed this given threshold level which would cause the above procedure to identify several shorter and mutually dependent drought events instead of one prolonged dry period to avoid this splitting the time series was filtered with a 30 day backwards moving average ma pooling procedure fleig et al 2006 tallaksen et al 1997 to produce more coherent uninterrupted sequences of independent droughts tallaksen et al 2009 tu et al 2016 van loon and van lanen 2012 zelenhasić and salvai 1987 in a last step we removed minor drought events with durations of less than three days as suggested by van loon and laaha 2015 4 3 2 statistical characterization of streamflow droughts after the identification of drought events for each catchment based on the threshold level method statistical drought properties were summarized including drought duration deficit volume also known as severity magnitude and the number of drought events clausen and pearson 1995 hisdal et al 2001 drought duration d is defined as the number of consecutive time steps here days in which streamflow is below the pre defined threshold i e flow with a non exceedance probability of 20 q80 deficit volume v for a particular drought event is obtained by summing up the deviations of streamflow from the threshold value during period d and is given in millimeters to be able to compare deficit volumes or severities among different catchments we also calculated a standardized deficit volume v s as suggested by van lanen et al 2013 the standardized deficit volume is computed by dividing v by the average annual or seasonal flow and can be interpreted as the number of days with average flow conditions needed to make up the deficit van loon 2015 drought magnitude m is calculated by dividing v by duration d while the number of drought events n is a simple count of drought events over the analyzed period we used a selection of 17 drought statistics table 4 which are commonly used in the scientific literature cf clausen and pearson 1995 dracup et al 1980 hisdal et al 2001 mishra and singh 2010 vicente serrano et al 2017 yevjevich 1967 these indicators were computed separately for each catchment on an annual basis additionally both the cumulated drought duration i e number of drought days and the cumulated deficit volume were also calculated separately for each season seasons were here defined by calendar months 1 spring consists of march april and may mam 2 summer period covers june july and august jja 3 autumn refers to september october and november son and 4 winter refers to the months of december january and february djf annual and seasonal drought statistics were averaged over the entire record period to obtain one single value for each drought statistic per catchment 4 4 droughts in a changing climate we performed the mann kendall s test kendall 1938 mann 1945 and sen s slope estimate sen 1968 theil 1992 to detect potential significant trends and their signs in annual and seasonal streamflow anomalies for trends in annual streamflow anomalies we chose the ssi 12 of the month of september of each year which aggregates the 12 months of the water year i e from october of the previous year to september of the present year and thus provides a good estimate of overall streamflow conditions in each water year for seasonal trend tests we chose the ssi 3 of the last month of each season ssi 3 of may for spring mam ssi 3 of august for summer jja ssi 3 of november for autumn son and ssi 3 of february djf therefore for each catchment we obtained a series of 60 values 1961 2020 of september ssi 12 and four series of 60 ssi 3 values taken at different seasons of the year all of which were tested for trends we further assessed if annual and seasonal streamflow anomalies as well as drought characteristics during two so called climate normal periods cnps which correspond to a 30 year average of the earth s climate as defined by the world meteorological organization wmo 2020 were significantly different for this we applied the non parametric wilcoxon rank sum test montgomery and runger 2010 over two cnps from 1961 to 1990 and from 1991 to 2020 respectively all analyses related to temporal changes of droughts were conducted for the five identified clusters rather than for individual study catchments 5 results 5 1 streamflow anomalies over space and time 5 1 1 computation of streamflow anomalies selection of distributions the monthly ssis for five different aggregation periods were computed after fitting and evaluating 16 different candidate distributions to the time series of 50 different catchments separately for each of the 12 months january december from all tested distributions both the generalized extreme value and loglogistic distributions were chosen most often i e both in 13 of all cases table 5 closely followed by the weibull 11 and gamma distributions 10 exponential generalized pareto and half normal distributions were the least favorable each chosen in less than 1 of all cases table 5 while some distributions such as lognormal normal or weibull had an increasing success rate with increasing aggregation period lengths e g ssi 12 or ssi 24 other distributions such as birnbaum saunders gamma or inverse gamma showed the exact opposite behavior 5 1 2 detection of spatiotemporal patterns across sweden according to the computed ssis each catchment experienced a number of streamflow droughts during the period 1961 2020 fig 4 expectedly the ssi calculated over shorter aggregation periods e g ssi 1 to ssi 6 in fig 4a c resulted in more drought events of less severity e g short mild and moderate droughts of which many become invisible as the aggregation periods lengthen e g ss12 or ssi 24 in fig 4d e this behavior is particularly pronounced during the period 1981 1991 the well remembered drought events of 1976 1996 2003 and the dry conditions in more recent years e g 2017 and 2018 are clearly visible in the ssi visualizations cf fig 4c purple annotation however these visualizations also indicate long lasting drought conditions in the early 1960 s i e 1963 and 64 in the late 1960 s i e mainly northern sweden in 1969 and 70 and drought conditions in southern sweden in the late 1980 s in total 10 drought years with different severity and different spatial extent were identified for all aggregation periods namely in temporal order 1963 1964 1969 1970 1976 1989 1996 2003 2017 and 2018 cf fig 4c turquoise annotation for each month we calculated the total number of catchments that were in drought state based on the ssi 6 values fig 5 over the 60 year record period the 1976 drought clearly sticks out as the drought that affected most catchments over the longest time in fact from april 1976 to february 1977 more than half of the catchments were either in severe or extreme drought state during the summer months june to august the situation escalated with roughly 50 of the catchments having extreme drought conditions 20 suffering from severe drought 15 from moderate to mild drought and only 15 i e 8 catchments not being in drought state similar conditions were observed 20 years later in april to june 1996 during this period all 50 catchments were in drought state in may 1996 50 of catchments suffered from an extreme drought 20 from a severe drought and the remaining 30 were either in moderate or mild drought conditions both of these drought events had the widest spatial impact with about 70 of catchments either suffering from extreme or severe drought conditions fig 5 with 50 60 of catchments suffering from extreme or severe droughts the events in 1964 2003 and 2018 also had widespread consequences but to a somewhat smaller spatial extent than the events in 1976 or 1996 fig 5 from the 10 identified drought years the droughts in 1963 1969 1970 1989 and 2017 had the smallest spatial coverage however still roughly 30 40 of catchments were in extreme or severe drought states during these events these patterns and drought years were to a large extent confirmed by analyzing the occurrence of major drought events across the country that were identified with the threshold level method for the period 1961 2020 when obtaining for each catchment the ten longest drought events of the study period the most reappearing events amongst all the catchments were those of 1970 1974 1976 1996 and 2018 the same ranking was done in terms of mean deficit volume and in this case the most reappearing drought events occurred during 1963 1970 1976 1996 and 2018 spatial differences revealed themselves both in the number of affected catchments fig 5 as well as in the average magnitude of ssi values for northern 60 n versus southern 60 n catchments fig 6 in most cases i e 1964 1970 1976 1989 2017 2018 southern catchments experienced significantly stronger i e more severe droughts than northern catchments the only exceptions were the droughts in 1969 and 2003 for which the wilcoxon rank sum test identified significantly stronger droughts in the north in 1969 mild drought conditions prevailed in the south median ssi 6 0 6 while the north was impacted by a severe drought median ssi 6 1 7 as for severity northern catchments experienced similar drought conditions in 2003 as in 1969 median ssi 6 1 6 but southern catchments were affected slightly more as they were in a moderate drought state median ssi 6 1 2 furthermore for the years 1963 and 1996 the wilcoxon rank sum test failed to reject the null hypothesis at the 5 significance level indicating that southern and northern catchments experienced droughts of similar severity this can also be seen in the spatial distribution of different severities in these two years fig 6 for which the maps do not reveal any clear north south pattern 5 2 clustering of catchments based on streamflow anomalies all 50 catchments were grouped into five homogenous clusters based on their similarity in ssi 6 streamflow anomalies five geographically distinct regions emerged from the clustering fig 7 which also distinguished themselves through varying geographic hydroclimatic and land cover characteristics table 6 catchments in cluster 1 are located in the mountainous region 623 942 m a s l of sweden within the dfc and et climate zones they receive high annual precipitation rates which lead to overall higher streamflows especially in the spring when snow is melting fig 7a these catchments are characterized by a high fraction of shrubs 46 and open land 10 catchments in cluster 2 are in the most northern parts of sweden at an elevation ranging from 255 m a s l to 645 m a s l their streamflow regime shows a distinct peak during late spring and early summer may to june and low flow during winter fig 7b cluster 2 has the largest share of surface water bodies 26 of all clusters a somewhat similar regime is shown by catchments in cluster 3 which are located in the central swedish dfc climate zone these catchments have a tendency towards an earlier spring flood peak april to may and feature a more pronounced autumn peak fig 7c compared to cluster 2 catchments in cluster 3 feature somewhat higher elevations ranging from 285 m to 758 m a s l and have large areas covered with boreal forest 65 and shrubs grassland 18 catchments grouped in clusters 4 and 5 are in the lowlands 12 240 m a s l of southern sweden they are characterized by a cfb climate mostly cluster 4 or a cfc climate mostly cluster 5 and their annual streamflow regime has low flow during the summer and higher flow during spring and winter fig 7d e large areas of these clusters are covered by forests 64 72 yet most agricultural activity in the country is also concentrated here these cluster profiles link the streamflow anomalies to the hydroclimatic conditions following the north south and elevation gradients and to landscape characteristics which strongly affect streamflow generating processes at the catchment scale each cluster also features in line with its geographical location a distinct hydrological regime ranging from snowmelt driven regimes with pronounced spring flood peaks fig 7a c to rainfall driven regimes with summer low flows in the south fig 7d e 5 3 characterization of streamflow drought events a total of 17 drought statistics table 4 was computed for each study catchment a single value per catchment of each statistic see section 4 3 2 and then presented for each cluster fig 8 these characteristics revealed clear differences across clusters cluster 1 in far north east sweden had on average the shortest duration of drought events fig 8a b and generally the lowest number of drought days fig 8c f except for the cold winter season fig 8c g it also featured the highest absolute deficit volume fig 8h i but the lowest standardized deficit volume both annually fig 8j and seasonally k n furthermore it was characterized by the highest drought magnitudes fig 8o p and one of the highest numbers of drought events fig 8q which was only topped by cluster 4 for many statistics a north south gradient i e gradual changes from cluster 1 to 5 emerged e g for drought duration fig 8a b annual number of drought days fig 8c and number of drought days in spring and summer fig 8d e as well as for standardized deficit volumes fig 8j n cluster 2 showed on average the least spread across catchments while other clusters showed a relatively large variability for some statistics in particular clusters 1 and 4 had a wide spread in absolute deficit volume fig 8h i and drought magnitude fig 8o p while clusters 3 and 5 showed a particularly large variability in drought duration fig 8a b number of drought days fig 8c g and number of drought events fig 8q cluster 5 additionally also featured the widest spread in standardized deficit volume fig 8j n 5 4 streamflow droughts in a changing climate 5 4 1 trends and changes in streamflow anomalies 1961 2020 the trend analysis revealed considerable differences among the clusters when considering anomalies in the annual streamflow conditions fig 9a the majority of catchments 74 featured a positive trend implying that streamflow conditions became wetter over time however only 12 catchments 24 mostly located in northern sweden clusters 1 and 2 exhibited significant trends which were all positive pointing towards a wetting over time only a minority of catchments 26 mostly located further south clusters 3 5 featured a negative drying yet insignificant trend at 5 level of significance this pattern was however not consistent across all seasons in fact spring mam was characterized by a strong north south pattern fig 9b with clusters 1 and 2 becoming wetter 54 of all catchments and clusters 4 and 5 drier 46 however many of the drying trends were not statistically significant only 4 catchments in the south had significant drying trends compared to 15 catchments with significant wetting trends in the north while there also seem to be spatial differences in summer jja and autumn son most of the observed trends 92 in summer and 98 in autumn respectively were not significant fig 9c d in contrast winter djf sticks out as the season with the highest proportion 92 of positive trends fig 9e implying wetting over time the majority of trends in winter 62 were significant changes over time in the streamflow anomalies across the clusters were also analyzed by comparing the anomalies between the two climate normal periods fig 10 cluster 1 in the north west of sweden experienced an overall wetting fig 10a which mostly occurred in winter and spring both significant while summer experienced only slight wetting insignificant in contrast during autumn cluster 1 exhibited a significant drying trend cluster 2 showed similar patterns as cluster 1 except for an insignificant and neglectable drying during autumn fig 10b all other seasons experienced a significant wetting over the 60 year study period cluster 3 which is located further south of clusters 1 and 2 underwent a significant wetting in winter which also caused an overall wetting on an annual basis fig 10c we did not detect any significant trends during the other 3 seasons clusters 4 and 5 both located in the southern parts of sweden experienced slight but insignificant overall wetting fig 10d e which was most pronounced and significant during winter both clusters also became significantly drier during spring overall positive changes i e wetting in the annual and winter streamflow were detected across all clusters and positive changes in the spring anomalies in the northern clusters 1 through 3 and negative in the southern clusters 4 and 5 in clusters with a large number of catchments exhibiting strong significant trends cf fig 9 significant differences in the anomalies between the two cnps were found according to the wilcoxon rank sum test e g annual spring or winter anomalies in cluster 1 fig 10 however significant differences between the two periods were obtained only rarely in clusters with a low number of catchments with significant trends such as autumn streamflow anomalies of cluster 1 summer anomalies of cluster 2 annual anomalies of cluster 3 or spring and summer anomalies of cluster 4 5 4 2 differences in streamflow drought characteristics between two climate normal periods 1961 1990 versus 1991 2020 our analysis revealed clear shifts in the drought characteristics of different clusters between the two climate normal periods 1961 1990 and 1991 2020 fig 11 it should however be noted that only about one third of the detected drought transitions was significant at the 5 significance level according to the wilcoxon rank sum test the duration of drought events declined in all five cluster groups which is shown both in the average fig 11a and maximum drought duration fig 11b those shifts were significant only for clusters 1 and 2 and 4 for average duration a pronounced variability in the changes in drought duration are apparent in clusters 2 4 and 5 the number of drought days per year declined significantly in all clusters except for the southernmost cluster 5 fig 11c a gradual north south pattern emerged with northern clusters experiencing a stronger decline the change in number of drought days varied considerably among seasons and clusters in spring fig 11d only the northern clusters 1 3 experienced a significant decline in summer fig 11e only the southernmost cluster 5 increased significantly during autumn fig 11f none of the clusters underwent a significant change while all clusters had significantly fewer drought days in winter during the second period 1991 2020 fig 11g most of these changes i e annual spring and winter exhibited a gradual pattern reflecting milder decrease towards the south shifts in absolute drought deficit were mostly insignificant fig 11h i apart from cluster 4 which showed a somewhat stronger decline in the deficit volume compared to other clusters especially a significant decline in the maximum deficit fig 11i the shifts in standardized deficit volume indicated a clear north south gradient fig 11j with relatively little change in the north and stronger changes in the south where catchment 5 featured a pronounced significant decline however the patterns differed seasonally with spring fig 11k summer fig 11 l and autumn fig 11 m mostly featuring weak and insignificant changes only winter season experienced stronger declines across all clusters of which cluster 1 3 and 5 exhibited significant changes fig 11 n transitions in drought magnitude fig 11o p were significant only for cluster 5 that showed a decline over time similarly cluster 4 experienced a strong but insignificant decline in drought magnitude while drought magnitudes in catchments of clusters 2 and 3 on average did not change significantly between the two periods conversely average annual drought magnitude in the north west of sweden cluster 1 increased however these changes were not statistically significant according to the wilcoxon rank sum test the total number of drought events fig 11q declined in all clusters except for cluster 5 but only the northernmost clusters 1 and 2 featured significant and strong trends changes in the number of drought events largely follow a gradual north south pattern from a decrease in the north to a slight increase in the south 6 discussion 6 1 identification of drought events our analysis of streamflow anomalies over space and time was based on the standardized streamflow index ssi over several different aggregation periods by testing a wide range of possible candidate distributions for each catchment each aggregation period and each month of the year we ensured an optimal fit in each case to increase the robustness of our results the selection of a best fitting distribution varied across catchments and aggregation periods while loglogistic generalized extreme value and weibull distributions provided the best fit more often than other candidate distributions there was generally not a single best fitting distribution these distributions have different features for example two of them have two parameters and only one is applied with the log transformed data based on earlier findings by vicente serrano et al 2011 these results are not surprising as the authors already stated over a decade ago that each theoretical distribution assumption has one or more limitations that influences their suitability for obtaining robust standardized streamflow series what is surprising however is that many recent publications utilizing the ssi e g abdelkader and yerdelen 2022 bevacqua et al 2021 botai et al 2021 lee et al 2022 taraky et al 2021 wu et al 2022 xing et al 2021 zalokar et al 2021 applied one preselected probability distribution most often gamma instead of assessing several candidate distributions such an approach would have resulted in an optimal fit in only 10 of all cases in our study features of different hydrologic regimes as well as the length of an aggregation period greatly affect statistical moments of the monthly flow series considering the differences in the statistical properties of these series it should become a standard practice to evaluate a wide range of candidate probability distributions not only one distribution function with catchment and aggregation period specific parameters to ensure reliable assessments especially in large ensemble studies across different hydroclimatic conditions and regimes 6 2 clustering of catchments based on streamflow anomalies five regions with homogeneous behavior in streamflow ssi 6 anomalies emerged from the clustering approach differences in streamflow patterns in these clusters were reflected by variations in independent cluster properties including geographical location latitude longitude elevation and climate characteristics the clusters identified in our study resembled to some extent the official swedish river basin districts fig 12 that were established in response to the european water framework directive directive 2000 60 ec 2000 however there were also some differences which imply that caution is needed in interpreting cluster based results in the context of river basin districts cluster 1 was the one that differed most from the boundaries of the swedish river basin districts this cluster has a somewhat special status as it stretches over two river basins and over two districts but includes only the highest elevation headwater catchments catchments at this elevation feature a different type of vegetation and land use compared to lower lying catchments at similar latitudes which naturally also affects their streamflow regimes and particularly their drought behavior cluster 2 lies completely within the bothnian bay district while cluster 3 is situated within the bothnian sea district cluster 4 matches the skagerrak and kattegat district while cluster 5 spreads over both the northern and southern baltic sea districts our results clearly show that no grouping of catchments into different districts or regions is sufficiently versatile to reflect all properties of hydrologic regimes and that groups of catchments might vary depending on the features that the grouping clustering is based upon 6 2 1 overall spatiotemporal patterns in streamflow droughts standardized indices such as the ssi are considered to be rather convenient measures for drought comparison across different regions mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 however they are often less useful for practical water management purposes as they do not quantify needs or conditions in a specific catchment such as water demand in an easily interpretable way mishra and singh 2010 thus the ssi was used in this study solely to identify the most drought prone regions i e regions with high drought hazard which according to the latest definitions by the united nations office for disaster risk reduction merely reflects a process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life injury or other health impacts property damage social and economic disruption or environmental degradation undrr 2019 despite this limitation the ssi based approach allowed us to identify overall spatiotemporal patterns in streamflow anomalies i e drought periods over sweden and to identify five distinct regions in sweden by clustering the study catchments based on these anomalies by also using a threshold based approach we were able to reaffirm the results from the indicator based assessment and complemented these analyses by statistically analyzing trends and differences in annual and seasonal streamflow characteristics identification of drought events provides a useful reference to place more recent drought events into an appropriate context despite clearly depending on the chosen aggregation period the ssis obtained for the five aggregation periods all revealed 10 drought years with different severity and different spatial extent namely 1963 1964 1969 1970 1976 1989 1996 2003 2017 and 2018 although not all these drought years seem to be remembered by the general public e g the authors were unaware of drought events in the 1960 s and 70 s these years are in line with historic drought reporting in national newspapers e g atterstam 2003 beckerman and larsson ask 1996 tt nyhetsbyrån 1989 the ongoing public discussion often focuses on the most recent drought events of 2017 and 2018 which have been pointed out as historic or unprecedented droughts dauschy 2018 mcelwee 2018 while these events were undoubtedly included in the list of the top 10 drought events over the past 60 years in our study these statements are hydrologically speaking not correct in fact we found the droughts of 1976 and 1996 to be the most severe events as they had the most extreme drought conditions i e the strongest deviations from normal conditions and affected the largest number of catchments across sweden this discrepancy between hydrological facts and public debate indicates a weak collective memory of the swedish society viglione et al 2014 defined collective memory as the capacity of a society to keep awareness of a risk high pfister 2011 even argues that the collective memory of natural disasters such as flood and droughts is relatively short lived in our globalized world we here argue that given a projected warming and changing climate and severe drought events already recorded we can and should constantly learn from the past events and should as a society not forget about past events these past drought events demonstrated that southern catchments often suffered from significantly stronger i e more severe droughts than the northern ones the only exceptions were the years of the 1969 and 2003 droughts for which we found significantly stronger droughts in the north these findings highlight that the complex interplay of hydroclimatic conditions and physical processes at the land surface can influence the evolution and the propagation of droughts in different regions peña gallardo et al 2019 in fact fleig et al 2011 argued that different atmospheric conditions have a key role in the development of individual drought events consequently even regions that are commonly known for their abundance of water are not exempt from droughts as corroborated by our results 6 3 streamflow drought characteristics for a more detailed quantification of streamflow drought characteristics at a finer temporal resolution i e on a daily basis the threshold level approach was utilized this approach provided information on drought frequency duration and severity for the period 1961 2020 as well as over the two climate normal periods 1961 1990 and 1991 2020 this method is more suitable for water management purposes than the ssi as it can serve as a point for action van loon 2015 for example it can be used for assessing environmental flows required to preserve aquatic ecosystems länsstyrelsen värmland 2007 however the threshold level method is sensitive to numerous pre defined parameters that control the pooling of droughts tallaksen et al 2009 tu et al 2016 van loon and van lanen 2012 and removal of minor drought events heudorfer and stahl 2016 tallaksen et al 1997 van loon 2015 zelenhasić and salvai 1987 both of which can affect identification of drought events and consequently cause uncertainties in estimated drought characteristics previous studies showed that the approach for setting the threshold primarily impacts droughts of short durations while its impact drops with increasing drought duration heudorfer and stahl 2017 the focus of our study was primarily on analyses of spatiotemporal patterns and an inter comparison of drought characteristics across a large sample of catchments rather than on accuracy of the estimates of drought characteristics per se furthermore we followed the same methodology across all catchments and in all periods to identify drought events including removal of minor events and consequently their characteristics thus we deem that the impact of the threshold selection and removal of minor drought events on our conclusions was largely reduced heudorfer and stahl 2017 the computed drought characteristics were not consistent across the clusters clusters 1 and 2 in the north generally experienced shorter and less severe droughts than clusters in the southern regions such spatial differences in drought characteristics were also found in other studies in comparable climate zones e g for the 2006 drought in finland gao et al 2016 for the 2015 drought in canada szeto et al 2016 or for the 2018 drought in norway bakke et al 2020 seasonal differences that can be linked to the underlying streamflow regimes in the clusters were found in our study while all clusters can suffer from streamflow droughts caused by a rainfall deficit during any season van loon and van lanen 2012 catchments within clusters 1 2 and 3 in the northern parts of the country are additionally prone to other drought types which include 1 rain to snow season droughts in autumn and winter that are caused by a prolonged lack in rainfall in summer autumn that continues into the snowy winter season 2 cold snow season droughts that are caused by a prolonged winter season meaning that precipitation falls as snow over a longer than normal period and 3 warm snow season droughts in spring summer due to a shortened winter season that causes precipitation to fall as rain over a longer than normal period and implies smaller amounts of water stored in the snowpack these drought types are the reason for a higher number of winter drought days in clusters 1 3 and more autumn drought days in clusters 2 and 3 in contrast clusters 4 and 5 are more prone to wet to dry season droughts in spring and summer which occur due to a rainfall deficit in winter spring that continues into the dry summer season thus droughts in these southern regions are predominantly related to precipitation van loon and van lanen 2012 this is reflected in the higher number of drought days in spring and summer in these clusters 6 4 streamflow droughts in a changing climate this paper reveals a tendency towards wetter conditions across the country our results suggest an overall increase in the annual ssi in all 5 clusters which is consistent with the detected decrease in drought durations frequencies and severities these results generally do not support our hypothesis that streamflow droughts in sweden have become more common our examination indicates the opposite tendency implying that increasing annual precipitation and higher temperatures have overall lead to an increase in streamflow in the majority of catchments however a more precise analysis of seasonal shifts provided a clearer picture of the dynamics and patterns over the past 60 years although the majority of drought characteristics pointed towards wetter conditions we observed a drying trend based on the ssi 12 values in spring in clusters 4 and 5 as well as in summer in clusters 3 and 5 in these southern regions the number of drought days in summer slightly increased while they decreased in all other seasons these changes suggest a shift in the prevailing streamflow regimes and delineate two distinct regions with different temporal evolution of droughts northern parts clusters 1 3 versus southern parts clusters 4 5 in the northern temperature and snowmelt driven catchments warmer temperatures 0 9 to 1 5 c and in particular the strong increase in winter temperatures 2 3 c compared to 0 6 c in summer caused more precipitation to fall as rain instead of snow which led to more streamflow during winter an earlier onset of snowmelt also pushed the spring flood peak towards earlier dates which caused more streamflow in the spring at the same time increasing precipitation 3 to 18 outweighed the effects of increasing temperatures and evapotranspiration during summer leading to an overall wetting of the catchments in the southern catchments with rainfall driven regimes winter streamflow was less affected by warming temperatures 1 0 to 1 3 c as there was only little to no snow in these areas to melt however the winter streamflow in these clusters increased due to the increasing precipitation 5 to 16 in spring and summer the increase in precipitation was not as pronounced so changes in drought characteristics where somewhat outweighed by increasing temperatures and evapotranspiration rates these results confirm earlier findings from large scale pan european studies on droughts for example gudmundsson and seneviratne 2015 found overall wetting trends in the standardized precipitation index on an annual and seasonal basis which are in line with the increasing precipitation values over our study area these changes in precipitation manifested themselves in streamflow changes and stahl et al 2010 highlighted that low flows have increased i e became less severe in most winter low flow regimes e g norway sweden and finland in another european study that also included 9 streamflow stations in sweden stahl 2001 found slightly negative trends in annual standardized maximum deficit volume in northern catchments no significant trends in central sweden and slightly positive trends in southern areas for the period 1962 1990 these results were somewhat different from ours as we could not observe significant trends in annual standardized deficit volumes in the northern parts and found contrasting to stahl 2001 a wetting trend in the south one possible explanation for this discrepancy might be the different length of the study period which was much shorter in the study of stahl 2001 this highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate record length to avoid uncertainties link et al 2020 we believe that our study which was based on a larger ensemble of streamflow stations and on a period more than twice as long provides a reliable representation of spatial drought patterns across sweden in fact our patterns are consistent with findings in other studies in comparable climate zones for example asong et al 2018 and yang et al 2020 studied trends in hydrological droughts over canada and detected a wetting in northern areas and a drying in southern areas in finland korhonen and kuusisto 2010 discovered significant streamflow shifts in line with what we observed in northern sweden which lead to less severe low flow conditions at about half of their study sites wilson et al 2010 found similar spatial patterns in mean streamflow with mostly weak and insignificant trends in the south and stronger wetting trends in the northern parts of norway and sweden but based on much fewer catchments in the same studies the authors also analyzed drought deficit volumes over the period 1920 2000 and were not able to find any strong trends over sweden droughts are extreme events which by definition occur only rarely as such observations are scarce this poses challenges for meaningfully testing for the presence of trends in the frequency of occurrence of these most extreme events e g by applying the mann kendall s test the outcome of any trend detection procedure strongly depends on the selected time period hisdal et al 2001 as natural variability in hydroclimatic conditions is relatively large mao et al 2015 analyzed droughts during a 95 year long period with reconstructed hydrological variables and found that the most severe droughts did not occur only in the 21st century in other words occurrence of the most severe drought events cannot be attributed to global warming alone as the natural variability in frequency of occurrence of these events is rather high even though the record used in our study encompasses two consecutive climate normal periods it cannot be deemed sufficiently informative about rare extremes to address this issue climate reanalysis data could be used as a proxy for observed temperature and precipitation to force a hydrological model essou et al 2016 to artificially create longer data sets that might allow the assessment of truly rare events caillouet et al 2017 nonetheless our data records provide a solid basis for trend analysis in the ssi values and for exploring the significance of the differences in average drought characteristics between the two periods 1961 1990 versus 1991 2020 both of which were the focus of our study the question arises whether these observed patterns are consistent with future hydrological projections under climate change although such a comparison would be of key interest it is a difficult one to make because climate models do not directly project reliable estimates of hydrological catchments components teutschbein and seibert 2010 thus hydrological models are needed to provide dependable streamflow projections in a future climate hakala et al 2019 teutschbein et al 2011 teutschbein and seibert 2013 several recent attempts have been made to project future streamflow conditions in sweden arheimer and lindström 2015 teutschbein et al 2018 2015 teutschbein and seibert 2012 while none of these studies specifically simulated future droughts they showed tendencies towards wetter conditions for example arheimer and lindström 2015 projected temperatures to rise by 3 5 c and precipitation by 100 400 mm year in different parts of sweden by the end of the 21st century although their streamflow projections showed large uncertainties they followed a similar pattern as our observations with increasing streamflow in northern and decreasing flows in south eastern parts of sweden teutschbein et al 2015 2018 specifically computed the low flow segment of flow duration curves for a set of nested catchments in northern sweden within cluster 2 future changes varied from 40 and 170 for the period 2071 2100 which clearly indicates a lower drought risk in the future for northern catchments results from pan european drought projections e g forzieri et al 2014 marx et al 2018 roudier et al 2016a point towards similar patterns minimum flows in scandinavia and the baltic countries are expected to increase by 8 marx et al 2018 to 40 forzieri et al 2014 low flow durations will be up to 40 shorter roudier et al 2016 while deficit volumes in non frost seasons might decrease by up to 60 by the end of the 21st century forzieri et al 2014 6 5 implications for drought mitigation strategies and water management overall the existing future climate projections are in line with the direction of our observed trends due to ongoing regime shifts in northern sweden water got more equally distributed throughout the year and water availability increased which lowered the risk for cold snow season droughts and mitigated the effects of classic rainfall deficit droughts in the summer this had positive implications for water management and in particular hydropower production which is predominantly present in the northern regions hamududu and killingtveit 2012 however the ongoing warming caused an increase in the portion of liquid precipitation as opposed to snow which increased the risk for warm snow season droughts especially in northern areas our findings support our hypothesis that not all regions were affected by streamflow droughts to the same extent in fact the results suggest that the five regional clusters faced differently sized changes in drought characteristics given the ongoing shifts in the hydroclimatic drivers that control streamflow generating processes these outcomes have implications for local water management at the river basin level and in particular for the regulation of hydropower dams and storage distribution of drinking water rivera et al 2021 but also for maintenance of environmental flows vanham et al 2022 from our long data records we can learn for future developments that there is large natural variability both within and across regions particularly crucial for water resources management are however events that simultaneously alter several regions or even span over the entire country dobson et al 2020 such as the droughts of 1976 or 1996 during which more than two thirds of the country suffered from drought conditions during such large scale droughts the possibility of long distance water transfer from regions not affected by a drought to drought region is no longer given rahiz and new 2012 we argue that the future risk of droughts calls for substantial efforts by authorities to adapt at local levels as a drying trend in southern catchments requires other actions and preparedness measures than a wetting trend in other parts of the country however it should be noted that the presented study assesses droughts only as a hazard and does not account for exposure or vulnerability of the regions or compound or cascading hazard events sutanto et al 2020 to make generalizable conclusions for regional water management the entire propagation chain from precipitation and soil moisture drought to streamflow and groundwater drought would have to be explored in combination with local water demand and socio economic components and other natural hazards nonetheless we argue that region specific drought risk reduction and action plans are needed to avoid or reduce future impacts of streamflow droughts on water quality water supply hydropower production agriculture and ecosystems 7 conclusions while sweden has historically been a country abundant with water it has not been exempt of droughts numerous severe streamflow drought events have hit the country over the past 60 years of which the years of 1976 and 1996 were the most extreme and wide spread events based on a set of streamflow data from 50 gauging stations spanning a north south gradient from 68 n to 56 n and covering three different climate zones we found that southern catchments were generally more often and more severely affected than northern catchments moreover we provided evidence for a decline in drought severity over the past six decades which manifested in fewer and shorter drought events with lower deficit volumes over time thus a general wetting across the entire country prevailed especially during colder winter months only in the southernmost regions a slight drying trend in spring and summer was found our results provide a better understanding of spatiotemporal patterns of streamflow droughts and their characteristics which is crucial for regional water management and for securing the needs of the environment society and economy now and in the future we should use knowledge about past events to examine and reinforce the existing strategies for coping with droughts and thereby improve our preparedness as society and efficiency of water resources management and aid sustainability of ecosystems we argue however that more research is needed to 1 entangle the complex processes underlying streamflow drought development 2 investigate potential future implications of a continued warming and changing patterns in precipitation for streamflow droughts 3 examine corresponding human or ecosystem responses that can even further modify hydroclimatic processes at the catchment scale and thus exacerbate or even reverse existing trends and 4 provide insights on regional and sectoral drought vulnerability in sweden which may even be amplified in a future with growing anthropogenic and climate pressure credit authorship contribution statement claudia teutschbein conceptualization methodology software

7933,study region sweden study focus although sweden has historically been a country abundant with water observed changes in temperature and precipitation patterns during the past century have perturbed regional hydrologic regimes including the severity frequency and duration of streamflow droughts this study utilizes the standardized streamflow index ssi and the threshold level method to provide an unprecedented overview of spatiotemporal patterns of streamflow droughts in 50 swedish catchments over the past six decades the study catchments were categorized into five clusters of which each was analyzed for changes in various drought characteristics over the period 1961 2020 new hydrological insights for the region multiple severe streamflow drought events were detected over the past 60 years remarkably droughts in 1976 and 1996 were identified as the most extreme and wide spread events also compared to the latest 2018 drought southern catchments were generally more often and more severely affected than northern catchments our results suggest a wetting tendency over the past six decades across the entire country this occurs in conjunction with less severe shorter and less frequent droughts especially during colder winter months only in the southernmost regions a slight drying trend in spring and summer was found thus we argue that a better understanding and regional management of streamflow droughts is essential to secure the needs of the environment society and economy now and in the future graphical abstract ga1 keywords streamflow drought low flows

the negative deviation of surface and subsurface water supplies from average conditions at various points in time tallaksen and lanen 2004 wmo 2006 can cause problems for drinking water supply agriculture forestry industry energy production and can lead to a severe habitat damage swedish commission on climate and vulnerability 2007 hydrological droughts include groundwater droughts and streamflow droughts goyal et al 2017 while groundwater droughts are characterized by below normal groundwater levels streamflow droughts refer to periods when flows and water levels in a river are below a given threshold van loon 2015 hydrological droughts tend to gradually emerge over longer time scales than deficits in precipitation or soil moisture zaidman et al 2002 hydrological droughts are cumulative in nature because they become increasingly severe as long as water input into the system remains insufficient zaidman et al 2002 similar to the onset of droughts recovery from droughts is also slow due to long recharge times wmo 2006 streamflow droughts play a fundamental role in water resources management and influence the balance between in stream uses such as aquatic life and recreation and out of stream uses such as reservoir regulation smakhtin 2001 a reduction of in stream flow can cause interruptions in stream connectivity and loss of habitat lake 2003 lower stream velocities can trigger higher sedimentation rates wood and armitage 1997 which in combination with higher stream temperatures and higher concentrations of pollutants such as nitrogen lee et al 2021 also lead to deterioration of water quality van vliet and zwolsman 2008 these effects inevitably result in a loss of biodiversity which eventually alters food resources for other animals lake 2003 crop production during drought years can be substantially reduced up to 50 if irrigation is not provided campana et al 2018 droughts can severely affect hydropower production including in nordic regions jääskeläinen et al 2018 for example hydropower production by swedish hydropower stations dropped by more than 30 during droughts conditions van vliet et al 2016 negative impacts of droughts on forestry in nordic countries have frequently been reported stahl et al 2016 these severe consequences clearly illustrate the importance of knowledge about streamflow droughts for many aspects of water resources management including hydropower planning determining allowable water transfers and withdrawals or decisions regarding environmental flows it is thus essential to better understand simulate and predict streamflow droughts to secure the needs of the environment society and economy now and in the future although sweden has historically been a region abound with water it is not exempt of streamflow droughts fig 1 upper panels the 1976 northwest european drought the drought of 1996 and the 2003 european heatwave drought will long be remembered for their devastating effects in europe including scandinavia bradford 2000 fink et al 2004 the slowly developing drought in 1976 smashed records nationwide it had a relatively slow onset and resulted from a warm and dry summer following a dry winter with record rain deficits bradford 2000 stagge et al 2004 this led to reductions of annual streamflow of roughly 20 in northern sweden fig 1a center panel and 58 in southern sweden fig 1a bottom panel the 1996 streamflow drought started with precipitation deficits in late 1995 in the uk followed by an ever expanding meteorological drought in scandinavia continuing into spring 1996 this led to a considerable reduction in available water for northern europe in the early spring of 1996 which in turn caused streamflow to decrease on average by 25 in northern sweden fig 1a center panel and by 35 in southern sweden fig 1a bottom panel that year in 2003 drought conditions developed rather quickly due to a heat wave accompanied by a lack of summer rainfall euraqua 2004 annual streamflow was on average 24 below normal 20 in the north 32 in the south which caused substantial reductions in hydroelectric production energimyndigheten 2012 more recently 2016 and 2017 were rather dry years especially in southern sweden streamflow was 28 below normal and many regions issued local water use restrictions geological survey of sweden 2017 this drought continued and culminated in 2018 fig 1b which was yet another dry and unusually warm year swedish board of agriculture 2019 that led to the most serious wildfires in modern history the local 2018 this latest drought event had the epicenter over the uk and scandinavia peters et al 2020 in all cases however there were large seasonal and spatial variations in streamflow across the country fig 1a b which was likely caused by a large spatiotemporal variability in hydro climatic patterns and a complex interplay of meteorological conditions and catchment properties yet research on drought conditions and resulting hydrological impacts in sweden is still in its infancy and scientific studies dedicated to streamflow droughts in sweden are lacking even though hydropower forest industry and drinking water supply depend largely on a sufficient quantity of surface water anderegg et al 2013 barthel et al 2021 lehner et al 2005 given the large observed change in mean air temperature fig 2a accompanied by changes in mean precipitation patterns fig 2b over the past six decades we hypothesize that streamflow droughts in sweden have become more common and that not all regions are affected by streamflow droughts to the same extent to test this hypothesis we computed drought indices for 50 swedish catchments over a period of 60 years from january 1961 to december 2020 the scientific literature provides two types of indices which can be used to identify and characterize streamflow droughts from existing streamflow series 1 standardized indices that provide standardized information on drought strength and 2 threshold based indices that allow for the estimation of deficit volumes as an additional severity measure van loon 2015 in our study we combined both types of indicators we used a standardized index to compute spatiotemporal streamflow anomalies in 50 swedish catchments over a period of 60 years from january 1961 to december 2020 identified the most severe droughts and analyzed spatial prevalence of these events section 4 1 we then clustered the 50 catchments into spatially contiguous regions based on their streamflow anomalies section 4 2 to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of multiple threshold based drought characteristics across sweden section 4 3 and their patterns over time in a changing climate section 4 4 2 study area sweden spans an area of approximately 408 000 km2 slu 2015 with an elevation range of 2 2100 m a s l fig 3a more than two thirds 69 of the land area are currently covered by forests slu 2015 9 by wetlands and water bodies 8 by shrubs and grass land 8 by agriculture mostly in southern sweden 3 by human settlements urban areas and the remaining 3 are open land and glaciers fig 3b the dominant soil class is till which covers about 75 of the land area fig 3c sweden has three major climate zones fig 3d according to the köppen geiger classification beck et al 2018 the scandinavian mountains in northwestern sweden are located in the polar tundra climate zone et with monthly mean temperatures below 10 c central and northern sweden experiences a subarctic boreal climate dfc with cool summers very cold winter persistent seasonal snow cover and soil frost during winters and southern sweden is located within the warm summer hemiboreal climate zone dfb during the period 1961 2020 annual mean temperature in sweden was on average 2 6 c 3 2 c in the selected catchments while the annual precipitation averaged 784 mm 800 mm in the selected catchments during this period annual temperature has been significantly rising at a rate of 0 037 c per year at 5 significance level which adds up to a total warming of 2 2 c from 1961 to 2020 fig 2a at the same time precipitation has been increasing at a significant rate of 2 4 mm per year fig 2b which corresponds to a total increase of 144 mm or 20 for the same period average annual streamflow showed spatial variations fig 3e with the highest runoff 810 1300 mm year in the scandinavian mountains in northwestern sweden and the lowest 168 300 mm year in southeastern sweden fig 3a which reflected the spatial variations in topography fig 3a land use fig 3b soil types fig 3c and climate zone fig 3d table 1 for the subsequent analysis catchments were divided into northern catchments above 60 n and southern catchments below 60 n which corresponds to the prevailing climate conditions and streamflow regimes northern catchments featured et or dfc climates were characterized by temperature based snowmelt driven regimes with a clear snowmelt peak i e spring flood in the spring or early summer and low streamflow in the winter due to snow accumulation on the ground in contrast southern catchments exhibited a dfb climate and rainfall driven regimes with higher flows in the winter and lower flows in the summer due to high evapotranspiration demands 3 data 3 1 streamflow data daily streamflow measurements were downloaded from a publicly accessible streamflow database http vattenwebb smhi se provided by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi the data has been quality checked and is commonly used for hydrological studies in sweden as well as for national predictions warnings and statistical assessments geospatial data for the streamflow stations and their catchments was obtained from smhi s svar database eklund 2011 which offers information on more than 100 000 lakes 28 000 streams and roughly 52 000 catchments henestål et al 2015 from all these catchments we selected only 50 for this study table 1 fig 3e which had continuous streamflow measurements with gaps up to 14 days that were filled through linear interpolation during the period january 1961 to december 2020 and which were not affected by bifurcations or backwater effects 3 2 meteorological data for each of the 50 catchments gridded daily mean temperature and daily precipitation were obtained from smhi s pthbv database smhi 2005 which provides a spatially interpolated 4 km x 4 km national grid for the period 1961 2020 johansson 2002 catchment specific temperature and precipitation values table 1 were calculated by an area weighted average of all grid cells partly or fully lying within the catchment boundaries 4 methods 4 1 streamflow anomalies over space and time 4 1 1 computation of streamflow anomalies to identify spatiotemporal streamflow anomalies i e drought periods over sweden we used the standardized streamflow index ssi that was originally developed by shukla and wood 2008 and later improved by vicente serrano et al 2011 the ssi quantifies streamflow anomalies as dimensionless deviations from normal conditions it is computed by fitting a probability distribution function to the monthly streamflow series to estimate cumulative probabilities which are then transformed into so called z scores based on a normal distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation of one the ssi equals these z scores which implies that it represents the number of standard deviations away from the mean positive ssi values indicate streamflow conditions above normal while negative values represent below normal conditions the magnitude of streamflow anomalies can also be described qualitatively e g following the classification scheme originally introduced lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 for precipitation anomalies table 2 according to mishra and singh 2010 ssi is a powerful tool to characterize streamflow droughts because it can be calculated for different aggregation periods e g for 1 3 6 12 or 24 months and because it enables comparison of events across regions short aggregation periods 3 months can be useful to capture short term hydrological responses to droughts while longer aggregation periods reflect longer lasting streamflow anomalies seibert et al 2017 here we applied the ssi to identify the most severe drought periods and to identify the overall spatiotemporal patterns it should however be noted that the estimated ssi is strongly affected by the length of the streamflow record wu et al 2005 and by the chosen probability distribution function stagge et al 2015b in the literature a number of different probability distributions has been fitted to streamflow soľáková et al 2013 svensson et al 2017 vicente serrano et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2011 concluded that the use of any single distribution is inappropriate in regions with highly variable streamflow regimes given the wide north south span of our study area and the associated regional differences in streamflow regimes snow melt driven in the north versus rainfall driven in the south we tested a variety of probability distributions for each considered series obtained for 50 gauging stations 12 months of the year and 5 different aggregation periods separately we selected 16 distributions including several one two and three parameter distributions see table 3 to fit to the monthly streamflow series and applied the kuiper s goodness of fit test kuiper 1960 to decide on the best fitting distribution the kuiper test statistic is the sum of maximum negative d and maximum positive d distances between two cumulative distribution functions this test is similar to the widely known two sample kolmogorov smirnov test massey 1951 but is generally considered superior louter and koerts 1970 because it is equally sensitive at the mean and at the tails this feature makes the kuiper test especially useful in analyzing extreme events such as droughts and floods we calculated the ssi based on the following procedure i first mean monthly flows in mm month were obtained from the observed daily streamflow series this represented the one month aggregation period equaling ssi 1 ii these monthly series were further averaged over 3 6 12 and 24 months using a moving average to obtain ssi 3 ssi 6 ssi 12 and ssi 24 svensson et al 2017 for example the 3 month streamflow ssi 3 in june 1990 is the average streamflow over april may and june 1990 iii these monthly time series were split by calendar month resulting in 12 monthly series one for each month from january to december each consisting of 60 values from 1961 to 2020 for each of the five considered aggregation periods ssi 1 ssi 3 ssi 6 ssi 12 and ssi 24 for each of the 50 catchments thus a total of 3000 series were created iv sixteen candidate probability distribution functions table 3 were fitted to each of the 3000 monthly streamflow series v kuiper s test kuiper 1960 was used to decide on the best fitting distribution for every series independently vi the selected best fitting distribution for a particular series was transformed into z scores i e a normal distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation equal to 1 which directly provided the ssi values in each catchment for each calendar month and each aggregation period drought periods were identified by applying the scheme given in table 2 over the ssi values it should be noted that the ssi is based on monthly streamflow series and does not allow for a high temporal resolution i e identification of drought events of shorter durations thus in this study the ssi was used only to explore the overall large scale spatiotemporal patterns of droughts across sweden from 1961 to 2020 4 1 2 detection of spatiotemporal patterns across sweden we analyzed general spatiotemporal patterns in droughts by considering the ssi values obtained from the 5 aggregation periods jointly over the entire record period 1961 2020 and across all catchments as a result we were able to identify droughts and to analyze their spatial prevalence special emphasis in our analyses was put on evaluating potential north south patterns which we expected to emerge due to variations in evaporation as well as snow accumulation and snow melt for example we analyzed if the magnitude of a specific severe drought event was the same in the northern and in the southern catchments comparisons between drought severity in the northern catchments to the severity in the southern ones were performed based on the non parametric wilcoxon rank sum test asadzadeh et al 2014 the null hypothesis of this test is that the samples medians are equal under the underlying assumption that the two distributions have the same shape and variance montgomery and runger 2010 the test statistic is considered normally distributed for sample sizes greater than 15 kottegoda and rosso 2008 most of these analyses were based on the ssi 6 obtained from 6 month moving average flows as this particular aggregation period reflects seasonal anomalies and is regularly considered for assessment of drought impacts on freshwater ecosystems water supply hydropower production and industry faiz et al 2022 stagge et al 2015a 4 2 clustering of catchments based on streamflow anomalies to facilitate comprehensive analyses of drought characteristics across sweden a cluster analysis cattell 1943 was performed to generate five groups out of the 50 catchments five was chosen as the optimal number of groups based on the silhouette method rousseeuw 1987 which is an approach to graphically detect how close each point in a cluster is to other points within the same cluster and to points in other clusters we applied the k means clustering algorithm kaufman and rousseeuw 2009 to the 50 ssi 6 time series 6 month aggregation to generate clusters on the basis of similarity in streamflow anomalies i e general streamflow drought behavior in a preliminary analysis the clustering was also tested based on the other aggregation periods ssi 1 to ssi 24 however using a different aggregation period resulted only in minor differences 2 4 catchments ending up in another neighboring cluster and thus we deemed the clustering based on ssi 6 sufficiently robust and representative analyses of temporal patterns in the ssi values and in drought characteristics were subsequently conducted on a per cluster basis 4 3 characterization of streamflow drought events 4 3 1 identification of drought events to assess characteristics of individual drought events such as drought duration severity magnitude and frequency wanders and van lanen 2015 and to enable a statistical analysis of drought properties across sweden we applied the threshold level method originally developed by yevjevich 1967 this method is based on a predefined streamflow level below which flows are considered to be insufficient and thus to cause drought conditions this approach can be used to compute various drought properties such as drought durations deficit volumes minimum flow and time of occurrence hisdal et al 2001 van loon 2015 these estimates strongly depend on the selected threshold level fleig et al 2006 mishra and singh 2010 which is typically derived from non exceedance probabilities usually 5th 25th percentile of the flow duration curve in sweden the threshold levels are often calculated by averaging all annual minimum values based on daily streamflow over a period of 30 years naturvårdsverket 2003 this approach results in a constant value for the entire year i e no seasonal variability which is often used for long term planning of drinking water supply or irrigation and as a target for minimum environmental flows at hydropower stations vattenfall 2012 it has however been suggested that the minimum required environmental flow in sweden should be increased considerably up to a non exceedance probability of 20 q80 to support the preservation of aquatic organisms länsstyrelsen värmland 2007 as the q80 is also the most frequently applied threshold in the scientific literature heudorfer and stahl 2017 we computed the q80 in each catchment separately over the entire period 1961 2020 as a threshold for streamflow drought definition in this study however instead of calculating one fixed threshold we utilized a variable threshold for each day of the year using a moving window to account for seasonal patterns van loon 2015 as follows for each day of the year we gathered the streamflow values of the 15 days before and 15 days after that day resulting in 31 streamflow values for a single day in a specific year in a particular catchment these 31 values were selected from each year of the record period 1961 2020 providing us with 1860 values in total then the 20th percentile was computed from these 1860 values to serve as the threshold value of streamflow for that particular day in a considered catchment consequently every day of the year had a distinct streamflow threshold based on the 20th percentile of streamflow in that particular catchment on that specific day and the 15 days before and after a drought event was identified if streamflows were below the given threshold it is crucial to note that even during a longer dry period streamflow can shortly exceed this given threshold level which would cause the above procedure to identify several shorter and mutually dependent drought events instead of one prolonged dry period to avoid this splitting the time series was filtered with a 30 day backwards moving average ma pooling procedure fleig et al 2006 tallaksen et al 1997 to produce more coherent uninterrupted sequences of independent droughts tallaksen et al 2009 tu et al 2016 van loon and van lanen 2012 zelenhasić and salvai 1987 in a last step we removed minor drought events with durations of less than three days as suggested by van loon and laaha 2015 4 3 2 statistical characterization of streamflow droughts after the identification of drought events for each catchment based on the threshold level method statistical drought properties were summarized including drought duration deficit volume also known as severity magnitude and the number of drought events clausen and pearson 1995 hisdal et al 2001 drought duration d is defined as the number of consecutive time steps here days in which streamflow is below the pre defined threshold i e flow with a non exceedance probability of 20 q80 deficit volume v for a particular drought event is obtained by summing up the deviations of streamflow from the threshold value during period d and is given in millimeters to be able to compare deficit volumes or severities among different catchments we also calculated a standardized deficit volume v s as suggested by van lanen et al 2013 the standardized deficit volume is computed by dividing v by the average annual or seasonal flow and can be interpreted as the number of days with average flow conditions needed to make up the deficit van loon 2015 drought magnitude m is calculated by dividing v by duration d while the number of drought events n is a simple count of drought events over the analyzed period we used a selection of 17 drought statistics table 4 which are commonly used in the scientific literature cf clausen and pearson 1995 dracup et al 1980 hisdal et al 2001 mishra and singh 2010 vicente serrano et al 2017 yevjevich 1967 these indicators were computed separately for each catchment on an annual basis additionally both the cumulated drought duration i e number of drought days and the cumulated deficit volume were also calculated separately for each season seasons were here defined by calendar months 1 spring consists of march april and may mam 2 summer period covers june july and august jja 3 autumn refers to september october and november son and 4 winter refers to the months of december january and february djf annual and seasonal drought statistics were averaged over the entire record period to obtain one single value for each drought statistic per catchment 4 4 droughts in a changing climate we performed the mann kendall s test kendall 1938 mann 1945 and sen s slope estimate sen 1968 theil 1992 to detect potential significant trends and their signs in annual and seasonal streamflow anomalies for trends in annual streamflow anomalies we chose the ssi 12 of the month of september of each year which aggregates the 12 months of the water year i e from october of the previous year to september of the present year and thus provides a good estimate of overall streamflow conditions in each water year for seasonal trend tests we chose the ssi 3 of the last month of each season ssi 3 of may for spring mam ssi 3 of august for summer jja ssi 3 of november for autumn son and ssi 3 of february djf therefore for each catchment we obtained a series of 60 values 1961 2020 of september ssi 12 and four series of 60 ssi 3 values taken at different seasons of the year all of which were tested for trends we further assessed if annual and seasonal streamflow anomalies as well as drought characteristics during two so called climate normal periods cnps which correspond to a 30 year average of the earth s climate as defined by the world meteorological organization wmo 2020 were significantly different for this we applied the non parametric wilcoxon rank sum test montgomery and runger 2010 over two cnps from 1961 to 1990 and from 1991 to 2020 respectively all analyses related to temporal changes of droughts were conducted for the five identified clusters rather than for individual study catchments 5 results 5 1 streamflow anomalies over space and time 5 1 1 computation of streamflow anomalies selection of distributions the monthly ssis for five different aggregation periods were computed after fitting and evaluating 16 different candidate distributions to the time series of 50 different catchments separately for each of the 12 months january december from all tested distributions both the generalized extreme value and loglogistic distributions were chosen most often i e both in 13 of all cases table 5 closely followed by the weibull 11 and gamma distributions 10 exponential generalized pareto and half normal distributions were the least favorable each chosen in less than 1 of all cases table 5 while some distributions such as lognormal normal or weibull had an increasing success rate with increasing aggregation period lengths e g ssi 12 or ssi 24 other distributions such as birnbaum saunders gamma or inverse gamma showed the exact opposite behavior 5 1 2

calculated over shorter aggregation periods e g ssi 1 to ssi 6 in fig 4a c resulted in more drought events of less severity e g short mild and moderate droughts of which many become invisible as the aggregation periods lengthen e g ss12 or ssi 24 in fig 4d e this behavior is particularly pronounced during the period 1981 1991 the well remembered drought events of 1976 1996 2003 and the dry conditions in more recent years e g 2017 and 2018 are clearly visible in the ssi visualizations cf fig 4c purple annotation however these visualizations also indicate long lasting drought conditions in the early 1960 s i e 1963 and 64 in the late 1960 s i e mainly northern sweden in 1969 and 70 and drought conditions in southern sweden in the late 1980 s in total 10 drought years with different severity and different spatial extent were identified for all aggregation periods namely in temporal order 1963 1964 1969 1970 1976 1989 1996 2003 2017 and 2018 cf fig 4c turquoise annotation for each month we calculated the total number of catchments that were in drought state based on the ssi 6 values fig 5 over the 60 year record period the 1976 drought clearly sticks out as the drought that affected most catchments over the longest time in fact from april 1976 to february 1977 more than half of the catchments were either in severe or extreme drought state during the summer months june to august the situation escalated with roughly 50 of the catchments having extreme drought conditions 20 suffering from severe drought 15 from moderate to mild drought and only 15 i e 8 catchments not being in drought state similar conditions were observed 20 years later in april to june 1996 during this period all 50 catchments were in drought state in may 1996 50 of catchments suffered from an extreme drought 20 from a severe drought and the remaining 30 were either in moderate or mild drought conditions both of these drought events had the widest spatial impact with about 70 of catchments either suffering from extreme or severe drought conditions fig 5 with 50 60 of catchments suffering from extreme or severe droughts the events in 1964 2003 and 2018 also had widespread consequences but to a somewhat smaller spatial extent than the events in 1976 or 1996 fig 5 from the 10 identified drought years the droughts in 1963 1969 1970 1989 and 2017 had the smallest spatial coverage however still roughly 30 40 of catchments were in extreme or severe drought states during these events these patterns and drought years were to a large extent confirmed by analyzing the occurrence of major drought events across the country that were identified with the threshold level method for the period 1961 2020 when obtaining for each catchment the ten longest drought events of the study period the most reappearing events amongst all the catchments were those of 1970 1974 1976 1996 and 2018 the same ranking was done in terms of mean deficit volume and in this case the most reappearing drought events occurred during 1963 1970 1976 1996 and 2018 spatial differences revealed themselves both in the number of affected catchments fig 5 as well as in the average magnitude of ssi values for northern 60 n versus southern 60 n catchments fig 6 in most cases i e 1964 1970 1976 1989 2017 2018 southern catchments experienced significantly stronger i e more severe droughts than northern catchments the only exceptions were the droughts in 1969 and 2003 for which the wilcoxon rank sum test identified significantly stronger droughts in the north in 1969 mild drought conditions prevailed in the south median ssi 6 0 6 while the north was impacted by a severe drought median ssi 6 1 7 as for severity northern catchments experienced similar drought conditions in 2003 as in 1969 median ssi 6 1 6 but southern catchments were affected slightly more as they were in a moderate drought state median ssi 6 1 2 furthermore for the years 1963 and 1996 the wilcoxon rank sum test failed to reject the null hypothesis at the 5 significance level indicating that southern and northern catchments experienced droughts of similar severity this can also be seen in the spatial distribution of different severities in these two years fig 6 for which the maps do not reveal any clear north south pattern 5 2 clustering of catchments based on streamflow anomalies all 50 catchments were grouped into five homogenous clusters based on their similarity in ssi 6 streamflow anomalies five geographically distinct regions emerged from the clustering fig 7 which also distinguished themselves through varying geographic hydroclimatic and land cover characteristics table 6 catchments in cluster 1 are located in the mountainous region 623 942 m a s l of sweden within the dfc and et climate zones they receive high annual precipitation rates which lead to overall higher streamflows especially in the spring when snow is melting fig 7a these catchments are characterized by a high fraction of shrubs 46 and open land 10 catchments in cluster 2 are in the most northern parts of sweden at an elevation ranging from 255 m a s l to 645 m a s l their streamflow regime shows a distinct peak during late spring and early summer may to june and low flow during winter fig 7b cluster 2 has the largest share of surface water bodies 26 of all clusters a somewhat similar regime is shown by catchments in cluster 3 which are located in the central swedish dfc climate zone these catchments have a tendency towards an earlier spring flood peak april to may and feature a more pronounced autumn peak fig 7c compared to cluster 2 catchments in cluster 3 feature somewhat higher elevations ranging from 285 m to 758 m a s l and have large areas covered with boreal forest 65 and shrubs grassland 18 catchments grouped in clusters 4 and 5 are in the lowlands 12 240 m a s l of southern sweden they are characterized by a cfb climate mostly cluster 4 or a cfc climate mostly cluster 5 and their annual streamflow regime has low flow during the summer and higher flow during spring and winter fig 7d e large areas of these clusters are covered by forests 64 72 yet most agricultural activity in the country is also concentrated here these cluster profiles link the streamflow anomalies to the hydroclimatic conditions following the north south and elevation gradients and to landscape characteristics which strongly affect streamflow generating processes at the catchment scale each cluster also features in line with its geographical location a distinct hydrological regime ranging from snowmelt driven regimes with pronounced spring flood peaks fig 7a c to rainfall driven regimes with summer low flows in the south fig 7d e 5 3 characterization of streamflow drought events a total of 17 drought statistics table 4 was computed for each study catchment a single value per catchment of each statistic see section 4 3 2 and then presented for each cluster fig 8 these characteristics revealed clear differences across clusters cluster 1 in far north east sweden had on average the shortest duration of drought events fig 8a b and generally the lowest number of drought days fig 8c f except for the cold winter season fig 8c g it also featured the highest absolute deficit volume fig 8h i but the lowest standardized deficit volume both annually fig 8j and seasonally k n furthermore it was characterized by the highest drought magnitudes fig 8o p and one of the highest numbers of drought events fig 8q which was only topped by cluster 4 for many statistics a north south gradient i e gradual changes from cluster 1 to 5 emerged e g for drought duration fig 8a b annual number of drought days fig 8c and number of drought days in spring and summer fig 8d e as well as for standardized deficit volumes fig 8j n cluster 2 showed on average the least spread across catchments while other clusters showed a relatively large variability for some statistics in particular clusters 1 and 4 had a wide spread in absolute deficit volume fig 8h i and drought magnitude fig 8o p while clusters 3 and 5 showed a particularly large variability in drought duration fig 8a b number of drought days fig 8c g and number of drought events fig 8q cluster 5 additionally also featured the widest spread in standardized deficit volume fig 8j n 5 4 streamflow droughts in a changing climate 5 4 1 trends and changes in streamflow anomalies 1961 2020 the trend analysis revealed considerable differences among the clusters when considering anomalies in the annual streamflow conditions fig 9a the majority of catchments 74 featured a positive trend implying that streamflow conditions became wetter over time however only 12 catchments 24 mostly located in northern sweden clusters 1 and 2 exhibited significant trends which were all positive pointing towards a wetting over time only a minority of catchments 26 mostly located further south clusters 3 5 featured a negative drying yet insignificant trend at 5 level of significance this pattern was however not consistent across all seasons in fact spring mam was characterized by a strong north south pattern fig 9b with clusters 1 and 2 becoming wetter 54 of all catchments and clusters 4 and 5 drier 46 however many of the drying trends were not statistically significant only 4 catchments in the south had significant drying trends compared to 15 catchments with significant wetting trends in the north while there also seem to be spatial differences in summer jja and autumn son most of the observed trends 92 in summer and 98 in autumn respectively were not significant fig 9c d in contrast winter djf sticks out as the season with the highest proportion 92 of positive trends fig 9e implying wetting over time the majority of trends in winter 62 were significant changes over time in the streamflow anomalies across the clusters were also analyzed by comparing the anomalies between the two climate normal periods fig 10 cluster 1 in the north west of sweden experienced an overall wetting fig 10a which mostly occurred in winter and spring both significant while summer experienced only slight wetting insignificant in contrast during autumn cluster 1 exhibited a significant drying trend cluster 2 showed similar patterns as cluster 1 except for an insignificant and neglectable drying during autumn fig 10b all other seasons experienced a significant wetting over the 60 year study period cluster 3 which is located further south of clusters 1 and 2 underwent a significant wetting in winter which also caused an overall wetting on an annual basis fig 10c we did not detect any significant trends during the other 3 seasons clusters 4 and 5 both located in the southern parts of sweden experienced slight but insignificant overall wetting fig 10d e which was most pronounced and significant during winter both clusters also became significantly drier during spring overall positive changes i e wetting in the annual and winter streamflow were detected across all clusters and positive changes in the spring anomalies in the northern clusters 1 through 3 and negative in the southern clusters 4 and 5 in clusters with a large number of catchments exhibiting strong significant trends cf fig 9 significant differences in the anomalies between the two cnps were found according to the wilcoxon rank sum test e g annual spring or winter anomalies in cluster 1 fig 10 however significant differences between the two periods were obtained only rarely in clusters with a low number of catchments with significant trends such as autumn streamflow anomalies of cluster 1 summer anomalies of cluster 2 annual anomalies of cluster 3 or spring and summer anomalies of cluster 4 5 4 2 differences in streamflow drought characteristics between two climate normal periods 1961 1990 versus 1991 2020 our analysis revealed clear shifts in the drought characteristics of different clusters between the two climate normal periods 1961 1990 and 1991 2020 fig 11 it should however be noted that only about one third of the detected drought transitions was significant at the 5 significance level according to the wilcoxon rank sum test the duration of drought events declined in all five cluster groups which is shown both in the average fig 11a and maximum drought duration fig 11b those shifts were significant only for clusters 1 and 2 and 4 for average duration a pronounced variability in the changes in drought duration are apparent in clusters 2 4 and 5 the number of drought days per year declined significantly in all clusters except for the southernmost cluster 5 fig 11c a gradual north south pattern emerged with northern clusters experiencing a stronger decline the change in number of drought days varied considerably among seasons and clusters in spring fig 11d only the northern clusters 1 3 experienced a significant decline in summer fig 11e only the southernmost cluster 5 increased significantly during autumn fig 11f none of the clusters underwent a significant change while all clusters had significantly fewer drought days in winter during the second period 1991 2020 fig 11g most of these changes i e annual spring and winter exhibited a gradual pattern reflecting milder decrease towards the south shifts in absolute drought deficit were mostly insignificant fig 11h i apart from cluster 4 which showed a somewhat stronger decline in the deficit volume compared to other clusters especially a significant decline in the maximum deficit fig 11i the shifts in standardized deficit volume indicated a clear north south gradient fig 11j with relatively little change in the north and stronger changes in the south where catchment 5 featured a pronounced significant decline however the patterns differed seasonally with spring fig 11k summer fig 11 l and autumn fig 11 m mostly featuring weak and insignificant changes only winter season experienced stronger declines across all clusters of which cluster 1 3 and 5 exhibited significant changes fig 11 n transitions in drought magnitude fig 11o p were significant only for cluster 5 that showed a decline over time similarly cluster 4 experienced a strong but insignificant decline in drought magnitude while drought magnitudes in catchments of clusters 2 and 3 on average did not change significantly between the two periods conversely average annual drought magnitude in the north west of sweden cluster 1 increased however these changes were not statistically significant according to the wilcoxon rank sum test the total number of drought events fig 11q declined in all clusters except for cluster 5 but only the northernmost clusters 1 and 2 featured significant and strong trends changes in the number of drought events largely follow a gradual north south pattern from a decrease in the north to a slight increase in the south 6 discussion 6 1 identification of drought events our analysis of streamflow anomalies over space and time was based on the standardized streamflow index ssi over several different aggregation periods by testing a wide range of possible candidate distributions for each catchment each aggregation period and each month of the year we ensured an optimal fit in each case to increase the robustness of our results the selection of a best fitting distribution varied across catchments and aggregation periods while loglogistic generalized extreme value and weibull distributions provided the best fit more often than other candidate distributions there was generally not a single best fitting distribution these distributions have different features for example two of them have two parameters and only one is applied with the log transformed data based on earlier findings by vicente serrano et al 2011 these results are not surprising as the authors already stated over a decade ago that each theoretical distribution assumption has one or more limitations that influences their suitability for obtaining robust standardized streamflow series what is surprising however is that many recent publications utilizing the ssi e g abdelkader and yerdelen 2022 bevacqua et al 2021 botai et al 2021 lee et al 2022 taraky et al 2021 wu et al 2022 xing et al 2021 zalokar et al 2021 applied one preselected probability distribution most often gamma instead of assessing several candidate distributions such an approach would have resulted in an optimal fit in only 10 of all cases in our study features of different hydrologic regimes as well as the length of an aggregation period greatly affect statistical moments of the monthly flow series considering the differences in the statistical properties of these series it should become a standard practice to evaluate a wide range of candidate probability distributions not only one distribution function with catchment and aggregation period specific parameters to ensure reliable assessments especially in large ensemble studies across different hydroclimatic conditions and regimes 6 2 clustering of catchments based on streamflow anomalies five regions with homogeneous behavior in streamflow ssi 6 anomalies emerged from the clustering approach differences in streamflow patterns in these clusters were reflected by variations in independent cluster properties including geographical location latitude longitude elevation and climate characteristics the clusters identified in our study resembled to some extent the official swedish river basin districts fig 12 that were established in response to the european water framework directive directive 2000 60 ec 2000 however there were also some differences which imply that caution is needed in interpreting cluster based results in the context of river basin districts cluster 1 was the one that differed most from the boundaries of the swedish river basin districts this cluster has a somewhat special status as it stretches over two river basins and over two districts but includes only the highest elevation headwater catchments catchments at this elevation feature a different type of vegetation and land use compared to lower lying catchments at similar latitudes which naturally also affects their streamflow regimes and particularly their drought behavior cluster 2 lies completely within the bothnian bay district while cluster 3 is situated within the bothnian sea district cluster 4 matches the skagerrak and kattegat district while cluster 5 spreads over both the northern and southern baltic sea districts our results clearly show that no grouping of catchments into different districts or regions is sufficiently versatile to reflect all properties of hydrologic regimes and that groups of catchments might vary depending on the features that the grouping clustering is based upon 6 2 1 overall spatiotemporal patterns in streamflow droughts standardized indices such as the ssi are considered to be rather convenient measures for drought comparison across different regions mishra and singh 2010 van loon 2015 however they are often less useful for practical water management purposes as they do not quantify needs or conditions in a specific catchment such as water demand in an easily interpretable way mishra and singh 2010 thus the ssi was used in this study solely to identify the most drought prone regions i e regions with high drought hazard which according to the latest definitions by the united nations office for disaster risk reduction merely reflects a process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life injury or other health impacts property damage social and economic disruption or environmental degradation undrr 2019 despite this limitation the ssi based approach allowed us to identify overall spatiotemporal patterns in streamflow anomalies i e drought periods over sweden and to identify five distinct regions in sweden by clustering the study catchments based on these anomalies by also using a threshold based approach we were able to reaffirm the results from the indicator based assessment and complemented these analyses by statistically analyzing trends and differences in annual and seasonal streamflow characteristics identification of drought events provides a useful reference to place more recent drought events into an appropriate context despite clearly depending on the chosen aggregation period the ssis obtained for the five aggregation periods all revealed 10 drought years with different severity and different spatial extent namely 1963 1964 1969 1970 1976 1989 1996 2003 2017 and 2018 although not all these drought years seem to be remembered by the general public e g the authors were unaware of drought events in the 1960 s and 70 s these years are in line with historic drought reporting in national newspapers e g atterstam 2003 beckerman and larsson ask 1996 tt nyhetsbyrån 1989 the ongoing public discussion often focuses on the most recent drought events of 2017 and 2018 which have been pointed out as historic or unprecedented droughts dauschy 2018 mcelwee 2018 while these events were undoubtedly included in the list of the top 10 drought events over the past 60 years in our study these statements are hydrologically speaking not correct in fact we found the droughts of 1976 and 1996 to be the most severe events as they had the most extreme drought conditions i e the strongest deviations from normal conditions and affected the largest number of catchments across sweden this discrepancy between hydrological facts and public debate indicates a weak collective memory of the swedish society viglione et al 2014 defined collective memory as the capacity of a society to keep awareness of a risk high pfister 2011 even argues that the collective memory of natural disasters such as flood and droughts is relatively short lived in our globalized world we here argue that given a projected warming and changing climate and severe drought events already recorded we can and should constantly learn from the past events and should as a society not forget about past events these past drought events demonstrated that southern catchments often suffered from significantly stronger i e more severe droughts than the northern ones the only exceptions were the years of the 1969 and 2003 droughts for which we found significantly stronger droughts in the north these findings highlight that the complex interplay of hydroclimatic conditions and physical processes at the land surface can influence the evolution and the propagation of droughts in different regions peña gallardo et al 2019 in fact fleig et al 2011 argued that different atmospheric conditions have a key role in the development of individual drought events consequently even regions that are commonly known for their abundance of water are not exempt from droughts as corroborated by our results 6 3 streamflow drought characteristics for a more detailed quantification of streamflow drought characteristics at a finer temporal resolution i e on a daily basis the threshold level approach was utilized this approach provided information on drought frequency duration and severity for the period 1961 2020 as well as over the two climate normal periods 1961 1990 and 1991 2020 this method is more suitable for water management purposes than the ssi as it can serve as a point for action van loon 2015 for example it can be used for assessing environmental flows required to preserve aquatic ecosystems länsstyrelsen värmland 2007 however the threshold level method is sensitive to numerous pre defined parameters that control the pooling of droughts tallaksen et al 2009 tu et al 2016 van loon and van lanen 2012 and removal of minor drought events heudorfer and stahl 2016 tallaksen et al 1997 van loon 2015 zelenhasić and salvai 1987 both of which can affect identification of drought events and consequently cause uncertainties in estimated drought characteristics previous studies showed that the approach for setting the threshold primarily impacts droughts of short durations while its impact drops with increasing drought duration heudorfer and stahl 2017 the focus of our study was primarily on analyses of spatiotemporal patterns and an inter comparison of drought characteristics across a large sample of catchments rather than on accuracy of the estimates of drought characteristics per se furthermore we followed the same methodology across all catchments and in all periods to identify drought events including removal of minor events and consequently their characteristics thus we deem that the impact of the threshold selection and removal of minor drought events on our conclusions was largely reduced heudorfer and stahl 2017 the computed drought characteristics were not consistent across the clusters clusters 1 and 2 in the north generally experienced shorter and less severe droughts than clusters in the southern regions such spatial differences in drought characteristics were also found in other studies in comparable climate zones e g for the 2006 drought in finland gao et al 2016 for the 2015 drought in canada szeto et al 2016 or for the 2018 drought in norway bakke et al 2020 seasonal differences that can be linked to the underlying streamflow regimes in the clusters were found in our study while all clusters can suffer from streamflow droughts caused by a rainfall deficit during any season van loon and van lanen 2012 catchments within clusters 1 2 and 3 in the northern parts of the country are additionally prone to other drought types which include 1 rain to snow season droughts in autumn and winter that are caused by a prolonged lack in rainfall in summer autumn that continues into the snowy winter season 2 cold snow season droughts that are caused by a prolonged winter season meaning that precipitation falls as snow over a longer than normal period and 3 warm snow season droughts in spring summer due to a shortened winter season that causes precipitation to fall as rain over a longer than normal period and implies smaller amounts of water stored in the snowpack these drought types are the reason for a higher number of winter drought days in clusters 1 3 and more autumn drought days in clusters 2 and 3 in contrast clusters 4 and 5 are more prone to wet to dry season droughts in spring and summer which occur due to a rainfall deficit in winter spring that continues into the dry summer season thus droughts in these southern regions are predominantly related to precipitation van loon and van lanen 2012 this is reflected in the higher number of drought days in spring and summer in these clusters 6 4 streamflow droughts in a changing climate this paper reveals a tendency towards wetter conditions across the country our results suggest an overall increase in the annual ssi in all 5 clusters which is consistent with the detected decrease in drought durations frequencies and severities these results generally do not support our hypothesis that streamflow droughts in sweden have become more common our examination indicates the opposite tendency implying that increasing annual precipitation and higher temperatures have overall lead to an increase in streamflow in the majority of catchments however a more precise analysis of seasonal shifts provided a clearer picture of the dynamics and patterns over the past 60 years although the majority of drought characteristics pointed towards wetter conditions we observed a drying trend based on the ssi 12 values in spring in clusters 4 and 5 as well as in summer in clusters 3 and 5 in these southern regions the number of drought days in summer slightly increased while they decreased in all other seasons these changes suggest a shift in the prevailing streamflow regimes and delineate two distinct regions with different temporal evolution of droughts northern parts clusters 1 3 versus southern parts clusters 4 5 in the northern temperature and snowmelt driven catchments warmer temperatures 0 9 to 1 5 c and in particular the strong increase in winter temperatures 2 3 c compared to 0 6 c in summer caused more precipitation to fall as rain instead of snow which led to more streamflow during winter an earlier onset of snowmelt also pushed the spring flood peak towards earlier dates which caused more streamflow in the spring at the same time increasing precipitation 3 to 18 outweighed the effects of increasing temperatures and evapotranspiration during summer leading to an overall wetting of the catchments in the southern catchments with rainfall driven regimes winter streamflow was less affected by warming temperatures 1 0 to 1 3 c as there was only little to no snow in these areas to melt however the winter streamflow in these clusters increased due to the increasing precipitation 5 to 16 in spring and summer the increase in precipitation was not as pronounced so changes in drought characteristics where somewhat outweighed by increasing temperatures and evapotranspiration rates these results confirm earlier findings from large scale pan european studies on droughts for example gudmundsson and seneviratne 2015 found overall wetting trends in the standardized precipitation index on an annual and seasonal basis which are in line with the increasing precipitation values over our study area these changes in precipitation manifested themselves in streamflow changes and stahl et al 2010 highlighted that low flows have increased i e became less severe in most winter low flow regimes e g norway sweden and finland in another european study that also included 9 streamflow stations in sweden stahl 2001 found slightly negative trends in annual standardized maximum deficit volume in northern catchments no significant trends in central sweden and slightly positive trends in southern areas for the period 1962 1990 these results were somewhat different from ours as we could not observe significant trends in annual standardized deficit volumes in the northern parts and found contrasting to stahl 2001 a wetting trend in the south one possible explanation for this discrepancy might be the different length of the study period which was much shorter in the study of stahl 2001 this highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate record length to avoid uncertainties link et al 2020 we believe that our study which was based on a larger ensemble of streamflow stations and on a period more than twice as long provides a reliable representation of spatial drought patterns across sweden in fact our patterns are consistent with findings in other studies in comparable climate zones for example asong et al 2018 and yang et al 2020 studied trends in hydrological droughts over canada and detected a wetting in northern areas and a drying in southern areas in finland korhonen and kuusisto 2010 discovered significant streamflow shifts in line with what we observed in northern sweden which lead to less severe low flow conditions at about half of their study sites wilson et al 2010 found similar spatial patterns in mean streamflow with mostly weak and insignificant trends in the south and stronger wetting trends in the northern parts of norway and sweden but based on much fewer catchments in the same studies the authors also analyzed drought deficit volumes over the period 1920 2000 and were not able to find any strong trends over sweden droughts are extreme events which by definition occur only rarely as such observations are scarce this poses challenges for meaningfully testing for the presence of trends in the frequency of occurrence of these most extreme events e g by applying the mann kendall s test the outcome of any trend detection procedure strongly depends on the selected time period hisdal et al 2001 as natural variability in hydroclimatic conditions is relatively large mao et al 2015 analyzed droughts during a 95 year long period with reconstructed hydrological variables and found that the most severe droughts did not occur only in the 21st century in other words occurrence of the most severe drought events cannot be attributed to global warming alone as the natural variability in frequency of occurrence of these events is rather high even though the record used in our study encompasses two consecutive climate normal periods it cannot be deemed sufficiently informative about rare extremes to address this issue climate reanalysis data could be used as a proxy for observed temperature and precipitation to force a hydrological model essou et al 2016 to artificially create longer data sets that might allow the assessment of truly rare events caillouet et al 2017 nonetheless our data records provide a solid basis for trend analysis in the ssi values and for exploring the significance of the differences in average drought characteristics between the two periods 1961 1990 versus 1991 2020 both of which were the focus of our study the question arises whether these observed patterns are consistent with future hydrological projections under climate change although such a comparison would be of key interest it is a difficult one to make because climate models do not directly project reliable estimates of hydrological catchments components teutschbein and seibert 2010 thus hydrological models are needed to provide dependable streamflow projections in a future climate hakala et al 2019 teutschbein et al 2011 teutschbein and seibert 2013 several recent attempts have been made to project future streamflow conditions in sweden arheimer and lindström 2015 teutschbein et al 2018 2015 teutschbein and seibert 2012 while none of these studies specifically simulated future droughts they showed tendencies towards wetter conditions for example arheimer and lindström 2015 projected temperatures to rise by 3 5 c and precipitation by 100 400 mm year in different parts of sweden by the end of the 21st century although their streamflow projections showed large uncertainties they followed a similar pattern as our observations with increasing streamflow in northern and decreasing flows in south eastern parts of sweden teutschbein et al 2015 2018 specifically computed the low flow segment of flow duration curves for a set of nested catchments in northern sweden within cluster 2 future changes varied from 40 and 170 for the period 2071 2100 which clearly indicates a lower drought risk in the future for northern catchments results from pan european drought projections e g forzieri et al 2014 marx et al 2018 roudier et al 2016a point towards similar patterns minimum flows in scandinavia and the baltic countries are expected to increase by 8 marx et al 2018 to 40 forzieri et al 2014 low flow durations will be up to 40 shorter roudier et al 2016 while deficit volumes in non frost seasons might decrease by up to 60 by the end of the 21st century forzieri et al 2014 6 5 implications for drought mitigation strategies and water management overall the existing future climate projections are in line with the direction of our observed trends due to ongoing regime shifts in northern sweden water got more equally distributed throughout the year and water availability increased which lowered the risk for cold snow season droughts and mitigated the effects of classic rainfall deficit droughts in the summer this had positive implications for water management and in particular hydropower production which is predominantly present in the northern regions hamududu and killingtveit 2012 however the ongoing warming caused an increase in the portion of liquid precipitation as opposed to snow which increased the risk for warm snow season droughts especially in northern areas our findings support our hypothesis that not all regions were affected by streamflow droughts to the same extent in fact the results suggest that the five regional clusters faced differently sized changes in drought characteristics given the ongoing shifts in the hydroclimatic drivers that control streamflow generating processes these outcomes have implications for local water management at the river basin level and in particular for the regulation of hydropower dams and storage distribution of drinking water rivera et al 2021 but also for maintenance of environmental flows vanham et al 2022 from our long data records we can learn for future developments that there is large natural variability both within and across regions particularly crucial for water resources management are however events that simultaneously alter several regions or even span over the entire country dobson et al 2020 such as the droughts of 1976 or 1996 during which more than two thirds of the country suffered from drought conditions during such large scale droughts the possibility of long distance water transfer from regions not affected by a drought to drought region is no longer given rahiz and new 2012 we argue that the future risk of droughts calls for substantial efforts by authorities to adapt at local levels as a drying trend in southern catchments requires other actions and preparedness measures than a wetting trend in other parts of the country however it should be noted that the presented study assesses droughts only as a hazard and does not account for exposure or vulnerability of the regions or compound or cascading hazard events sutanto et al 2020 to make generalizable conclusions for regional water management the entire propagation chain from precipitation and soil moisture drought to streamflow and groundwater drought would have to be explored in combination with local water demand and socio economic components and other natural hazards nonetheless we argue that region specific drought risk reduction and action plans are needed to avoid or reduce future impacts of streamflow droughts on water quality water supply hydropower production agriculture and ecosystems 7 conclusions while sweden has historically been a country abundant with water it has not been exempt of droughts numerous severe streamflow drought events have hit the country over the past 60 years of which the years of 1976 and 1996 were the most extreme and wide spread events based on a set of streamflow data from 50 gauging stations spanning a north south gradient from 68 n to 56 n and covering three different climate zones we found that southern catchments were generally more often and more severely affected than northern catchments moreover we provided evidence for a decline in drought severity over the past six decades which manifested in fewer and shorter drought events with lower deficit volumes over time thus a general wetting across the entire country prevailed especially during colder winter months only in the southernmost regions a slight drying trend in spring and summer was found our results provide a better understanding of spatiotemporal patterns of streamflow droughts and their characteristics which is crucial for regional water management and for securing the needs of the environment society and economy now and in the future we should use knowledge about past events to examine and reinforce the existing strategies for coping with droughts and thereby improve our preparedness as society and efficiency of water resources management and aid sustainability of ecosystems we argue however that more research is needed to 1 entangle the complex processes underlying streamflow drought development 2 investigate potential future implications of a continued warming and changing patterns in precipitation for streamflow droughts 3 examine corresponding human or ecosystem responses that can even further modify hydroclimatic processes at the catchment scale and thus exacerbate or even reverse existing trends and 4 provide insights on regional and sectoral drought vulnerability in sweden which may even be amplified in a future with growing anthropogenic and climate pressure credit authorship contribution statement claudia teutschbein conceptualization methodology software

7934,study region irtysh river basin a transboundary river laying in the north hemisphere and serving as a home for around 15 million people in china kazakhstan and russia study focus considering existing pressures of climate change and anthropogenic activities on water resources this research aims to evaluate recent 2010 2022 trends in research about a state of the art of the river in a matter of relationships between hydrological budget water quality biodiversity and policy issues a literature review was carried out in english chinese and russian languages for defining key issues in the river management new hydrological insights for the region melting of permafrost glaciers and snow in the upstream mountains of the river should be considered as one of the key processes in the hydrological budget however the high impact of evapotranspiration rate could offset the effect of the increased melting rate along the basin efficient operating of existing large dams and reservoirs and the planning of future installations deserves special attention in assurance of the respective water level for restoration of the ecological diversity of the basin implementation of water saving techniques and restoration of tributaries of irtysh also play a significant role in keeping the resilience of the river handling historical and existing contamination will also guarantee restoration of the river health the basin management still lacks tripartite agreement however the principles of hydrosolidarity and no harm effect are followed by involved countries graphical abstract ga1 keywords irtysh river basin literature review hydrological budget water quality biodiversity policy 1 introduction the latest intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report has claimed that climate change is intensifying the water cycle with consequences such as more intense rainfall and associated flooding or more intense drought in many regions these processes put significant pressure on surface water including on rivers dai 2016 main expectations for north and north east asia regions are shrinking of permafrost volume with further global warming precipitation is projected to continue to increase and cause almost double the annual maximum river discharge with increased flooded area in major siberian rivers by mid 21st century ipcc 2021 rivers of the eurasian region have already experienced an increase in drainage into the arctic ocean due to increased melting of suprapermafrost pi et al 2021 environmental implications on the hydrological balance of the river basin management in the region due to the effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change has been well documented in scientific investigations xenarios et al 2021 thus these challenges should be mitigated in future with the support of the respective analysis of existing related risks and discussions by key stakeholders irtysh river basin here and after irb river or basin is a transboundary river spanning 4248 km originating from the border region between mongolia and china and flowing through china kazakhstan and russia before joining with ob river at khanty mansiysk and entering into the arctic ocean from khanty mansiysk upwards the irb occupies a drainage area of about 165 104 km2 with a drainage area distribution of mongolia 1 china 2 9 kazakhstan 53 1 and russia 44 xia et al 2015 the main territory of the basin serves as a living space for approximately 15 million people the river is the main source of water in the region which brings its highest value in social economic industrial energy generation and irrigation activities krasnoyarova et al 2019 fig 1 the previous research represented rich and contradictory history of the river basin management and its consequences huang et al 2013 detected that climate has changed in the irtysh river basin during the first half of the 1970 s with the increase of the annual minimum temperature by more than 2 c yang et al 2012 investigated the impact of the man made reservoirs on a parameter of ecological flow along the whole length of the river and concluded that the minimum instream ecological flow is increasing from upstream to downstream the flows in may july are larger than in other months some studies state that the hydrological regime of the river at the lower reaches was mildly affected by the reservoirs at the upper reaches for the period 1936 1999 while anthropogenic activities and climate change did not have a significant influence on the annual runoff of the river huang et al 2012 research by galperin and chigrinets 2017 revealed that the sum of runoff from both china and regional tributaries was considered enough for domestic use and even for transferring water to balkhash lake in case of emergency even possibilities to import water for aral sea schuiling and badescu 2010 or for syr darya river medeu et al 2019 from irtysh have been investigated at the same time there have been some debates about ambitious but hardly realistic projects to restore irtysh itself torkunov et al 2011 by transferring water from other sources for example from katun river a tributary of the ob river krasnoyarova et al 2019 hrkal et al 2006 highlighted a concern about the future of irtysh in 2006 with regards to the impact of anthropogenic activities on the river including ecological issues such as a close location of the semipalatinsk nuclear polygon the influence on water quality from the industrial complexes in the cities situated within the riparian zone of the basin a transboundary status of the river and impact of the created dams along the stream presently there are major concerns regarding the future of the river which can be characterized by two group of origins the first group is related to the potential impact of climate particularly the effects of increased precipitation and intensive snowmelt padalko 2021 the second group is related to the transboundary nature of the river and the potential increase in consumption especially upstream zhiltsov et al 2018 these factors may lead to the contradictory consequences in future from potential depletion of water in the basin to the potential flooding in the region both scenarios may deteriorate the health and functionality of the river and demands improved management of the river based on reliable monitoring and investigations within the irb hülsmann et al 2019 have stated that management and assessment of water resources should be performed considering the perspective of ecosystem with regards to interlinkages between water related sectors and resources in a comprehensive way the similar approach of comprehensive evaluation of the pressure on water energy food ecology systems in central asia has been proposed by qin et al 2022 an idea is to investigate relationships between energy and food sectors on the one hand and environmental degradation and increasing pressure on regional finite water resources on the other hand guidelines from united nations environment programme unep for vulnerability assessment of freshwater resources to environmental change propose the following framework to evaluate the status of surface water bodies huang and cai 2009 according to this framework an intensive study on relevant literature is used to diagnose the issues about 1 estimation of the amount of water resources in both state and trends 2 water development supply and use data including a description of infrastructure and analysis of water use by sectors 3 ecological health data with the main focus on water quality and with interest for biodiversity and 4 management capacity with investigating institutional and transboundary issues all the approaches aim to define actions needed for the efficient management of the water resources this paper presents an attempt to evaluate existing risks and future perspectives of the irtysh river by reviewing the most recent research trends in empirical investigations of the basin authors aim to assemble available information about the current status of irtysh river from the perspective of the ecosystem approach when hydrological status of the water body is evaluated by research in the topics of water quantity water quality biodiversity and policy issues local and transboundary accordingly the main objectives of this study are to identify actual challenges and to consider following pathways needed for management of the river 2 methodology the rationale for performing this review was to cover all available and relevant sources of information in three languages chinese russian and english the first source of information was on macrolevel generated by reports from governmental quasi governmental and intergovernmental organizations they included primary data about characteristics of regions belonging to the river including socio economical such as population industry agriculture etc hydro climatic such as precipitation discharge water quality etc and information about agreements commitments and plans to manage the river on the regional and transboundary scale the second source of information was a traditional literature review on peer reviewed english language journals in scopus with additional selection of some publications in russian and chinese languages from local scientific databases as the problem of predatory publishing exists in the countries of interest e g machacek and srholec 2021 the main criteria for choosing selected publications were consideration of the sources of the publications they might be peer reviewed and have reliable bibliometric and historical reputation on a regional level and recommended by local governmental committees for control in the sphere of education and science publications in scientific journals excluded from scientific databases were not reviewed either the articles content of which have been considered as discredited due to their unfit information with officially available data and or another research to obtain the freshest picture publications covering a study period between 2010 and 2021 were chosen for this review in total 64 research paper have been selected as eligible for chosen criteria table 1 as a result of performed review key topics of the hydrological issues include i interactions between water bodies dynamics and geo meteo climatic factors such as precipitation temperature evapotranspiration oscillation land use changes etc ii snowcover mass trends in the headwater of the river iii investigations of the river management and its effect on water balance with the particular focus on iv the impact of dams and hydropower reservoirs research on water quality issues cover i investigations of current trends in water quality in the river ii assessment of potential impact from existing and future sources of contamination and iii assessment of already affected areas by the river and respective response the section on biodiversity reviews the topics of i value of biodiversity systems of the river and belonged ecosystems ii fish assemblage and influencing factors iii studies about the potential for fisheries development iv emerging issue of opisthorchiasis and v insights about rare species in the river studies of the policy issues discuss i the status of the cooperation between china and kazakhstan ii the water relations between kazakhstan and russian federation and iii the absence of tripartite agreements regarding the river spatial distribution of the investigations from the reviewed studies is presented in fig 2 3 study area the headwater part of the irb is mostly located in china characterized by high mountainous areas top peak 4374 m a s l with permafrost and glaciers but also with forest and grassland although the long term precipitation trend in the upper reach is almost constant indicating a relatively stable rainfall distribution 300 320 mm year for the headwater it has been considered as the runoff generating area for the middle reach located in kazakhstan since the middle reach is an arid and semi arid region jiang et al 2016 the research has also concluded that the long term monthly temperature distribution follows a nice normal distribution with the highest temperature in july 22 ºс and lowest in january 20 ºс while the monthly precipitation distribution showed a double peak pattern for july and november climate within the basin on the kazakhstani territory varies between mountain area on the south east to flat plain towards the north west direction in terms of temperature regime and in the amount of precipitation the sharp continentality of the desert and semi desert areas of the region is significantly smoothed out in the mountainous and foothill areas january is the coldest month when the average temperature varies between 12 c and 19 c with a minimum of 45 and 49 c respectively the average monthly temperature of the warmest month july is 20 22 c while the annual air temperature shows an increasing trend fig 3 there is a tendency to a slight decrease of the temperature during the winter seasons kazhydromet 2020a the annual amount of precipitation is distributed unevenly fig 4 400 650 mm falls in the north east of the basin mountainous and foothill areas and the least amount of precipitation falls in the areas of intermontane depressions less than 200 mm per year precipitation of the warmest period march october is greater than the precipitation experienced during the colder periods december march on the territory of kazakhstan irtysh comes from china and is also fed by tributaries of ishim ulba tobol and other small rivers burlibayeva et al 2016 precipitation including in the form of snow and groundwater originated in altay mountains also contribute to the river significantly radelyuk et al 2021a trends of the river flow on the kazakhstani territory can be seen in fig 5 all gauge measurements indicate a slight but constant decrease of water flow during the peak seasons when snowmelt occurs since 2016 the peak values of the flow for the stations ulba and semiyarka occur in april due to their locations regarding the cascade of reservoirs which reflects storing water during this month in may water is disposed from the reservoirs which is reflected in the peak values of the flow for the stations pavlodar zhanabet and priirtyshskoe the peak value for the station kara ertis in june can be explained by the receiving of the snowmelt from the chinese part of the basin by this month the difference in the values of average annual flow between the stations of kara ertis and ulba 280 and 94 m3 s respectively and the next observation point semiyarka 967 m3 s can also be explained firstly by the location up and downstream relatively to the cascade of reservoirs and secondly by the delivery of water from ulba river after that observation point the average flow shows a slight decrease with relatively steady values for the last observation points on kazakhstani territory 891 and 886 m3 s for zhanabet and priirtyshskoe respectively the irtysh river basin contributes 30 of the total water runoff to the overall water availability in kazakhstan which is the highest rate among the country anon 2017 specific surface water availability is equal to 15 4 thousand m3 per person in the basin the research by karatayev et al 2017 has shown that 9 9 of total available water in the basin has been used in electricity generation in kazakhstan official statistics bureau of national statistics 2020 2021a 2021b have shown that trends of water abstraction and water use for industrial and domestic purposes in general remains steady with a slight decrease fig 6a c while there is a sharp jump in the pavlodar region for water use for agricultural needs in 2017 fig 6d data from anon 2021 have shown that despite the growth of population in two out of three regions situated within the basin in russia and related growth of water intake and disposal implementation of rational water use strategy has led to a decline in water use since 2018 figs 7a and 7b respectively 4 hydrological status the most recent research from huang et al 2021 has used remote sensing techniques to quantify dynamics of water bodies along the whole irtysh river basin and to estimate influence of the major factors such as temperature precipitation evapotranspiration and snow water equivalent it has been identified that the total surface water area has shown an increasing trend since 1990 at a rate of 2922 km2 year the same growth has been identified for middle irtysh river basin mirb which mainly characterizes the sub basin of the main stream coefficients of variation of the mirb for permanent and seasonal water areas have shown relatively small values which indicates that water is distributed uniformly the factor of evapotranspiration has had the highest impact on total surface water area in mirb among others leading to increased water consumption while temperature has had the smallest contribution rate therefore an interaction between different factors for mirb has shown a relatively slight tendency relationship between surface water body area swa and terrestrial water storage tws showed an abrupt change in 2007 swa showed growth while tws started to descend significantly with the lowest value in 2012 the same results of a little effect of precipitation as well as of the amount of runoff on tws have been obtained by yang et al 2020a decline in tws of the basin could be explained as caused by diminishing of glaciers and snow in the upstream area of mirb in the altay mountains in northern xinjiang during previous years according to wu et al 2021 snowmelt runoff at the headwaters of the irtysh river of the chinese altai mountains in northern xinjiang constituted 29 3 of total runoff in the river basin for the period 2000 2016 a study of snow hydrological processes in chinese altai mountains during 1961 2015 has shown that the period from april to june contributes up to 58 1 of annual runoff by meltwater in the southern slope of the middle altai mountains zhang et al 2017a yang et al 2019 have investigated this issue in detail for the whole basin in northern xinjiang of china and concluded that firstly snow cover mass declines at a rate of 10 2 mt per year or 0 3 per year and secondly the related loss of freshwater service contributes about 19 implying that there would be a significant underestimation of service loss if only water supply is considered while gao et al 2021 have reported no significant changes in the snow depth snow water equivalent snow days and the start time of snow accumulation in the basin from 2001 to 2017 the trend of a shift to earlier snow cover melting in the upper irtysh basin coupled with a decrease in late spring snow depth and snow cover duration had been identified dai and che 2014 zhang et al 2021 have focused their research on the impact of a cascade of hydropower plants located in the northern xinjiang on environment and society the analysis has been based on data of streamflow between 1959 and 2012 and considering data of water demand for the same period these hydropower plants were estimated to guarantee 95 of water supply for domestic and industrial purposes 90 for ecological baseflow and for northern xinjiang and 75 for agricultural irrigation it has been found that the designed water supply guarantee rates can be met on the sufficient level for socio economic benefits and also for restoration of the ecological diversity in the region there is a large cascade of reservoirs on the territory of kazakhstan on the river huang et al 2014 have tested difference between the pre dam and post dam seasonal discharge on the kazakhstani territory using the lepage test it has been found that precipitation over the irtysh river basin changed little before and after the operation of the reservoir which means that changes along the streamflow mainly depend on a control of water storage in the reservoirs in the middle reaches of the river beysembaeva et al 2016 have studied flow characteristics after the start of operation of the upper irtysh river cascade of reservoirs and found that summer flow decreased by 38 for the period 1935 2010 while winter flow increased by 70 for the same period the research by smagulov et al 2019 has calculated scenarios for water balance in the kazakhstani site of irtysh based on retrospective data and assumptions if water consumption remains on the current level positive scenario or increases intensively negative scenario fig 8 the results have shown that annual flow would decrease in both scenarios a slight deficit approx 2 km3 has been forecasted for the zones between a kazakhstani chinese border and bukhtarma reservoir zone i between bukhtarma and schulba reservoirs zone ii and between schulba reservoir and a border between east kazakhstan and pavlodar regions zone iii in the positive scenario if a situation with water consumption follows the negative scenario the deficit increases significantly for the zone i more than 7 km3 in 2050 with a serious decrease of annual flow from 29 2 to 16 1 km3 nevertheless tributaries of irtysh in zone iv between the pavlodar region and a russian kazakhstani border would supply enough water to avoid a deficit in future if the situation remains unchanged russian site of irtysh river is highly concerned about both quantity and quality of the water in the river as it receives them after two countries zonn et al 2018 noted that compared to the 1990 s the irtysh flow in russia has fallen on three occasions the omsk hydrological station has been used to determine the impact of upstream cascade reservoirs on instream ecological flow in the study from li et al 2018 the results have shown that at the start of operations of two out of three reservoirs upstream omsk hydrological station built in 1959 led to uneven distribution of annual flow volumes after 1959 the study emphasizes the same conclusion about efficient operation of the reservoirs on mutual agreement gusev et al 2019 assessed possible scenarios of variations in water balance in the basin the results have shown that areas of relatively small runoff of the irtysh can be found in the southern russian part of the irtysh basin and northern kazakhstan these areas risk to increase and extend southward by 2045 2070 also there are studies about water loss in water supply from the river due to poor conditions of water supply networks in russia kondratyeva et al 2021 therefore there are attempts to implement water saving techniques and to better manage the river for example an updated wastewater treatment unit has been successfully launched in omsk city that has led to a reduction of the intake of water from the river as well as eliminating the discharge of the contaminated wastewater into the river alekseev 2018 5 water quality scientific literature gives poor information about water quality in the upper reaches of the basin while china is well aware of the challenges of increased water use the pollution problem has been ignored in a recent study deng 2014 has identified a top ten list of strategically important challenges to tackle for the future including ecosystem protection and eco environmental protection together with traditional issues involved in integrated water resources management iwrm where the key issue is the general water use efficiency according to the classification of water bodies irtysh has been rated differently in two regions of kazakhstan where the river flows kazhydromet 2020b the water quality in the pavlodar region has been considered suitable for all purposes including fishery domestic recreation irrigation etc class 1 the water in the east kazakhstani region has been ranked on class 4 which means that the water body can not be recommended for fisheries domestic purposes it is possible to use only in case of intensive treatment and recreation mainly suspended matters have exceeded permissible levels at the monitoring points these exceedances have been observed downstream at the point of wastewater discharged by industrial enterprises or after the ust kamenogorsk reservoir also severe pollution has been detected downstream at the cross section with the ulba river tributary with the exceeding of concentrations of suspended matters and manganese it can also be pointed out that toxicity tests have shown a high level of toxicity in tributaries for example the death rate of indicators daphnia magna in samples from ulba varied between 13 3 and 100 with an average of 60 between winter and summer 2020 high density of industrial capacity along the river generates historical and current contamination in kazakhstan both regions east kazakhstani and pavlodar highly contribute to the industrial development of the country as a sound example burlibayeva et al 2016 have analyzed a connection between recent characteristics of the hydrochemical regime and toxicological indicators near the city of ust kamenogorsk the authors have assessed firstly an ecological status regarding the maximum permissible concentrations mpc of the major pollutants such as salt content biochemical oxygen demand bod5 phosphate si fe cu zn ni cr6 pb v hg cd mn as volatile phenols petroleum products fluorides oxidizability and nitrogen using data from republican state enterprise kazhydromet and secondly toxicological tests have been applied to selected water samples phytoplankton and daphnia have been used as bioindicators the water quality has been recognized as relatively clean on the sampling point near the china kazakhstani boundary boran village exceptionally rare exceedings of heavy metals and organic compounds during the flooding seasons the slight increase in concentrations but still below or around mpc of potentially toxic metals such as copper iron and manganese phosphorus and nitrogen have been detected on the following sampling points located near the cascade of reservoirs and big cities this fact most probably can be explained by runoff from the territory of large settlements and industrial enterprises however severe contamination has been investigated in one of the tributaries near mine discharge where concentrations for copper reached 37 fold and 51 fold mpc for zinc 215 fold mpc and manganese to 19 6 fold mpc also biotesting results have shown a high level of acute toxicity of water samples in tributaries where the survival rate of most water samples was lower than 46 7 combination of those results says about a necessity to pay more attention to the methods and programs of the assessment of the water quality in the river as there is a high risk of severe pollution historical experiments of explosions of a nuclear weapon on a former semipalatinsk semey test site have also been considered as a potential threat for irtysh solodukhin et al 2015 have carried out laboratory studies of radiation near the segment of irtysh river and its tributary shagan river which belonged to the test site results of radionuclide and elemental compositions of water objects water bottom sediment have shown a safe status however it has been found that the content of some elements li be b v cu sr mo slightly increases downstream which requires extra investigations the same situation remains for potential mercury contamination by former mercury cell chlor alkali plant operated in pavlodar northern kazakhstan many research have proved e g ullrich et al 2007 guney et al 2021 that there is no transport towards the river however there is still public concern about a potential threat also some potential sources of pollution make concern about a potential impact on water quality for example issakhov and zhandaulet 2021 have developed a numerical model to analyze the impact of thermal pollution from a future nuclear power plant in result there is a recommendation to keep the temperature value below 3 c at a discharge rate of 1 0 m s to avoid a negative effect on aquatic life complaints come from the territory of russia about water quality in irtysh after it flows from kazakhstan kondratyeva et al 2021 with the reference to the annual bulletin of the omsk region government and the ministry of agriculture and food of the omsk region have reported that the content of chemical oxygen demand cod iron copper and aluminium slightly but permanently exceed threshold limit values tlv near omsk city russia experiences the same issues with current and historical water contamination like kazakhstan chemagin 2020 has carried out a chemical analysis of bottom sediments along 179 km of the river and found a periodic excess of oil products in there the author has linked this fact with activities of river piers and ship repair sections of the river fleet releases of sewage treatment facilities from big cities and industry also first order tributaries contribute to mineralization processes of the river where related parameters exceeded the parameters in irtysh two fold mihailova et al 2019 gulchenko and bazhenova 2016 have used phytoplankton as indicators of water pollution near omsk city it has been found that the most influential factors were flowrate temperature and chemical and biochemical oxygen demand cod and bod most of the phytoplankton species have been indicators of severe pollution what reflexed the respective polluted status of the river in the investigated area evaluation of flora and fauna of the floodplain in the right bank of the lower reaches of the river has shown that plant communities of the irtysh river are stressed by anthropogenic invasion from the deteriorated quality of water supplied which lead to the disruption of natural ecosystems including a decrease in species diversity density and biological productivity at the test sites popova 2019 6 biodiversity there is a general increasing concern of environmental protection and biodiversity consideration in china among decision makers in a recent large scale campaign an integrated investigation was carried out on areas of the upper irtysh which is classified as the national natural reserve where the basin wide biodiversity the flora and fauna community structure as well as socio economic characteristics have been analyzed wang et al 2017 in a recent attempt sun and zhou 2020 used a quantification method based on a chinese standard to calculate and quantify the economic values of various ecosystem services in the upper reaches of irtysh the results of this study have shown that fuyun and altai farms have the largest total value and the most dominant contribution for all the farms come from water conservation fig 9 besides the water and soil conservation the value of ecosystem services also includes carbon sequestration and oxygen release nutrient accumulation biodiversity and atmospheric cleaning the chinese section of the irtysh river is considered an area with a broader range of fish assemblages according to zheng et al 2018 that research has aimed to characterize the food web of the river on the chinese site with a particular focus on potential effects of resource availability and flooding regime on food web trophodynamics one of the main conclusion was that flooding scouring and dam construction plays an important role in trophic structure and impacted the hydrological regime which regulates availability and distribution of primary and secondary food resources regions with higher trophic positions and food chain length at the upper reach were noted to have high availability of food resources and more fish species insectivorous and piscivorous fish borisenko et al 2013 have attempted to carry out substantial work in identification of distribution of fish in the lower irtysh basin during summer periods the following representatives were found acipenser ruthenus sterlet coregonus muksun muksun rutilus rutilus roach leuciscus idus ide l leuciscus dace abramis brama bream car assius carassius crucian carp c auratus golden carp perca fluviatilis perch gymnocephalus cernuus ruff stizostedion lucioperca pikeperch esox lucius pike and lota lota burbot the juveniles in a family of cyprinids rutilus leuciscus abramis and carassius dominated and represented over 80 of fish abundance areas of a large floodplain complex and within limits of a riverbed depression seemed to be the most attractive places as there were found the maximum density of the fish aggregation also it has been found that the downstream migration of juveniles takes place at nights in narrow floodplain channels with no cloudiness or rapid streams the intensity of brief movements of fish is also synchronized with the change of day and night in channels with turbid flow though the relationship is reverse maximum activity is observed during the day investigation of the effect of water level and temperature on the fish population has been carried out in the floodplain channel complex of the lower irtysh during the spring flood season chemagin 2019 the place is recognized as a good fit for feeding and a spawning place for various species of fish results showed that the density of fish decreased from 4 to 13 times due to their migration to the floodplain during the 30 days observation period it can be concluded that low temperature serves as a signal there is a risk for reduction of the success of catching prey which makes fish staying in the main channel also the predominant migration of small fish from the mainstream to tributaries was observed during the period of water level increase which could be explained by attempts to decrease the density of aggregation and to survive another study by mochek et al 2015 also has investigated factors of water level local environmental conditions such as depth substrates patterns and diurnal cycle on fish distribution on the fish distribution in the same area the level of illumination was rated as the most influential factor most migration with the significantly higher density was observed during nights the largest proportion of these fish was represented by early juveniles not exceeding 2 cm in body length also chemagin 2018 has observed that in the zones of vortices along the river the number of fish is on average 2 times higher compared with the no vortices zones at the same depth there are also attempts to restore fauna of the river for example larvae and juveniles were artificially grown with the enriched nutrition to increase their growth and survival potential korentovich and litvinenko 2018 there is a huge potential to develop fisheries for example research from luan et al 2021 has shown that the population of northern pike spreading from the mainstream of irtysh to connected water bodies with a low risk of extinction xie et al 2019 have investigated the influence of environmental factors on the population of phoxinus ujmonesis the results have shown that abiotic factors like dissolved oxygen ph total dissolved solids and conductivity in water as well as biotic factors like plankton diversity and fish species diversity might contribute to genetic diversity and divergence in the population in the region analysis of growth natural mortality and maturity for a fishery species european bream abramis brama from the family cyprinidae in the downstream section of the irtysh river in china have been performed ding et al 2019 the authors have proposed to increase the minimum age limits by increasing mesh sizes of fishing nets to conserve the a brama stock in the region as there is a higher risk of growth overfishing than that of recruitment overfishing also the abundance of benthic organisms might be a more important influencing factor of growth rate compared to the latitude according to zhang et al 2016 additionally zhang et al 2017b have highlighted that a brama in the lower reaches of the irtysh river is vulnerable to overexploitation due to relatively late reproductive maturity in their life span maturity for a short period and spawns in aggregations fish processing enterprises are also located in the irtysh zaysan basin with the largest in the pavlodar karaganda and ust kamenogorsk regions park et al 2020 studies of the characteristics of biodiversity in the kazakhstani section of irtysh indicate that opisthorchiasis is widespread home animals of the habitants in rural settlements of the region especially cats and dogs are fed by unprepared fish from the river which highly contribute to the existence of opisthorchiasis foci proskurina et al 2020 akhmetov and maralbayeva 2020 have investigated the fish trematodes fauna in the pavlodar region and found that the maximum intensity and prevalence of infection 7 9 94 4 respectively was in stomach and esophagus of pikes the infection rate of b luciopercae maritas in fish of the region was estimated as 40 the prevalence of invasion of s bramae ranged from 6 7 to 26 09 as a result most human cases of opisthorchiidosis have been found in the north and northeast part of kazakhstan in areas drained by the irtysh river and its tributaries sultanov et al 2014 the same problem related to the distribution of parasites in fish exists in russia investigations of the invasion of the most widespread fish family in lower irtysh cyprinidae have shown that 13 species of trematodes occupied all representatives of the family liberman 2020 a significant infection of bream abramis brama linnaeus 1758 with opisthorchiasis has been revealed in the lower irtysh by liberman and voropaeva 2018 despite ordinary habitats specific for the river fauna is represented also by some rare species for example european freshwater mussels including a unique u tumidus haplotype of a relict origin has been found in east kazakhstan in samples from the black irtysh river and the bukhtarma reservoir bolotov et al 2020 babushkin et al 2021 new species of calanoida diaptomus chaetodiaptomus mirus and gigantodiaptomus irtyshensis have also been discovered in east kazakhstani waters of irtysh krupa and aubakirova 2021 the richness of biodiversity is still being investigated for example bazhenova et al 2019 has recently described plankton diatoms from the middle part of the river with the first appearance of 61 species in the studied sector chinese site is also a home of very rare aquatic species such as freshwater sculpins cottus dzungaricus belonging to order osteichthyes family scorpaeniformes and genus cottidae yang et al 2020b 7 policy this section can be formally divided into two parts first part can be dedicated to regional legislation where the issues related to local management are described second part can be about transboundary relationships relevant agreements and commitments and related issues kazakhstan and russia have the same system of river management based on the basin management ministry of ecology geology and natural resources 2019 russian federation 2006 the basin inspection regulates the use and protection of the river by establishing and control of water use limits water balances by basins control over the observance of the boundaries of water protection zones and strips etc therefore the inspection does not rule the characteristics of discharge to the river and does not control water quality this functional belongs to the committee of environmental regulation and control the discharge characteristics are established based on the volume of effluents while the content and a potential impact on the flora and fauna are barely considered radelyuk et al 2021b according to the order from ministries of agriculture anon 2015 2020 irtysh river belongs to the list of fishery water bodies of international significance it means that the most stringent requirements are imposed for water quality of the respective water body ministry of national economy 2015 anon 2016 tributaries of irtysh also belong to this list however they are also recipients of discharges from mines and open pits the literature review reveals several important and interesting points in sense of multilateral agreements most researchers have admitted the 1997 unece water convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes unece water convention as an unbiased guideline for the management of transboundary rivers while china still has yet to ratify this convention there is a solid enough cooperation with neighbouring countries in a matter of shared rivers biba 2014 biba has analyzed the recent status of the cooperation between china and neighbourhoods aiming to approve or disregard a role of china as dangerous hegemon in controlling its upstream rivers including irtysh in 2004 the chinese government affirmed plans to use a max of 40 of the irtysh to provide water to the karamay oil fields and to construct a canal to divert water from the river to lake ulungur in xinjiang allouche 2007 the major concern has been about dam building and river rerouting activities with possible negative ecological economic and political consequences the outcomes of the study showed that even beijing deals with a domestic water crisis the principle of peaceful development has been promoted by authorities with consideration of the needs of downstream countries in the context of irtysh river the author has highlighted that the chinese government clearly agreed to institutional design to manage shared water resources between two countries china and kazakhstan which resulted in two key agreements agreement on cooperation in the use and protection of transboundary rivers 2001 and agreement on the protection of the water quality of transboundary rivers 2011 moreover these agreements were followed by respective joint commissions with the developed program for actions to solve all the addressed issues within the constant meetings zonn et al 2018 ziganshina and janusz pawletta 2020 have investigated these agreements and concluded that following important issues are defined in mutual respect and with the pathway to dialogue promotion of the exchange of hydrological and water chemical data assurance of the optimal use of water resources water quality control and prevention of pollution of transboundary rivers to reduce the impact on the environment and society to the lowest possible level coupled with actions to avoid man made accidents to take obligation to take measures and to respond in emergencies several authors e g zhiltsov et al 2018 stewart raf 2014 ho 2017 have noted that china intensified the negotiation process with kazakhstan and made incentives for cooperation park et al 2020 also have highlighted that a potential failure in the mismanagement of water resources can not be explained by the concept of hydro hegemonism only the authors have clarified the importance of both institutionalizing cooperation and establishing communication at societal governmental and inter governmental environmental levels effective implementation of an analysis of ecological risks aims to help stakeholders in decision making and to avoid a passive state of the parties kukeyeva et al 2015 have added to this idea a concept of sustainable development the authors have proposed seeking for water efficient technologies for all sectors for example for farmers to achieve environmental sustainability and greater social harmony russia has long been concerned about upstream watercourse impact due to the reason that there are no tripartite agreements regarding irtysh river krasnoyarova et al 2019 collaboration between russia and kazakhstan has been seeking for different forms to establish efficient and sustainable use of irtysh particularly in issues of runoff control management of infrastructure regulatory basement and water quality e g vinokurov et al 2018 rybkina and sivokhip 2019 an ideal option to create a commonly ruled basin wide joint inspection could probably fail due to lacking respective political will boklan and janusz pawletta 2017 the water relations between kazakhstan and russian federation are regulated by the agreement on joint use and protection of transboundary water bodies signed in october 2010 zhiltsov et al 2018 this agreement considers mutual efforts and information exchange in terms of quality and quantity of water supply therefore there are still no enough data for researchers and stakeholders to effectively predict and propose patterns for sustainable river management e g vasilenko 2015 the parties have emphasized the importance of cooperation programs for the conservation and restoration of ecosystems of the basins within 2021 2024 the programs assume joint monitoring of the water quality of the river by respective scientific investigations with particular focus on identification of the sources of contamination development of programs for recultivation remediation and modernization of existing treatment facilities to restore the river the inclusion of representatives of the russian federation in the interdepartmental commission on the use of the cascade of reservoirs in kazakhstan and permanent exchange of the relevant information anon 2021 8 discussion padalko 2021 has identified a decreasing trend in water consumption in russia and kazakhstan while china sees steady growth for the last decade specifically for the irtysh river basin irrigation and agricultural water use went down by 18 6 domestic and industrial water use fell by 15 8 special attention should be paid to the conditions of tributaries of the river in kazakhstan as currently they supply a sufficient amount of water and support to avoid a deficit of the mainstream observations of the increase of water supply by slightly increased precipitation and more intensive snowmelt potentially caused by climate change have been mainly confirmed by various researchers for example the results of the investigation of the processes of spring floods in the light of snowmelts in eastern kazakhstan indicated high influence of winter arctic oscillation on patterns of snow cover depletion over the region which plays important role in the generation of annual runoff into the river fugazza et al 2020 melting of permafrost glaciers and snow in the upstream mountains of the river should be considered as one of the key processes in the hydrological budget the amount of snow storage shows a relatively slight decrease which causes higher water supply into the stream however the high impact of evapotranspiration rate could offset this effect spring season of the snowmelt along the whole basin coupled with specific melting of snow and glaciers in the mountains during april june can be considered as an advantage in the management of the reservoirs used as hydroelectric power plants located on the mainstream however there is a slight trend of a shift to earlier snow cover melting which should be considered the main point about reservoirs is not a fact of their existence in each country but ways of operating them based on mutual collaboration as changing water inflows is a function of energy system dynamics the planning of future installations and operating already existing reservoirs deserves special attention previous plans aimed to assure water quantity on the respective level for restoration of the ecological diversity of the basin therefore some authors raise a significant concern about the development of the xinjiang region and the building of the black irtysh karamay urumqi canal systems with the expected increase of water consumption for 50 of irtysh volume in future e g krasnoyarova et al 2019 zonn et al 2018 biba 2014 hopefully parties would follow the principles of hydrosolidarity sustainable development and circular economy via implementation of water saving techniques seeking for the no harm principle special attention must be paid to water quality issues as these are followed by restoration of ecosystems and people health e g water from irtysh has been directly used by rural habitants tussupova et al 2016 china is recognized as one of the most important countries that promoted a circular economy concept mathews and tan 2016 this concept has been recently introduced in the country and has led to more careful management of water resources including the elimination of water pollution nowadays the main focus on a chinese site has to be on remediation programs of historical sources of contamination e g jia et al 2019 while the kazakhstani site still generates contamination main problems of water quality issues in kazakhstan come mainly from two sources of the pollution first the high density of industrial capacity along the river which generates historical and current contamination second the run off from the riparian surface industry in kazakhstan takes advantage of loopholes in environmental legislation to pollute the river and its tributaries according to the entrepreneurial code kazakhstan 2015 industrial inspections are carried out once per six months with the preliminary notification at least thirty calendar days before the start of the inspection thus businesses use the opportunity to prepare for the inspections in advance and to fix inconsistencies temporarily radelyuk et al 2019 while the mainstream tends to self purification and shows a good status of water quality the water quality in tributaries especially where risks of contamination are high should be focused on methods of assessment and quality of monitoring of the river lacks efficiency as they give a wrong picture of the current status of the river and should be revised standardization of monitoring and evaluation approaches across the basin can allow for a more fair and objective assessment of the issues being experienced in the basin and thereby allowing for a more targeted approach to address these issues also there is a critical lack of research about assessment and monitoring of persistent organic pollutants pesticides pharmaceuticals microplastic etc review of biodiversity status has identified three major issues of the river a status of living species and their interactions with conditions of the river problems related to parasites and opportunities for fisheries biodiversity along the stream indicates the current good status of the river in general including discovery and distribution of new exotic species the following factors have been identified as comfort for fish distribution along the river the large floodplain complexes limited riverbed depression appropriate water quality parameters and biotic factors like plankton diversity and fish species diversity to ensure a food chain therefore redistribution of water flow appeared after construction of a cascade of reservoirs negatively affects conditions of the regional floodplain for example 90 of all the kazakhstani floodplain of the river are located in the pavlodar region while the fluctuation of flow remained relatively unchanged 4 6 for the period until 2010 a huge amount of warmed water after heat exchangers increased mineralization which might affect soil and living species beysembayeva and bazarbekov 2015 thus these risks should be considered while planning the following ways of irtysh use including for fisheries the main recommendation to provide sustainable fisheries is to consider vulnerability of the fish to overexploitation during the periods of maturity and spawns in aggregations the third identified issue parasites cause inconvenience for their hosts and first and second order consumers and demands proper outreach and communication to the people therefore the behavior of parasites can be used for scientific monitoring of dynamic processes related to the river such as the investigation of the impact of anthropogenic activities or climate change palm 2011 the section on policy can be the hottest topic in a matter of the irb all involved countries consider the challenges listed above and implement respective legislation on a local scale develop restoration programs invest into minimization of water consumption and seek alternative or recycling sources of water the major point that has been raised by many researchers is lacking trilateral agreement for the river management based on searching for consensus e g ziganshina and janusz pawletta 2020 zhiltsov et al 2018 boklan and janusz pawletta 2017 the reasons for it are underlying beyond the will of academic society the main concern can be a denial from the chinese side to ratify the unece water convention however researchers mainly evaluate actions of china as peaceful development institutional cooperation and joint commissions seem to be the right response to support the common aim of a restoration of the river this is also in line with the institutional capacity development in china as a general trend yang et al 2016 this research uses ecosystem or water energy food ecology nexus approach to see the correlations between reviewed factors for example the issues with earlier snow cover melting time may positively impact energy generation in reservoirs improve fisheries and to supply enough water for consumption in the mid term perspective however the tendency of the slight decrease in the amount of snow storage can be recognized as a problem itself and may cause negative consequences for the basin in the long term perspective another example is the interaction between water quality and biodiversity while there are possibilities for fisheries the current poor ecological status of the river causes risks of eliminating this opportunity or disseminating the contaminated fish to consumers which affects the food chain of the river the policy issues cover all the reviewed factors as they have power to restore the river on an appropriate level for use in the involved countries and to assure the good status of the health of the river 9 conclusion this research attempts to identify current challenges for irtysh river considering the overview of scientific investigations of the basin for the last decade the challenges are supposed to be mitigated to ensure the good status of the irtysh river in a matter of its sufficiency for ecological balance domestic use and living species the state of the hydrological budget can be classified as stable while contrary processes exist in the basin projected increase in water consumption in upstream and a higher rate of evapotranspiration from one site and slowly but permanently increased snowmelt and precipitation rate from another thus risks related to the impact of climate change and responsible water use should be considered and prevented involved countries should pay special attention to issues of water contamination both historical and permanent via respective remediation programs and implementation of restrictive legislation these programs should be based on a unified and transparent monitoring system of the river where all data will be available to all parties to make reasonable decisions on water management assurance of sufficient water quantity and water quality creates comfortable conditions for sustainable biodiversity management which include stability of food chain and ecosystems and perspectives for fisheries development one of the important actions to achieve the established aims is the building up of a connection for efficient data exchange and information dissemination between governments involved the latest investigations also present opportunities to manage the basin more efficiently using the remote sensing techniques authors believe that international collaboration should start on an academia level at first it will provide a more detailed and reliable assessment of the existing challenges of the river on the whole basin scale involvement of multidisciplinary researchers will let to evaluate the complex system of the river basin with the following best scientific based suggestions for key stakeholders for the sustainable river management thus this research can be used as a starting point for future investigations of issues described in the paper obviously this research has a limitation in the lack of full access to all data available in three countries to obtain a better picture of the processes within the basin the proposal for future research is to close existing gaps and to provide a more detailed basis for investigations credit authorship

7934,study region irtysh river basin a transboundary river laying in the north hemisphere and serving as a home for around 15 million people in china kazakhstan and russia study focus considering existing pressures of climate change and anthropogenic activities on water resources this research aims to evaluate recent 2010 2022 trends in research about a state of the art of the river in a matter of relationships between hydrological budget water quality biodiversity and policy issues a literature review was carried out in english chinese and russian languages for defining key issues in the river management new hydrological insights for the region melting of permafrost glaciers and snow in the upstream mountains of the river should be considered as one of the key processes in the hydrological budget however the high impact of evapotranspiration rate could offset the effect of the increased melting rate along the basin efficient operating of existing large dams and reservoirs and the planning of future installations deserves special attention in assurance of the respective water level for restoration of the ecological diversity of the basin implementation of water saving techniques and restoration of tributaries of irtysh also play a significant role in keeping the resilience of the river handling historical and existing contamination will also guarantee restoration of the river health the basin management still lacks tripartite agreement however the principles of hydrosolidarity and no harm effect are followed by involved countries graphical abstract ga1 keywords irtysh river basin literature review hydrological budget water quality biodiversity policy 1 introduction the latest intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report has claimed that climate change is intensifying the water cycle with consequences such as more intense rainfall and associated flooding or more intense drought in many regions these processes put significant pressure on surface water including on rivers dai 2016 main expectations for north and north east asia regions are shrinking of permafrost volume with further global warming precipitation is projected to continue to increase and cause almost double the annual maximum river discharge with increased flooded area in major siberian rivers by mid 21st century ipcc 2021 rivers of the eurasian region have already experienced an increase in drainage into the arctic ocean due to increased melting of suprapermafrost pi et al 2021 environmental implications on the hydrological balance of the river basin management in the region due to the effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change has been well documented in scientific investigations xenarios et al 2021 thus these challenges should be mitigated in future with the support of the respective analysis of existing related risks and discussions by key stakeholders irtysh river basin here and after irb river or basin is a transboundary river spanning 4248 km originating from the border region between mongolia and china and flowing through china kazakhstan and russia before joining with ob river at khanty mansiysk and entering into the arctic ocean from khanty mansiysk upwards the irb occupies a drainage area of about 165 104 km2 with a drainage area distribution of mongolia 1 china 2 9 kazakhstan 53 1 and russia 44 xia et al 2015 the main territory of the basin serves as a living space for approximately 15 million people the river is the main source of water in the region which brings its highest value in social economic industrial energy generation and irrigation activities krasnoyarova et al 2019 fig 1 the previous research represented rich and contradictory history of the river basin management and its consequences huang et al 2013 detected that climate has changed in the irtysh river basin during the first half of the 1970 s with the increase of the annual minimum temperature by more than 2 c yang et al 2012 investigated the impact of the man made reservoirs on a parameter of ecological flow along the whole length of the river and concluded that the minimum instream ecological flow is increasing from upstream to downstream the flows in may july are larger than in other months some studies state that the hydrological regime of the river at the lower reaches was mildly affected by the reservoirs at the upper reaches for the period 1936 1999 while anthropogenic activities and climate change did not have a significant influence on the annual runoff of the river huang et al 2012 research by galperin and chigrinets 2017 revealed that the sum of runoff from both china and regional tributaries was considered enough for domestic use and even for transferring water to balkhash lake in case of emergency even possibilities to import water for aral sea schuiling and badescu 2010 or for syr darya river medeu et al 2019 from irtysh have been investigated at the same time there have been some debates about ambitious but hardly realistic projects to restore irtysh itself torkunov et al 2011 by transferring water from other sources for example from katun river a tributary of the ob river krasnoyarova et al 2019 hrkal et al 2006 highlighted a concern about the future of irtysh in 2006 with regards to the impact of anthropogenic activities on the river including ecological issues such as a close location of the semipalatinsk nuclear polygon the influence on water quality from the industrial complexes in the cities situated within the riparian zone of the basin a transboundary status of the river and impact of the created dams along the stream presently there are major concerns regarding the future of the river which can be characterized by two group of origins the first group is related to the potential impact of climate particularly the effects of increased precipitation and intensive snowmelt padalko 2021 the second group is related to the transboundary nature of the river and the potential increase in consumption especially upstream zhiltsov et al 2018 these factors may lead to the contradictory consequences in future from potential depletion of water in the basin to the potential flooding in the region both scenarios may deteriorate the health and functionality of the river and demands improved management of the river based on reliable monitoring and investigations within the irb hülsmann et al 2019 have stated that management and assessment of water resources should be performed considering the perspective of ecosystem with regards to interlinkages between water related sectors and resources in a comprehensive way the similar approach of comprehensive evaluation of the pressure on water energy food ecology systems in central asia has been proposed by qin et al 2022 an idea is to investigate relationships between energy and food sectors on the one hand and environmental degradation and increasing pressure on regional finite water resources on the other hand guidelines from united nations environment programme unep for vulnerability assessment of freshwater resources to environmental change propose the following framework to evaluate the status of surface water bodies huang and cai 2009 according to this framework an intensive study on relevant literature is used to diagnose the issues about 1 estimation of the amount of water resources in both state and trends 2 water development supply and use data including a description of infrastructure and analysis of water use by sectors 3 ecological health data with the main focus on water quality and with interest for biodiversity and 4 management capacity with investigating institutional and transboundary issues all the approaches aim to define actions needed for the efficient management of the water resources this paper presents an attempt to evaluate existing risks and future perspectives of the irtysh river by reviewing the most recent research trends in empirical investigations of the basin authors aim to assemble available information about the current status of irtysh river from the perspective of the ecosystem approach when hydrological status of the water body is evaluated by research in the topics of water quantity water quality biodiversity and policy issues local and transboundary accordingly the main objectives of this study are to identify actual challenges and to consider following pathways needed for management of the river 2 methodology the rationale for performing this review was to cover all available and relevant sources of information in three languages chinese russian and english the first source of information was on macrolevel generated by reports from governmental quasi governmental and intergovernmental organizations they included primary data about characteristics of regions belonging to the river including socio economical such as population industry agriculture etc hydro climatic such as precipitation discharge water quality etc and information about agreements commitments and plans to manage the river on the regional and transboundary scale the second source of information was a traditional literature review on peer reviewed english language journals in scopus with additional selection of some publications in russian and chinese languages from local scientific databases as the problem of predatory publishing exists in the countries of interest e g machacek and srholec 2021 the main criteria for choosing selected publications were consideration of the sources of the publications they might be peer reviewed and have reliable bibliometric and historical reputation on a regional level and recommended by local governmental committees for control in the sphere of education and science publications in scientific journals excluded from scientific databases were not reviewed either the articles content of which have been considered as discredited due to their unfit information with officially available data and or another research to obtain the freshest picture publications covering a study period between 2010 and 2021 were chosen for this review in total 64 research paper have been selected as eligible for chosen criteria table 1 as a result of performed review key topics of the hydrological issues include i interactions between water bodies dynamics and geo meteo climatic factors such as precipitation temperature evapotranspiration oscillation land use changes etc ii snowcover mass trends in the headwater of the river iii investigations of the river management and its effect on water balance with the particular focus on iv the impact of dams and hydropower reservoirs research on water quality issues cover i investigations of current trends in water quality in the river ii assessment of potential impact from existing and future sources of contamination and iii assessment of already affected areas by the river and respective response the section on biodiversity reviews the topics of i value of biodiversity systems of the river and belonged ecosystems ii fish assemblage and influencing factors iii studies about the potential for fisheries development iv emerging issue of opisthorchiasis and v insights about rare species in the river studies of the policy issues discuss i the status of the cooperation between china and kazakhstan ii the water relations between kazakhstan and russian federation and iii the absence of tripartite agreements regarding the river spatial distribution of the investigations from the reviewed studies is presented in fig 2 3 study area the headwater part of the irb is mostly located in china characterized by high mountainous areas top peak 4374 m a s l with permafrost and glaciers but also with forest and grassland although the long term precipitation trend in the upper reach is almost constant indicating a relatively stable rainfall distribution 300 320 mm year for the headwater it has been considered as the runoff generating area for the middle reach located in kazakhstan since the middle reach is an arid and semi arid region jiang et al 2016 the research has also concluded that the long term monthly temperature distribution follows a nice normal distribution with the highest temperature in july 22 ºс and lowest in january 20 ºс while the monthly precipitation distribution showed a double peak pattern for july and november climate within the basin on the kazakhstani territory varies between mountain area on the south east to flat plain towards the north west direction in terms of temperature regime and in the amount of precipitation the sharp continentality of the desert and semi desert areas of the region is significantly smoothed out in the mountainous and foothill areas january is the coldest month when the average temperature varies between 12 c and 19 c with a minimum of 45 and 49 c respectively the average monthly temperature of the warmest month july is 20 22 c while the annual air temperature shows an increasing trend fig 3 there is a tendency to a slight decrease of the temperature during the winter seasons kazhydromet 2020a the annual amount of precipitation is distributed unevenly fig 4 400 650 mm falls in the north east of the basin mountainous and foothill areas and the least amount of precipitation falls in the areas of intermontane depressions less than 200 mm per year precipitation of the warmest period march october is greater than the precipitation experienced during the colder periods december march on the territory of kazakhstan irtysh comes from china and is also fed by tributaries of ishim ulba tobol and other small rivers burlibayeva et al 2016 precipitation including in the form of snow and groundwater originated in altay mountains also contribute to the river significantly radelyuk et al 2021a trends of the river flow on the kazakhstani territory can be seen in fig 5 all gauge measurements indicate a slight but constant decrease of water flow during the peak seasons when snowmelt occurs since 2016 the peak values of the flow for the stations ulba and semiyarka occur in april due to their locations regarding the cascade of reservoirs which reflects storing water during this month in may water is disposed from the reservoirs which is reflected in the peak values of the flow for the stations pavlodar zhanabet and priirtyshskoe the peak value for the station kara ertis in june can be explained by the receiving of the snowmelt from the chinese part of the basin by this month the difference in the values of average annual flow between the stations of kara ertis and ulba 280 and 94 m3 s respectively and the next observation point semiyarka 967 m3 s can also be explained firstly by the location up and downstream relatively to the cascade of reservoirs and secondly by the delivery of water from ulba river after that observation point the average flow shows a slight decrease with relatively steady values for the last observation points on kazakhstani territory 891 and 886 m3 s for zhanabet and priirtyshskoe respectively the irtysh river basin contributes 30 of the total water runoff to the overall water availability in kazakhstan which is the highest rate among the country anon 2017 specific surface water availability is equal to 15 4 thousand m3 per person in the basin the research by karatayev et al 2017 has shown that 9 9 of total available water in the basin has been used in electricity generation in kazakhstan official statistics bureau of national statistics 2020 2021a 2021b have shown that trends of water abstraction and water use for industrial and domestic purposes in general remains steady with a slight decrease fig 6a c while there is a sharp jump in the pavlodar region for water use for agricultural needs in 2017 fig 6d data from anon 2021 have shown that despite the growth of population in two out of three regions situated within the basin in russia and related growth of water intake and disposal implementation of rational water use strategy has led to a decline in water use since 2018 figs 7a and 7b respectively 4 hydrological status the most recent research from huang et al 2021 has used remote sensing techniques to quantify dynamics of water bodies along the whole irtysh river basin and to estimate influence of the major factors such as temperature precipitation evapotranspiration and snow water equivalent it has been identified that the total surface water area has shown an increasing trend since 1990 at a rate of 2922 km2 year the same growth has been identified for middle irtysh river basin mirb which mainly characterizes the sub basin of the main stream coefficients of variation of the mirb for permanent and seasonal water areas have shown relatively small values which indicates that water is distributed uniformly the factor of evapotranspiration has had the highest impact on total surface water area in mirb among others leading to increased water consumption while temperature has had the smallest contribution rate therefore an interaction between different factors for mirb has shown a relatively slight tendency relationship between surface water body area swa and terrestrial water storage tws showed an abrupt change in 2007 swa showed growth while tws started to descend significantly with the lowest value in 2012 the same results of a little effect of precipitation as well as of the amount of runoff on tws have been obtained by yang et al 2020a decline in tws of the basin could be explained as caused by diminishing of glaciers and snow in the upstream area of mirb in the altay mountains in northern xinjiang during previous years according to wu et al 2021 snowmelt runoff at the headwaters of the irtysh river of the chinese altai mountains in northern xinjiang constituted 29 3 of total runoff in the river basin for the period 2000 2016 a study of snow hydrological processes in chinese altai mountains during 1961 2015 has shown that the period from april to june contributes up to 58 1 of annual runoff by meltwater in the southern slope of the middle altai mountains zhang et al 2017a yang et al 2019 have investigated this issue in detail for the whole basin in northern xinjiang of china and concluded that firstly snow cover mass declines at a rate of 10 2 mt per year or 0 3 per year and secondly the related loss of freshwater service contributes about 19 implying that there would be a significant underestimation of service loss if only water supply is considered while gao et al 2021 have reported no significant changes in the snow depth snow water equivalent snow days and the start time of snow accumulation in the basin from 2001 to 2017 the trend of a shift to earlier snow cover melting in the upper irtysh basin coupled with a decrease in late spring snow depth and snow cover duration had been identified dai and che 2014 zhang et al 2021 have focused their research on the impact of a cascade of hydropower plants located in the northern xinjiang on environment and society the analysis has been based on data of streamflow between 1959 and 2012 and considering data of water demand for the same period these hydropower plants were estimated to guarantee 95 of water supply for domestic and industrial purposes 90 for ecological baseflow and for northern xinjiang and 75 for agricultural irrigation it has been found that the designed water supply guarantee rates can be met on the sufficient level for socio economic benefits and also for restoration of the ecological diversity in the region there is a large cascade of reservoirs on the territory of kazakhstan on the river huang et al 2014 have tested difference between the pre dam and post dam seasonal discharge on the kazakhstani territory using the lepage test it has been found that precipitation over the irtysh river basin changed little before and after the operation of the reservoir which means that changes along the streamflow mainly depend on a control of water storage in the reservoirs in the middle reaches of the river beysembaeva et al 2016 have studied flow characteristics after the start of operation of the upper irtysh river cascade of reservoirs and found that summer flow decreased by 38 for the period 1935 2010 while winter flow increased by 70 for the same period the research by smagulov et al 2019 has calculated scenarios for water balance in the kazakhstani site of irtysh based on retrospective data and assumptions if water consumption remains on the current level positive scenario or increases intensively negative scenario fig 8 the results have shown that annual flow would decrease in both scenarios a slight deficit approx 2 km3 has been forecasted for the zones between a kazakhstani chinese border and bukhtarma reservoir zone i between bukhtarma and schulba reservoirs zone ii and between schulba reservoir and a border between east kazakhstan and pavlodar regions zone iii in the positive scenario if a situation with water consumption follows the negative scenario the deficit increases significantly for the zone i more than 7 km3 in 2050 with a serious decrease of annual flow from 29 2 to 16 1 km3 nevertheless tributaries of irtysh in zone iv between the pavlodar region and a russian kazakhstani border would supply enough water to avoid a deficit in future if the situation remains unchanged russian site of irtysh river is highly concerned about both quantity and quality of the water in the river as it receives them after two countries zonn et al 2018 noted that compared to the 1990 s the irtysh flow in russia has fallen on three occasions the omsk hydrological station has been used to determine the impact of upstream cascade reservoirs on instream ecological flow in the study from li et al 2018 the results have shown that at the start of operations of two out of three reservoirs upstream omsk hydrological station built in 1959 led to uneven distribution of annual flow volumes after 1959 the study emphasizes the same conclusion about efficient operation of the reservoirs on mutual agreement gusev et al 2019 assessed possible scenarios of variations in water balance in the basin the results have shown that areas of relatively small runoff of the irtysh can be found in the southern russian part of the irtysh basin and northern kazakhstan these areas risk to increase and extend southward by 2045 2070 also there are studies about water loss in water supply from the river due to poor conditions of water supply networks in russia kondratyeva et al 2021 therefore there are attempts to implement water saving techniques and to better manage the river for example an updated wastewater treatment unit has been successfully launched in omsk city that has led to a reduction of the intake of water from the river as well as eliminating the discharge of the contaminated wastewater into the river alekseev 2018 5 water quality scientific literature gives poor information about water quality in the upper reaches of the basin while china is well aware of the challenges of increased water use the pollution problem has been ignored in a recent study deng 2014 has identified a top ten list of strategically important challenges to tackle for the future including ecosystem protection and eco environmental protection together with traditional issues involved in integrated water resources management iwrm where the key issue is the general water use efficiency according to the classification of water bodies irtysh has been rated differently in two regions of kazakhstan where the river flows kazhydromet 2020b the water quality in the pavlodar region has been considered suitable for all purposes including fishery domestic recreation irrigation etc class 1 the water in the east kazakhstani region has been ranked on class 4 which means that the water body can not be recommended for fisheries domestic purposes it is possible to use only in case of intensive treatment and recreation mainly suspended matters have exceeded permissible levels at the monitoring points these exceedances have been observed downstream at the point of wastewater discharged by industrial enterprises or after the ust kamenogorsk reservoir also severe pollution has been detected downstream at the cross section with the ulba river tributary with the exceeding of concentrations of suspended matters and manganese it can also be pointed out that toxicity tests have shown a high level of toxicity in tributaries for example the death rate of indicators daphnia magna in samples from ulba varied between 13 3 and 100 with an average of 60 between winter and summer 2020 high density of industrial capacity along the river generates historical and current contamination in kazakhstan both regions east kazakhstani and pavlodar highly contribute to the industrial development of the country as a sound example burlibayeva et al 2016 have analyzed a connection between recent characteristics of the hydrochemical regime and toxicological indicators near the city of ust kamenogorsk the authors have assessed firstly an ecological status regarding the maximum permissible concentrations mpc of the major pollutants such as salt content biochemical oxygen demand bod5 phosphate si fe cu zn ni cr6 pb v hg cd mn as volatile phenols petroleum products fluorides oxidizability and nitrogen using data from republican state enterprise kazhydromet and secondly toxicological tests have been applied to selected water samples phytoplankton and daphnia have been used as bioindicators the water quality has been recognized as relatively clean on the sampling point near the china kazakhstani boundary boran village exceptionally rare exceedings of heavy metals and organic compounds during the flooding seasons the slight increase in concentrations but still below or around mpc of potentially toxic metals such as copper iron and manganese phosphorus and nitrogen have been detected on the following sampling points located near the cascade of reservoirs and big cities this fact most probably can be explained by runoff from the territory of large settlements and industrial enterprises however severe contamination has been investigated in one of the tributaries near mine discharge where concentrations for copper reached 37 fold and 51 fold mpc for zinc 215 fold mpc and manganese to 19 6 fold mpc also biotesting results have shown a high level of acute toxicity of water samples in tributaries where the survival rate of most water samples was lower than 46 7 combination of those results says about a necessity to pay more attention to the methods and programs of the assessment of the water quality in the river as there is a high risk of severe pollution historical experiments of explosions of a nuclear weapon on a former semipalatinsk semey test site have also been considered as a potential threat for irtysh solodukhin et al 2015 have carried out laboratory studies of radiation near the segment of irtysh river and its tributary shagan river which belonged to the test site results of radionuclide and elemental compositions of water objects water bottom sediment have shown a safe status however it has been found that the content of some elements li be b v cu sr mo slightly increases downstream which requires extra investigations the same situation remains for potential mercury contamination by former mercury cell chlor alkali plant operated in pavlodar northern kazakhstan many research have proved e g ullrich et al 2007 guney et al 2021 that there is no transport towards the river however there is still public concern about a potential threat also some potential sources of pollution make concern about a potential impact on water quality for example issakhov and zhandaulet 2021 have developed a numerical model to analyze the impact of thermal pollution from a future nuclear power plant in result there is a recommendation to keep the temperature value below 3 c at a discharge rate of 1 0 m s to avoid a negative effect on aquatic life complaints come from the territory of russia about water quality in irtysh after it flows from kazakhstan kondratyeva et al 2021 with the reference to the annual bulletin of the omsk region government and the ministry of agriculture and food of the omsk region have reported that the content of chemical oxygen demand cod iron copper and aluminium slightly but permanently exceed threshold limit values tlv near omsk city russia experiences the same issues with current and historical water contamination like kazakhstan chemagin 2020 has carried out a chemical analysis of bottom sediments along 179 km of the river and found a periodic excess of oil products in there the author has linked this fact with activities of river piers and ship repair sections of the river fleet releases of sewage treatment facilities from big cities and industry also first order tributaries contribute to mineralization processes of the river where related parameters exceeded the parameters in irtysh two fold mihailova et al 2019 gulchenko and bazhenova 2016 have used phytoplankton as indicators of water pollution near omsk city it has been found that the most influential factors were flowrate temperature and chemical and biochemical oxygen demand cod and bod most of the phytoplankton species have been indicators of severe pollution what reflexed the respective polluted status of the river in the investigated area evaluation of flora and fauna of the floodplain in the right bank of the lower reaches of the river has shown that plant communities of the irtysh river are stressed by anthropogenic invasion from the deteriorated quality of water supplied which lead to the disruption of natural ecosystems including a decrease in species diversity density and biological productivity at the test sites popova 2019 6 biodiversity there is a general increasing concern of environmental protection and biodiversity consideration in china among decision makers in a recent large scale campaign an integrated investigation was carried out on areas of the upper irtysh which is classified as the national natural reserve where the basin wide biodiversity the flora and fauna community structure as well as socio economic characteristics have been analyzed wang et al 2017 in a recent attempt sun and zhou 2020 used a quantification method based on a chinese standard to calculate and quantify the economic values of various ecosystem services in the upper reaches of irtysh the results of this study have shown that fuyun and altai farms have the largest total value and the most dominant contribution for all the farms come from water conservation fig 9 besides the water and soil conservation the value of ecosystem services also includes carbon sequestration and oxygen release nutrient accumulation biodiversity and atmospheric cleaning the chinese section of the irtysh river is considered an area with a broader range of fish assemblages according to zheng et al 2018 that research has aimed to characterize the food web of the river on the chinese site with a particular focus on potential effects of resource availability and flooding regime on food web trophodynamics one of the main conclusion was that flooding scouring and dam construction plays an important role in trophic structure and impacted the hydrological regime which regulates availability and distribution of primary and secondary food resources regions with higher trophic positions and food chain length at the upper reach were noted to have high availability of food resources and more fish species insectivorous and piscivorous fish borisenko et al 2013 have attempted to carry out substantial work in identification of distribution of fish in the lower irtysh basin during summer periods the following representatives were found acipenser ruthenus sterlet coregonus muksun muksun rutilus rutilus roach leuciscus idus ide l leuciscus dace abramis brama bream car assius carassius crucian carp c auratus golden carp perca fluviatilis perch gymnocephalus cernuus ruff stizostedion lucioperca pikeperch esox lucius pike and lota lota burbot the juveniles in a family of cyprinids rutilus leuciscus abramis and carassius dominated and represented over 80 of fish abundance areas of a large floodplain complex and within limits of a riverbed depression seemed to be the most attractive places as there were found the maximum density of the fish aggregation also it has been found that the downstream migration of juveniles takes place at nights in narrow floodplain channels with no cloudiness or rapid streams the intensity of brief movements of fish is also synchronized with the change of day and night in channels with turbid flow though the relationship is reverse maximum activity is observed during the day investigation of the effect of water level and temperature on the fish population has been carried out in the floodplain channel complex of the lower irtysh during the spring flood season chemagin 2019 the place is recognized as a good fit for feeding and a spawning place for various species of fish results showed that the density of fish decreased from 4 to 13 times due to their migration to the floodplain during the 30 days observation period it can be concluded that low temperature serves as a signal there is a risk for reduction of the success of catching prey which makes fish staying in the main channel also the predominant migration of small fish from the mainstream to tributaries was observed during the period of water level increase which could be explained by attempts to decrease the density of aggregation and to survive another study by mochek et al 2015 also has investigated factors of water level local environmental conditions such as depth substrates patterns and diurnal cycle on fish distribution on the fish distribution in the same area the level of illumination was rated as the most influential factor most migration with the significantly higher density was observed during nights the largest proportion of these fish was represented by early juveniles not exceeding 2 cm in body length also chemagin 2018 has observed that in the zones of vortices along the river the number of fish is on average 2 times higher compared with the no vortices zones at the same depth there are also attempts to restore fauna of the river for example larvae and juveniles were artificially grown with the enriched nutrition to increase their growth and survival potential korentovich and litvinenko 2018 there is a huge potential to develop fisheries for example research from luan et al 2021 has shown that the population of northern pike spreading from the mainstream of irtysh to connected water bodies with a low risk of extinction xie et al 2019 have investigated the influence of environmental factors on the population of phoxinus ujmonesis the results have shown that abiotic factors like dissolved oxygen ph total dissolved solids and conductivity in water as well as biotic factors like plankton diversity and fish species diversity might contribute to genetic diversity and divergence in the population in the region analysis of growth natural mortality and maturity for a fishery species european bream abramis brama from the family cyprinidae in the downstream section of the irtysh river in china have been performed ding et al 2019 the authors have proposed to increase the minimum age limits by increasing mesh sizes of fishing nets to conserve the a brama stock in the region as there is a higher risk of growth overfishing than that of recruitment overfishing also the abundance of benthic organisms might be a more important influencing factor of growth rate compared to the latitude according to zhang et al 2016 additionally zhang et al 2017b have highlighted that a brama in the lower reaches of the irtysh river is vulnerable to overexploitation due to relatively late reproductive maturity in their life span maturity for a short period and spawns in aggregations fish processing enterprises are also located in the irtysh zaysan basin with the largest in the pavlodar karaganda and ust kamenogorsk regions park et al 2020 studies of the characteristics of biodiversity in the kazakhstani section of irtysh indicate that opisthorchiasis is widespread home animals of the habitants in rural settlements of the region especially cats and dogs are fed by unprepared fish from the river which highly contribute to the existence of opisthorchiasis foci proskurina et al 2020 akhmetov and maralbayeva 2020 have investigated the fish trematodes fauna in the pavlodar region and found that the maximum intensity and prevalence of infection 7 9 94 4 respectively was in stomach and esophagus of pikes the infection rate of b luciopercae maritas in fish of the region was estimated as 40 the prevalence of invasion of s bramae ranged from 6 7 to 26 09 as a result most human cases of opisthorchiidosis have been found in the north and northeast part of kazakhstan in areas drained by the irtysh river and its tributaries sultanov et al 2014 the same problem related to the distribution of parasites in fish exists in russia investigations of the invasion of the most widespread fish family in lower irtysh cyprinidae have shown that 13 species of trematodes occupied all representatives of the family liberman 2020 a significant infection of bream abramis brama linnaeus 1758 with opisthorchiasis has been revealed in the lower irtysh by liberman and voropaeva 2018 despite ordinary habitats specific for the river fauna is represented also by some rare species for example european freshwater mussels including a unique u tumidus haplotype of a relict origin has been found in east kazakhstan in samples from the black irtysh river and the bukhtarma reservoir bolotov et al 2020 babushkin et al 2021 new species of calanoida diaptomus chaetodiaptomus mirus and gigantodiaptomus irtyshensis have also been discovered in east kazakhstani waters of irtysh krupa and aubakirova 2021 the richness of biodiversity is still being investigated for example bazhenova et al 2019 has recently described plankton diatoms from the middle part of the river with the first appearance of 61 species in the studied sector chinese site is also a home of very rare aquatic species such as freshwater sculpins cottus dzungaricus belonging to order osteichthyes family scorpaeniformes and genus cottidae yang et al 2020b 7 policy this section can be formally divided into two parts first part can be dedicated to regional legislation where the issues related to local management are described second part can be about transboundary relationships relevant agreements and commitments and related issues kazakhstan and russia have the same system of river management based on the basin management ministry of ecology geology and natural resources 2019 russian federation 2006 the basin inspection regulates the use and protection of the river by establishing and control of water use limits water balances by basins control over the observance of the boundaries of water protection zones and strips etc therefore the inspection does not rule the characteristics of discharge to the river and does not control water quality this functional belongs to the committee of environmental regulation and control the discharge characteristics are established based on the volume of effluents while the content and a potential impact on the flora and fauna are barely considered radelyuk et al 2021b according to the order from ministries of agriculture anon 2015 2020 irtysh river belongs to the list of fishery water bodies of international significance it means that the most stringent requirements are imposed for water quality of the respective water body ministry of national economy 2015 anon 2016 tributaries of irtysh also belong to this list however they are also recipients of discharges from mines and open pits the literature review reveals several important and interesting points in sense of multilateral agreements most researchers have admitted the 1997 unece water convention on the protection and use of transboundary watercourses and international lakes unece water convention as an unbiased guideline for the management of transboundary rivers while china still has yet to ratify this convention there is a solid enough cooperation with neighbouring countries in a matter of shared rivers biba 2014 biba has analyzed the recent status of the cooperation between china and neighbourhoods aiming to approve or disregard a role of china as dangerous hegemon in controlling its upstream rivers including irtysh in 2004 the chinese government affirmed plans to use a max of 40 of the irtysh to provide water to the karamay oil fields and to construct a canal to divert water from the river to lake ulungur in xinjiang allouche 2007 the major concern has been about dam building and river rerouting activities with possible negative ecological economic and political consequences the outcomes of the study showed that even beijing deals with a domestic water crisis the principle of peaceful development has been promoted by authorities with consideration of the needs of downstream countries in the context of irtysh river the author has highlighted that the chinese government clearly agreed to institutional design to manage shared water resources between two countries china and kazakhstan which resulted in two key agreements agreement on cooperation in the use and protection of transboundary rivers 2001 and agreement on the protection of the water quality of transboundary rivers 2011 moreover these agreements were followed by respective joint commissions with the developed program for actions to solve all the addressed issues within the constant meetings zonn et al 2018 ziganshina and janusz pawletta 2020 have investigated these agreements and concluded that following important issues are defined in mutual respect and with the pathway to dialogue promotion of the exchange of hydrological and water chemical data assurance of the optimal use of water resources water quality control and prevention of pollution of transboundary rivers to reduce the impact on the environment and society to the lowest possible level coupled with actions to avoid man made accidents to take obligation to take measures and to respond in emergencies several authors e g zhiltsov et al 2018 stewart raf 2014 ho 2017 have noted that china intensified the negotiation process with kazakhstan and made incentives for cooperation park et al 2020 also have highlighted that a potential failure in the mismanagement of water resources can not be explained by the concept of hydro hegemonism only the authors have clarified the importance of both institutionalizing cooperation and establishing communication at societal governmental and inter governmental environmental levels effective implementation of an analysis of ecological risks aims to help stakeholders in decision making and to avoid a passive state of the parties kukeyeva et al 2015 have added to this idea a concept of sustainable development the authors have proposed seeking for water efficient technologies for all sectors for example for farmers to achieve environmental sustainability and greater social harmony russia has long been concerned about upstream watercourse impact due to the reason that there are no tripartite agreements regarding irtysh river krasnoyarova et al 2019 collaboration between russia and kazakhstan has been seeking for different forms to establish efficient and sustainable use of irtysh particularly in issues of runoff control management of infrastructure regulatory basement and water quality e g vinokurov et al 2018 rybkina and sivokhip 2019 an ideal option to create a commonly ruled basin wide joint inspection could probably fail due to lacking respective political will boklan and janusz pawletta 2017 the water relations between kazakhstan and russian federation are regulated by the agreement on joint use and protection of transboundary water bodies signed in october 2010 zhiltsov et al 2018 this agreement considers mutual efforts and information exchange in terms of quality and quantity of water supply therefore there are still no enough data for researchers and stakeholders to effectively predict and propose patterns for sustainable river management e g vasilenko 2015 the parties have emphasized the importance of cooperation programs for the conservation and restoration of ecosystems of the basins within 2021 2024 the programs assume joint monitoring of the water quality of the river by respective scientific investigations with particular focus on identification of the sources of contamination development of programs for recultivation remediation and modernization of existing treatment facilities to restore the river the inclusion of representatives of the russian federation in the interdepartmental commission on the use of the cascade of reservoirs in kazakhstan and permanent exchange of the relevant information anon 2021 8 discussion padalko 2021 has identified a decreasing trend in water consumption in russia and kazakhstan while china sees steady growth for the last decade specifically for the irtysh river basin irrigation and agricultural water use went down by 18 6 domestic and industrial water use fell by 15 8 special attention should be paid to the conditions of tributaries of the river in kazakhstan as currently they supply a sufficient amount of water and support to avoid a deficit of the mainstream observations of the increase of water supply by slightly increased precipitation and more intensive snowmelt potentially caused by climate change have been mainly confirmed by various researchers for example the results of the investigation of the processes of spring floods in the light of snowmelts in eastern kazakhstan indicated high influence of winter arctic oscillation on patterns of snow cover depletion over the region which plays important role in the generation of annual runoff into the river fugazza et al 2020 melting of permafrost glaciers and snow in the upstream mountains of the river should be considered as one of the key processes in the hydrological budget the amount of snow storage shows a relatively slight decrease which causes higher water supply into the stream however the high impact of evapotranspiration rate could offset this effect spring season of the snowmelt along the whole basin coupled with specific melting of snow and glaciers in the mountains during april june can be considered as an advantage in the management of the reservoirs used as hydroelectric power plants located on the mainstream however there is a slight trend of a shift to earlier snow cover melting which should be considered the main point about reservoirs is not a fact of their existence in each country but ways of operating them based on mutual collaboration as changing water inflows is a function of energy system dynamics the planning of future installations and operating already existing reservoirs deserves special attention previous plans aimed to assure water quantity on the respective level for restoration of the ecological diversity of the basin therefore some authors raise a significant concern about the development of the xinjiang region and the building of the black irtysh karamay urumqi canal systems with the expected increase of water consumption for 50 of irtysh volume in future e g krasnoyarova et al 2019 zonn et al 2018 biba 2014 hopefully parties would follow the principles of hydrosolidarity sustainable development and circular economy via implementation of water saving techniques seeking for the no harm principle special attention must be paid to water quality issues as these are followed by restoration of ecosystems and people health e g water from irtysh has been directly used by rural habitants tussupova et al 2016 china is recognized as one of the most important countries that promoted a circular economy concept mathews and tan 2016 this concept has been recently introduced in the country and has led to more careful management of water resources including the elimination of water pollution nowadays the main focus on a chinese site has to be on remediation programs of historical sources of contamination e g jia et al 2019 while the kazakhstani site still generates contamination main problems of water quality issues in kazakhstan come mainly from two sources of the pollution first the high density of industrial capacity along the river which generates historical and current contamination second the run off from the riparian surface industry in kazakhstan takes advantage of loopholes in environmental legislation to pollute the river and its tributaries according to the entrepreneurial code kazakhstan 2015 industrial inspections are carried out once per six months with the preliminary notification at least thirty calendar days before the start of the inspection thus businesses use the opportunity to prepare for the inspections in advance and to fix inconsistencies temporarily radelyuk et al 2019 while the mainstream tends to self purification and shows a good status of water quality the water quality in tributaries especially where risks of contamination are high should be focused on methods of assessment and quality of monitoring of the river lacks efficiency as they give a wrong picture of the current status of the river and should be revised standardization of monitoring and evaluation approaches across the basin can allow for a more fair and objective assessment of the issues being experienced in the basin and thereby allowing for a more targeted approach to address these issues also there is a critical lack of research about assessment and monitoring of persistent organic pollutants pesticides pharmaceuticals microplastic etc review of biodiversity status has identified three major issues of the river a status of living species and their interactions with conditions of the river problems related to parasites and opportunities for fisheries biodiversity along the stream indicates the current good status of the river in general including discovery and distribution of new exotic species the following factors have been identified as comfort for fish distribution along the river the large floodplain complexes limited riverbed depression appropriate water quality parameters and biotic factors like plankton diversity and fish species diversity to ensure a food chain therefore redistribution of water flow appeared after construction of a cascade of reservoirs negatively affects conditions of the regional floodplain for example 90 of all the kazakhstani floodplain of the river are located in the pavlodar region while the fluctuation of flow remained relatively unchanged 4 6 for the period until 2010 a huge amount of warmed water after heat exchangers increased mineralization which might affect soil and living species beysembayeva and bazarbekov 2015 thus these risks should be considered while planning the following ways of irtysh use including for fisheries the main recommendation to provide sustainable fisheries is to consider vulnerability of the fish to overexploitation during the periods of maturity and spawns in aggregations the third identified issue parasites cause inconvenience for their hosts and first and second order consumers and demands proper outreach and communication to the people therefore the behavior of parasites can be used for scientific monitoring of dynamic processes related to the river such as the investigation of the impact of anthropogenic activities or climate change palm 2011 the section on policy can be the hottest topic in a matter of the irb all involved countries consider the challenges listed above and implement respective legislation on a local scale develop restoration programs invest into minimization of water consumption and seek alternative or recycling sources of water the major point that has been raised by many researchers is lacking trilateral agreement for the river management based on searching for consensus e g ziganshina and janusz pawletta 2020 zhiltsov et al 2018 boklan and janusz pawletta 2017 the reasons for it are underlying beyond the will of academic society the main concern can be a denial from the chinese side to ratify the unece water convention however researchers mainly evaluate actions of china as peaceful development institutional cooperation and joint commissions seem to be the right response to support the common aim of a restoration of the river this is also in line with the institutional capacity development in china as a general trend yang et al 2016 this research uses ecosystem or water energy food ecology nexus approach to see the correlations between reviewed factors for example the issues with earlier snow cover melting time may positively impact energy generation in reservoirs improve fisheries and to supply enough water for consumption in the mid term perspective however the tendency of the slight decrease in the amount of snow storage can be recognized as a problem itself and may cause negative consequences for the basin in the long term perspective another example is the interaction between water quality and biodiversity while there are possibilities for fisheries the current poor ecological status of the river causes risks of eliminating this opportunity or disseminating the contaminated fish to consumers which affects the food chain of the river the policy issues cover all the reviewed factors as they have power to restore the river on an appropriate level for use in the involved countries and to assure the good status of the health of the river 9 conclusion this research attempts to identify current challenges for irtysh river considering the overview of scientific investigations of the basin for the last decade the challenges are supposed to be mitigated to ensure the good status of the irtysh river in a matter of its sufficiency for ecological balance domestic use and living species the state of the hydrological budget can be classified as stable while contrary processes exist in the basin projected increase in water consumption in upstream and a higher rate of evapotranspiration from one site and slowly but permanently increased snowmelt and precipitation rate from another thus risks related to the impact of climate change and responsible water use should be considered and prevented involved countries should pay special attention to issues of water contamination both historical and permanent via respective remediation programs and implementation of restrictive legislation these programs should be based on a unified and transparent monitoring system of the river where all data will be available to all parties to make reasonable decisions on water management assurance of sufficient water quantity and water quality creates comfortable conditions for sustainable biodiversity management which include stability of food chain and ecosystems and perspectives for fisheries development one of the important actions to achieve the established aims is the building up of a connection for efficient data exchange and information dissemination between governments involved the latest investigations also present opportunities to manage the basin more efficiently using the remote sensing techniques authors believe that international collaboration should start on an academia level at first it will provide a more detailed and reliable assessment of the existing challenges of the river on the whole basin scale involvement of multidisciplinary researchers will let to evaluate the complex system of the river basin with the following best scientific based suggestions for key stakeholders for the sustainable river management thus this research can be used as a starting point for future investigations of issues described in the paper obviously this research has a limitation in the lack of full access to all data available in three countries to obtain a better picture of the processes within the basin the proposal for future research is to close existing gaps and to provide a more detailed basis for investigations credit authorship
