19040,the presence of ammonium nh4 in drinking water treatment results in inhibition of disinfection efficiency and formation of nitrogenous disinfection by products our previous study found monochloramine nh2cl photolysis under 254 nm uv irradiation can be effective for removal of nh4 however the mechanisms of nh4 degradation in this process were unknown the kinetics and fundamental radical chemistry responsible for nh4 removal in the uv nh2cl process were investigated in this study the results showed that the pseudo first order rate constant for nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process ranged between 3 6 10 4 to 1 8 10 3 s 1 solution ph affected radical conversion and a higher nh4 degradation efficiency was achieved under acidic conditions the effects of chloride were limited however the presence of either bicarbonate or natural organic matter scavenged radicals and inhibited nh4 removal nh2cl photolysis generated an aminyl radical nh2 and a chlorine radical cl that further transformed to a chlorine dimer cl2 and a hydroxyl radical ho the second order rate constants for cl and cl2 reacting with nh4 were estimated as 2 59 108 m 1s 1 and 3 45 105 m 1s 1 at ph 3 9 respectively cl cl2 and ho contributed 95 2 3 5 and 1 3 to nh4 removal respectively at the condition of 3 mm nh2cl and ph 7 5 major products included nitrite and nitrate possibly accompanied by nitrogen containing gases this investigation provides insight into the photochemistry of nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process and offers an alternative method for drinking water production graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv nh2cl process ammonium reactive chlorine radicals kinetic model 1 introduction ammonium nh4 is a common contaminant in groundwater and surface water in china which has become a great environmental issue the concentration of nh4 in natural waters has been reported to range from 0 1 to 3 mg l and sometimes reached more than 10 mg l according to a report on the state of the environment in china http datacenter mep gov cn nh4 in drinking water can diminish chlorination disinfection efficiency by converting free chlorine to inorganic combined chlorine predominantly nh2cl contribute to taste and odor problems and promote the formation of harmful disinfection byproducts dbps villanueva et al 2014 a guideline upper limit concentration for nh4 of 0 5 mg l as n has been established for drinking water in china standards for drinking water quality of china gb5749 2006 conventional drinking water treatment processes including coagulation sedimentation and filtration are ineffective for nh4 removal due to its extremely high solubility and stability han et al 2013 breakpoint chlorination is effective but significantly increases chlorine consumption because chlorine dosages need to be at least 1 6 fold higher than the nh4 molar concentration this process has also caused public concern due to the potential generation of highly genotoxic nitrogenous dbps bond et al 2011 although several additional nh4 eliminating methods have been developed such as biological nitrification ion exchange and chemical precipitation each of these methods has disadvantages in drinking water treatment liu et al 2017 therefore research related to nh4 removal for drinking water treatment processes continues our previous study demonstrated that the combination of chlorination and uv irradiation at 254 nm was effective for nh4 removal when the molar ratio of chlorine to nh4 was lower than 1 0 zhang et al 2015 compared with breakpoint chlorination this process accomplished greater nh4 removal efficiency and less dbp generation apparent rate constants of free chlorine reacting with nh4 nh3 at ph 7 have been reported to be 1 3 104 m 1s 1 qiang and adams 2004 and 1 8 104 m 1s 1 morris and isaac 1983 thus free chlorine is entirely consumed and transformed into monochloramine nh2cl which is predominant in solution under the condition of cl2 n molar ratio less than 1 0 uv irradiation provides an additional mechanism for nh4 degradation the uv chlorine process as an advanced oxidation process aop has been widely investigated for decomposition of emerging contaminants jin et al 2011 pan et al 2017 ye et al 2017 wang et al 2017 the uv nh2cl process been incorporated into treatment of reverse osmosis ro permeate and it was demonstrated to be similar to the uv h2o2 process for degradation of carbamazepine and benzoate at ph 5 5 8 3 chuang et al 2017 a recent study reported the uv nh2cl process to be effective for 1 4 dioxane removal patton et al 2016 these previous studies have indicated that the uv nh2cl process can be an effective method for inclusion in drinking water treatment however limited information was available to address nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process li and blatchley investigated the photolysis of nh2cl by uv254 irradiation li and blatchley iii 2009 the proposed mechanism of the reaction involved photolytic products of the aminyl radical nh2 and the chlorine radical cl as described by reaction 1 in table 1 the quantum yield of nh2cl photolysis at 254 nm was reported to be 0 62 0 049 mol es 1 li and blatchley iii 2009 cl can selectively react with electron rich moieties such as phenols anilines olefins and amines minakata et al 2017 among these cl reacts with particularly rapidly with amine moieties through either electron transfer or h abstraction beitz et al 1998 in addition cl can be converted to a chlorine dimer cl2 in the presence of chloride reaction 2 in table 1 jayson et al 1973 klaning and wolff 1984 furthermore the hydroxyl radical ho can be generated through the reaction of cl with water or oh under alkaline conditions reactions 3 8 in table 1 the degradation of nh4 by ho is recognized but occurs at a rate that is slower than many other reactions that involve ho huang et al 2008 when the molar ratio of chlorine to nh3 nitrogen is less than 1 0 nh4 nh3 and nh2cl can coexist in the aqueous solution although nh2cl photolysis is an important pathway for nh4 nh3 removal in the uv chlorine process the presence of free radicals may also contribute to nh4 nh3 oxidation however the fate and contribution of these radicals to nh4 degradation have not been investigated previously the mechanism and pathway of nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process also needs to be clarified in order to systemically understand the kinetics and mechanism of nh4 decomposition in the uv nh2cl process this study focused on three aspects 1 examination of the efficiency and main factors that influence nh4 removal in the uv nh2cl process 2 development of a model to describe nh4 degradation and to evaluate the contribution of reactive species to nh4 degradation and 3 to determine the degradation products and to summarize the nh4 degradation pathway 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ammonium chloride nh4cl 99 pure and sodium hypochlorite solutions naocl 10 active chlorine by weight were obtained from j k scientific beijing china benzoic acid ba nitrobenzene nb tert butanol t buoh and acetonitrile were high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade obtained from aladdin industrial corporation beijing china other reagents applied in the experiments were of analytical grade obtained from guangfu fine chemical research institute tianjin china suwannee river nom cat no 2r101n was purchased from international humic substances society reagents were used as received all solutions were prepared in water produced by a milli q purification system free chlorine stock solutions were prepared by dilution of naocl to 2500 mg l as cl2 ammonium stock solutions were prepared by dilution of nh4cl to 500 mg l as n nom stock solution was prepared by dissolving nom into ultrapure water and filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane whatman all stock solutions were prepared weekly and stored in the dark at 4 c 2 2 uv system uv irradiation experiments were conducted using a flat plate collimated beam the characteristic wavelength of this device was 254 nm and incident uv254 fluence rate was 3 3 10 7 einstein s 1 l 1 corresponding to 2 00 mw cm 2 as determined by iodide iodate chemical actinometry rahn et al 2006 the effective path length was 3 5 cm the uv lamps were warmed up for 20 min before experiments 2 3 experimental procedures monochloramine nh2cl standard solutions were prepared daily by slowly pouring a free chorine solution over an ammonium chloride solution to achieve a chlorine to ammonium molar ratio cl2 n of 0 99 1 for over 30 min with rapid stirring both solutions were adjusted to ph 10 with sodium hydroxide before mixing shang and blatchley iii 1999 nh2cl standard solutions were standardized to the desired concentration 0 5 4 mm prior to each experiment in experiments a target quantity of ammonium solution was spiked into nh2cl standard solution 0 5 4 mm to achieve an initial nh4 concentration of 70 μm 1 mg l as n then the solution was subjected to uv irradiation at 254 nm all experimental solutions were buffered with 10 mm of phosphate buffer to maintain ph at 6 5 7 5 or 8 5 20 mm of chloride cl 2 5 mm of bicarbonate hco3 and 5 mg c l of natural organic matter nom were spiked into solutions in separate experiments to examine the effects of these constituents on reaction progress samples were collected at specified time intervals samples were subjected to measurements of nh4 concentration immediately without adding reductive quenchers because quenchers can convert nh2cl back to nh4 the reaction rate constants of reactive chlorine species cl and cl2 with nh4 were estimated by a laser flash photolysis technique this technology has been successfully applied for estimation of rate constants for cl and cl2 with mono and dichloramine li et al 2018 irradiated solutions of na2s2o8 in distilled water generated sulfate radicals so4 which reacted rapidly with cl and converted to cl or cl2 with an equilibrium constant of 1 4 105 m 1 buxton et al 1998 the experimental solution was without ph adjustment and ph was determined as 3 9 therefore nh4 was dominant 99 8 then the rate constant of chlorine radicals cl and cl2 with nh4 was estimated by monitoring absorbance at 340 nm as a surrogate for the decay rate of cl2 additionally the rate constant of ho with nh4 was measured using the same laser flash photolysis system and applied kscn as a competition compound song et al 2012 the solution was without ph adjustment and ph was determined as 3 2 therefore nh4 was dominant 99 8 details are illustrated in the supporting information si text s1 and fig s1 for chlorine radicals with nh4 and text s2 and fig s2 for ho with nh4 respectively the steady state concentrations of radicals were measured by probe methods as illustrated by text s3 to text s5 all experiments were conducted in triplicate the relative standard deviation rsd of three replicates was required to be within 5 to meet the quality assurance quality control qa qc reporting requirements 2 4 analytical methods nh4 concentrations were measured by a selective electrode method using a ph ise meter thermo orion 720a equipped with an nh4 selective electrode thermo orion 95 12 anonymous 2012 the minimum reporting limit mrl of nh4 was 0 01 mg l as n in the range of nh4 concentration from 0 to 2 mg l as n the pearson correlation coefficient r2 for the linear regression of the calibration curve was higher than 0 999 suggesting this detection method was suitable for nh4 analysis nh2cl was analyzed by membrane introduction mass spectrometry mims shang and blatchley iii 1999 weng et al 2012 nitrite and nitrate were measured by ion chromatography anonymous 2012 concentrations of tert butanol were measured by gas chromatography agilent 7890a using a flame ionization detector fid detector and a sac 5 column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm film thickness supelco oakville on canada sec butanol was employed as an internal standard helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the oven temperature was held at 40 c for 5 min and was then increased at a rate of 30 c min to 190 c with a total run time of 10 min the fid was maintained at 300 c tert and sec butanol were identified by comparison of retention times to known standards the method detection limits mdls for tert butanol were lower than 0 001 μm the concentrations of nb and ba were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc ultimate3000 thermo scientific equipped with a photodiode array detector pda at wavelengths of 265 and 227 nm respectively the injection volume was 20 μl nb and ba were separated by an agilent zorbax sb c18 column 4 6 mm 150 mm 3 5 μm particle size the mobile phase consisted of 60 acetonitrile v v and 40 h2o with 0 1 acetic acid v v at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 at 35 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of nh4 in uv nh2cl process fig 1 shows the pseudo first order rate results for nh4 degradation by uv254 irradiation alone chloramination alone and the uv nh2cl process negligible quantities of nh4 were degraded by exposure to a uv254 dose up to 1000 mj cm2 largely because of the low molar absorptivity of nh4 at 254 nm wavelengths fig s3 in si this result suggests that direct photodegradation of nh4 by exposure to uv254 radiation can be ignored which is consistent with our previous study zhang et al 2015 chloramination resulted in only 1 7 nh4 removal by exposure to 3 mm of nh2cl during 500 s of dark reaction in contrast extensive nh4 degradation was observed during the uv nh2cl process 51 6 of nh4 was removed during co exposure with 3 mm of nh2cl and a of uv254 dose of 400 mj cm2 nh4 degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics with a rate constant of 1 8 10 3 s 1 thus nh4 degradation was more effective by the uv nh2cl process than by either uv254 irradiation or chloramination alone the enhancement of nh4 degradation by the uv nh2cl process was consistent with previous reports of uv nh2cl degradation of 1 4 dioxane benzoate and carbamazepine chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2016 fig s3 in si indicates that nh2cl absorbs photons with the molar absorptivity of 354 m 1cm 1 at 254 nm as shown in fig s4 in si the concentration of nh2cl gradually decreased with increasing uv254 exposure time nh2cl degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics with a rate constant of 1 4 10 3 s 1 it should be noted that in realistic treatment of ammonia containing water by the uv chlorine process nh4 nh3 was removed primarily by chloramine photolysis accompanied by a smaller contribution by the radicals ho cl and cl2 et al according to figure s3 17 5 μm of nh2cl degradation is necessary for a removal of 1 0 μm of nh4 nh3 at ph 7 5 the faster loss rate of nh2cl can ascribe to both nh2cl photolysis as well as the consumption by radicals oxidation whereas nh3 nh4 elimination can merely attribute to radicals oxidation the consistency between nh2cl degradation and nh4 removal suggests that reactive radicals generated from nh2cl photolysis contribute to nh4 degradation 3 2 kinetic modeling of nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process uv254 irradiation leads to cleavage of the n cl bond of nh2cl yielding an aminyl radical nh2 and a chlorine radical cl li and blatchley iii 2009 in general the contribution of nh2 to nh4 degradation was assumed to be negligible because nh2 has been reported to have low reactivity with primary amines 105 m 1s 1 patton et al 2016 cl can selectively react with an amine moiety via hydrogen abstraction guo et al 2017 cheng et al 2018 cl also tends to transform to other reactive radicals in particular cl will react with cl resulting in production of cl2 with an equilibrium constant of 1 4 105 m 1 buxton et al 1998 cl can also convert to ho via cl2 and cloh pathways violet 1981 the radical reaction scheme of the uv nh2cl process for nh4 degradation is illustrated in fig 2 a kinetic model of nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process was established based on the hypothesis that cl cl2 and ho were primarily responsible for nh4 degradation under the assumption of nh2cl being present at a steady state concentration during the experimental conditions the kinetic model of nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process can be expressed as eq 1 1 d nh 4 dt k cl nh 4 cl ss k cl 2 nh 4 cl 2 ss k oh nh 4 oh ss nh 4 where nh4 represents the concentration of nh4 k cl nh4 k cl2 nh4 and k ho nh4 are the second order rate constants for reactions involving cl cl2 and ho with nh4 respectively cl ss cl2 ss and ho ss were the steady state concentrations of cl cl2 and ho respectively the rate constant of ho and nh4 was estimated as described in text s2 ho generated by laser flash photolysis of h2o2 scn was selected as a competitor because this compound has been extensively applied for determining ho rate constants with a wide variety of substrates song et al 2012 the apparent second order rate constant of nh4 with ho was estimated to be 1 38 107 m 1s 1 at ph 3 2 huang s study suggested the rate constant of nh3 with ho was 1 0 108 m 1s 1 ph 9 3 whereas the reaction of nh4 with ho can be ignored huang et al 2008 the obtained rate constants of nh4 with ho was nearly three orders of magnitudes lower than the competitor scn with ho which may result in a certain degree of deviation however as shown in fig s2 the decrease of the absorbance of scn 2 at 490 nm with increasing initial nh4 concentration demonstrated nh4 reacted competitively with scn for ho these results imply ho can react with nh4 however it is relevant to note that nh4 reacts slowly with these radicals as compared with nh3 the pseudo second order rate constant of chlorine radicals cl and cl2 with nh4 was calculated by monitoring the decay of transient absorbance at 340 nm alegre et al 2000 fig s1a shows the decay of cl2 absorption intensity and fig s1b illustrates the cl2 decay rate decreased linearly with increasing initial cl concentration from 2 to 12 mm accordingly the second order rate constant of cl and cl2 with nh4 was calculated to be 2 59 108 and 3 45 105 m 1s 1 at ph 3 9 respectively text s1 the reactivity of cl towards nh4 was three orders of magnitude of rate constant for the reaction with cl2 the relative higher reactivity of cl are comparable with the reactivity of cl with key substrates classes including saturated aliphatic 108 109 m 1s 1 aromatic 1010 m 1s 1 and olefin 109 m 1s 1 zhang and parker 2018 reactivity of cl and cl2 towards nh4 nh3 was attributed to the relatively high oxidation potentials for these radicals of 2 43 and 2 13 ev respectively jin et al 2011 nh4 nh3 is likely to react with chlorine radicals via hydrogen abstraction from a n h bond followed by a sequence of reactions starting from the aminyl radical nh2 the pathway of h atom abstraction by chlorine radicals has been proposed previously minakata et al 2017 additionally the halogen radical can promote the halogenation of nitroaromatic compounds calza et al 2008 therefore chlorine radicals probably enhance the chlorination of nh4 nh3 resulting in the formation of nh2cl and further photodegradation photolysis of nh2cl yields nh2 and cl then cl reacts with chloride ion to form cl2 nh2cl itself may serve as an important radical scavenger with the reaction rate constants of 2 4 0 3 107 m 1 s 1 for cl and 6 5 3 5 106 m 1 s 1 for cl2 respectively li et al 2018 thus formation and scavenging reactions result in a steady state for each radical species the presence of free radicals can promote nh4 nh3 oxidation in this study the steady state concentrations of cl cl2 and ho were quantified by employing different probe compounds as illustrated in text s3 text s4 and text s5 in si the values were 2 4 10 12 m 7 8 10 11 m and 8 2 10 13 m for cl cl2 and ho respectively for an initial concentration of 3 mm nh2cl containing 3 2 mm chloride at ph 7 5 these results suggest that cl2 was the predominant radical in solution the concentration of cl2 was nearly 30 fold and 95 fold larger than that of cl and ho respectively since the rate constant of cl2 with nh4 around 3 45 105 m 1s 1 was substantially lower than those of cl and ho around 2 59 108 and 1 38 107 m 1s 1 nh4 degradation may be largely attributed to reactions involving cl rather than cl2 and ho the fates and contributions of reactive radials on nh4 degradation will also depend on the experimental conditions in this study the steady state concentrations of radicals under different experimental conditions were predicted using the mathematical modeling software kintecus version 5 55 on the basis of the major elementary chemical and photochemical reactions this kinetic model has been successfully applied in uv chlorine uv h2o2 and uv ozone processes parker and mitch 2016 grebel et al 2010 the main photochemical reactions and their rate equilibrium constants used in kintecus modeling are represented in table 1 based on equation 1 each specific radical pseudo first order rate constant for nh4 degradation was calculated as the radical s second order rate constant multiplied by its pseudo steady state concentrations their sum of these species specific pseudo first order rate constants was used as an estimate of the overall pseudo first order rate constant of nh4 nh3 degradation 3 3 effects of initial nh2cl concentration the initial nh2cl concentration affected the degradation of nh4 in the uv nh2cl process nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process followed pseudo first order kinetics fig s5 in si fig 3 indicates that the rate constants of nh4 degradation gradually increased from 3 6 10 4 to 1 8 10 3 s 1 with a corresponding increase of nh2cl concentration from 0 5 to 3 0 mm essentially the increase of initial nh2cl concentration enhanced the generation of cl reaction 1 in table 1 because cl could be transformed to cl2 and ho the increase of cl generation also promoted formation of cl2 and ho therefore the increase in nh2cl dosage promoted reactive radical formation and enhanced nh4 degradation under the condition of 3 mm nh2cl the contributions of cl cl2 and ho to nh4 degradation were 95 2 3 5 and 1 3 respectively fig 3 in contrast the rate constant decreased slightly to 1 6 10 3 s 1 at 4 0 mm nh2cl this was likely attributable to the consumption of reactive radicals by excess nh2cl as described in table 1 reactions 10 12 overdosing of nh2cl resulted in additional consumption of cl cl2 and ho relative to experiments conducted at lower initial nh2cl concentration which was consistent with a previous study of the inhibition of ba degradation in uv chlorine process fang et al 2014 3 4 effects of ph the effect of ph on nh4 degradation was examined by conducting experiments at ph 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 these conditions are also representative of practical applications in municipal drinking water treatment in this ph range ammonia n was the present largely in the form of nh4 pk a 9 25 deborde and von gunten 2008 nh4 accounts for 96 0 92 9 and 87 7 of total ammonia nitrogen sum of nh4 and nh3 at ph 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 respectively the reactivity of reactive radicals towards nh4 nh3 was also ph dependency table s1 fig 4 and fig s6 in si indicate that the degradation rate of nh4 decreased as ph increased from 6 5 to 8 5 the pseudo first order rate constant of nh4 decreased from 2 2 10 3 s 1 at ph 6 5 to 1 7 10 3 s 1at ph 8 5 the predicted results matched well with the experimental observation the relative contributions of cl cl2 and ho to the overall rate constant of nh4 degradation was 97 2 0 2 and 0 4 respectively at ph 6 5 whereas these contributions changed to 83 3 1 0 and 0 7 respectively at ph 8 5 these results suggest nh4 degradation relied less on cl with increasing ph while the contributions of ho increased slightly with ph previous studies have indicated that the photolysis of nh2cl appeared to be largely independent of ph under circumneutral conditions li and blatchley iii 2009 however solution ph influenced the transformation of cl into ho via cloh the first order rate constant of cl with h2o was 2 5 105 s 1 whereas this constant significantly increased to 1 8 1010 m 1s 1 in alkaline solution reaction 3 and 5 in table 1 as a result an increasing ph accelerates the transformation of cl to ho and reduces the nh4 degradation rate because cl reacts more quickly with nh4 than does ho 3 5 effects of water constituents chloride bicarbonate nom chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 natural organic matter nom are common constituents in real water their presence may affect the nh4 degradation efficiency in the uv nh2cl process each of these three water constituents was examined under relevant environmental conditions and their effects on nh4 removal are illustrated in fig 5 and fig s7 in si the results shown in fig 5 indicate that modeling results were generally consistent with the experimental data the concentration of chloride in the control sample was 2 2 mm induced by the addition of 2 mm nh2cl in solution with the increase of chloride concentration to 20 mm the overall pseudo first order rate constant of nh4 degradation remained stable at around 1 8 10 3 s 1 the modeling results indicated that the individual contributions of cl cl2 and ho to nh4 degradation changed from 95 2 3 5 and 1 3 in the control condition to 88 8 7 7 and 3 5 in the presence of 20 mm cl respectively cl reacted rapidly with cl to form cl2 the second order rate constant of this reaction was 8 0 109 m 1s 1 reaction 2 in table 1 the rate constant for the reverse reaction was 1 1 105 s 1 thus the increase of cl2 contribution could be attributed to an increase of cl2 concentration with increasing cl concentration in addition the effect of cl on ho was negligible because the reaction of cl with ho was counterbalanced gao et al 2017 the rate constants of the forward and backward of cl and ho reactions were 4 3 109 m 1s 1 and 6 1 109 s 1 respectively reactions 8 and 9 in table 1 the effect of bicarbonate on nh4 degradation was evaluated by adding 2 5 mm bicarbonate to the uv nh2cl system at the initial nh2cl concentration of 3 mm and ph 7 5 the rate constant of nh4 degradation decreased from 1 8 10 3 s 1 to 1 2 10 3 s 1 as the bicarbonate concentration increased from 0 to 2 5 mm the individual contributions of cl cl2 and ho to nh4 degradation in the absence of hco3 were 1 4 10 3 3 8 10 4 and 8 0 10 5 s 1 respectively these constants reduced to 9 1 10 4 2 6 10 4 and 7 5 10 5 s 1 respectively in the presence of hco3 these results suggest the scavenging effect of hco3 on cl and cl2 were much stronger than that on ho due to the larger rate constant between hco3 and cl than that of hco3 with ho reaction 25 and 26 in table 1 in addition the generation of ho depended on transformation of cl the decrease of cl concentration also limited the formation of ho nh4 degradation rate in the uv nh2cl process decreased from 1 8 10 3 s 1 to 1 4 10 3 s 1 when the nom concentration increased from 0 to 5 mg l correspondingly the presence of 5 mg c l of nom reduced the rate of nh2cl photodegradation by around 22 nom consumed free chlorine and absorbed uv photons in addition nom also scavenged radials with reaction rate constants of 2 5 104 and 1 3 104 mg l 1s 1 for ho and cl respectively guo et al 2017 thus increasing nom concentrations reduced the concentrations of the reactive radicals on the other hand nom also undergoes reactions under uv irradiation to produce triplet states of natural organic matter 3nom li et al 2017 promotion of nh4 nh3 oxidation by 3nom has not been directly observed however chlorine radical generation via 3nom oxidation in the presence of chloride has been proposed in a seawater system parker and mitch 2016 based on the results of this study this pathway plays a minor role on chlorine radical formation due to a relatively low chloride concentration in drinking water as compared with seawater additionally nom may absorb uv light and reduce solution transmittance by 10 20 the light screening effects inhibited nh4 nh3 oxidation as a result nom reduced the degradation rate of nh4 in the uv nh2cl process by reducing the steady state concentration of reactive radicals 3 6 products the evolution of oxidized nitrogen containing products nitrite and nitrate during nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process is illustrated in fig 6 the evolution of total products during uv photolysis of experimental solution containing both nh2cl 3000 μm and nh4 nh3 70 μm is illustrated in fig s8 it has been reported that nh2cl photolysis at ph 7 5 yields 44 4 of nitrogen in the form of no2 and 9 7 in the form of no3 li and blatchley iii 2009 the formation of no2 and no3 from nh2cl photolysis were much greater than these values in the experiments described herein probably due to a relatively high initial nh2cl concentration this study mainly focused on the net formation of nitrogen containing products from nh4 nh3 oxidation by radicals the concentration of nh4 gradually decreased from 1 0 to 0 1 mg l as n during 20 min of the uv nh2cl process at ph 7 5 nitrite and nitrate were the dominant products of nh4 degradation after 20 min of uv nh2cl treatment the conversion rates of nh4 to nitrite and nitrate were around 43 5 and 20 4 respectively reactions 32 34 for nitrite and 35 38 for nitrate in table 1 as shown in fig 6 the dashed line indicates the modeling results predicted by the kintecus method the consistency between experimental and modeling results suggest that both nh4 degradation and the product formation can be accurately predicted by the proposed reaction mechanism according to the radical mediated reactions listed in table 1 based on the radical reactions nh2 was proposed to be a critical intermediate in the reaction of nh4 reacting with cl cl2 and ho de laat et al 2010 nh2 is unstable and can be further oxidized to nh2o2 by dissolved oxygen in solution laszlo et al 1998 then nitrite and nitrate are generated via a series of radical reactions reaction 32 38 in table 1 the experimental results indicate that nitrite nitrate accounts for about 61 0 of total nh4 degradation nh4 degradation may also have yielded nitrogen containing gaseous products such as n2 and n2o as described in reactions 39 48 in table 1 de laat et al 2010 4 conclusions ammonium nh4 can be degraded by the uv nh2cl process the pseudo first order rate constants for nh4 degradation increased from 3 6 10 4 s 1 to 1 8 10 3 s 1 with an increase of initial nh2cl concentration from 0 5 to 3 mm the reactive chlorine radicals cl and cl2 and ho each contributed to nh4 degradation the second order rate constants for reactions between cl and cl2 with nh4 were estimated to be 2 59 108 m 1s 1 and 3 45 105 m 1s 1 respectively cl were the primary reactive radicals for nh4 decomposition faster nh4 degradation was achieved at ph 6 5 than ph 8 5 because alkaline conditions led to more rapid consumption of the reactive species than in acidic solution chloride concentration did not substantially affect nh4 degradation efficiency but changed the contribution of reactive radicals to nh4 degradation both bicarbonate and nom served as radical scavengers and inhibited nh4 removal efficiency the products of nh4 decomposition in the uv nh2cl process included nitrate and nitrite presumably accompanied by gaseous products overall the uv nh2cl process appears to represent an alternative method for nh4 degradation this approach could also be utilized in control of other pollutants acknowledgement we thank the national science foundation of china grants 51708562 21622706 and 51808156 and the

19040,the presence of ammonium nh4 in drinking water treatment results in inhibition of disinfection efficiency and formation of nitrogenous disinfection by products our previous study found monochloramine nh2cl photolysis under 254 nm uv irradiation can be effective for removal of nh4 however the mechanisms of nh4 degradation in this process were unknown the kinetics and fundamental radical chemistry responsible for nh4 removal in the uv nh2cl process were investigated in this study the results showed that the pseudo first order rate constant for nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process ranged between 3 6 10 4 to 1 8 10 3 s 1 solution ph affected radical conversion and a higher nh4 degradation efficiency was achieved under acidic conditions the effects of chloride were limited however the presence of either bicarbonate or natural organic matter scavenged radicals and inhibited nh4 removal nh2cl photolysis generated an aminyl radical nh2 and a chlorine radical cl that further transformed to a chlorine dimer cl2 and a hydroxyl radical ho the second order rate constants for cl and cl2 reacting with nh4 were estimated as 2 59 108 m 1s 1 and 3 45 105 m 1s 1 at ph 3 9 respectively cl cl2 and ho contributed 95 2 3 5 and 1 3 to nh4 removal respectively at the condition of 3 mm nh2cl and ph 7 5 major products included nitrite and nitrate possibly accompanied by nitrogen containing gases this investigation provides insight into the photochemistry of nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process and offers an alternative method for drinking water production graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv nh2cl process ammonium reactive chlorine radicals kinetic model 1 introduction ammonium nh4 is a common contaminant in groundwater and surface water in china which has become a great environmental issue the concentration of nh4 in natural waters has been reported to range from 0 1 to 3 mg l and sometimes reached more than 10 mg l according to a report on the state of the environment in china http datacenter mep gov cn nh4 in drinking water can diminish chlorination disinfection efficiency by converting free chlorine to inorganic combined chlorine predominantly nh2cl contribute to taste and odor problems and promote the formation of harmful disinfection byproducts dbps villanueva et al 2014 a guideline upper limit concentration for nh4 of 0 5 mg l as n has been established for drinking water in china standards for drinking water quality of china gb5749 2006 conventional drinking water treatment processes including coagulation sedimentation and filtration are ineffective for nh4 removal due to its extremely high solubility and stability han et al 2013 breakpoint chlorination is effective but significantly increases chlorine consumption because chlorine dosages need to be at least 1 6 fold higher than the nh4 molar concentration this process has also caused public concern due to the potential generation of highly genotoxic nitrogenous dbps bond et al 2011 although several additional nh4 eliminating methods have been developed such as biological nitrification ion exchange and chemical precipitation each of these methods has disadvantages in drinking water treatment liu et al 2017 therefore research related to nh4 removal for drinking water treatment processes continues our previous study demonstrated that the combination of chlorination and uv irradiation at 254 nm was effective for nh4 removal when the molar ratio of chlorine to nh4 was lower than 1 0 zhang et al 2015 compared with breakpoint chlorination this process accomplished greater nh4 removal efficiency and less dbp generation apparent rate constants of free chlorine reacting with nh4 nh3 at ph 7 have been reported to be 1 3 104 m 1s 1 qiang and adams 2004 and 1 8 104 m 1s 1 morris and isaac 1983 thus free chlorine is entirely consumed and transformed into monochloramine nh2cl which is predominant in solution under the condition of cl2 n molar ratio less than 1 0 uv irradiation provides an additional mechanism for nh4 degradation the uv chlorine process as an advanced oxidation process aop has been widely investigated for decomposition of emerging contaminants jin et al 2011 pan et al 2017 ye et al 2017 wang et al 2017 the uv nh2cl process been incorporated into treatment of reverse osmosis ro permeate and it was demonstrated to be similar to the uv h2o2 process for degradation of carbamazepine and benzoate at ph 5 5 8 3 chuang et al 2017 a recent study reported the uv nh2cl process to be effective for 1 4 dioxane removal patton et al 2016 these previous studies have indicated that the uv nh2cl process can be an effective method for inclusion in drinking water treatment however limited information was available to address nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process li and blatchley investigated the photolysis of nh2cl by uv254 irradiation li and blatchley iii 2009 the proposed mechanism of the reaction involved photolytic products of the aminyl radical nh2 and the chlorine radical cl as described by reaction 1 in table 1 the quantum yield of nh2cl photolysis at 254 nm was reported to be 0 62 0 049 mol es 1 li and blatchley iii 2009 cl can selectively react with electron rich moieties such as phenols anilines olefins and amines minakata et al 2017 among these cl reacts with particularly rapidly with amine moieties through either electron transfer or h abstraction beitz et al 1998 in addition cl can be converted to a chlorine dimer cl2 in the presence of chloride reaction 2 in table 1 jayson et al 1973 klaning and wolff 1984 furthermore the hydroxyl radical ho can be generated through the reaction of cl with water or oh under alkaline conditions reactions 3 8 in table 1 the degradation of nh4 by ho is recognized but occurs at a rate that is slower than many other reactions that involve ho huang et al 2008 when the molar ratio of chlorine to nh3 nitrogen is less than 1 0 nh4 nh3 and nh2cl can coexist in the aqueous solution although nh2cl photolysis is an important pathway for nh4 nh3 removal in the uv chlorine process the presence of free radicals may also contribute to nh4 nh3 oxidation however the fate and contribution of these radicals to nh4 degradation have not been investigated previously the mechanism and pathway of nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process also needs to be clarified in order to systemically understand the kinetics and mechanism of nh4 decomposition in the uv nh2cl process this study focused on three aspects 1 examination of the efficiency and main factors that influence nh4 removal in the uv nh2cl process 2 development of a model to describe nh4 degradation and to evaluate the contribution of reactive species to nh4 degradation and 3 to determine the degradation products and to summarize the nh4 degradation pathway 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ammonium chloride nh4cl 99 pure and sodium hypochlorite solutions naocl 10 active

into ultrapure water and filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber membrane whatman all stock solutions were prepared weekly and stored in the dark at 4 c 2 2 uv system uv irradiation experiments were conducted using a flat plate collimated beam the characteristic wavelength of this device was 254 nm and incident uv254 fluence rate was 3 3 10 7 einstein s 1 l 1 corresponding to 2 00 mw cm 2 as determined by iodide iodate chemical actinometry rahn et al 2006 the effective path length was 3 5 cm the uv lamps were warmed up for 20 min before experiments 2 3 experimental procedures monochloramine nh2cl standard solutions were prepared daily by slowly pouring a free chorine solution over an ammonium chloride solution to achieve a chlorine to ammonium molar ratio cl2 n of 0 99 1 for over 30 min with rapid stirring both solutions were adjusted to ph 10 with sodium hydroxide before mixing shang and blatchley iii 1999 nh2cl standard solutions were standardized to the desired concentration 0 5 4 mm prior to each experiment in experiments a target quantity of ammonium solution was spiked into nh2cl standard solution 0 5 4 mm to achieve an initial nh4 concentration of 70 μm 1 mg l as n then the solution was subjected to uv irradiation at 254 nm all experimental solutions were buffered with 10 mm of phosphate buffer to maintain ph at 6 5 7 5 or 8 5 20 mm of chloride cl 2 5 mm of bicarbonate hco3 and 5 mg c l of natural organic matter nom were spiked into solutions in separate experiments to examine the effects of these constituents on reaction progress samples were collected at specified time intervals samples were subjected to measurements of nh4 concentration immediately without adding reductive quenchers because quenchers can convert nh2cl back to nh4 the reaction rate constants of reactive chlorine species cl and cl2 with nh4 were estimated by a laser flash photolysis technique this technology has been successfully applied for estimation of rate constants for cl and cl2 with mono and dichloramine li et al 2018 irradiated solutions of na2s2o8 in distilled water generated sulfate radicals so4 which reacted rapidly with cl and converted to cl or cl2 with an equilibrium constant of 1 4 105 m 1 buxton et al 1998 the experimental solution was without ph adjustment and ph was determined as 3 9 therefore nh4 was dominant 99 8 then the rate constant of chlorine radicals cl and cl2 with nh4 was estimated by monitoring absorbance at 340 nm as a surrogate for the decay rate of cl2 additionally the rate constant of ho with nh4 was measured using the same laser flash photolysis system and applied kscn as a competition compound song et al 2012 the solution was without ph adjustment and ph was determined as 3 2 therefore nh4 was dominant 99 8 details are illustrated in the supporting information si text s1 and fig s1 for chlorine radicals with nh4 and text s2 and fig s2 for ho with nh4 respectively the steady state concentrations of radicals were measured by probe methods as illustrated by text s3 to text s5 all experiments were conducted in triplicate the relative standard deviation rsd of three replicates was required to be within 5 to meet the quality assurance quality control qa qc reporting requirements 2 4 analytical methods nh4 concentrations were measured by a selective electrode method using a ph ise meter thermo orion 720a equipped with an nh4 selective electrode thermo orion 95 12 anonymous 2012 the minimum reporting limit mrl of nh4 was 0 01 mg l as n in the range of nh4 concentration from 0 to 2 mg l as n the pearson correlation coefficient r2 for the linear regression of the calibration curve was higher than 0 999 suggesting this detection method was suitable for nh4 analysis nh2cl was analyzed by membrane introduction mass spectrometry mims shang and blatchley iii 1999 weng et al 2012 nitrite and nitrate were measured by ion chromatography anonymous 2012 concentrations of tert butanol were measured by gas chromatography agilent 7890a using a flame ionization detector fid detector and a sac 5 column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm film thickness supelco oakville on canada sec butanol was employed as an internal standard helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the oven temperature was held at 40 c for 5 min and was then increased at a rate of 30 c min to 190 c with a total run time of 10 min the fid was maintained at 300 c tert and sec butanol were identified by comparison of retention times to known standards the method detection limits mdls for tert butanol were

60 acetonitrile v v and 40 h2o with 0 1 acetic acid v v at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 at 35 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of nh4 in uv nh2cl process fig 1 shows the pseudo first order rate results for nh4 degradation by uv254 irradiation alone chloramination alone and the uv nh2cl process negligible quantities of nh4 were degraded by exposure to a uv254 dose up to 1000 mj cm2 largely because of the low molar absorptivity of nh4 at 254 nm wavelengths fig s3 in si this result suggests that direct photodegradation of nh4 by exposure to uv254 radiation can be ignored which is consistent with our previous study zhang et al 2015 chloramination resulted in only 1 7 nh4 removal by exposure to 3 mm of nh2cl during 500 s of dark reaction in contrast extensive nh4 degradation was observed during the uv nh2cl process 51 6 of nh4 was removed during co exposure with 3 mm of nh2cl and a of uv254 dose of 400 mj cm2 nh4 degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics with a rate constant of 1 8 10 3 s 1 thus nh4 degradation was more effective by the uv nh2cl process than by either uv254 irradiation or chloramination alone the enhancement of nh4 degradation by the uv nh2cl process was consistent with previous reports of uv nh2cl degradation of 1 4 dioxane benzoate and carbamazepine chuang et al 2017 patton et al 2016 fig s3 in si indicates that nh2cl absorbs photons with the molar absorptivity of 354 m 1cm 1 at 254 nm as shown in fig s4 in si the concentration of nh2cl gradually decreased with increasing uv254 exposure time nh2cl degradation followed pseudo first order kinetics with a rate constant of 1 4 10 3 s 1 it should be noted that in realistic treatment of ammonia containing water by the uv chlorine process nh4 nh3 was removed primarily by chloramine photolysis accompanied by a smaller contribution by the radicals ho cl and cl2 et al according to figure s3 17 5 μm of nh2cl degradation is necessary for a removal of 1 0 μm of nh4 nh3 at ph 7 5 the faster loss rate of nh2cl can ascribe to both nh2cl photolysis as well as the consumption by radicals oxidation whereas nh3 nh4 elimination can merely attribute to radicals oxidation the consistency between nh2cl degradation and nh4 removal suggests that reactive radicals generated from nh2cl photolysis contribute to nh4 degradation 3 2 kinetic modeling of nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process uv254 irradiation leads to cleavage of the n cl bond of nh2cl yielding an aminyl radical nh2 and a chlorine radical cl li and blatchley iii 2009 in general the contribution of nh2 to nh4 degradation was assumed to be negligible because nh2 has been reported to have low reactivity with primary amines 105 m 1s 1 patton et al 2016 cl can selectively react with an amine moiety via hydrogen abstraction guo et al 2017 cheng et al 2018 cl also tends to transform to other reactive radicals in particular cl will react with cl resulting in production of cl2 with an equilibrium constant of 1 4 105 m 1 buxton et al 1998 cl can also convert to ho via cl2 and cloh pathways violet 1981 the radical reaction scheme of the uv nh2cl process for nh4 degradation is illustrated in fig 2 a kinetic model of nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process was established based on the hypothesis that cl cl2 and ho were primarily responsible for nh4 degradation under the assumption of nh2cl being present at a steady state concentration during the experimental conditions the kinetic model of nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process can be expressed as eq 1 1 d nh 4 dt k cl nh 4 cl ss k cl 2 nh 4 cl 2 ss k oh nh 4 oh ss nh 4 where nh4 represents the concentration of nh4 k cl nh4 k cl2 nh4 and k ho nh4 are the second order rate constants for reactions involving cl cl2 and ho with nh4 respectively cl ss cl2 ss and ho ss were the steady state concentrations of cl cl2 and ho respectively the rate constant of ho and nh4 was estimated as described in text s2 ho generated by laser flash photolysis of h2o2 scn was selected as a competitor because this compound has been extensively applied for determining ho rate constants with a wide variety of substrates song et al 2012 the apparent second order rate constant of nh4 with ho was estimated to be 1 38 107 m 1s 1 at ph 3 2 huang s study suggested the rate constant of nh3 with ho was 1 0 108 m 1s 1 ph 9 3 whereas the reaction of nh4 with ho can be ignored huang et al 2008 the obtained rate constants of nh4 with ho was nearly three orders of magnitudes lower than the competitor scn with ho which may result in a certain degree of deviation however as shown in fig s2 the decrease of the absorbance of scn 2 at 490 nm with increasing initial nh4 concentration demonstrated nh4 reacted competitively with scn for ho these results imply ho can react with nh4 however it is relevant to note that nh4 reacts slowly with these radicals as compared with nh3 the pseudo second order rate constant of chlorine radicals cl and cl2 with nh4 was calculated by monitoring the decay of transient absorbance at 340 nm alegre et al 2000 fig s1a shows the decay of cl2 absorption intensity and fig s1b illustrates the cl2 decay rate decreased linearly with increasing initial cl concentration from 2 to 12 mm accordingly the second order rate constant of cl and cl2 with nh4 was calculated to be 2 59 108 and 3 45 105 m 1s 1 at ph 3 9 respectively text s1 the reactivity of cl towards nh4 was three orders of magnitude of rate constant for the reaction with cl2 the relative higher reactivity of cl are comparable with the reactivity of cl with key substrates classes including saturated aliphatic 108 109 m 1s 1 aromatic 1010 m 1s 1 and olefin 109 m 1s 1 zhang and parker 2018 reactivity of cl and cl2 towards nh4 nh3 was attributed to the relatively high oxidation potentials for these radicals of 2 43 and 2 13 ev respectively jin et al 2011 nh4 nh3 is likely to react with chlorine radicals via hydrogen abstraction from a n h bond followed by a sequence of reactions starting from the aminyl radical nh2 the pathway of h atom abstraction by chlorine radicals has been proposed previously minakata et al 2017 additionally the halogen radical can promote the halogenation of nitroaromatic compounds calza et al 2008 therefore chlorine radicals probably enhance the chlorination of nh4 nh3 resulting in the formation of nh2cl and further photodegradation photolysis of nh2cl yields nh2 and cl then cl reacts with chloride ion to form cl2 nh2cl itself may serve as an important radical scavenger with the reaction rate constants of 2 4 0 3 107 m 1 s 1 for cl and 6 5 3 5 106 m 1 s 1 for cl2 respectively li et al 2018 thus formation and scavenging reactions result in a steady state for each radical species the presence of free radicals can promote nh4 nh3 oxidation in this study the steady state concentrations of cl cl2 and ho were quantified by employing different probe compounds as illustrated in text s3 text s4 and text s5 in si the values were 2 4 10 12 m 7 8 10 11 m and 8 2 10 13 m for cl cl2 and ho respectively for an initial concentration of 3 mm nh2cl containing 3 2 mm chloride at ph 7 5 these results suggest that cl2 was the predominant radical in solution the concentration of cl2 was nearly 30 fold and 95 fold larger than that of cl and ho respectively since the rate constant of cl2 with nh4 around 3 45 105 m 1s 1 was substantially lower than those of cl and ho around 2 59 108 and 1 38 107 m 1s 1 nh4 degradation may be largely attributed to reactions involving cl rather than cl2 and ho the fates and contributions of reactive radials on nh4 degradation will also depend on the experimental conditions in this study the steady state concentrations of radicals under different experimental conditions were predicted using the mathematical modeling software kintecus version 5 55 on the basis of the major elementary chemical and photochemical reactions this kinetic model has been successfully applied in uv chlorine uv h2o2 and uv ozone processes parker and mitch 2016 grebel et al 2010 the main photochemical reactions and their rate equilibrium constants used in kintecus modeling are represented in table 1 based on equation 1 each specific radical pseudo first order rate constant for nh4 degradation was calculated as the radical s second order rate constant multiplied by its pseudo steady state concentrations their sum of these species specific pseudo first order rate constants was used as an estimate of the overall pseudo first order rate constant of nh4 nh3 degradation 3 3 effects of initial nh2cl concentration the initial nh2cl concentration affected the degradation of nh4 in the uv nh2cl process nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process followed pseudo first order kinetics fig s5 in si fig 3 indicates that the rate constants of nh4 degradation gradually increased from 3 6 10 4 to 1 8 10 3 s 1 with a corresponding increase of nh2cl concentration from 0 5 to 3 0 mm essentially the increase of initial nh2cl concentration enhanced the generation of cl reaction 1 in table 1 because cl could be transformed to cl2 and ho the increase of cl generation also promoted formation of cl2 and ho therefore the increase in nh2cl dosage promoted reactive radical formation and enhanced nh4 degradation under the condition of 3 mm nh2cl the contributions of cl cl2 and ho to nh4 degradation were 95 2 3 5 and 1 3 respectively fig 3 in contrast the rate constant decreased slightly to 1 6 10 3 s 1 at 4 0 mm nh2cl this was likely attributable to the consumption of reactive radicals by excess nh2cl as described in table 1 reactions 10 12 overdosing of nh2cl resulted in additional consumption of cl cl2 and ho relative to experiments conducted at lower initial nh2cl concentration which was consistent with a previous study of the inhibition of ba degradation in uv chlorine process fang et al 2014 3 4 effects of ph the effect of ph on nh4 degradation was examined by conducting experiments at ph 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 these conditions are also representative of practical applications in municipal drinking water treatment in this ph range ammonia n was the present largely in the form of nh4 pk a 9 25 deborde and von gunten 2008 nh4 accounts for 96 0 92 9 and 87 7 of total ammonia nitrogen sum of nh4 and nh3 at ph 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 respectively the reactivity of reactive radicals towards nh4 nh3 was also ph dependency table s1 fig 4 and fig s6 in si indicate that the degradation rate of nh4 decreased as ph increased from 6 5 to 8 5 the pseudo first order rate constant of nh4 decreased from 2 2 10 3 s 1 at ph 6 5 to 1 7 10 3 s 1at ph 8 5 the predicted results matched well with the experimental observation the relative contributions of cl cl2 and ho to the overall rate constant of nh4 degradation was 97 2 0 2 and 0 4 respectively at ph 6 5 whereas these contributions changed to 83 3 1 0 and 0 7 respectively at ph 8 5 these results suggest nh4 degradation relied less on cl with increasing ph while the contributions of ho increased slightly with ph previous studies have indicated that the photolysis of nh2cl appeared to be largely independent of ph under circumneutral conditions li and blatchley iii 2009 however solution ph influenced the transformation of cl into ho via cloh the first order rate constant of cl with h2o was 2 5 105 s 1 whereas this constant significantly increased to 1 8 1010 m 1s 1 in alkaline solution reaction 3 and 5 in table 1 as a result an increasing ph accelerates the transformation of cl to ho and reduces the nh4 degradation rate because cl reacts more quickly with nh4 than does ho 3 5 effects of water constituents chloride bicarbonate nom chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 natural organic matter nom are common constituents in real water their presence may affect the nh4 degradation efficiency in the uv nh2cl process each of these three water constituents was examined under relevant environmental conditions and their effects on nh4 removal are illustrated in fig 5 and fig s7 in si the results shown in fig 5 indicate that modeling results were generally consistent with the experimental data the concentration of chloride in the control sample was 2 2 mm induced by the addition of 2 mm nh2cl in solution with the increase of chloride concentration to 20 mm the overall pseudo first order rate constant of nh4 degradation remained stable at around 1 8 10 3 s 1 the modeling results indicated that the individual contributions of cl cl2 and ho to nh4 degradation changed from 95 2 3 5 and 1 3 in the control condition to 88 8 7 7 and 3 5 in the presence of 20 mm cl respectively cl reacted rapidly with cl to form cl2 the second order rate constant of this reaction was 8 0 109 m 1s 1 reaction 2 in table 1 the rate constant for the reverse reaction was 1 1 105 s 1 thus the increase of cl2 contribution could be attributed to an increase of cl2 concentration with increasing cl concentration in addition the effect of cl on ho was negligible because the reaction of cl with ho was counterbalanced gao et al 2017 the rate constants of the forward and backward of cl and ho reactions were 4 3 109 m 1s 1 and 6 1 109 s 1 respectively reactions 8 and 9 in table 1 the effect of bicarbonate on nh4 degradation was evaluated by adding 2 5 mm bicarbonate to the uv nh2cl system at the initial nh2cl concentration of 3 mm and ph 7 5 the rate constant of nh4 degradation decreased from 1 8 10 3 s 1 to 1 2 10 3 s 1 as the bicarbonate concentration increased from 0 to 2 5 mm the individual contributions of cl cl2 and ho to nh4 degradation in the absence of hco3 were 1 4 10 3 3 8 10 4 and 8 0 10 5 s 1 respectively these constants reduced to 9 1 10 4 2 6 10 4 and 7 5 10 5 s 1 respectively in the presence of hco3 these results suggest the scavenging effect of hco3 on cl and cl2 were much stronger than that on ho due to the larger rate constant between hco3 and cl than that of hco3 with ho reaction 25 and 26 in table 1 in addition the generation of ho depended on transformation of cl the decrease of cl concentration also limited the formation of ho nh4 degradation rate in the uv nh2cl process decreased from 1 8 10 3 s 1 to 1 4 10 3 s 1 when the nom concentration increased from 0 to 5 mg l correspondingly the presence of 5 mg c l of nom reduced the rate of nh2cl photodegradation by around 22 nom consumed free chlorine and absorbed uv photons in addition nom also scavenged radials with reaction rate constants of 2 5 104 and 1 3 104 mg l 1s 1 for ho and cl respectively guo et al 2017 thus increasing nom concentrations reduced the concentrations of the reactive radicals on the other hand nom also undergoes reactions under uv irradiation to produce triplet states of natural organic matter 3nom li et al 2017 promotion of nh4 nh3 oxidation by 3nom has not been directly observed however chlorine radical generation via 3nom oxidation in the presence of chloride has been proposed in a seawater system parker and mitch 2016 based on the results of this study this pathway plays a minor role on chlorine radical formation due to a relatively low chloride concentration in drinking water as compared with seawater additionally nom may absorb uv light and reduce solution transmittance by 10 20 the light screening effects inhibited nh4 nh3 oxidation as a result nom reduced the degradation rate of nh4 in the uv nh2cl process by reducing the steady state concentration of reactive radicals 3 6 products the evolution of oxidized nitrogen containing products nitrite and nitrate during nh4 degradation in the uv nh2cl process is illustrated in fig 6 the evolution of total products during uv photolysis of experimental solution containing both nh2cl 3000 μm and nh4 nh3 70 μm is illustrated in fig s8 it has been reported that nh2cl photolysis at ph 7 5 yields 44 4 of nitrogen in the form of no2 and 9 7 in the form of no3 li and blatchley iii 2009 the formation of no2 and no3 from nh2cl photolysis were much greater than these values in the experiments described herein probably due to a relatively high initial nh2cl concentration this study mainly focused on the net formation of nitrogen containing products from nh4 nh3 oxidation by radicals the concentration of nh4 gradually decreased from 1 0 to 0 1 mg l as n during 20 min of the uv nh2cl process at ph 7 5 nitrite and nitrate were the dominant products of nh4 degradation after 20 min of uv nh2cl treatment the conversion rates of nh4 to nitrite and nitrate were around 43 5 and 20 4 respectively reactions 32 34 for nitrite and 35 38 for nitrate in table 1 as shown in fig 6 the dashed line indicates the modeling results predicted by the kintecus method the consistency between experimental and modeling results suggest that both nh4 degradation and the product formation can be accurately predicted by the proposed reaction mechanism according to the radical mediated reactions listed in table 1 based on the radical reactions nh2 was proposed to be a critical intermediate in the reaction of nh4 reacting with cl cl2 and ho de laat et al 2010 nh2 is unstable and can be further oxidized to nh2o2 by dissolved oxygen in solution laszlo et al 1998 then nitrite and nitrate are generated via a series of radical reactions reaction 32 38 in table 1 the experimental results indicate that nitrite nitrate accounts for about 61 0 of total nh4 degradation nh4 degradation may also have yielded nitrogen containing gaseous products such as n2 and n2o as described in reactions 39 48 in table 1 de laat et al 2010 4 conclusions ammonium nh4 can be degraded by the uv nh2cl process the pseudo first order rate constants for nh4 degradation increased from 3 6 10 4 s 1 to 1 8 10 3 s 1 with an increase of initial nh2cl concentration from 0 5 to 3 mm the reactive chlorine radicals cl and cl2 and ho each contributed to nh4 degradation the second order rate constants for reactions between cl and cl2 with nh4 were estimated to be 2 59 108 m 1s 1 and 3 45 105 m 1s 1 respectively cl were the primary reactive radicals for nh4 decomposition faster nh4 degradation was achieved at ph 6 5 than ph 8 5 because alkaline conditions led to more rapid consumption of the reactive species than in acidic solution chloride concentration did not substantially affect nh4 degradation efficiency but changed the contribution of reactive radicals to nh4 degradation both bicarbonate and nom served as radical scavengers and inhibited nh4 removal efficiency the products of nh4 decomposition in the uv nh2cl process included nitrate and nitrite presumably accompanied by gaseous products overall the uv nh2cl process appears to represent an alternative method for nh4 degradation this approach could also be utilized in control of other pollutants acknowledgement we thank the national science foundation of china grants 51708562 21622706 and 51808156 and the

currently reaching 63 million tons per year moe 2014 phosphorous in the lm is considered the main cause of eutrophication of fresh water and almost half of civil complaints on odor problems are related to lm the management of lm in korea focuses on its conversion into liquid fertilizer or compost under aerobic condition kim et al 2013 won et al 2017 however these processes entail many drawbacks such as requiring huge electrical energy input and the loss of significant organic content which on the other hand could be converted into energy rich biogas via anaerobic digestion ad nasir et al 2012 whatever the treatment process may be lm is stored for long periods 10 150 d in storage tanks before transport to treatment facilities during storage in addition to undesirable odorous gases including ammonia and hydrogen sulfide h2s greenhouse gases ghg such as carbon dioxide co2 nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 are also generated amon et al 2006 chadwick et al 2011 dai and blanes vidal 2013 wang et al 2014 globally the second largest source of ghg emissions is ch4 which is produced via intestinal fermentation and in the process of storage and subsequent management of lm in the agricultural sector massé et al 2008 these various sources of ch4 are all produced by the similar way of ad carried out by the activity of indigenous and inoculated methanogens ch4 emissions related to lm accounts for about 12 41 of total agricultural ch4 emissions and thus the development of manure storage and treatment technologies for reducing ch4 emissions could efficiently contribute to less global ghg emissions from the agricultural sector chadwick et al 2011 although less efforts have been put into reducing ch4 emissions during storage of lm compared to ad of lm there have been a few studies which have stored lm in particular slurry type manure after acidification with sulfuric acid wang et al 2014 the acidification was however initially applied as a strategy to reduce the ammonia emissions and improve fertilizer quality sommer and hutchungs 1995 the principle behind this treatment is that the portion of free ammonia nh3 decreases under low ph conditions fangueiro et al 2015 some reports have shown that slurry acidification to below ph of 6 0 can reduce ammonia emissions by 70 81 during storage kai et al 2008 sommer and hutchungs 1995 in denmark 11 of the total slurry produced was acidified in 2010 at percentage which had increased to 20 in 2015 hou et al 2017 the reasons why acidification is effective in suppressing the indigenous methanogenic activity is not well understood but it is related with vulnerable characteristics of methanogens under acidic condition and the accumulation of fermentation products ottosen et al 2009 according to petersen et al 2012 the acidification of cattle slurry using h2so4 to ph 5 5 could reduce the ch4 emissions during storage by 67 87 compared to the untreated one petersen et al 2012 in addition the acidification may retard the degradation of easily biodegradable organic matter in lm resulting in an increased biogas production in the subsequent ad fangueiro et al 2015 it follows from these observations that acidification of lm could be an appropriate strategy to preserve the degradable organics in lm while reducing ch4 emissions during storage however few studies have so far addressed changes in the microbial community and its total concentration as a result of acidification or changes in the specific methanogenic activity sma caused by acidification which could be highly important from both a scientific and an engineering point of view in addition the total reduction of ghg emissions achievable by reducing ch4 emissions during storage by acidification and the associated effect on biogas production by ad has never been previously addressed experimentally in the present work pig slurry ps was acidified with h2so4 solution to a ph ranging from 5 0 to 7 0 and then stored for 40 d during the storage the gases produced mainly ch4 were measured and the stored ps were examined for microbial community analysis the stored ps was also subjected to measurements of ribonucleic acid rna content sma and biochemical ch4 potential bmp test finally the total achievable reduction of ghg emissions resulting from acidification ph effect on ch4 emissions and increased ch4 production during ad was estimated 2 materials and methods 2 1 pig slurry and seeding sludge fresh ps was collected from the storage tank at local farm that raises 1000 pigs in south korea it was transferred to laboratory within 4 h

average temperature of ps tanks in korea is reported to be around 30 c choi et al 2001 during the storage there was no mechanical agitation the composition of produced gas and its amount were analyzed once or two times a week when gas was analyzed the headspace of tanks was purged with air 0 5 l min for 5 min to mimic the actual upper layer condition of ps storage tank berg et al 2006 after 40 d of

nitrogen gas shaking speed and temperature were controlled at 150 rpm and 35 1 c respectively the volume and composition of biogas were analyzed two times a week until the biogas production was negligible the experiments were carried out by duplicate and the results were averaged 2 2 3 bmp test bmp test was conducted using the same bottles used in the sma test 15 ml of the acidified ps stored at different phs for 40 d were added to the bottles corresponding to an initial substrate concentration at 8 0 10 9 g cod l 65 ml of seeding sludge was added to reach an i s inoculum substrate vs cod ratio at 2 3 to 3 0 after adjusting the ph at 7 8 0 1 by using 3 m hcl or 3 m koh all bottles were flushed with 99 999 nitrogen at the flow rate of 3 l min for 10 min to provide anaerobic condition then it was sealed with butyl rubber stoppers secured with aluminum crimp the bottles were placed in an incubator at 35 1 c under shaking speed of 150 rpm the supply method of nutrient and measurement method of biogas production were same in the sma test the experiments were carried out by duplicate and the results were averaged the cumulative ch4 production curve in the bmp test was

during the storage was calculated by the following eq based on only emitted ch4 eq 2 2 g h g s t o r a g e m 1 g w p c h 4 v 1 10 3 where ghg storage is the amount of ghg emissions calculated based on

storage the ps was stored for 40 d and cumulative ch4 emissions was expressed in terms of co2 eq according to eq 2 as clearly shown in fig 1 ch4 emissions from ps was efficiently reduced by acidification ch4 emission was immediately detected in the control non acidified ps as well as in ph 6 5 and 7 0 while it took about 20 d at ph 5 0 6 0 after 40 d of storage a maximum cumulative ch4 emissions of 3 7 kg co2 eq ton ps was detected in the control which was in the similar range of previous studies misselbrook et al 2016 wolter et al 2004 this emission was almost reduced by half to 1 8 kg co2 eq ton ps at ph 7 0 this huge drop was unexpected since methanogens are known to be active at neutral ph of 7 0 and ph was increased to 7 6 after storing for 40 d table 1 such ch4 reduction may be assigned to the toxic effect of sulfate as a result of h2so4 addition which was previously highlighted by petersen et al 2012 it was found that sulfate addition alone at 4 8 g so4 2 l by using k2so4 without causing ph drop exhibited a similar ch4 reduction performance to that attained by acidification to ph 5 5 using hydrochloric acid sulfate is known to inhibit anaerobic methanogenesis via two ways the reduced form sulfide can directly disturb the various coenzyme sulfide linkages and the assimilatory metabolisms of sulfur inside the cytoplasm chen et al 2008 according to karhadkar et al 1987 sulfide concentrations at 0 2 0 8 g l can inhibit methanogenesis up to 50 the other way of inhibiting methanogenesis is related with competing electron uptake between sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogens sulfate reducing reaction is thermodynamically more favorable than methanogenic reaction and this is further discussed later also the other reason behind this drop could be the inhibitory effect of produced organic acids on the methanogenic activity at ph 7 0 the total concentration of organic acids mainly acetate and propionate increased to 8 2 g l which was 45 higher value than the control it is reported that although suitable ph is provided to methanogens the existence of organic acids at high concentration could inhibit methanogenic activity dogan et al 2007 liquid analysis and microbial activity test during storage are remained as future works to clearly reveal the reason of ch4 emission drop at ph 7 0 as acidification strength increased ch4 emissions further decreased reaching 0 1 kg co2 eq ton ps at ph 5 0 however there was a slight drop from ph below 6 0 like our study misselbrook et al 2016 observed that ch4 emissions from cattle slurry was declined by 61 compared to the control as a result of ph decrease to 5 5 using sulfuric acid and according to berg et al 2006 lactic acid assisted acidification of cattle slurry to below ph of 5 0 could reduce ch4 emission by about 91 98 compared to the control berg et al 2006 solids and liquid characteristics of raw ps control non acidified and acidified ps after 40 d of storage are arranged in table 1 from the changes in vs and tcod concentration showing similar change pattern with high correlation p 0 001 it can be easily inferred that organic matters in the ps was substantially degraded during 40 d of storage both vs and tcod concentrations were decreased by 30 from the initial value raw slurry in the control meanwhile in acidified ps the reduction rates in these parameters were lower than that occurred in the case of control at ph 5 0 6 0 vs and tcod removal efficiency were decreased to around 5 15 after 40 d of storage however it was noteworthy to see that the emitted ch4 accounts for only about 1 3 of the organic matter degradation on cod basis for example at ph 6 0 25 ml of ch4 was emitted per l of ps corresponding to 0 07 g cod 1 g cod 350 ml ch4 since 9 8 g l of cod reduction was detected at ph 6 0 the emitted ch4 accounts for about only 1 of total cod removal the other possible route for removing cod could be sulfate reduction to decrease ph sulfuric acid was added at 0 7 10 4 g so4 2 l which in turn can consume 0 05 0 68 g cod per l of ps assuming 10 conversion of so4 2 to h2s the conversion efficiency of sulfate reduction is generally reported to be around 10 hilton and oleszkiewicz 1988 hu et al 2015 at ph 5 0 where largest amount of sulfate was added the cod removal by sulfate reduction could reach around 20 0 68 76 3 72 3 however it was less than 10 in other ph conditions this clearly indicates that facultative anaerobic bacteria might have a more effective role than that done by anaerobic consortium in degradation of organic matters nonetheless such conclusion needs to be further investigated in the future studies regarding ph behavior table 1 discloses the increase in ph values of all slurries after being stored by 0 2 1 2 compared to initial phs such tendency is usually attributed to the degradation of dissociated organic acids and the mineralization of organic nitrogen petersen et al 2012 by taking into account that organic acids concentration was increased after storage it can be assumed that ph rises were most likely due to the corresponding increases in ammonia concentration the increase of ammonia concentration during storage of lm was also observed in the previous work wang et al 2010 mechanisms of the acidification of slurry for reduction of ch4 emissions and organic matter decomposition can be attributed to the decrease of microbial activity ottosen et al 2009 the effect of such acidification upon microbes was observed through microbial community analysis using ngs tool rna analysis and sma test which would be explained in the next section 3 2 microbial analysis to investigate the change of archaeal community mixed liquor samples of raw and acidified ps at ph of 6 0 and 5 0 as well as control were collected after 40 d and then analyzed by ngs the vast majority of the archaeal community in raw ps was assigned to methanosarcina 70 4 methanolobus 8 8 methanobrevilbacter 7 9 methanocorpusculum 5 4 methanomassiliicoccus 1 2 and methanobacterium 1 1 fig 2 such finding is in agreement with former work by barret et al 2013 that methanosarcina was one of the major contributors to the methanogenesis inside the storage tanks of ps after storing for 40 d methanosarcina remained as the predominant genus in the control 67 0 while its dominance reduced to 45 7 and 34 4 as acidification strength increased to 6 0 and 5 0 respectively additionally the sequences to species level was further assigned by selecting ten representative otus in order to reveal the shifts of methanogenic diversity in detail table 2 it was distinctive to observe that methanosarcina flavescens was dominant in raw ps it is known to have both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic ch4 producing pathways which was often detected in anaerobic digesters for biogas production from various substrates fitzgerald et al 2015 kern et al 2016 vavilin et al 2008 after storing for 40 d the proportion of methanosarcina flavescens was decreased as storage ph decreased while the dominance of other species such as methanobrevibacter olleyae methanocorpusculum aggregans methanomassiliicocus luminyensis and methanoculleus bourgense was increased these methanogens with increased dominance are known to have only hydrogenotrophic ch4 producing pathway for their metabolism dridi et al 2007 ollivier et al 1986 rea et al 2007 xun et al 1989 ngs is a good tool to easily tell the changes in microbial community but cannot provide enough information on the changes in microbial activity or number of effective microorganisms vss is a common way of representing biomass concentration but it cannot be used when the feedstock contains solids matters and their degradation is incomplete as in this study thus rna concentration assay was employed to estimate the amount of viable biomass kim et al 2011 liwarska bizukojc and ledackowicz 2001 the rna concentration in the control was 80 mg l which was not much different from that was found for the raw slurry 88 mg l fig 2 however it was sharply dropped to 43 mg l and 20 mg l as the acidification strength increased to ph values of 6 0 and 5 0 respectively clearly confirming the impact of acidification on inhibiting indigenous microbial growth to confirm further sma test was conducted with acetate as clearly shown in fig 3 the highest value of 22 2 ml ch4 g vss d was observed in the control and it gradually dropped to 21 1 17 7 15 6 15 4 and 14 1 ml ch4 g vss d as acidification ph decreased from 7 0 to 5 0 this result clearly indicates that acidification showed an inhibitory effect on indigenous methanogenic activity however compared to the amount of ch4 emissions during storage there was less difference in the sma value among different ph conditions this tells that the acidification strength applied in this study was not lethal so that indigenous methanogens could recover when the environment turns into a suitable condition 3 3 bmp test to compare ch4 production potential of the control and acidified ps the test was performed for 80 d using the same volume of stored ps the cumulative ch4 production curves were well fitted by the modified gompertz eq eq 1 r2 0 99 and kinetic parameters are arranged in table 3 as shown in fig 4 the ch4 production performance was found to be ph dependent of stored ps ch4 production started to appear after around 10 d in the control while it was detected after 16 d from the acidified ps after 25 d the control reached its maximal value about 158 8 ml this value was increased to 190 9 198 2 218 6 205 1 and 194 1 ml from the ps stored at initial ph of 7 0 6 5 6 0 5 5 and 5 0 respectively as revealed earlier the acidification process of ps could preserve organic matters by inhibiting the indigenous microbial activity during storage thus there was an increased amount of organic matters available per volume of ps resulting in an increased total amount of ch4 production by acidification interestingly however the ch4 yield based on cod input showed different results above ph 6 0 ch4 yields were increased by around 10 compared to the control while it showed lower values at ph 5 5 and 5 0 the possible reasons could be related with the presence of sulfur moset et al 2012 2016 at low concentration sulfur could act as a nutrient but could inhibit methanogenic activity at high concentration in this study of bmp test total sulfate concentration was gradually increased from 0 1 to 1 5 g so4 2 l as acidification strength increased like our study moset et al 2012 observed a similar tendency in ch4 yield as the input ratio of h2so4 acidified slurry increased it means increase of sulfur addition there was an increase in ch4 production up to 20 at 0 6 g so4 2 l while it was decreased by 18 71 and 97 at 0 7 1 7 2 5 g so4 2 l moset et al 2012 in addition it has been previously stated that the presence of sulfate can boost the activity of srb in anaerobic digester which can outcompete with methane producing archaea for electron source such as acetate or hydrogen madden et al 2014 also h2s produced by srb may result in an inhibition on ad process moset et al 2016 therefore the acidification of ps in order to reduce ch4 emissions during storage should be performed in such a way that takes into consideration its impact upon the biogas produced subsequently 3 4 total reduction of greenhouse gases acidification of ps can reduce the ghg emissions during storage and increase ch4 production potential in the subsequent ad for calculating the reduction amount in ghg emission associated to biogas production the electrical energy that can be generated from the produced ch4 was evaluated assuming 30 energy conversion efficiency chemical energy electrical energy 35 1 48 3 kwh can be attained from the produced ch4 per ton of ps table 4 this range of electrical energy corresponds to the ghg reduction of 16 2 22 5 kg co2 eq ton ps considering the ghg emissions factor of 0 466 kg co2 eq kwh in the control the ghg emissions during storage was 3 7 kg co2 eq ton ps and a reduction of 16 2 kg co2 eq ton ps was attained by biogas production resulting in a total 12 5 kg co2 ton ps of ghg emissions reduction among different acidification phs although maximum reduction of ghg emissions during the storage was found at ph of 5 0 maximum overall reduction of ghg emissions was attained at ph of 6 0 with 22 1 kg co2 eq ton ps owing to the increased biogas production therefore it can be concluded that the acidification of ps at ph of 6 0 was an optimum condition reducing further 9 6 kg co2 eq ton ps of ghg compared to the control to our knowledge this was the first study to find an optimum acidification condition of ps in terms of total ghg emissions reduction resulting from the reduced ch4 emissions during storage and subsequent biogas production 4 conclusions from the storage of acidified ps at different phs and their subsequent bmp test following conclusions were drawn 1 during 40 d of storage ch4 emissions of 3 7 kg co2 eq ton ps was detected from the control which was reduced to 0 1 1 8 kg co2 eq ton ps it was almost dropped by half at ph 7 0 and the further drop of ch4 emission was not substantial from ph 6 0 2 methanosarcina was found to be the dominant archaea during storage of ps its dominance was 67 0 of total archaeal sequences in the control which was dropped to 45 7 and 34 4 at ph 6 0 and 5 0 respectively the results of rna analysis and sma test further confirmed the inhibition of indigenous methanogens under acidic condition 3 compared to the control 10 6 l ch4 l ps higher amount of ch4 production 12 7 14 6 l ch4 l ps was attained from the acidified ps owing to the preservation of organic matters in the ps under acidic condition 4 the acidification of ps at ph 6 0 was found to be an optimum condition in terms of maximizing the ghg reduction 0 4 and 22 5 kg co2 eq ton ps during storage and subsequent biogas production respectively achieving further reduction of 9 6 kg co2 eq ton ps compared to the control acknowledgements this work was supported by the r d

19041,in addition to undesirable odorous gases substantial amounts of greenhouse gases ghg particularly methane ch4 are generated during the storage of livestock manure to reduce the ch4 emissions first pig slurry ps was stored for 40 d at 30 c after adjusting the ph at 5 0 7 0 using h2so4 solution in the control non acidified ps 3 7 kg co2 eq ton ps of ch4 emissions was detected which was reduced to 1 8 0 9 0 4 0 2 and 0 1 kg co2 eq ton ps at ph 7 0 6 5 6 0 5 5 and 5 0 respectively methanosarcina was found to be the dominant genus 67 of the total archaeal sequence in the control whose dominance was reduced as storage ph decreased the results of ribonucleic acid analysis and specific methanogenic activity test further confirmed the inhibition of indigenous methanogens by acidification later the biochemical ch4 potential of stored ps was tested compared to the control 10 6 l ch4 l ps the acidified ps showed higher ch4 yields of 12 7 14 6 l ch4 l ps presumably by keeping degradable organic matters in ps under acidic condition among different acidification phs tested the maximum amount of ghg reduction was achieved at ph 6 0 by reducing ch4 emission to 0 4 kg co2 eq ton ps during storage while increasing biogas production potential equivalent to 48 3 kwh ton ps 22 5 kg co2 eq ton ps resulting in a further reduction of 9 6 kg co2 eq ton ps compared to the

currently reaching 63 million tons per year moe 2014 phosphorous in the lm is considered the main cause of eutrophication of fresh water and almost half of civil complaints on odor problems are related to lm the management of lm in korea focuses on its conversion into liquid fertilizer or compost under aerobic condition kim et al 2013 won et al 2017 however these processes entail many drawbacks such as requiring huge electrical energy input and the loss of significant organic content which on the other hand could be converted into energy rich biogas via anaerobic digestion ad nasir et al 2012 whatever the treatment process may be lm is stored for long periods 10 150 d in storage tanks before transport to treatment facilities during storage in addition to undesirable odorous gases including ammonia and hydrogen sulfide h2s greenhouse gases ghg such as carbon dioxide co2 nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 are also generated amon et al 2006 chadwick et al 2011 dai and blanes vidal 2013 wang et al 2014 globally the second largest source of ghg emissions is ch4 which is produced via intestinal fermentation and in the process of storage and subsequent management of lm in the agricultural sector massé et al 2008 these various sources of ch4 are all produced by the similar way of ad carried out by the activity of indigenous and inoculated methanogens ch4 emissions related to lm accounts for about 12 41 of total agricultural ch4 emissions and thus the development of manure storage and treatment technologies for reducing ch4 emissions could efficiently contribute to less global ghg emissions from the agricultural sector chadwick et al 2011 although less efforts have been put into reducing ch4 emissions during storage of lm compared to ad of lm there have been a few studies which have stored lm in particular slurry type manure after acidification with sulfuric acid wang et al 2014 the acidification was however initially applied as a strategy to reduce the ammonia emissions and improve fertilizer quality sommer and hutchungs 1995 the principle behind this treatment is that the portion of free ammonia nh3 decreases under low ph conditions fangueiro et al 2015 some reports have shown that slurry acidification to below ph of 6 0 can reduce ammonia emissions by 70 81 during storage kai et al 2008 sommer and hutchungs 1995 in denmark 11 of the total slurry produced was acidified in 2010 at percentage which had increased to 20 in 2015 hou et al 2017 the reasons why acidification is effective in suppressing the indigenous methanogenic activity is not well understood but it is related with vulnerable characteristics of methanogens under acidic condition and the accumulation of fermentation products ottosen et al 2009 according to petersen et al 2012 the acidification of cattle slurry using h2so4 to ph 5 5 could reduce the ch4 emissions during storage by 67 87 compared to the untreated one petersen et al 2012 in addition the acidification may retard the degradation of easily biodegradable organic matter in lm resulting in an increased biogas production in the subsequent ad fangueiro et al 2015 it follows from these observations that acidification of lm could be an appropriate strategy to preserve the degradable organics in lm while reducing ch4 emissions during storage however few studies have so far addressed changes in the microbial community and its total concentration as a result of acidification or changes in the specific methanogenic activity sma caused by acidification which could be highly important from both a scientific and an engineering point of view in addition the total reduction of ghg emissions achievable by reducing ch4 emissions during storage by acidification and the associated effect on biogas production by ad has never been previously addressed experimentally in the present work pig slurry ps was acidified with h2so4 solution to a ph ranging from 5 0 to 7 0 and then stored for 40 d during the storage the gases produced mainly ch4 were measured and the stored ps were examined for microbial community analysis the stored ps was also subjected to measurements of ribonucleic acid rna content sma and biochemical ch4 potential bmp test finally the total achievable reduction of ghg emissions resulting from acidification ph effect on ch4 emissions and increased ch4 production during ad was estimated

nitrogen gas shaking speed and temperature were controlled at 150 rpm and 35 1 c respectively the volume and composition of biogas were analyzed two times a week until the biogas production was negligible the experiments were carried out by duplicate and the results were averaged 2 2 3 bmp test bmp test was conducted using the same bottles used in the sma test 15 ml of the acidified ps stored at different phs for 40 d were added to the bottles corresponding to an initial substrate concentration at 8 0 10 9 g cod l 65 ml of seeding sludge was added to reach an i s inoculum substrate

condition then it was sealed with butyl rubber stoppers secured with aluminum crimp the bottles were placed in an incubator at 35 1 c under shaking speed of 150 rpm the supply method of nutrient and measurement method of biogas production were same in the sma test the experiments were carried out by duplicate and the results were averaged the cumulative ch4 production curve in the bmp test was

aligned sequences and operational taxonomical units otu 97 100 sequence similarity were assigned using the furthest neighbor clustering algorithm 2 3 3 greenhouse gas the amount of ghg emissions during the storage was calculated by the following eq based on only emitted ch4 eq 2 2 g h g s t o r a g e m 1 g w p c h 4 v 1 10 3 where ghg storage is the amount of ghg emissions calculated based on

the ghg reduction from the produced biogas was estimated by the following eq eq 3 3 g h g b i o g a s p r o d u c t i o n m 2 h h v c h 4 c f η g h g e v 2 10 3 where ghg biogas production is the

storage the ps was stored for 40 d and cumulative ch4 emissions was expressed in terms of co2 eq according to eq 2 as clearly shown in fig 1 ch4 emissions from ps was efficiently reduced by acidification ch4 emission was immediately detected in the control non acidified ps as well as in ph 6 5 and 7 0 while it took about 20 d at ph 5 0 6 0 after 40 d of storage a maximum cumulative ch4 emissions of 3 7 kg co2 eq ton ps was detected in the control which was in the similar range of previous studies misselbrook et al 2016 wolter et al 2004 this emission was almost reduced by half to 1 8 kg co2 eq ton ps at ph 7 0 this huge drop was unexpected since methanogens are known to be active at neutral ph of 7 0 and ph was increased to 7 6 after storing for 40 d table 1 such ch4 reduction may be assigned to the toxic effect of sulfate as a result of h2so4 addition which was previously highlighted by petersen et al 2012 it was found that sulfate addition alone at 4 8 g so4 2 l by using k2so4 without causing ph drop exhibited a similar ch4 reduction performance to that attained by acidification to ph 5 5 using hydrochloric acid sulfate is known to inhibit anaerobic methanogenesis via two ways the reduced form sulfide can directly disturb the various coenzyme sulfide linkages and the assimilatory metabolisms of sulfur inside the cytoplasm chen et al 2008 according to karhadkar et al 1987 sulfide concentrations at 0 2 0 8 g l can inhibit methanogenesis up to 50 the other way of inhibiting methanogenesis is related with competing electron uptake between sulfate reducing bacteria srb and methanogens sulfate reducing reaction is thermodynamically more favorable than methanogenic reaction and this is further discussed later also the other reason behind this drop could be the inhibitory effect of produced organic acids on the methanogenic activity at ph 7 0 the total concentration of organic acids mainly acetate and propionate increased to 8 2 g l which was 45 higher value than the control it is reported that although suitable ph is provided to methanogens the existence of organic acids at high concentration could inhibit methanogenic activity dogan et al 2007 liquid analysis and microbial activity test during storage are remained as future works to clearly reveal the reason of ch4 emission drop at ph 7 0 as acidification strength increased ch4 emissions further decreased reaching 0 1 kg co2 eq ton ps at ph 5 0 however there was a slight drop from ph below 6 0 like our study misselbrook et al 2016 observed that ch4 emissions from cattle slurry was declined by 61 compared to the control as a result of ph decrease to 5 5 using sulfuric acid and according to berg et al 2006 lactic acid assisted acidification of cattle slurry to below ph of 5 0 could reduce ch4 emission by about 91 98 compared to the control berg et al 2006 solids and liquid characteristics of raw ps control non acidified and acidified ps after 40 d of storage are arranged in table 1 from the changes in vs and tcod concentration showing similar change pattern with high correlation p 0 001 it can be easily inferred that organic matters in the ps was substantially degraded during 40 d of storage both vs and tcod concentrations were decreased by 30 from the initial value raw slurry in the control meanwhile in acidified ps the reduction rates in these parameters were lower than that occurred in the case of control at ph 5 0 6 0 vs and tcod removal efficiency were decreased to around 5 15 after 40 d of storage however it was noteworthy to see that the emitted ch4 accounts for only about 1 3 of the organic matter degradation on cod basis for example at ph 6 0 25 ml of ch4 was emitted per l of ps corresponding to 0 07 g cod 1 g cod 350 ml ch4 since 9 8 g l of cod reduction was detected at ph 6 0 the emitted ch4 accounts for about only 1 of total cod removal the other possible route for removing cod could be sulfate reduction to decrease ph sulfuric acid was added at 0 7 10 4 g so4 2 l which in turn can consume 0 05 0 68 g cod per l of ps assuming 10 conversion of so4 2 to h2s the conversion efficiency of sulfate reduction is generally reported to be around 10 hilton and oleszkiewicz 1988 hu et al 2015 at ph 5 0 where largest amount of sulfate was added the cod removal by sulfate reduction could reach around 20 0 68 76 3 72 3 however it was less than 10 in other ph conditions this clearly indicates that facultative anaerobic bacteria might have a more effective role than that done by anaerobic consortium in degradation of organic matters nonetheless such conclusion needs to be further investigated in the future studies regarding ph behavior table 1 discloses the increase in ph values of all slurries after being stored by 0 2 1 2 compared to initial phs such tendency is usually attributed to the degradation of dissociated organic acids and the mineralization of organic nitrogen petersen et al 2012 by taking into account that organic acids concentration was increased after storage it can be assumed that ph rises were most likely due to the corresponding increases in ammonia concentration the increase of ammonia concentration during storage of lm was also observed in the previous work wang et al 2010 mechanisms of the acidification of slurry for reduction of ch4 emissions and organic matter decomposition can be attributed to the decrease of microbial activity ottosen et al 2009 the effect of such acidification upon microbes was observed through microbial community analysis using ngs tool rna analysis and sma test which would be explained in the next section 3 2 microbial analysis to investigate the change of archaeal community mixed liquor samples of raw and acidified ps at ph of 6 0 and 5 0 as well as control were collected after 40 d and then analyzed by ngs the vast majority of the archaeal community in raw ps was assigned to methanosarcina 70 4 methanolobus 8 8 methanobrevilbacter 7 9 methanocorpusculum 5 4 methanomassiliicoccus 1 2 and methanobacterium 1 1 fig 2 such finding is in agreement with former work by barret et al 2013 that methanosarcina was one of the major contributors to the methanogenesis inside the storage tanks of ps after storing for 40 d methanosarcina remained as the predominant genus in the control 67 0 while its dominance reduced to 45 7 and 34 4 as acidification strength increased to 6 0 and 5 0 respectively additionally the sequences to species level was further assigned by selecting ten representative otus in order to reveal the shifts of methanogenic diversity in detail table 2 it was distinctive to observe that methanosarcina flavescens was dominant in raw ps it is known to have both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic ch4 producing pathways which was often detected in anaerobic digesters for biogas production from various substrates fitzgerald et al 2015 kern et al 2016 vavilin et al 2008 after storing for 40 d the proportion of methanosarcina flavescens was decreased as storage ph decreased while the dominance of other species such as methanobrevibacter olleyae methanocorpusculum aggregans methanomassiliicocus luminyensis and methanoculleus bourgense was increased these methanogens with increased dominance are known to have only hydrogenotrophic ch4 producing pathway for their metabolism dridi et al 2007 ollivier et al 1986 rea et al 2007 xun et al 1989 ngs is a good tool to easily tell the changes in microbial community but cannot provide enough information on the changes in microbial activity or number of effective microorganisms vss is a common way of representing biomass concentration but it cannot be used when the feedstock contains solids matters and their degradation is incomplete as in this study thus rna concentration assay was employed to estimate the amount of viable biomass kim et al 2011 liwarska bizukojc and ledackowicz 2001 the rna concentration in the control was 80 mg l which was not much different from that was found for the raw slurry 88 mg l fig 2 however it was sharply dropped to 43 mg l and 20 mg l as the acidification strength increased to ph values of 6 0 and 5 0 respectively clearly confirming the impact of acidification on inhibiting indigenous microbial growth to confirm further sma test was conducted with acetate as clearly shown in fig 3 the highest value of 22 2 ml ch4 g vss d was observed in the control and it gradually dropped to 21 1 17 7 15 6 15 4 and 14 1 ml ch4 g vss d as acidification ph decreased from 7 0 to 5 0 this result clearly indicates that acidification showed an inhibitory effect on indigenous methanogenic activity however compared to the amount of ch4 emissions during storage there was less difference in the sma value among different ph conditions this tells that the acidification strength applied in this study was not lethal so that indigenous methanogens could recover when the environment turns into a suitable condition 3 3 bmp test to compare ch4 production potential of the control and acidified ps the test was performed for 80 d using the same volume of stored ps the cumulative ch4 production curves were well fitted by the modified gompertz eq eq 1 r2 0 99 and kinetic parameters are arranged in table 3 as shown in fig 4 the ch4 production performance was found to be ph dependent of stored ps ch4 production started to appear after around 10 d in the control while it was detected after 16 d from the acidified ps after 25 d the control reached its maximal value about 158 8 ml this value was increased to 190 9 198 2 218 6 205 1 and 194 1 ml from the ps stored at initial ph of 7 0 6 5 6 0 5 5 and 5 0 respectively as revealed earlier the acidification process of ps could preserve organic matters by inhibiting the indigenous microbial activity during storage thus there was an increased amount of organic matters available per volume of ps resulting in an increased total amount of ch4 production by acidification interestingly however the ch4 yield based on cod input showed different results above ph 6 0 ch4 yields were increased by around 10 compared to the control while it showed lower values at ph 5 5 and 5 0 the possible reasons could be related with the presence of sulfur moset et al 2012 2016 at low concentration sulfur could act as a nutrient but could inhibit methanogenic activity at high concentration in this study of bmp test total sulfate concentration was gradually increased from 0 1 to 1 5 g so4 2 l as acidification strength increased like our study moset et al 2012 observed a similar tendency in ch4 yield as the input ratio of h2so4 acidified slurry increased it means increase of sulfur addition there was an increase in ch4 production up to 20 at 0 6 g so4 2 l while it was decreased by 18 71 and 97 at 0 7 1 7 2 5 g so4 2 l moset et al 2012 in addition it has been previously stated that the presence of sulfate can boost the activity of srb in anaerobic digester which can outcompete with methane producing archaea for electron source such as acetate or hydrogen madden et al 2014 also h2s produced by srb may result in an inhibition on ad process moset et al 2016 therefore the acidification of ps in order to reduce ch4 emissions during storage should be performed in such a way that takes into consideration its impact upon the biogas produced subsequently 3 4 total reduction of greenhouse gases acidification of ps can reduce the ghg emissions during storage and increase ch4 production potential in the subsequent ad for calculating the reduction amount in ghg emission associated to biogas production the electrical energy that can be generated from the produced ch4 was evaluated assuming 30 energy conversion efficiency chemical energy electrical energy 35 1 48 3 kwh can be attained from the produced ch4 per ton of ps table 4 this range of electrical energy corresponds to the ghg reduction of 16 2 22 5 kg co2 eq ton ps considering the ghg emissions factor of 0 466 kg co2 eq kwh in the control the ghg emissions during storage was 3 7 kg co2 eq ton ps and a reduction of 16 2 kg co2 eq ton ps was attained by biogas production resulting in a total 12 5 kg co2 ton ps of ghg emissions reduction among different acidification phs although maximum reduction of ghg emissions during the storage was found at ph of 5 0 maximum overall reduction of ghg emissions was attained at ph of 6 0 with 22 1 kg co2 eq ton ps owing to the increased biogas production therefore it can be concluded that the acidification of ps at ph of 6 0 was an optimum condition reducing further 9 6 kg co2 eq ton ps of ghg compared to the control to our knowledge this was the first study to find an optimum acidification condition of ps in terms of total ghg emissions reduction resulting from the reduced ch4 emissions during storage and subsequent biogas production 4 conclusions from the storage of acidified ps at different phs and their subsequent bmp test following conclusions were drawn 1 during 40 d of storage ch4 emissions of 3 7 kg co2 eq ton ps was detected from the control which was reduced to 0 1 1 8 kg co2 eq ton ps it was almost dropped by half at ph 7 0 and the further drop of ch4 emission was not substantial from ph 6 0 2 methanosarcina was found to be the dominant archaea during storage of ps its dominance was 67 0 of total archaeal sequences in the control which was dropped to 45 7 and 34 4 at ph 6 0 and 5 0 respectively the results of rna analysis and sma test further confirmed the inhibition of indigenous methanogens under acidic condition 3 compared to the control 10 6 l ch4 l ps higher amount of ch4 production 12 7 14 6 l ch4 l ps was attained from the acidified ps owing to the preservation of organic matters in the ps under acidic condition 4 the acidification of ps at ph 6 0 was found to be an optimum condition in terms of maximizing the ghg reduction 0 4 and 22 5 kg co2 eq ton ps during storage and subsequent biogas production respectively achieving further reduction of 9 6 kg co2 eq ton ps compared to the control acknowledgements this work was supported by the r d

19042,microbiological water quality is traditionally assessed using culture based enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria such as escherichia coli despite their relative ease of use these methods require a minimal 18 24 h incubation step before the results are obtained this study aimed to assess the suitability of an autonomous online fluorescence based technology measuring β glucuronidase

quantitative real time pcr qpcr using replicate measurements of grab samples containing e coli concentrations between 50 and 2330 cfu 100 ml 1 the autonomous gluc activity measurement technology displayed an average coefficient of variation cv of less than 5 that was 4 8 fold lower than other methods tested comparable precision was observed during online in situ monitoring of gluc activity at a drinking water intake using three independent instruments gluc activity measurements were not affected by sewage or sediments at concentrations likely to be encountered during long term monitoring furthermore significant p 0 05 correlations were obtained between gluc activity and the other assays including defined substrate technology r 0 77 membrane filtration r 0 73 qpcr r 0 55 and the automated microbial detection system r 0 50 this study is the first to thoroughly compare the analytical performance of rapid automated detection technologies to established culture and molecular based methods results show that further research is required to correlate gluc activity to the presence of viable e coli as measured in terms of cfu 100 ml 1 this would allow the use of autonomous online gluc activity measurements for rapid e coli monitoring in water supplies used for drinking water production and recreation graphical abstract image 1 keywords online monitoring escherichia coli β d glucuronidase enzymatic assays repeatability robustness 1 introduction autonomous devices are urgently needed for rapid near real time quantification of faecal microorganisms across the drinking water supply chain and in recreational waters noble and weisberg 2005 considered that such rapid assays should provide results within 4 h of time to enable same day decision for recreational water safety given the high cost and complexity of direct pathogen monitoring faecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli or enterococci are used to routinely monitor microbiological water quality worldwide ec 2006 usepa 2012a who 2016 faecal indicator bacteria are traditionally enumerated using culture based methods involving an 18 24 h incubation period in liquid or solid culture media this is a considerable limitation given that microbiological water quality can fluctuate over short daily or even hourly time intervals boehm 2007 ekklesia et al 2015 enns et al 2012 intermittent short term contamination peaks can occur following rainfall episodes combined sewer overflows or accidental spills madoux humery et al 2016 2013 passerat et al 2011 traister and anisfeld 2006 resulting in potential exposures to faecal pathogens to address this limitation alternative rapid and user friendly assays were developed during the past two decades molecular assays such as real time pcr qpcr that quantifies e coli dna ex chern et al 2011 frahm and obst 2003 were shown to hold promise for rapid enumeration of e coli in wastewater and surface water lavender and kinzelman 2009 noble et al 2010 nevertheless the need for standardization and specialized laboratory equipment limits the generalized implementation of qpcr for rapid microbial water quality testing enzymatic methods have also been proposed for rapid assays without cultivation step farnleitner et al 2001 fiksdal et al 1994 garcia armisen et al 2005 george et al 2000 considering the high specificity of the β d glucuronidase gluc enzyme to e coli these assays consist in direct measurement of gluc activity using the 4 methylumbelliferyl β d glucuronide mug substrate by defining the enzymatic activity as the rate of production of fluorescent methylumbelliferone muf that results from mug hydrolysis several studies conducted in freshwater and marine water showed good correlations between gluc activity and culture based enumeration of e coli farnleitner et al 2001 garcia armisen et al 2005 lebaron et al 2005 the direct enzymatic technique is based on the same enzymatic reaction as usepa approved culture based methods already in use for over 2 decades and for which epidemiological data has been gathered usepa 2012a wade et al 2003 in recent years efforts were made to automate the detection of

koschelnik et al 2015 ryzinska paier et al 2014 some of these enzyme based technologies can be organised in remote and or low resource settings either for grab sample testing wildeboer et al 2010 wu et al 2018 or for autonomous online monitoring of e coli at high temporal frequencies 1 h ender et al 2017 stadler et al 2016 although they offer promising perspectives towards near real time monitoring of faecal pollution there is a lack of information on their precision and robustness during normal operation also thorough comparison of the results from these technologies to established e coli enumeration assays is limited as any microbiological method including enzymatic assays displays inherent analytical uncertainty and can be impacted by matrix related interferences servais et al 2005 togo et al 2006 defining the application and use of autonomous measurement of gluc activity requires a thorough understanding of its technical performance in comparison to widely used standard methods the objective of the present study was to assess the suitability of an autonomous online gluc activity measurement technology for rapid online monitoring of e coli concentrations in water the analytical precision of the online technology was first determined and compared to an array of other microbiological assays including an automated microbial detection system two culture based assays membrane filtration and defined substrate technology and real time pcr qpcr using samples collected during various hydro meteorological conditions the relationships between gluc activity and e coli concentrations were then assessed finally considering the potential of the autonomous online technology to achieve long term monitoring of gluc activity in surface water its measurement performance was challenged against a variety of surface water samples to identify potential matrix related interferences implications for rapid autonomous online monitoring of microbiological water quality are discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and sample collection raw water samples were collected in autoclaved bottles from a drinking water treatment plant dwtp intake serving almost 100 000

substrate solution and buffer that are mixed to the water sample incubation temperature of the chamber is set at 44 0 1 c to maximise gluc activity and subsequent emission of fluorescence george et al 2000 sampling addition of reagents and heating phases are fully automated and the measurement of fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 and 455 nm respectively starts automatically when the incubation temperature is stable after 8 min as the fluorescence signal increases with enzymatic activity over time high resolution analysis of the emitted fluorescence is continuously performed in the flow through photometric measurement chamber patent pct at2011 000497 during the measurement phase approximately 6 min the rate of fluorescence emission is expressed in volts per second and converted into modified fishman units per 100 ml mfu 100 ml 1 following the standard sigma quality control test procedure one mfu of gluc activity from e coli generates 1 0 μg of phenolphthalein from phenolphthalein glucuronide per hour at ph 6 8 and at a temperature of 37 c sigma aldrich 1998 the device is equipped with a data correction algorithm patent pct at2014 050036 to account for the influence of sample turbidity on the fluorescence intensity upon completion of the measurement phase the sample is automatically discarded into a waste container and the measurement chamber and tubes are cleaned with a washing solution composed of cmquick clean i vwm solutions gmbh austria and 2 5 hydrochloric acid when the device collects a new sample part of it is used to flush the internal tubing system and remove any remaining washing solution the analysis phase sampling heating and measurement steps only takes 15 min and the entire cycle including the cleaning step takes about 30 min further information on the incubation time and ph adjustment as well as on calibration and quality control is provided by koschelnik et al 2015 and in the supplementary material data from laboratory and field measurements were continuously recorded by the device transmitted via a wireless modem and accessed remotely through a secured internet connection 2 2 2 automated microbial detection system the automated tecta b16 technology endetec canada is a fibre optic coupled fluorescence multi wavelength sensor that shortens the culture time of e coli through a patented technology involving a fibre optic probe and a miniature spectrometer brown et al 2013 measurement cartridges contain proprietary growth media with metabolic substrates for the specific detection of e coli and total coliforms through their glucuronidase and galactosidase activities respectively cartridges are incubated at 35 c into a benchtop instrument and in presence of e coli a hydrophobic fluorescent metabolite is released from gluc mediated breakdown of the substrate a glucuronic acid conjugate and detected by the instrument the fluorescence is continuously monitored by an optical fibre coupled to the instrument miniature spectrometer and any background turbidity and matrix effects are reduced through absorption of the fluorescent metabolite to a siloxane polymer bead integrated at the bottom of each cartridge brown et al 2013 the software converts the time at which a given fluorescence intensity is detected time to detection ttd into a concentration of bacteria cfu 100 ml 1 using a default calibration curve provided by the manufacturer and based on water samples from lake ontario the kinetics approach has the advantage to use a wider dynamic range six orders of magnitude than conventional most probable number or membrane filtration methods without need for sample dilution the manufacturer recommends performing a custom calibration if overall tecta counts are consistently lower or higher than those provided by an alternate quantitative method ex membrane filtration the semi log linear relationship between ttd obtained by the tecta and the log10 of e coli enumeration data from the alternate method can thus be used to convert subsequent tecta measurements into e coli concentrations the instrument can be connected to internet and configured to send an email at the start of a test upon detection of e coli and at the end of a test all samples were analysed without dilution by following the instructions from the manufacturer water samples 100 ml were poured into a tecta cartridge which was gently mixed to completely dissolve the substrate and inserted into the instrument for incubation at 35 c for 24 h the optics of the wells were preliminarily checked using the dedicated validation cartridge ttd as well as e coli and total coliform concentrations cfu 100 ml 1 were automatically generated by the instrument 2 2 3 enumeration of e coli by culture 2 2 3 1 membrane filtration usepa method 1604 the membrane filtration method using mi agar was performed according to usepa method 1604 usepa 2002 one hundred millilitres 100 ml of raw or diluted sample were filtered through a sterile 47 mm 0 45 μm pore size cellulose ester membrane filter millipore and placed on a 5 ml plate of mi agar bd biosciences containing 5 μg ml cefsulodine sigma aldrich plates were incubated at 35 c for up to 24 h identified e coli colonies were counted and concentrations expressed in colony forming units cfu per 100 ml cfu 100 ml 1 2 2 3 2 defined substrate technology for the defined substrate technology colilert quanti tray 2000 idexx all samples were processed with or without dilution by following the manufacturer instructions colilert reagents were mixed with the samples and poured into quanti trays which were heat sealed and incubated at 35 0 5 c for 24 h after the incubation period positive wells yellow for total coliforms yellow and fluorescent for e coli were counted and transformed into mpn 100 ml 1 using the idexx mpn conversion table 2 2 4 enumeration of e coli by real time pcr samples 100 300 ml were filtered through a sterile 47 mm 0 45 μm pore size cellulose ester membrane filter millipore and stored into a sterile microcentrifuge tube at 20 c until further processing dna extraction was performed using the fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals filter samples were homogenized with lysis matrix a on a fastprep instrument at a speed of 6 0 m s 1 for 40 s during 2 successive cycles and were cooled down on ice for 5 min between cycles to avoid overheating lysates were centrifuged and dna was purified on spin filter columns according to the instructions of the manufacturer before storage at 20 c real time pcr was performed according to chern et al 2011 final concentrations of primers and taqman probe were optimal at 300 nmol l 1 and 100 nmol l 1 respectively samples for qpcr were prepared in 25 μl reactions containing 5 μl of dna template 12 5 μl taqman universal mastermix ii thermo fisher scientific 0 75 μl of each primer 0 25 μl of probe and dnase free water pcr was run on a rotorgene 6000 instrument qiagen under the following thermocycling conditions 10 min hold at 95 c followed by 45 cycles including annealing at 95 c for 15 s and hybridization elongation at 60 c for 1 min quality control was ensured through extraction blanks and no template controls ntc duplicate pcr reactions were performed for each sample fig s2 standard curves were constructed using genomic dna from a pure culture of e coli 107 cfu ml 1 as described earlier burnet et al 2017 genomic dna was then serially log diluted in dnase free water to reduce the uncertainty associated with the estimation of e coli concentrations from unknown samples the pooled standard calibration curve approach sivaganesan et al 2010 was adopted following this approach dna standard measurements from all runs were pooled while simultaneously generating a calibration curve for each single pcr run fig s1 the generated calibration curve equation was then used to convert ct cycle threshold from unknown samples into cfu equivalents per pcr reaction cfueq r 1 details about pcr inhibition assessment and removal can be found in the supplementary material 2 3 precision of autonomous gluc activity measurements in comparison to the other assays evaluation of the precision i e the closeness of agreement between independent test results astm 2014 of the assays was performed both in laboratory and in in situ conditions for the laboratory experiment 5 l samples were collected at the dwtp intake on four occasions and analysed by the autonomous gluc activity measurement technology the automated microbial detection system as well as by culture and qpcr for each method the measurements were replicated 6 times consecutively giving special care to thoroughly mixing the sample before each new analysis between analyses samples were kept refrigerated and negative controls were performed for each analytical method the coefficient of variation cv expressed in percentages was calculated for each method as an indication of their precision using the average and standard deviation obtained from the respective 6 replicate measurements for the assessment of precision under field conditions three 3 autonomous gluc activity measurement devices were installed in parallel on two occasions january and may 2017 at the dwtp intake to perform online gluc activity monitoring during 48 96 h at hourly frequency in addition 1 l samples were collected synchronously using an isco6712 auto sampler and stored on site at 4 c a subset was selected for triplicate analysis within 24 h using the automated microbial detection device mf dst and qpcr 2 4 robustness of autonomous gluc activity measurements to determine whether matrix related interferences could impact online gluc activity measurements in our field settings the technology was challenged with raw water samples spiked separately with raw sewage treated wastewater effluent or river sediments the volume of these matrices constituted 10 1 and 0 1 of the final sample volume to be analysed river water spiking matrix ratios of 90 10 99 1 and 99 9 0 1 respectively to mimic a range of faecal pollution inputs to the urban river via combined sewer overflows treated wastewater discharges or sediment resuspension raw sewage was first passed on a sieve to remove large debris before mixing with river water sediments were shaken vigorously before a subsample was added to river water to obtain an initial turbidity of 500 ntu this suspension was then diluted again in river water to obtain the desired above mentioned mixture ratios final mixtures generated turbidity values between 21 and 70 ntu which lies in the medium to upper range of values typically observed at the dwtp intake gluc activity was first characterized in river water and in the respective spiking matrices raw sewage treated wastewater or sediments to compare the expected gluc activity to the measured one for all mixtures in addition to gluc activity culturable e coli measured by dst and turbidity were also characterized in river water spiking matrices and final mixtures 2 5 statistical analyses least squares linear regression was performed to analyse the relationships between gluc activity and e coli enumerated by the automatic microbial detection system mf dst or qpcr one factor analysis of variance was used to test for significant differences between expected and observed gluc activities in river water mixtures containing various amounts of raw sewage treated wastewater or river sediments significance was assessed at an alpha level of 0 05 all analyses were run in statistica v 12 statsoft inc 3 results and discussion 3 1 precision of autonomous gluc activity measurements and e coli enumeration the analytical precision of autonomous online gluc activity measurement and e coli enumeration assays was assessed in samples ranging from 4 6 to 30 0 mmfu 100 ml 1 and from 50 to 2000 cfu 100 ml 1 respectively these values fall within the range typically measured at the drinking water treatment plant dwtp intake as shown in table 2 the lowest coefficients of variation cv were calculated for autonomous gluc activity measurements although we did not perform a side by side comparison between autonomous and manual measurements of gluc activity results from the literature indicate that the cv for the manual assay lies around 10 and can increase to 50 for enzymatic activities approaching detection limits lebaron et al 2005 servais et al 2005 the precision of autonomous gluc activity measurements was also on average 5 to 8 times higher than for culture and molecular based enumeration of e coli table 2 in a comparative study servais et al 2005 similarly reported cvs between 8 and 15 for the manual gluc activity assay compared to 31 105 and 23 28 for a miniaturized most probable number mpn method and membrane filtration respectively coefficients of variation for mpn methods such as the defined substrate technology dst used in this study can typically exceed 30 as a direct consequence of the probability distribution for the mpn gronewold and wolpert 2008 prats et al 2008 real time pcr also displayed high cv values particularly for e coli concentrations 400 cfu 100 ml 1 variability in e coli dna quantification can result from alteration of pcr sensitivity due to inhibitors affecting target dna recovery and or amplification schrader et al 2012 also dna extraction and purification involve multiple analytical steps which increases the likelihood for imprecision noble et al 2010 observed higher average cvs for qpcr based enumeration of e coli between 25 and 67 when comparing it to dst between 19 and 25 despite apparent absence of pcr inhibition the higher relative error in qpcr results compared to culture was also reported for enterococcus enumeration whitman et al 2010 following laboratory assessment of autonomous gluc activity measurement precision the latter was verified under in situ conditions using three independent instruments performing parallel online gluc activity monitoring at the dwtp intake in the absence of rainfall january 2017 the cv calculated from three independent gluc activity measurements ranged from 1 to 8 average 3 5 following a 37 2 mm cumulative rainfall episode may 2017 it varied from 0 1 to 16 0 average 3 6 fig 1 a b overall gluc activity measurements were highly correlated between the three instruments fig 1c and reliably depicted the temporal dynamics of gluc activity at the intake fig 2 stadler et al 2016 drew similar conclusions for a sediment laden stream in an agricultural catchment we further showed that direct comparison of analytical precision with the other methods resulted in lowest average cvs for mf 12 followed by dst 18 qpcr 24 and the automated microbial detection system 30 despite these variabilities similar temporal fluctuation patterns were observed for gluc activity and e coli fig 2 gluc activity peaked consecutively three times with maximum values of 13 5 16 1 and 16 9 mmfu 100 ml 1 and aligned with similar peaks in culturable and total e coli as illustrated by culture and qpcr respectively it is important to note that the high precision of gluc activity measurements even in the lower range of e coli concentrations 1000 cfu 100 ml 1 does not necessarily imply that gluc activity accurately accounted for e coli concentrations within that range fig 3 since both methods target different e coli populations gluc activity can also account for the occurrence of viable but non culturable e coli cells in water which likely explains the discrepancy between both methods in this concentration range 3 2 robustness of autonomous gluc activity measurement online sensors can be affected by matrix related interferences zamyadi et al 2012 and generate biased data that can ultimately influence decision making we therefore evaluated the robustness of online gluc activity measurements by challenging them with water matrices likely to be encountered during long term online monitoring and susceptible to cause interferences during enzymatic measurements based on the comparison between expected and measured gluc activity in matrix spikes raw sewage did not affect p 0 05 automatic gluc activity measurements even when it contributed to 10 of the water matrix table 3 for treated effluents gluc activity was slightly underestimated in presence of 10 effluents 90 10 mixture and accurately estimated in the mixtures containing lower proportions of treated effluent 1 and 0 1 in 99 1 and 99 9 0 1 mixtures respectively similarly observed e coli concentrations in the 90 10 mixture were lower than expected table s2 suggesting an error introduced during mixture preparation rather than a true matrix effect on gluc activity and e coli measurements although the river feeding the dwtp is impacted by multiple treated wastewater effluents and combined sewer overflow cso discharge points yarahmadi et al 2018 the highest gluc activities did not exceed 55 mmfu 100 ml 1 at the intake over a 1 5 year monitoring period which is over 5 times lower than the enzymatic activity measured in the 90 10 mixture with treated wastewater we can therefore assume that treated wastewater effluents are unlikely to affect gluc activity measurements in our settings the addition of sediments to the river water did not influence gluc activity measurements table 3 even for a turbidity of 70 ntu 90 10 mixture the online gluc activity measurement device is equipped with a patented technology that compensates for possible fluorescence losses in turbid samples koschelnik et al 2015 such correction likely occurred in the 90 10 mixtures with raw sewage or sediments where river water turbidity was raised 2 and 3 fold respectively overall the results from matrix spikes demonstrated the robustness of autonomous gluc activity measurements for testing conditions simulating the discharge of raw sewage treated wastewater or the resuspension of river sediments although we did not address potential interferences by algae and humic substances on the robustness of gluc activity measurement fiksdal and tryland 2008 it would be worth testing these compounds too 3 3 relationship between analytical methods relationships of variable patterns and strengths were reported among culture based methods such as mf and dst hallas et al 2008 hamilton et al 2005 olstadt et al 2007 zimmerman et al 2009 vergine et al 2017 or between culture and qpcr ahmed et al 2012 noble et al 2010 raith et al 2013 truchado et al 2016 here we assessed the relationships between the autonomous gluc activity measurement culture including an automatic microbial detection system and qpcr 3 3 1 relationship between culture and qpcr based methods culture based mf and dst assays displayed the strongest correlation r 0 94 and both methods were also positively correlated with the automated microbial detection system r 0 91 and 0 92 respectively table 4 bramburger et al 2015 reported a strong agreement between the automated detection system and mf in the saint lawrence river canada while schang et al 2016 found a weaker yet significant relationship between that system and dst in the yarra river australia although inter correlated we found that the three methods differed in their relative quantification of e coli for instance higher e coli concentrations were obtained with dst compared to mf slope of 1 2 which could result from a better recovery of stressed e coli using the former assay hallas et al 2008 vergine et al 2017 in contrast the automated detection system consistently provided lower e coli concentrations compared to mf and dst this likely originated from the instrument default calibration used for the conversion of time to detection ttd into cfu 100 ml 1 and done by the manufacturer with samples from lake ontario canada we performed a custom calibration of the instrument as recommended but could only use a limited set of local water samples for this purpose this did not sufficiently correct the e coli enumeration bias between the automated detection system and both mf and dst using a dataset that spans over a larger dynamic range of e coli concentrations should remove this bias because of its rapidity compared to culture based methods real time quantitative pcr qpcr has been proposed as an alternative to achieve same day results for more efficient decision making although no current standardized qpcr exists for e coli such assay has been developed for enterococcus for beach water quality monitoring usepa 2012b our results using a published taqman assay targeting the 23s rrna gene of e coli chern et al 2011 were marginally correlated with culture based assays table 4 in a previous study targeting the same gene but using different primer sets a moderate relationship r 0 47 was found using log10 transformed data ahmed et al 2012 noble et al 2010 described a strong relationship between culture and qpcr in seawater samples most of which were not affected by pcr inhibition our river samples were inhibited at various degrees as reported by the internal amplification control although pcr inhibition was eventually removed table s1 inhibitory compounds carried over during dna extraction could have caused suboptimal dna recovery schrader et al 2012 thereby affecting the sensitivity and precision of the assay particularly for high e coli concentrations table 2 the qpcr measured e coli concentrations were in average 1 2 log10 higher than those determined by the automated microbial detection system mf and dst differences of about one order of magnitude have been reported between qpcr and culture based enumeration of e coli and enterococcus ahmed et al 2012 noble et al 2010 raith et al 2013 truchado et al 2016 whitman et al 2010 culture and qpcr quantify fundamentally different targets and the latter detects not only dna from culturable but also from viable but not culturable vbnc or even dying and dead cells the comparatively higher e coli concentrations estimated by qpcr are thus likely caused by the occurrence of a high proportion of non culturable cells that partly originated from uv disinfected wastewater discharges upstream the drinking water intake the autonomous gluc activity measurement technology similarly detects enzymatic activity from non culturable e coli cells interestingly it was the only assay significantly correlated to qpcr table 4 underscoring the fact that gluc activity and dna measurements generate more conservative estimates of e coli than culture 3 3 2 relationship between autonomous gluc activity measurements and e coli enumeration we found linear relationships between the autonomous gluc activity measurements and e coli enumeration by four different assays automated microbial detection system mf dst and qpcr table 4 the strongest relationships between online gluc activity and culturable e coli were observed for dst r 0 77 and mf r 0 73 the relationships between autonomous gluc activity measurements and e coli concentrations provided by the automated microbial detection system and qpcr were weaker this likely resulted from the higher measurement uncertainty of both assays table 2 but also from a smaller dataset available for method comparison earlier studies comparing the manual gluc activity assay to culture reported good correlations r 0 85 for log10 transformed data spanning over large dynamic ranges 1 8 log10 farnleitner et al 2001 garcia armisen et al 2005 lebaron et al 2005 the relationships between the autonomous gluc activity measurement technology and dst were stronger than those reported by two recent studies comparing the same technology to dst in agricultural and mixed catchments ender et al 2017 stadler et al 2016 agricultural catchments are characterized by complex pollution patterns with a continuum of recent to old faecal inputs that may impact the relationship between gluc and e coli ryzinska paier et al 2014 in contrast the urban river investigated in this study is highly impacted by human sewage via treated wastewater and cso discharges which represent recent contamination inputs and are more likely to contain high proportions of culturable e coli nevertheless a subset of samples from routine monitoring of the drinking water intake deviated from the linear relationship between gluc activity and mf especially for e coli concentrations 1000 cfu 100 ml 1 fig 3 garcia armisen et al 2005 demonstrated that the fraction of non culturable e coli cells represent a higher portion of the total e coli population in low contaminated samples compared to samples highly contaminated by e coli the former usually stem from older faecal inputs where e coli switched from a culturable to a non culturable stage following prolonged exposure to nutrient scarcity and or uv irradiation servais et al 2009 the above mentioned discrepancies were measured during and following snowmelt runoff events for samples possibly containing older faecal deposits and high amounts of non culturable e coli or interfering compounds in turn resulting in high gluc activities 3 4 implications for the use of autonomous gluc activity measurements as surrogate of e coli for rapid online water quality monitoring considering the urgent need for rapid testing of microbial water quality autonomous near real time measurement of gluc activity can represent an attractive early warning tool for e coli monitoring our results demonstrate the precision table 2 fig 2 and robustness table 3 of autonomous online gluc activity measurements for a range of e coli concentrations and significant correlations with culturable and total e coli are reported table 4 these correlations appear to be weaker for e coli concentrations 1000 cfu 100 ml 1 likely due to a larger proportion of non culturable cells in samples within this concentration range garcia armisen et al 2005 the relationships between gluc activity and e coli as described in the previous section certainly merit careful attention given that culture based enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria fib prevail in most regulatory based monitoring frameworks however because the goal of fib is to reliably account for faecal pollution and point out an increased likelihood of pathogen occurrence it is of even higher importance to determine whether gluc activity is an equivalent or better predictor of an exposure to microbial hazards future work should therefore focus on the link between gluc activity and pathogen occurrence in water and investigate the epidemiological value of autonomous near real time monitoring of gluc activity while qpcr quantifies dna from culturable and non culturable cells direct measurement of gluc enzyme likewise targets a continuum of metabolically active e coli cells garcia armisen et al 2005 it remains to be tested whether gluc activity better correlates with the occurrence of waterborne pathogens known to persist longer than culturable e coli in water harwood et al 2005 jenkins et al 2011 such future work will be paramount for validating the usefulness of autonomous gluc activity measurement and other rapid online monitoring technologies as early warning tools towards more efficient protection of public health the long sample to result time of traditional culture based assays limits their usefulness in identification of intermittent hazardous events the automated microbial detection system significantly reduces the incubation time for the range of e coli concentrations measured in our study 1 3 5 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 a maximum of 11 5 h and a minimum of 8 5 h respectively were needed to deliver quantitative results without need of sample dilution furthermore it does not require trained technicians and laboratory facilities table 5 eventually though further improvements of the automated microbial detection system should aim at reducing the analysis time down to 4 h typically to enable same day decision making among the methods tested in this study the autonomous gluc activity measurement technology and qpcr are the most rapid the autonomous enzymatic technology can represent an alternative user friendly approach and generate high resolution data on the temporal dynamics of gluc activity as surrogate of culturable and non culturable e coli in water the comparatively high equipment cost of the autonomous gluc activity measurement technology may be offset in the long term by reductions in operation costs as it does not require trained technicians and lab facilities to process samples perform analyses and handle waste table 5 online near real time monitoring of e coli and other microbiological parameters will represent a huge leap forward for safe drinking and recreational water usage and it will ultimately lead to a paradigm shift in compliance monitoring and water resources management given the comparatively high equipment cost and absence of regulatory requirements though the use of autonomous online technologies is currently limited essentially to research oriented studies and proactive monitoring by a limited number of water utilities ultimately it is expected that rapid online monitoring will provide datasets of considerable importance for water resources management as well as risk assessment and modelling 4 conclusion the suitability of autonomous gluc activity measurement for rapid online monitoring of e coli in water was assessed the correlation of this parameter with the presence of culturable e coli as measured with different techniques was also evaluated laboratory and in situ assessment of method precision revealed that the autonomous gluc activity measurement technology demonstrated high analytical precision with average coefficients of variation below 5 compared to mf 16 dst 21 an automated microbial detection system 31 and qpcr 31 autonomous gluc activity measurements were not affected by raw sewage treated wastewater or river sediments attesting for high assay robustness although significant correlations between gluc activity measurements and e coli enumeration were observed further work is required to link enzymatic activity with the occurrence of pathogens this is especially warranted for e coli concentrations 1000 cfu 100 ml 1 for which the correlation with gluc activity was weaker collectively reported results illustrate that the promising potential of autonomous gluc activity measurement for online near real time monitoring of e coli in surface water should be confirmed by further investigating the relationships between gluc activity and the presence of viable e coli cells despite cost effectiveness of traditional culture based assays fully or semi automated field deployable instruments such as those tested in this study do not depend on state of art laboratory equipment nor do they require trained technicians to be operated which would facilitate the collection of larger data sets ongoing work is examining the value of online gluc activity monitoring for detection of peak pathogen concentrations in drinking

19042,microbiological water quality is traditionally assessed using culture based enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria such as escherichia coli despite their relative ease of use these methods require a minimal 18 24 h incubation step before the results are obtained this study aimed to assess the suitability of an autonomous online fluorescence based technology measuring β glucuronidase gluc activity for rapid near real time monitoring of e coli in water the analytical precision was determined and compared to an automated microbial detection system two culture based assays and quantitative real time pcr qpcr using replicate measurements of grab samples containing e coli concentrations between 50 and 2330 cfu 100 ml 1 the autonomous gluc activity measurement technology displayed an average coefficient of variation cv of less than 5 that was 4 8 fold lower than other methods tested comparable precision was observed during online in situ monitoring of gluc activity at a drinking water intake using three independent instruments gluc activity measurements were not affected by sewage or sediments at concentrations likely to be encountered during long term monitoring furthermore significant p 0 05 correlations were obtained between gluc activity and the other assays including defined substrate technology r 0 77 membrane filtration r 0 73 qpcr r 0 55 and the automated microbial detection system r 0 50 this study is the first to thoroughly compare the analytical performance of rapid automated detection technologies to established culture and molecular based methods results show that further research is required to correlate gluc activity to the presence of viable e coli as measured in terms of cfu 100 ml 1 this would allow the use of autonomous online gluc activity measurements for rapid e coli monitoring in water supplies used for drinking water production and recreation graphical abstract image 1 keywords online monitoring escherichia coli β d glucuronidase enzymatic assays repeatability robustness 1 introduction autonomous devices are urgently needed for rapid near real time quantification of faecal microorganisms across the drinking water supply chain and in recreational waters noble and weisberg 2005 considered that such rapid assays should provide results within 4 h of time to enable same day decision for recreational water safety given the high cost and complexity of direct pathogen monitoring faecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli or enterococci are used to routinely monitor microbiological water quality worldwide ec 2006 usepa 2012a who 2016 faecal indicator bacteria are traditionally enumerated using culture based methods involving an 18 24 h incubation period in liquid or solid culture media this is a considerable limitation given that microbiological water quality can fluctuate over short daily or even hourly time intervals boehm 2007 ekklesia et al 2015 enns et al 2012 intermittent short term contamination peaks can occur following rainfall episodes combined sewer overflows or accidental spills madoux humery et al 2016 2013 passerat et al 2011 traister and anisfeld 2006 resulting in potential exposures to faecal pathogens to address this limitation alternative rapid and user friendly assays were developed during the past two decades molecular assays such as real time pcr qpcr that quantifies e coli dna ex chern et al 2011 frahm and obst 2003 were shown to hold promise for rapid enumeration of e coli in wastewater and surface water lavender and kinzelman 2009 noble et al 2010 nevertheless the need for standardization and specialized laboratory equipment limits the generalized implementation of qpcr for rapid microbial water quality testing enzymatic methods have also been proposed for rapid assays without cultivation step farnleitner et al 2001 fiksdal et al 1994 garcia armisen et al 2005 george et al 2000 considering the high specificity of the β d glucuronidase gluc enzyme to e coli these assays consist in direct measurement of gluc activity using the 4 methylumbelliferyl β d glucuronide mug substrate by defining the enzymatic activity as the rate of production of fluorescent methylumbelliferone muf that results from mug hydrolysis several studies conducted in freshwater and marine water showed good correlations between gluc activity and culture based enumeration of e coli farnleitner et al 2001 garcia armisen et al 2005 lebaron et al 2005 the direct enzymatic technique is based on the same enzymatic reaction as usepa approved culture based methods already in use for over 2 decades and for which epidemiological data has been gathered usepa 2012a wade et al 2003 in recent years efforts were made to automate the detection of the fluorescence generated by the enzymatic reaction in combination with a culture step angelescu et al 2018 briciu burghina et al 2015 brown et al 2013 heery et al 2016 tryland et al 2015 or not koschelnik et al 2015 ryzinska paier et al 2014 some of these enzyme based technologies can be organised in remote and or low resource settings either for grab sample testing wildeboer et al 2010 wu et al 2018 or for autonomous online monitoring of e coli at high temporal frequencies 1 h ender et al 2017 stadler et al 2016 although they offer promising perspectives towards near real time monitoring of faecal pollution there is a lack of information on their precision and robustness during normal operation also thorough comparison of the results from these technologies to established e coli enumeration assays is limited as any microbiological method including enzymatic assays displays inherent analytical uncertainty and can be impacted by matrix related interferences servais et al 2005 togo et al 2006 defining the application and use of autonomous measurement of gluc activity requires a thorough understanding of its technical performance in comparison to widely used standard methods the objective of the present study was to assess the suitability of an autonomous online gluc activity measurement technology for rapid online monitoring of e coli concentrations in water the analytical precision of the online technology was first determined and compared to an array of other microbiological assays including an automated microbial detection system two culture based assays membrane filtration and defined substrate technology and real time pcr qpcr using samples collected during various hydro meteorological conditions the relationships between gluc activity and e coli concentrations were then assessed finally considering the potential of the autonomous online technology to achieve long term monitoring of gluc activity in surface water its measurement performance was challenged against a variety of surface water samples to identify potential matrix related interferences implications for rapid autonomous online monitoring of microbiological water quality are discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and sample collection raw water samples were collected in autoclaved bottles from a drinking water treatment plant dwtp intake serving almost 100 000

meteorological conditions samples were refrigerated until further processing in the laboratory within 24 h after collection during the same period intensive event sampling was performed on three occasions following snowmelt and or rainfall episodes using an isco6712 auto sampler teledyne isco lincoln ne usa additional samples were collected routinely monday to thursday and during event sampling at the intake by the dwtp staff from january 2017 to april 2018 and they were used for comparisons between online gluc activity measurements and a membrane filtration method see section 2 for method description to evaluate the measurement performance of the autonomous online technology under various controlled turbidity conditions untreated sewage as well as treated effluent samples were collected from a nearby water resources recovery facility wrrf discharging treated effluents from 40 000 people the treatment includes degritting settling biofiltration and uv disinfection river sediments were sampled with a sediment collector as previously described yarahmadi et al 2018 and immediately brought back to the laboratory for further processing wrrf and sediment samples were refrigerated at 4 c until used in matrix spikes within 6 h of collection 2 2 microbiological analyses 2 2 1 autonomous online measurement of gluc activity the autonomous coliminder vwm solutions gmbh austria technology table 1 measures the β d glucuronidase gluc activity based on the optical detection of highly fluorescent 4 methylumbelliferone muf the latter is formed upon breakdown of 4 methlyumbelliferyl β d glucuronide mug that is catalysed by the gluc enzyme for each 6 5 ml sample pumped into the measurement chamber the instrument injects pre defined volumes of fluorogenic substrate solution and buffer that are mixed to the water sample incubation temperature of the chamber is set at 44 0 1 c to maximise gluc activity and subsequent emission of fluorescence george et al 2000 sampling addition of reagents and heating phases are fully automated and the measurement of fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 and 455 nm respectively starts automatically when the incubation temperature is stable after 8 min as the fluorescence signal increases with enzymatic activity over time high resolution analysis of the emitted fluorescence is continuously performed in the flow through photometric measurement chamber patent pct at2011 000497 during the measurement phase approximately 6 min the rate of fluorescence emission is expressed in volts per second and converted into modified fishman units per 100 ml mfu 100 ml 1 following the standard sigma quality control test procedure one mfu of gluc activity from e coli generates 1 0 μg of phenolphthalein from phenolphthalein glucuronide per hour at ph 6 8 and at a temperature of 37 c sigma aldrich 1998 the device is equipped with a data correction algorithm patent pct at2014 050036 to account for the influence of sample turbidity on the fluorescence intensity upon completion of the measurement phase the sample is automatically discarded into a waste container and the measurement chamber and tubes are cleaned with a washing solution composed of cmquick clean i vwm solutions gmbh austria and 2 5 hydrochloric acid when the device collects a new sample part of it is used to flush the internal tubing system and remove any remaining washing solution the analysis phase sampling heating and measurement steps only takes 15 min and the entire cycle including the cleaning step takes about 30 min further information on the incubation time and ph adjustment as well as on calibration and quality control is provided by koschelnik et al 2015 and in the supplementary material data from laboratory and field measurements were continuously recorded by the device transmitted via a wireless modem and accessed remotely through a secured internet connection 2 2 2 automated microbial detection system the automated tecta b16 technology endetec canada is a fibre optic coupled fluorescence multi wavelength sensor that shortens the culture time of e coli through a patented technology involving a fibre optic probe and a miniature spectrometer brown et al 2013 measurement cartridges contain proprietary growth media with metabolic substrates for the specific detection of e coli and total coliforms through their glucuronidase and galactosidase activities respectively cartridges are incubated at 35 c into a benchtop instrument and in presence of e coli a hydrophobic fluorescent metabolite is released from gluc mediated breakdown of the substrate a glucuronic acid conjugate and detected by the instrument the fluorescence is continuously monitored by an optical fibre coupled to the instrument miniature spectrometer and any background turbidity and matrix effects are reduced through absorption of the fluorescent metabolite to a siloxane polymer bead integrated at the bottom of each cartridge brown et al 2013 the software converts the time at which a given fluorescence intensity is detected time to detection ttd into a concentration of bacteria cfu 100 ml 1 using a default calibration curve provided by the manufacturer and based on water samples from lake ontario the kinetics approach has the advantage to use a wider dynamic range six orders of magnitude than conventional most probable number or membrane filtration methods without need for sample dilution the manufacturer recommends performing a custom calibration if overall tecta counts are consistently lower or higher than those provided by an alternate quantitative method ex membrane filtration the semi log linear relationship between ttd obtained by the tecta and the log10 of e coli enumeration data from the alternate method can thus be used to convert subsequent tecta measurements into e coli concentrations the instrument can be connected to internet and configured to send an email at the start of a test upon detection of e coli and at the end of a test all samples were analysed without dilution by following the instructions from the manufacturer water samples 100 ml were poured into a tecta cartridge which was gently mixed to completely dissolve the substrate and inserted into the instrument for incubation at 35 c for 24 h the optics of the wells were preliminarily checked using the dedicated validation cartridge ttd as well as e coli and total coliform concentrations cfu 100 ml 1 were automatically generated by the instrument 2 2 3 enumeration of e coli by culture 2 2 3 1 membrane filtration usepa method 1604 the membrane filtration method using mi agar was performed according to usepa method 1604 usepa 2002 one hundred millilitres 100 ml of raw or diluted sample were filtered through a sterile 47 mm 0 45 μm pore size cellulose ester membrane filter millipore and placed on a 5 ml plate of mi agar bd biosciences containing 5 μg ml cefsulodine sigma aldrich plates were incubated at 35 c for up to 24 h identified e coli colonies were counted and concentrations expressed in colony forming units cfu per 100 ml cfu 100 ml 1 2 2 3 2 defined substrate technology for the defined substrate technology colilert quanti tray 2000 idexx all samples were processed with or without dilution by following the manufacturer instructions colilert reagents were mixed with the samples and poured into quanti trays which were heat sealed and incubated at 35 0 5 c for 24 h after the incubation period positive wells yellow for total coliforms yellow and fluorescent for e coli were counted and transformed into mpn 100 ml 1 using the idexx mpn conversion table 2 2 4 enumeration of e coli by real time pcr samples 100 300 ml were filtered through a sterile 47 mm 0 45 μm pore size cellulose ester membrane filter millipore and stored into a sterile microcentrifuge tube at 20 c until further processing dna extraction was performed using the fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals filter samples were homogenized with lysis matrix a on a fastprep instrument at a speed of 6 0 m s 1 for 40 s during 2 successive cycles and were cooled down on ice for 5 min between cycles to avoid overheating lysates were centrifuged and dna was purified on spin filter columns according to the instructions of the manufacturer before storage at 20 c real time pcr was performed according to chern et al 2011 final concentrations of primers and taqman probe were optimal at 300 nmol l 1 and 100 nmol l 1 respectively samples for qpcr were prepared in 25 μl reactions containing 5 μl of dna template 12 5 μl taqman universal mastermix ii thermo fisher scientific 0 75 μl of each primer 0 25 μl of probe and dnase free water pcr was run on a rotorgene 6000 instrument qiagen under the following thermocycling conditions 10 min hold at 95 c followed by 45 cycles including annealing at 95 c for 15 s and hybridization elongation at 60 c for 1 min quality control was ensured through extraction blanks and no template controls ntc duplicate pcr reactions were performed for each sample fig s2 standard curves were constructed using genomic dna from a pure culture of e coli 107 cfu ml 1 as described earlier burnet et al 2017 genomic dna was then serially log diluted in dnase free water to reduce the uncertainty associated with the estimation of e coli concentrations from unknown samples the pooled standard calibration curve approach sivaganesan et al 2010 was adopted following this approach dna standard measurements from all runs were pooled while simultaneously generating a calibration curve for each single pcr run fig s1 the generated calibration curve equation was then used to convert ct cycle threshold from unknown samples into cfu equivalents per pcr reaction cfueq r 1 details about pcr inhibition assessment and removal can be found in the supplementary material 2 3 precision of autonomous gluc activity measurements in comparison to the other assays evaluation of the precision i e the closeness of agreement between independent test results astm 2014 of the assays was performed both in laboratory and in in situ conditions for the laboratory experiment 5 l samples were collected at the dwtp intake on four occasions and analysed by the autonomous gluc activity measurement technology the automated microbial detection system as well as by culture and qpcr for each method the measurements were replicated 6 times consecutively giving special care to thoroughly mixing the sample before each new analysis between analyses samples were kept refrigerated and negative controls were performed for each analytical method the coefficient of variation cv expressed in percentages was calculated for each method as an indication of their precision using the average and standard deviation obtained from the respective 6 replicate measurements for the assessment of precision under field conditions three 3 autonomous gluc activity measurement devices were installed in parallel on two occasions january and may 2017 at the dwtp intake to perform online gluc activity monitoring during 48 96 h at hourly frequency in addition 1 l samples were collected synchronously using an isco6712 auto sampler and stored on site at 4 c a subset was selected for triplicate analysis within 24 h using the automated microbial detection device mf dst and qpcr 2 4 robustness of autonomous gluc activity measurements to determine whether matrix related interferences could impact online gluc activity measurements in our field settings the technology was challenged with raw water samples spiked separately with raw sewage treated wastewater effluent or river sediments the volume of these matrices constituted 10 1 and 0 1 of the final sample volume to be analysed river water spiking matrix ratios of 90 10 99 1 and 99 9 0 1 respectively to mimic a range of faecal pollution inputs to the urban river via combined sewer overflows treated wastewater discharges or sediment resuspension raw sewage was first passed on a sieve to remove large debris before mixing with river water sediments were shaken vigorously before a subsample was added to river water to obtain an initial turbidity of 500 ntu this suspension was then diluted again in river water to obtain the desired above mentioned mixture ratios final mixtures generated turbidity values between 21 and 70 ntu which lies in the medium to upper range of values typically observed at the dwtp intake gluc activity was first characterized in river water and in the respective spiking matrices raw sewage treated wastewater or sediments to compare the expected gluc activity to the measured one for all mixtures in addition to gluc activity culturable e coli measured by dst and turbidity were also characterized in river water spiking matrices and final mixtures 2 5 statistical analyses least squares linear regression was performed to analyse the relationships between gluc activity and e coli enumerated by the automatic microbial detection system mf dst or qpcr one factor analysis of variance was used to test for significant differences between expected and observed gluc activities in river water mixtures containing various amounts of raw sewage treated wastewater or river sediments significance was assessed at an alpha level of 0 05 all analyses were run in statistica v 12 statsoft inc 3 results and discussion 3 1 precision of autonomous gluc activity measurements and e coli enumeration the analytical precision of autonomous online gluc activity measurement and e coli enumeration assays was assessed in samples ranging from 4 6 to 30 0 mmfu 100 ml 1 and from 50 to 2000 cfu 100 ml 1 respectively these values fall within the range typically measured at the drinking water treatment plant dwtp intake as shown in table 2 the lowest coefficients of variation cv were calculated for autonomous gluc activity measurements although we did not perform a side by side comparison between autonomous and manual measurements of gluc activity results from the literature indicate that the cv for the manual assay lies around 10 and can increase to 50 for enzymatic activities approaching detection limits lebaron et al 2005 servais et al 2005 the precision of autonomous gluc activity measurements was also on average 5 to 8 times higher than for culture and molecular based enumeration of e coli table 2 in a comparative study servais et al 2005 similarly reported cvs between 8 and 15 for the manual gluc activity assay compared to 31 105 and 23 28 for a miniaturized most probable number mpn method and membrane filtration respectively coefficients of variation for mpn methods such as the defined substrate technology dst used in this study can typically exceed 30 as a direct consequence of the probability distribution for the mpn gronewold and wolpert 2008 prats et al 2008 real time pcr also displayed high cv values particularly for e coli concentrations 400 cfu 100 ml 1 variability in e coli dna quantification can result from alteration of pcr sensitivity due to inhibitors affecting target dna recovery and or amplification schrader et al 2012 also dna extraction and purification involve multiple analytical steps which increases the likelihood for imprecision noble et al 2010 observed higher average cvs for qpcr based enumeration of e coli between 25 and 67 when comparing it to dst between 19 and 25 despite apparent absence of pcr inhibition the higher relative error in qpcr results compared to culture was also reported for enterococcus enumeration whitman et al 2010 following laboratory assessment of autonomous gluc activity measurement precision the latter was verified under in situ conditions using three independent instruments performing parallel online gluc activity monitoring at the dwtp intake in the absence of rainfall january 2017 the cv calculated from three independent gluc activity measurements ranged from 1 to 8 average 3 5 following a 37 2 mm cumulative rainfall episode may 2017 it varied from 0 1 to 16 0 average 3 6 fig 1 a b overall gluc activity measurements were highly correlated between the three instruments fig 1c and reliably depicted the temporal dynamics of gluc activity at the intake fig 2 stadler et al 2016 drew similar conclusions for a sediment laden stream in an agricultural catchment we further showed that direct comparison of analytical precision with the other methods resulted in lowest average cvs for mf 12 followed by dst 18 qpcr 24 and the automated microbial detection system 30 despite these variabilities similar temporal fluctuation patterns were observed for gluc activity and e coli fig 2 gluc activity peaked consecutively three times with maximum values of 13 5 16 1 and 16 9 mmfu 100 ml 1 and aligned with similar peaks in culturable and total e coli as illustrated by culture and qpcr respectively it is important to note that the high precision of gluc activity measurements even in the lower range of e coli concentrations 1000 cfu 100 ml 1 does not necessarily imply that gluc activity accurately accounted for e coli concentrations within that range fig 3 since both methods target different e coli populations gluc activity can also account for the occurrence of viable but non culturable e coli cells in water which likely explains the discrepancy between both methods in this concentration range 3 2 robustness of autonomous gluc activity measurement online sensors can be affected by matrix related interferences zamyadi et al 2012 and generate biased data that can ultimately influence decision making we therefore evaluated the robustness of online gluc activity measurements by challenging them with water matrices likely to be encountered during long term online monitoring and susceptible to cause interferences during enzymatic measurements based on the comparison between expected and measured gluc activity in matrix spikes raw sewage did not affect p 0 05 automatic gluc activity measurements even when it contributed to 10 of the water matrix table 3 for treated effluents gluc activity was slightly underestimated in presence of 10 effluents 90 10 mixture and accurately estimated in the mixtures containing lower proportions of treated effluent 1 and 0 1 in 99 1 and 99 9 0 1 mixtures respectively similarly observed e coli concentrations in the 90 10 mixture were lower than expected table s2 suggesting an error introduced during mixture preparation rather than a true matrix effect on gluc activity and e coli measurements although the river feeding the dwtp is impacted by multiple treated wastewater effluents and combined sewer overflow cso discharge points yarahmadi et al 2018 the highest gluc activities did not exceed 55 mmfu 100 ml 1 at the intake over a 1 5 year monitoring period which is over 5 times lower than the enzymatic activity measured in the 90 10 mixture with treated wastewater we can therefore assume that treated wastewater effluents are unlikely to affect gluc activity measurements in our settings the addition of sediments to the river water did not influence gluc activity measurements table 3 even for a turbidity of 70 ntu 90 10 mixture the online gluc activity measurement device is equipped with a patented technology that compensates for possible fluorescence losses in turbid samples koschelnik et al 2015 such correction likely occurred in the 90 10 mixtures with raw sewage or sediments where river water turbidity was raised 2 and 3 fold respectively overall the results from matrix spikes demonstrated the robustness of autonomous gluc activity measurements for testing conditions simulating the discharge of raw sewage treated wastewater or the resuspension of river sediments although we did not address potential interferences by algae and humic substances on the robustness of gluc activity measurement fiksdal and tryland 2008 it would be worth testing these compounds too 3 3 relationship between analytical methods relationships of variable patterns and strengths were reported among culture based methods such as mf and dst hallas et al 2008 hamilton et al 2005 olstadt et al 2007 zimmerman et al 2009 vergine et al 2017 or between culture and qpcr ahmed et al 2012 noble et al 2010 raith et al 2013 truchado et al 2016 here we assessed the relationships between the autonomous gluc activity measurement culture including an automatic microbial detection system and qpcr 3 3 1 relationship between culture and qpcr based methods culture based mf and dst assays displayed the strongest correlation r 0 94 and both methods were also positively correlated with the automated microbial detection system r 0 91 and 0 92 respectively table 4 bramburger et al 2015 reported a strong agreement between the automated detection system and mf in the saint lawrence river canada while schang et al 2016 found a weaker yet significant relationship between that system and dst in the yarra river australia although inter correlated we found that the three methods differed in their relative quantification of e coli for instance higher e coli concentrations were obtained with dst compared to mf slope of 1 2 which could result from a better recovery of stressed e coli using the former assay hallas et al 2008 vergine et al 2017 in contrast the automated detection system consistently provided lower e coli concentrations compared to mf and dst this likely originated from the instrument default calibration used for the conversion of time to detection ttd into cfu 100 ml 1 and done by the manufacturer with samples from lake ontario canada we performed a custom calibration of the instrument as recommended but could only use a limited set of local water samples for this purpose this did not sufficiently correct the e coli enumeration bias between the automated detection system and both mf and dst using a dataset that spans over a larger dynamic range of e coli concentrations should remove this bias because of its rapidity compared to culture based methods real time quantitative pcr qpcr has been proposed as an alternative to achieve same day results for more efficient decision making although no current standardized qpcr exists for e coli such assay has been developed for enterococcus for beach water quality monitoring usepa 2012b our results using a published taqman assay targeting the 23s rrna gene of e coli chern et al 2011 were marginally correlated with culture based assays table 4 in a previous study targeting the same gene but using different primer sets a moderate relationship r 0 47 was found using log10 transformed data ahmed et al 2012 noble et al 2010 described a strong relationship between culture and qpcr in seawater samples most of which were not affected by pcr inhibition our river samples were inhibited at various degrees as reported by the internal amplification control although pcr inhibition was eventually removed table s1 inhibitory compounds carried over during dna extraction could have caused suboptimal dna recovery schrader et al 2012 thereby affecting the sensitivity and precision of the assay particularly for high e coli concentrations table 2 the qpcr measured e coli concentrations were in average 1 2 log10 higher than those determined by the automated microbial detection system mf and dst differences of about one order of magnitude have been reported between qpcr and culture based enumeration of e coli and enterococcus ahmed et al 2012 noble et al 2010 raith et al 2013 truchado et al 2016 whitman et al 2010 culture and qpcr quantify fundamentally different targets and the latter detects not only dna from culturable but also from viable but not culturable vbnc or even dying and dead cells the comparatively higher e coli concentrations estimated by qpcr are thus likely caused by the occurrence of a high proportion of non culturable cells that partly originated from uv disinfected wastewater discharges upstream the drinking water intake the autonomous gluc activity measurement technology similarly detects enzymatic activity from non culturable e coli cells interestingly it was the only assay significantly correlated to qpcr table 4 underscoring the fact that gluc activity and dna measurements generate more conservative estimates of e coli than culture 3 3 2 relationship between autonomous gluc activity measurements and e coli enumeration we found linear relationships between the autonomous gluc activity measurements and e coli enumeration by four different assays automated microbial detection system mf dst and qpcr table 4 the strongest relationships between online gluc activity and culturable e coli were observed for dst r 0 77 and mf r 0 73 the relationships between autonomous gluc activity measurements and e coli concentrations provided by the automated microbial detection system and qpcr were weaker this likely resulted from the higher measurement uncertainty of both assays table 2 but also from a smaller dataset available for method comparison earlier studies comparing the manual gluc activity assay to culture reported good correlations r 0 85 for log10 transformed data spanning over large dynamic ranges 1 8 log10 farnleitner et al 2001 garcia armisen et al 2005 lebaron et al 2005 the relationships between the autonomous gluc activity measurement technology and dst were stronger than those reported by two recent studies comparing the same technology to dst in agricultural and mixed catchments ender et al 2017 stadler et al 2016 agricultural catchments are characterized by complex pollution patterns with a continuum of recent to old faecal inputs that may impact the relationship between gluc and e coli ryzinska paier et al 2014 in contrast the urban river investigated in this study is highly impacted by human sewage via treated wastewater and cso discharges which represent recent contamination inputs and are more likely to contain high proportions of culturable e coli nevertheless a subset of samples from routine monitoring of the drinking water intake deviated from the linear relationship between gluc activity and mf especially for e coli concentrations 1000 cfu 100 ml 1 fig 3 garcia armisen et al 2005 demonstrated that the fraction of non culturable e coli cells represent a higher portion of the total e coli population in low contaminated samples compared to samples highly contaminated by e coli the former usually stem from older faecal inputs where e coli switched from a culturable to a non culturable stage following prolonged exposure to nutrient scarcity and or uv irradiation servais et al 2009 the above mentioned discrepancies were measured during and following snowmelt runoff events for samples possibly containing older faecal deposits and high amounts of non culturable e coli or interfering compounds in turn resulting in high gluc activities 3 4 implications for the use of autonomous gluc activity measurements as surrogate of e coli for rapid online water quality monitoring considering the urgent need for rapid testing of microbial water quality autonomous near real time measurement of gluc activity can represent an attractive early warning tool for e coli monitoring our results demonstrate the precision table 2 fig 2 and robustness table 3 of autonomous online gluc activity measurements for a range of e coli concentrations and significant correlations with culturable and total e coli are reported table 4 these correlations appear to be weaker for e coli concentrations 1000 cfu 100 ml 1 likely due to a larger proportion of non culturable cells in samples within this concentration range garcia armisen et al 2005 the relationships between gluc activity and e coli as described in the previous section certainly merit careful attention given that culture based enumeration of faecal indicator bacteria fib prevail in most regulatory based monitoring frameworks however because the goal of fib is to reliably account for faecal pollution and point out an increased likelihood of pathogen occurrence it is of even higher importance to determine whether gluc activity is an equivalent or better predictor of an exposure to microbial hazards future work should therefore focus on the link between gluc activity and pathogen occurrence in water and investigate the epidemiological value of autonomous near real time monitoring of gluc activity while qpcr quantifies dna from culturable and non culturable cells direct measurement of gluc enzyme likewise targets a continuum of metabolically active e coli cells garcia armisen et al 2005 it remains to be tested whether gluc activity better correlates with the occurrence of waterborne pathogens known to persist longer than culturable e coli in water harwood et al 2005 jenkins et al 2011 such future work will be paramount for validating the usefulness of autonomous gluc activity measurement and other rapid online monitoring technologies as early warning tools towards more efficient protection of public health the long sample to result time of traditional culture based assays limits their usefulness in identification of intermittent hazardous events the automated microbial detection system significantly reduces the incubation time for the range of e coli concentrations measured in our study 1 3 5 log10 cfu 100 ml 1 a maximum of 11 5 h and a minimum of 8 5 h respectively were needed to deliver quantitative results without need of sample dilution furthermore it does not require trained technicians and laboratory facilities table 5 eventually though further improvements of the automated microbial detection system should aim at reducing the analysis time down to 4 h typically to enable same day decision making among the methods tested in this study the autonomous gluc activity measurement technology and qpcr are the most rapid the autonomous enzymatic technology can represent an alternative user friendly approach and generate high resolution data on the temporal dynamics of gluc activity as surrogate of culturable and non culturable e coli in water the comparatively high equipment cost of the autonomous gluc activity measurement technology may be offset in the long term by reductions in operation costs as it does not require trained technicians and lab facilities to process samples perform analyses and handle waste table 5 online near real time monitoring of e coli and other microbiological parameters will represent a huge leap forward for safe drinking and recreational water usage and it will ultimately lead to a paradigm shift in compliance monitoring and water resources management given the comparatively high equipment cost and absence of regulatory requirements though the use of autonomous online technologies is currently limited essentially to research oriented studies and proactive monitoring by a limited number of water utilities ultimately it is expected that rapid online monitoring will provide datasets of considerable importance for water resources management as well as risk assessment and modelling 4 conclusion the suitability of autonomous gluc activity measurement for rapid online monitoring of e coli in water was assessed the correlation of this parameter with the presence of culturable e coli as measured with different techniques was also evaluated laboratory and in situ assessment of method precision revealed that the autonomous gluc activity measurement technology demonstrated high analytical precision with average coefficients of variation below 5 compared to mf 16 dst 21 an automated microbial detection system 31 and qpcr 31 autonomous gluc activity measurements were not affected by raw sewage treated wastewater or river sediments attesting for high assay robustness although significant correlations between gluc activity measurements and e coli enumeration were observed further work is required to link enzymatic activity with the occurrence of pathogens this is especially warranted for e coli concentrations 1000 cfu 100 ml 1 for which the correlation with gluc activity was weaker collectively reported results illustrate that the promising potential of autonomous gluc activity measurement for online near real time monitoring of e coli in surface water should be confirmed by further investigating the relationships between gluc activity and the presence of viable e coli cells despite cost effectiveness of traditional culture based assays fully or semi automated field deployable instruments such as those tested in this study do not depend on state of art laboratory equipment nor do they require trained technicians to be operated which would facilitate the collection of larger data sets ongoing work is examining the value of online gluc activity monitoring for detection of peak pathogen concentrations in drinking

19043,biogeochemical redox processes that govern radionuclide mobility in sediments are highly sensitive to forcing by the water cycle for example episodic draining and intrusion of oxidants into reduced zones during dry seasons can create biogeochemical seasonal hotspots of enhanced and changed microbial activity affect the redox status of minerals initiate changes in sediment gas and water

characterize the variability in redox processes and related usol solubility within shallow fine grained nrzs at the legacy u ore processing site at shiprock nm previous studies have reported u speciation and behavior in permanently saturated fine grained nrz sediments this is the first report of u behavior in fine grained nrz like sediments that experience repeated redox cycling due to seasonal fluctuations in moisture content our results support previous observations that reducing conditions are needed to accumulate usol in sediments but they counter the expectation that usol predominantly accumulates as u iv sol our data reveal that usol may accumulate as u vi sol in roughly equal proportion to u iv sol surprisingly high abundances of u vi sol confined in transiently saturated fine grained nrz like sediments suggest that redox cycling is needed to promote its accumulation we propose a new process model where redox oscillations driven by annual water table fluctuations accompanied by strong evapotranspiration in low permeability sediments promote conversion of u iv sol to relatively immobile u vi sol which suggests that usol is accumulating in a form that is resistant to redox perturbations this observation contradicts the common idea that u iv sol accumulated in reducing conditions is systematically re oxidized solubilized and transported away in

common features of floodplains gurwick et al 2008 blazejewski et al 2009 once these sediments are saturated with water they can develop reducing conditions independent of their texture due to oxygen consumption from organic matter decomposition noël et al 2017a due to high sulfate concentrations in groundwater in shallow ucrb aquifers with concentrations around 250 mg l doe 2013 nrzs contain abundant sulfate reduction products such as fe sulfide minerals two main classes of nrzs have been identified in the ucrb differing in terms of particle size 1 fine grained low permeability nrzs which are enriched in the 150 μm sediment size fraction compared to surrounding sediments creating strong permeability contrasts and sharp redox gradients and 2 coarse grained high permeability nrzs exhibiting grain size distributions similar to those in under and overlying sediments leading to more dynamic exchange of oxidants with surrounding aquifers and seasonal redox cycling noël et al 2017a 2017b oc content of the solid fraction sediment texture and moisture govern the retention of usol through reduction of u vi to u iv li et al 2015 cumberland et al 2016 mikutta et al 2016 noël et al

behrends and van cappellen 2005 jeon et al 2005 chakraborty et al 2010 boland et al 2011 hyun et al 2012 veeramani et al 2013 recent model microcosm studies simulating nrz field conditions suggest that u iv adsorbs to the surfaces of particulate organic material and exhibits a molecular structure consistent with non crystalline u iv sol bernier latmani et al 2010 bone et al 2017a investigations of u iv sol in nrzs throughout the ucrb corroborate these observations noël et al 2017b and suggest that the preservation of oxidation sensitive non crystalline u iv sol pools depends on the permeability of nrzs to oxygen in low permeability organic enriched sediments u accumulates as non crystalline u iv sol as long as system is saturated if these sediments become exposed to air then we would expect that u iv sol would become oxidized and transported away however no studies have documented the impact of oscillating redox conditions caused by fluctuating water saturation on u behavior in low permeability nrzs in the field the objectives of the present study were to a characterize the redox process variability within a shallow fine grained nrz at the shiprock nm site affected by annual water table fluctuations and b evaluate usol oxidation state and chemical forms as a function of this redox variability s and fe speciation of the solid fraction were determined as proxy of the redox conditions of sediments these were then compared with the distribution of usol and uaq species our results showed that a large fraction of usol within nrzs at the shiprock site was present as u vi sol stabilization of u vi in reduced sediments has not previously been reported here we propose a new conceptual model of u recycling in alluvial nrzs under variable hydrologic conditions that explains this observation knowledge provided by this study advances our ability to predict the role of nrzs as controls over ground and surface water quality 2 material and methods 2 1 field site description and common features of floodplain sediments through ucrb the shiprock site hosts a doe managed former u and v ore processing facility within the navajo nation in the northwest corner of new mexico near the town of shiprock approximately 28 miles west of farmington fig 1 a doe 2002 2012 the mill ore storage area raffinate ponds ponds that contained spent liquids from the milling process and tailings piles occupied approximately 0 93 km2 by 1986 all tailings and associated materials were encapsulated in a disposal cell built on an elevated terrace overlooking the san juan river the ponds on the adjacent floodplain which is in hydrological connection with the san juan river had been cleaned and filled by sediments however the floodplain continues to receive inflow from the terrace system fig 1a and in spite of natural and managed groundwater flushing total uaq concentrations still exceed the maximum concentration limit mcl 0 044 mgu l reaching as high as 1 52 mgu l

2 2 sampling of solid sediment and pore water cores and trenches were sampled from the contaminated floodplain supporting information si figure si 1 and tables si 1 in march april 2015 cores were obtained through direct push coring and retrieved in n2 purged plastic sleeves trenches were dug by backhoe the targeted area for this study fig 1b was selected because dm02 and dm04 cores and the 03 trench exhibited nrz materials black and clayey centimeter thick distinct layers fig 1c smelling of sulfides pore water was immediately extracted by directly inserting rhizon soil moisture samplers of 12 18 μm song et al 2003 into the sediment cores or trench walls groundwater samples from the 03 trench were collected along a 50 cm water column from 110 to 160 cm depth on the same day 3 4 h after stabilization of the water level in the trench and filtered using rhizon soil moisture sampler for comparison with pore water samples each pore water and groundwater sample was divided into two aliquots the first aliquot was anaerobically preserved in ar purged serum vials crimp sealed with rubber stoppers and the second aliquot was placed in acid cleaned sealed polypropylene tubes acidified

oxidation in ar purged serum vials crimp sealed with rubber stoppers all samples were immediately stored in the dark at 3 c and shipped on ice to the laboratory where they were vacuum dried inside an anoxic glove box with 5 h2 95 n2 atmosphere after drying each sediment sample was sieved 1 mm homogenized and stored in sealed containers in the glove box for comparison sediment samples from cores 20

complement the solid fraction fe speciation data derived from x ray absorption spectroscopy xas chen et al 2017 mössbauer spectra were analyzed at the environmental molecular sciences laboratory using

usol and relatively immobile or residual according to a protocol derived from alessi et al 2012 3 results 3 1 hydrological and physico chemical characteristics of the sediment system historical water table levels for wells 620 621 and 622 which are proximal to the dm02 core location are summarized in figure si 3 these data show that the water table varied between about 108 and 215 cm in depth bgs since 1985 we refer to the zone located between 0 and 108 cm the shallowest recorded level of groundwater table as the permanently unsaturated zone fig 2 a the groundwater level at the time of sample collection was measured at 110 cm bgs at the dm02 well which is close to the shallowest level registered figure si 3 the vertical distribution of total fe sulfide minerals fes and fes2 measured by linear combination fitting of s xanes along the dm02 core fig 2c shows that the permanently unsaturated zone was devoid of fe sulfide minerals conversely sediments located below the water table elevation at the time of sampling i e below 110 cm bgs contained elevated fes and fes2 this observation suggests that fe sulfide minerals are stable in these zones under saturated conditions at the time of sampling below the water table the trends in total fe sulfide minerals and oc concentrations of the solid fraction are concomitant fig 2b tables si 2 these observations are consistent with previous studies showing that abundance of fe sulfide minerals is correlated with solid fraction oc content and sediment moisture within ucrb floodplains campbell et al 2012 janot et al 2016 noël et al 2017a at the shiprock site nrzs exhibiting elevated total fe sulfide minerals and oc contents in the solid fraction fig 2a c are visually easily distinguished from the surrounding alluvium fig 1c nrzs consist of black clayey centimeter thick lenses infilling interstices created by cobbles or forming distinct layers whereas underlying sediments is composed of oblate spheroidal siliciclastic cobbles larger than 5 cm in diameter pebbles gravel and sand exhibiting a light grey color figs 1c and 2a the sharp texture contrast of sandy vs clayey is reflected in the particle size distribution fig 2b sieving confirmed an increased abundance of fine particles 150 μm from the top margin of the nrz to the interior this type of nrz was previously described at the rifle site as a fine grained nrz noël et al 2017a coarser grained underlying sediments containing in its solid fraction fe sulfide minerals and oc at lower concentration than fine grained nrzs are referred to here as the suboxic zones figs 2 and 3 because the fine grained nrzs and suboxic zones are located in the water table fluctuation area we referred to these zones as transiently saturated zones 3 2 s and fe mineral distribution the chemical forms of s and fe exhibit variability tied to redox conditions providing efficient and precise biogeochemical tracers of redox processes such as microbial sulfate reduction and periodic oxidant incursions noël et al 2017a we investigated s and fe speciation of the solid fraction to better identify redox boundaries and processes with depth using xas and mössbauer spectroscopy figure si 4 si 5 si 6 si 7 and si 8 the relative proportions of solid fraction s and fe species as determined from lc ls fitting of s k edge xanes and fe k edge exafs spectra are shown in fig 3b and c and tabulated in figure si 4 and si 8 respectively permanently unsaturated oxic zone 0 100 cm bgs s k edge xanes spectra of this zone show that sulfate s vi was the only oxidation state of s of the solid fraction occurring here indicating the presence of sulfate minerals and or sulfates complexed with solid fraction organic ligands fig 3b this result is supported by visual observations at the time of excavation of abundant efflorescent and solid white mineral deposits in sediments from the surface to the water table level these deposits are texturally similar to gypsum partly soluble in water and has been previously referred to as evaporite minerals dam et al 2015 doe 2016a b fe exafs indicates that fe of the solid fraction is present as fe iii oxyhydr oxides 26 30 including mainly hematite and goethite fe ii iii oxides 11 occurring as magnetite and fe ii and fe iii bearing phyllosilicates 59 63 fig 3c the lc ls fitting of fe exafs data detailed in figure si 8 yielded an optimum fit with fe iii bearing phyllosilicates such as illite nontronite mixture 40 as proxy of fe smectite noël et al 2014 and fe ii iii bearing phyllosilicates such as phlogopite 19 23 as proxy of fe mica the mössbauer spectroscopy is used in this study to give additional information on the fe minerals difficult to detect using only xas as the distribution the size and the crystallinity of different fe ii fe iii hydroxy oxides referred to as fe hydroxy oxides as well as fe ii fe iii ratio of silicates fig 4 a spectral modeling of the mössbauer spectrum of the sample from 15 cm bgs suggests the fe hydroxy oxides to be a mixture of large particle magnetite lp magnetite 50 nm goya et al 2003 large particle hematite lp hematite 15 nm murad and cashion 2004 and short range ordered nano goethite 10 nm thompson et al 2006 the changes in spectral features obtained at various temperatures figure si 5 suggest the occurrence of three different short range ordered nano goethites depending on the size of the compositional domain crystallinity which is related to average of particles size al contents with crystallinity of nano al goethite 1 nano al goethite 2 nano al goethite 3 thompson et al 2006 stucki et al 2012 the nature of the non fe hydroxy oxides pool which exhibit high spin fe ii and fe iii doublets in the spectrum on the other hand is not obvious mössbauer parameters of the doublets overlap well with phyllosilicate clay illite parameters dong et al 2003 however in this case the fe doublets appear not to be due to fe in illite but are likely due to fe in ottrelite a chloritoid the only fe silicate phase evident in sd xrd of all samples along the dm02 core profile figure si 2 or to a lesser extent in albite a na analog of plagioclase feldspar a silicate phase poor in fe but occurring abundantly in the sediment figure si 2 to our knowledge robust mössbauer spectral parameters of albite or ottrelite have not been reported in literature preventing us from fully resolving the source of the fe doublets in our samples further as discussed later 4 3 we cannot exclude the additional presence of amorphous fe silicates which are not detectable by xrd the fe bearing phases observed here are similar to those reported for other floodplain sediments in the ucrb at rifle naturita and grand junction co noël et al 2017a these minerals were described to be mainly inherited from burial of sediments along active river margins campbell et al 2012 transiently saturated suboxic zone 132 162 cm bgs the transiently saturated suboxic zone contained the lowest total s concentrations of the core sediments here s of the solid fraction was mainly present as s vi in sulfate minerals and or organic sulfates 51 85 fig 3b however relative to total s concentration of the solid fraction s vi was 2 to 4 fold less abundant in this zone than in the permanently unsaturated oxic zone s k edge xanes spectra also showed the occurrence of variable proportions of s 0 5 14 of total s of the solid fraction s i 9 16 of total s of the solid fraction and s ii 0 32 of total s of the solid fraction indicating the presence of elemental sulfur s 0 pyrite fes2 and mackinawite fes respectively detailed in figure si 4 no s k edge peak was detected between 2473 and 2480 ev from the bulk samples of the solid fraction subsequently except for organic sulfates s organic model compounds were not considered in the lc ls fits however we cannot exclude that some reduced organic s compounds were present in the solid fraction in concentrations below detection 10 prietzel et al 2011 in spite of the fact that both mössbauer spectroscopy measurements fig 4b and the lc ls fits of fe k edge exafs provided evidence for the existence of a fraction of the total fe as pyrite 3 4 of total fe of the solid fraction and mackinawite 0 8 of total fe of the solid fraction fe sulfide minerals were below detection 10 in the fe xas data fig 3c similar to the permanently unsaturated oxic zone fe of the solid fraction in the transiently saturated suboxic zones was mainly incorporated in fe ii and fe iii bearing phyllosilicate minerals 59 62 of total fe of the solid fraction goethite 0 10 of total fe of the solid fraction hematite 10 12 of total fe of the solid fraction and magnetite 15 17 of total fe of the solid fraction transiently saturated fine grained nrz 114 122 cm bgs 172 192 cm bgs these zones exhibit lower sulfate content comprising 18 47 of total s of the solid fraction fig 3b which is consistent with much lower abundances of white evaporite minerals observed within transiently saturated fine grained nrz sediments at the time of excavation as compared to permanently unsaturated oxic and transiently saturated suboxic zone samples fe sulfide minerals fes and fes2 were the dominant forms of s in the solid fraction 39 71 of total s of the solid fraction fig 3b similarly to s the fe oxidation state decreased in the solid fraction of transiently saturated fine grained nrzs indicating increasing proportions of fe ii bearing minerals figure si 6 si 7 and si 8 the proportion of exafs detectable goethite decreased from 24 at the interface with the permanently unsaturated oxic zone 114 cm bgs to undetectable in the transiently saturated fine grained nrzs 122 cm 172 cm and 182 cm depth bgs fig 3c concomitantly fe sulfide minerals ranged from 21 to 43 fig 3c the remaining fraction of fe of the solid fraction in the transiently saturated fine grained nrzs was present as fe ii and fe iii phyllosilicate minerals 32 64 and to lesser extent as magnetite 4 14 and hematite 2 9 the mössbauer spectra of samples at 114 and 172 cm depth bgs fig 4b and c corroborate these conclusions also suggesting the presence of fe sulfide minerals indeed a higher relative contribution of the central doublet 0 1 mm s compared to the spectrum from the permanently unsaturated oxic zone sample implies that this feature is a mix of silicate fe iii and pyrite mackinawite fe ii detailed in si 5 1 further the mössbauer spectroscopy measurements confirm that the contribution of combined fe hydroxy oxides content is lower in transiently saturated fine grained nrzs than in the permanently unsaturated oxic zone sample fig 4 in the upper transiently saturated fine grained nrz sample at the interface between the permanently unsaturated oxic zone and upper transiently saturated fine grained nrz 114 cm depth bgs mössbauer spectral modeling suggests lower amounts of smaller sized compositional domain less crystalline nano goethite nano al goethite 3 than in the overlying permanently unsaturated oxic zone sediment fig 4 more importantly in the deeper transiently saturated fine grained nrz sample 172 cm depth bgs fig 4c sextet peaks for both types of less crystalline nano goethite particles nano al goethtie 2 and nano al goethite 3 are absent in addition to fe hydroxy oxides fe sulfide minerals detailed in si 5 1 and silicate fe peaks a spectral feature that could be attributed to ilmenite fetio3 was distinguished no evidence was found in the mössbauer spectrum of species normally expected under reducing conditions siderite peretyazhko et al 2013 adsorbed fe ii on the surfaces of hematite larese casanova and scherer 2007 or more globally fe ii spiked onto rifle sediment proxy of ucrb sediments fox et al 2013 3 3 fe sulfide mineral variability in transiently saturated fine grained nrzs fe sulfide minerals in the shallow transiently saturated fine grained nrz 110 125 cm bgs consisted mostly of pyrite in contrast fe sulfide minerals in the deeper transiently saturated fine grained nrz 172 200 cm bgs contained abundant mackinawite moreover fe sulfide minerals transition from mostly pyrite in the shallower portion deeper of the transiently saturated fine grained nrz 172 cm bgs to dominantly mackinawite at 182 cm depth bgs and below elemental sulfur decreased in abundance as mackinawite increased fig 3b and si 4 this change in fe sulfide mineralogy is also reflected in the fe speciation detailed in si mössbauer and fe xas data from the samples collected at 114 and 172 cm depth bgs shallowest suggested the presence of pyrite and mackinawite without precipitation of greigite fe3s4 noël et al 2017a conversely the lc ls fitting of the 182 cm and 192 cm deeper transiently saturated fine grained nrz samples did not indicate any detectable pyrite and the best fits for the 182 cm sample were obtained by including both mackinawite 18 and greigite 12 moreover the greigite component significantly improved the quality of the lc ls fits estimated by an r factor parameter rf of the following form rf χexp χcalc 2 χexp 2 by 22 3 4 vertical distribution and oxidation state of usol the trend in sediment concentrations of total usol was similar to that of fe sulfide minerals fig 2c and d total usol concentrations increased from an average low concentration of 6 2 μg g in the permanently unsaturated oxic zone up to 202 μg g in the upper transiently saturated fine grained nrz 122 cm bgs and an average maximum of 245 6 μg g in the deeper transiently saturated fine grained nrz between 172 and 182 cm bgs sediments from the transiently saturated suboxic zone exhibited an intermediate average total usol concentration of 34 8 μg g 132 162 cm bgs and 197 240 cm bgs fig 2d tables si 2 in contrast to results from previous studies of nrzs campbell et al 2012 janot et al 2016 noël et al 2017b stetten et al 2018 the u liii edge xanes spectra of the transiently saturated fine grained nrz samples from shiprock indicated that significant concentrations of u vi sol fig 2d and si 9 table 1 and si 4 the proportion of u iv sol was systematically elevated in the transiently saturated fine grained nrz samples with u iv sol concentrations reaching up to 132 and 196 μg g at 122 and 182 cm depth bgs respectively fig 2d nevertheless u vi sol proportions in transiently saturated suboxic zone and fine grained nrz sediments ranged from 14 10 to 58 10 of total usol i e between 19 and 62 μg g in comparison total usol concentrations in permanently unsaturated oxic zone sediments were much lower between 0 and 11 μg g table 1 and si 4 3 5 u iv sol and vi sol extractions variability and distribution of non crystalline and residual u iv sol and vi sol oxygen free milli q water was used to extract weakly associated u iv sol and vi sol whereas oxygen free 1 0 m bicarbonate extractions were used to estimate the concentration of strongly sorbed complexes including both u iv sol and u vi sol adsorbed on mineral surfaces and organic matter elias et al 2003 zhou and gu 2005 alessi et al 2012 any u iv sol and u vi sol not extracted by these two techniques was assigned as residual previously this pool has been referred to as crystalline alessi et al 2012 however we suspect that some white evaporite minerals were still present after water and bicarbonate extraction this observation suggests that a portion of the residual u vi sol could be sorbed complexed with minerals trapped in the dissolution resistant evaporite assemblages observed at the time of excavation see 3 2 subsequently we use residual u iv sol and u vi sol to include u iv and u vi bearing minerals both crystalline minerals and amorphous mineraloids but also u vi sol sorbed complexed in the dissolution resistant evaporite assemblages not solubilized by oxygen free water and 1 0 m bicarbonate extractions oxygen free water and bicarbonate extractable u iv sol and u vi sol can be considered available non crystalline u iv sol and u vi sol the residual pool comprised between 24 and 63 of total usol according to the lc ls fitting of u liii edge xanes data for samples collected at 122 and 182 cm depth bgs this pool contained both u iv sol and u vi sol figure si 9 to estimate the proportion of residual u iv sol we used an additional step of the 1 0 m bicarbonate extractions in oxic conditions this step was performed sequentially after the oxygen free 1 0 m bicarbonate extraction we assumed that u iv sol from minerals such as uraninite would be oxidized under oxic conditions to avoid adsorption of oxidized u released in this step the extraction was performed in the presence of oxygenated 1 0 m bicarbonate solution however we cannot exclude the possibility that some u vi sol incorporated in the structure of redox sensitive minerals was released during extraction or that some residual u iv sol remained in the solid phase after the extraction further work is therefore needed to refine this chemical extraction step oxygen free vs oxygenated 1 0 m bicarbonate extraction and confirm that it targets the entire residual u iv sol pool and only this pool the results of the chemical extractions of u iv sol and u vi sol from transiently saturated suboxic and fine grained nrz sediments are shown in figs 3c and 5 3 6 total uaq concentration groundwater vs pore water groundwater samples were collected by doe legacy management from wells 620 621 and 622 between 1985 and 2017 fig 1c groundwater flow vectors computed before during and after peak runoff in the river between may and july 2011 suggest that these three wells are located immediately downgradient of transiently saturated fine grained nrzs regardless of seasonal water table variations m kautsky personal communication fig 1b total uaq concentrations i e u iv aq and u vi aq in the groundwater of wells 620 622 decreased over the 30 past years from an average of 2 11 mg l to 0 45 mg l fig 1d total uaq concentrations 0 49 mg l measured in water in trench 03 close to the location of the dm02 core was chosen as a proxy for total uaq concentration in groundwater near the dm02 transiently saturated fine grained nrzs this concentration is the same order of magnitude of uaq concentrations as the current total uaq concentrations of wells 620 622 in contrast the total uaq concentrations of pore water from the transiently saturated fine grained nrzs within the dm02 core at the time of sampling april 2015 ranged between 1 46 and 9 46 mg l which are 29 to 192 fold higher than groundwater from trench 03 and 620 622 wells at this time fig 1d tables si 2 this observation indicates that chemical hydrological processes operating in the transiently saturated fine grained nrz act to produce elevated uaq concentrations 4 discussion 4 1 stability of mackinawite and non crystalline u iv sol our mössbauer data suggest that short range ordered nano goethites composed of smaller sized compositional domain lower crystallinity nano al goethite 2 and nano al goethite 3 are unstable under anoxic conditions conversely larger sized compositional domain higher crystallinity nano goethites nano al goethite 1 large particle magnetite 50 nm and hematite 15 nm appear to be kinetically stable under reducing conditions fig 4 and fig si 5 this implies that smaller sized compositional domain nano goethites are more readily bio available than the larger particle fe hydroxy oxides kukkadapu et al 2001 ekstrom et al 2010 chen et al 2017 and the decrease of their proportion concomitant with the apparition of fe sulfide minerals suggests that these smaller sized compositional domain nano goethites are susceptible to reductive dissolution kumar et al 2018 reductive dissolution of fe hydroxy oxides and precipitation of fe sulfide minerals occurs when biogenic h2s produced by microbial sulfate respiration rickard 1975 druhan et al 2014 reacts with fe hydroxy oxides to produce elemental sulfur and nano crystalline mackinawite morin et al 2017 alternatively metal reducing heterotrophic bacteria can also directly reduce fe iii coupled to oxidation of oc nielsen and andersen 2003 canfield et al 2005 the produced fe ii then reacts with h2s to precipitate fes as mackinawite rickard and luther 2007 thus the oc microbial decomposition of saturated sediments ultimately facilitates microbial reduction of sulfate and iron which promotes fe hydroxy oxides reductive dissolution and enhances the precipitation of fe sulfide minerals interestingly the presence of organic matter has been proposed to favor fes and pyrite formation wind and conrad 1997 which could help to explain why that fe sulfide mineral abundance is directly correlated to solid fraction oc content in transiently saturated zones fig 2c here the distribution and mineralogy of fe sulfide minerals is used as biogeochemical tracer to predict the ability of sediments to preserve oxidation sensitive minerals within transiently saturated suboxic zones the highest proportion of fe sulfide minerals in the transiently saturated suboxic zones was concomitant with the highest solid fraction oc content at 152 cm bgs fig 2c consistent with idea that microbial consumption of oc creates conditions favorable for accumulation fe sulfide minerals these zones also exhibited the highest proportion of oxidation sensitive mackinawite suggesting that variability in oc content could control the distribution of mackinawite plausibly due to increased microbial oxygen consumption rates keiluweit et al 2015 2016 depending on solid fraction oc composition and limitation of diffusion into sediment keiluweit et al 2017 the availability of dissolved oc can protect mackinawite but also u iv sol from oxidation bi and hayes 2014 carpenter et al 2015 paradis et al 2016 bone et al 2017b within transiently saturated fine grained nrzs at increased depth 172 182 cm bgs we observed a shift in fe sulfide mineralogy in favor of mackinawite over pyrite fig 3b and c and elemental sulfur mackinawite metastable is widely regarded as precursors to thermodynamically favored pyrite eqs 1 and 2 rickard and luther 2007 burton et al 2011 furthermore mackinawite is also highly susceptible to being oxidized in the presence of o2 bearing solutions at near neutral ph eq 3 burton et al 2009 producing elemental sulfur rickard and luther 2007 1 fes sn 2 fes2 s n 1 2 2 fes h2s fes2 h2 3 fes 0 75 o2 0 5 h2o s0 feooh therefore high abundances of mackinawite combined with the absence of pyrite and low abundance of elemental sulfur suggest that mackinawite is more kinetically stable and oxidizes much more slowly below 172 cm bgs this observation specifically from eq 3 suggests that transiently saturated fine grained nrz sediments below 172 cm bgs are less frequently exposed to o2 than those above this elevation noël et al 2017a the solid fraction oc concentration and sediment texture did not change significantly from 172 to 182 cm depth bgs consequently these parameters cannot explain the variability of mackinawite abundance below 172 cm depth instead we assume that preservation of mackinawite is a result of less frequent wet dry cycling with the deepest portion of the fluctuating groundwater zone being infrequently drained figure si 3 and therefore exhibiting the most continuously sustained anoxia within transiently saturated suboxic and fine grained nrz sediments the abundance of available non crystalline u iv sol and u vi sol oxygen free water extractable and oxygen free bicarbonate extractable u iv sol and u vi sol species correlates well with the proportion of mackinawite and likely greigite normalized to total fe sulfide minerals fig 5 these results corroborate the conclusions of noël et al 2017b which concluded that accumulation of sorbed u iv sol is most effective under conditions of sustained anoxia and can be predicted based on the relative abundance of mackinawite these results suggest that non crystalline u iv sol proposed to be mainly complexed to sediment associated oc and possibly to mineral surfaces fletcher et al 2010 alessi et al 2014 stetten et al 2018 should be most abundant below 172 cm depth 4 2 contribution of u iv bearing mineral under reduced conditions bone et al 2017a and mikutta et al 2016 showed that the precipitation of u iv bearing minerals e g uraninite uo2 is thermodynamically inhibited when natural organic matter functional groups are available and u vi aq concentrations to be reduced are low 2 38 mg l at higher u vi aq concentrations between 2 38 and 11 90 mg l u vi aq converted to u iv lead to uo2 precipitation in most permanently saturated nrzs that we have observed total uaq concentrations 2 mg l noël et al 2017b are significantly below the threshold concentrations needed to precipitate u iv bearing mineral in contrast total uaq concentrations in dm02 transiently saturated fine grained nrz pore water ranged from 1 45 to 9 46 mg l fig 1d at these concentrations it is plausible that a part of u vi aq can precipitate as uo2 during reducing conditions back this conclusion is supported by our chemical extractions which reveal the presence of a residual u iv sol phase 4 3 evidence for redox resistant u vi sol accumulation our findings show that u can accumulate in transiently saturated fine grained nrzs as u vi sol at roughly equal proportion to u iv sol with u vi sol concentrations up to 69 μg g estimated in this study fig 2d table 1 and table si 4 the accumulation of residual u vi sol in transiently saturated fine grained nrzs fig 3d suggests that a part of u vi sol could be either i a newly formed u vi bearing mineral and or ii u vi sol physically trapped inside of dissolution resistant evaporite mineral assemblages the resistance of u vi sol to reducing conditions fig 2d also corroborates the idea that a significant part of u vi sol is not easily bio available to reduction i precipitation of u vi bearing minerals pore water compositions were used to calculate u vi sol phase saturation indices using phreeqc 3 4 0 charlton and parkhurst 2011 with the minteq database modified for uranyl mineral ksp s from gorman lewis et al 2008 total uaq concentration was assumed to be dominated by u vi aq the calculation shows that several uranyl silicates should have been oversaturated including uranophane ca uo2 2 sio3oh 2 5h2o logksp 9 42 log q k 3 4 5 4 na boltwoodite na uo2 sio3oh h2o 1 5 logksp 5 86 log q k 0 8 2 1 and na weeksite na2 uo2 2 si2o5 3 h2o 4 ksp 1 5 log q k 2 7 5 7 uranyl silicates such as uranophane and na bolwoodite were previously proposed to control the solubility of u vi in contaminated unsaturated zone sediments at the us department of energy hanford site liu et al 2004 catalano et al 2004 thermodynamic calculations in transiently saturated sediments at the us department of energy riverton floodplain site indicated that soddyite uo2 2 sio4 2 h2o and other uranyl silicates would become saturated during the evaporation process dam et al 2015 moreover silica species are expected to precipitate from si rich solutions due to evaporation in soils and exposed sediments chadwick et al 1986 which could be the case for the shallow evaporite enriched sediments at shiprock exhibiting high si concentrations in pore water 64 172 mg l tables si 2 if so then usol could be incorporated into amorphous silica likely in association with fe hydroxy oxides massey et al 2014 it is interesting to speculate that u vi sol could be associated with in situ precipitation of amorphous fe silica because fe is strongly remobilized during redox cycling and mössbauer analyses detected the presence of fe silica however the fe silica detected by mössbauer spectroscopy was most likely ottrelite and albite detailed in 3 2 which we suspect to be inherited from burial of sediments along active river margins and not precipitated during redox cycling which suggests they are not likely u vi hosts as soils dry calcite precipitates rapidly in an ionic diffusion controlled reaction while monosolicic acid which requires greater activation energy for si o bond breakage prior to precipitation is concentrated in the solution phase chadwick et al 1986 thus carbonate could precipitate during evaporation tables si 2 and trap uranyl from pore waters carlisle 1978 indeed thermodynamic calculation using uranyl carbonate ksp s calculated from gibbs free energy of formation gorman lewis et al 2008 suggests that shiprock pore waters were oversaturated for uranyl carbonate minerals including andersonite na2ca uo2 co3 3 h2o 6 logksp 38 alwan and williams 1980 log q k 2 3 3 3 consequently it is energetically likely that the reduction resistant u vi sol observed in shiprock transiently saturated fine grained nrzs is contained in evaporate minerals depending on the favorability of hydrological conditions to facilitate evaporite formation ii trapping u vi into dissolution resistant evaporite mineral assemblages due to a combination of high dissolved sulfate concentrations in the groundwater around 250 mg l doe 2013 and high capillary rise due to evapotranspiration dam et al 2015 doe 2016a b evaporite minerals can precipitate from the surface to deep sediments and have been proposed to partially control u mobility in these environments dam et al 2015 evaporite mineral assemblages were observed at the time of excavation within transiently saturated fine grained nrz sediments that were saturated in water see 3 2 indicating that they are resistant to the dissolution and thus likely carbonates indeed recent laboratory experiments by our group show that the groundwater lead quickly to supersaturation of sulfate due to natural high concentration of dissolved sulfate subsequently inhibiting total dissolution of evaporites unpublished data thus we propose that a part of u vi sol could be trapped inside of such evaporite mineral assemblages resistant to dissolution physically protecting u vi sol from reduction and oxygen free water and 1 0 m bicarbonate extractions 4 4 role of wet dry redox cycling on u vi sol accumulation the low permeability of fine grained nrzs together with high sorptive capacity from abundant organic ligands and clays limits the diffusion of u vi aq from the aquifer and increases its interaction with solid interfaces microorganisms and slow chemical reactions such as evaporate precipitation inside the fine grained nrzs when nrzs are water saturated intense reducing conditions enable the reduction of u vi to u iv which decreases the proportion of u vi associated with solids lovley et al 1991 1992 liger et al 1999 senko et al 2002 o loughlin et al 2003 behrends and van cappellen 2005 jeon et al 2005 wall and krumholz 2006 abdelouas 2006 chakraborty et al 2010 boland et al 2011 hyun et al 2012 veeramani et al 2013 moreover u vi sol phases have not previously been reported in permanently saturated nrzs of similar mineralogical and chemical composition campbell et al 2012 noël et al 2017b consequently we exclude the possibility that u vi sol could be protected from reducing conditions by sorption complexation mineral and organic surfaces the sorptive capacity of fine grained sediments alone cannot explain u vi sol accumulation as high as 69 μg g instead we propose the abundances of u vi sol in the transiently saturated fine grained nrz sediments at shiprock site must be attributed to wet dry redox cycling non crystalline u iv sol pools accumulated under reducing conditions are relatively susceptible to rapid oxidative mobilization during water table fluctuations 4 1 which could locally release u vi aq to pore water a portion of the u iv aq may also be remobilized in its reduced form such as in u iv colloids wang et al 2013 nrz pore water total uaq concentrations were elevated compared to the surrounding aquifer by 30 200x fig 1d which could indicate that oxic geochemical conditions in transiently saturated fine grained nrzs significantly re solubilize u but with limited export from the fine grained nrz pore waters to groundwater thus we conclude that under the diffusion limited conditions that prevail in transiently saturated fine grained nrzs released u vi aq and to lesser extend as likely u iv aq may accumulate to relatively high concentrations in pore waters bone et al 2017b evapotranspiration driven water loss from shallow unsaturated sediments yabusaki et al 2017 may also contribute to concentrating u vi aq in transiently saturated fine grained nrz pore waters consequently we propose that within the transiently saturated fine grained nrzs at shiprock and similar fine grained environments the combination of strong evapotranspiration and low permeability promotes a hyper accumulation of u vi aq during oxidation of u iv sol these u vi enriched microenvironments can then facilitate u vi accumulation in the solid phase through several mechanisms including i adsorption complexation of u vi on surfaces of for example nano particle al substituted goethite nano goethite ferrihydrite fig 4 dublet et al 2017 organic matter fig 2c stetten et al 2018 and phyllosilicate clays ii association with evaporite mineral assemblages resistant to dissolution 4 3 and iii precipitation of u vi uranyl mineral 4 3 4 5 a new process model for u iv sol and u vi sol accumulation in nrz sediments based on the results of this study we propose a new process model where each draining cycle leads to successive conversion of oxidation sensitive u iv sol pools to u vi sol some of which is incorporated into redox resistant u vi sol pools schematically illustrated in graphical abstract step 1 in water saturated conditions graphical abstract left part anoxia prevails and creates conditions that promote the conversion of u vi aq to u iv which predominantly accumulates as non crystalline u iv sol 4 1 step 2 when fine grained nrz sediments are partially desaturated graphical abstract right part incursion of o2 promotes the oxidative dissolution of non crystalline u iv sol to u vi aq the constraints generated by evapotranspiration and low permeability sediments limit the export of u vi aq to groundwater resulting in u vi aq accumulation step 3 u vi aq sorbs on minerals and organics associated precipitated in evaporite mineral assemblages and possibly precipitates as uranyl minerals 4 3 step 4 once sediments are seasonally re saturated reducing conditions are re established u vi sol incorporated in minerals or trapped in dissolution resistant evaporite mineral assemblages persists in spite of these reducing conditions the remaining dissolved colloidal and adsorbed u vi aq is reduced to u iv u iv can be newly complexed to sediment associated oc and possibly to mineral surfaces stetten et al 2018 however the elevated u vi aq concentrations in fine grained nrz also could favor neo formation of u iv bearing minerals 4 2 which are more immobile than the non crystalline phases thus further decreasing u susceptibility to being exported to groundwater we conclude that two conditions are necessary to promote u vi sol storage and mineralization after oxidation of u iv sol pools i redox oscillations and ii limited export of oxidatively mobilized u vi aq to groundwater due to evapotranspiration and or low permeability sediments fluctuating saturation combined with low sediment permeability and or evapotranspiration could contribute to long term u vi sol immobilization 5 conclusion fine grained sulfidic organic enriched sediments fine grained nrzs across the upper colorado river basin accumulate uranium originating from groundwater u vi aq plumes while previous studies have examined u behavior in permanently saturated fine grained low permeability nrzs none have looked at u speciation in fine grained low permeability nrz sediments that experience intense seasonal wet dry cycling under reducing conditions uranium accumulates retained in its reduced form u iv sol which can build up to relatively high concentrations during the oxidation stage u iv sol is oxidized to u vi sol faster than u vi aq can be transported away as u vi aq helped by low diffusion in fine grained sediments and evapotranspiration mechanisms becomes more concentrated in solution it is suspected to precipitate in solid phases that are kinetically stable against dissolution overall strong wet dry and redox cycling is required to accumulate both u iv sol and u vi sol this behavior suggests somewhat surprisingly that low permeability sulfidic zones could provide long term storage for u vi sol which has major environmental implications for floodplain water quality further research is needed to better define the key physico chemical requirements during wet dry redox cycling that promotes

19043,biogeochemical redox processes that govern radionuclide mobility in sediments are highly sensitive to forcing by the water cycle for example episodic draining and intrusion of oxidants into reduced zones during dry seasons can create biogeochemical seasonal hotspots of enhanced and changed microbial activity affect the redox status of minerals initiate changes in sediment gas and water transport and stimulate the release of organic carbon iron and sulfur by oxidation of solid reduced species to aqueous oxic species in the upper colorado river basin water saturation of organic enriched sediments locally promotes reducing conditions denoted naturally reduced zones nrzs that accumulate strongly u iv sol subsequently fluctuating hydrological conditions introduce oxidants which may reach internal portions of these sediments and reverse their role to become secondary sources of uaq knowledge of the impact of hydrological variability on the alternating import and export of contaminants including u is required to predict contaminant mobility and short and long term impacts on water quality in this study we tracked u fe and s oxidation states and speciation to characterize the variability in redox processes and related usol solubility within shallow fine grained nrzs at the legacy u ore processing site at shiprock nm previous studies have reported u speciation and behavior in permanently saturated fine grained nrz sediments this is the first report of u behavior in fine grained nrz like sediments that experience repeated redox cycling due to seasonal fluctuations in moisture content our results support previous observations that reducing conditions are needed to accumulate usol in sediments but they counter the expectation that usol predominantly accumulates as u iv sol our data reveal that usol may accumulate as u vi sol in roughly equal proportion to u iv sol surprisingly high abundances of u vi sol confined in transiently saturated fine grained nrz like sediments suggest that redox cycling is needed to promote its accumulation we propose a new process model where redox oscillations driven by annual water table fluctuations accompanied by strong evapotranspiration in low permeability sediments promote conversion of u iv sol to relatively immobile u vi sol which suggests that usol is accumulating in a form that is resistant to redox perturbations this observation contradicts the common idea that u iv sol accumulated in reducing conditions is systematically re oxidized solubilized and transported away in

al 2017b yabusaki et al 2017 few studies have experimentally investigated the mechanisms by which stored u iv sol is transformed and released from nrzs field validated process models of these interactions are needed to predict the response of groundwater contamination to fluctuating soil moisture and redox conditions floodplain sediments at ucrb sites commonly exhibit centimeter to meter thick sediment lenses with organic carbon oc contents of the solid fraction significantly higher than the sand and cobble alluvium that dominates the floodplain noël et al 2017a textural characteristics suggested that these organic enriched sediment lenses were buried riverbank soil horizons janot et al 2016 or buried river slow flowing portions or oxbow lake sediments which are common features of floodplains gurwick et al 2008 blazejewski et al 2009 once these sediments are saturated with water they can develop reducing conditions independent of their texture due to oxygen consumption from organic matter decomposition noël et al 2017a due to high sulfate concentrations in groundwater in shallow ucrb aquifers with concentrations around 250 mg l doe 2013 nrzs contain abundant sulfate reduction products such as fe sulfide minerals two main classes of nrzs have been identified in the ucrb differing in terms of particle size 1 fine grained low permeability nrzs which are enriched in the 150 μm sediment size fraction compared to surrounding sediments creating strong permeability contrasts and sharp redox gradients and 2 coarse grained high permeability nrzs exhibiting grain size distributions similar to those in under and overlying sediments leading to more dynamic exchange of oxidants with surrounding aquifers and seasonal redox cycling noël et al 2017a

that u iv adsorbs to the surfaces of particulate organic material and exhibits a molecular structure consistent with non crystalline u iv sol bernier latmani et al 2010 bone et al 2017a investigations of u iv sol in nrzs throughout the ucrb corroborate these observations noël et al 2017b and suggest that the preservation of oxidation sensitive non crystalline u iv sol pools depends on the permeability of nrzs to oxygen in low permeability organic enriched sediments u accumulates as non crystalline u iv sol as long as system is saturated if these sediments become exposed to air then we would expect that u iv sol would become oxidized and transported away however no studies have documented the impact of oscillating redox conditions caused by fluctuating water saturation on u behavior in low permeability nrzs in the field the objectives of the present study were to a characterize the redox process variability within a shallow fine grained nrz at the shiprock nm site affected by annual water table fluctuations and b evaluate usol oxidation state and chemical forms as a function of this redox variability s and fe speciation of the solid fraction were determined as proxy of the redox conditions of sediments these were then compared with the distribution of usol and uaq species our results showed that a large fraction of usol within nrzs at the shiprock site was present as u vi sol stabilization of u vi in reduced sediments has not previously been reported here we propose a new conceptual model of u recycling in alluvial nrzs under variable hydrologic conditions that explains this observation knowledge provided by this study advances our ability to predict the role of nrzs as controls over ground and surface water quality 2 material and methods 2 1 field site

process and tailings piles occupied approximately 0 93 km2 by 1986 all tailings and associated materials were encapsulated in a disposal cell built on an elevated terrace overlooking the san juan river the ponds on the adjacent floodplain which is in hydrological connection with the san juan river had been cleaned and filled by sediments however the floodplain continues to receive inflow from

table levels for wells 620 621 and 622 which are proximal to the dm02 core location are summarized in figure si 3 these data show that the water table varied between about 108 and 215 cm in depth bgs since 1985 we refer to the zone located between 0 and 108 cm the shallowest recorded level of groundwater table as the permanently unsaturated zone fig 2 a the groundwater level at the time of sample collection was measured at 110 cm bgs at the dm02 well which is close to the shallowest level registered figure si 3 the vertical distribution of total fe sulfide minerals fes and fes2 measured by linear combination fitting of s xanes along the dm02 core fig 2c shows that the permanently unsaturated zone was devoid of fe sulfide minerals conversely sediments located below the water table elevation at the time of sampling i e below 110 cm bgs contained elevated fes and fes2 this observation suggests that fe sulfide minerals are stable in these zones under saturated conditions at the time of sampling below the water table the trends in total fe sulfide minerals and oc concentrations of the solid fraction are concomitant fig 2b tables si 2 these observations are consistent with previous studies showing that abundance of fe sulfide minerals is correlated with solid fraction oc content and sediment moisture within ucrb floodplains campbell et al 2012 janot et al 2016 noël et al 2017a at the shiprock site nrzs exhibiting elevated total fe sulfide minerals and oc contents in the solid fraction fig 2a c are visually easily distinguished from the surrounding alluvium fig 1c nrzs consist of black clayey centimeter thick lenses infilling interstices created by cobbles or forming distinct layers whereas underlying sediments is composed of oblate spheroidal siliciclastic cobbles larger than 5 cm in diameter pebbles gravel and sand exhibiting a light grey color figs 1c and 2a the sharp texture contrast of sandy vs clayey is reflected in the particle size distribution fig 2b sieving confirmed an increased abundance of fine particles 150 μm from the top margin of the nrz to the interior this type of nrz was previously described at the rifle site as a fine grained nrz noël et al 2017a coarser grained underlying sediments containing in its solid fraction fe sulfide minerals and oc at lower concentration than fine grained nrzs are referred to here as the suboxic zones figs 2 and 3 because the fine grained nrzs and suboxic zones are located in the water table fluctuation area we referred to these zones as transiently saturated zones 3 2 s and fe mineral distribution the chemical forms of s and fe exhibit variability tied to redox conditions providing efficient and precise biogeochemical tracers of redox processes such as microbial sulfate reduction

fig 3b and c and tabulated in figure si 4 and si 8 respectively permanently unsaturated oxic zone 0 100 cm bgs s k edge xanes spectra of this zone show that sulfate s vi was the only oxidation state of s of the solid fraction occurring here indicating the presence of sulfate minerals and or sulfates complexed with solid fraction organic ligands fig 3b this result is supported by visual observations at the time of excavation of abundant efflorescent and solid white mineral deposits in sediments from the surface to the water table level these deposits are texturally similar to gypsum

feldspar a silicate phase poor in fe but occurring abundantly in the sediment figure si 2 to our knowledge robust mössbauer spectral parameters of albite or ottrelite have not been reported in literature preventing us from fully resolving the source of the fe doublets in our samples further as discussed later 4 3 we cannot exclude the additional presence of amorphous fe silicates which are not detectable by xrd the fe bearing phases observed here are similar to those reported for other floodplain sediments in the ucrb at rifle naturita and grand junction co noël et al 2017a these minerals were described to be mainly inherited from burial of sediments along active river margins campbell et al 2012 transiently saturated suboxic zone 132 162 cm bgs the transiently saturated suboxic zone contained the lowest total s concentrations of the core sediments here s of the solid fraction was mainly present as s vi in sulfate minerals and or organic sulfates 51 85 fig 3b however relative to total s concentration of the solid fraction s vi was 2 to 4 fold less abundant in this zone than in the permanently unsaturated oxic zone s k edge xanes spectra also showed the occurrence of variable proportions of s 0 5 14 of total s of the solid fraction s i 9 16 of total s of the solid fraction and s ii 0 32 of total s of the solid fraction indicating the presence of elemental sulfur s 0 pyrite fes2 and mackinawite fes respectively detailed in figure si 4 no s k edge peak was detected between 2473 and 2480 ev from the bulk samples of the solid fraction subsequently except for organic sulfates s organic model compounds were not considered in the lc ls fits however we cannot exclude that some reduced organic s compounds were present in the solid fraction in concentrations below detection 10 prietzel et al 2011 in spite of the fact that both mössbauer spectroscopy measurements fig 4b and the lc ls fits of fe k edge exafs provided evidence for the existence of a fraction of the total fe as pyrite 3 4 of total fe of the solid fraction and mackinawite 0 8 of total fe of the solid fraction fe sulfide minerals were below detection 10 in the fe xas data fig 3c similar to the permanently unsaturated oxic zone fe of the solid fraction in the transiently saturated suboxic zones was mainly incorporated in fe ii and fe iii bearing phyllosilicate minerals 59 62 of total fe of the solid fraction goethite 0 10 of total fe of the solid fraction hematite 10 12 of total fe of the solid fraction and magnetite 15 17 of total fe of the solid fraction transiently saturated fine grained nrz 114 122 cm bgs 172 192 cm bgs these zones exhibit lower sulfate content comprising 18 47 of total s of the solid fraction fig 3b which is consistent with much lower abundances of white evaporite minerals observed within transiently saturated fine grained nrz sediments at the time of excavation as compared to permanently unsaturated oxic and transiently saturated suboxic zone samples fe sulfide minerals fes and fes2 were the dominant forms of s in the solid fraction 39 71 of total s of the solid fraction fig 3b similarly to s the fe oxidation state decreased in the solid fraction of transiently saturated fine grained nrzs indicating increasing proportions of fe ii bearing minerals figure si 6 si 7 and si 8 the proportion of exafs detectable goethite decreased from 24 at the interface with the permanently unsaturated oxic zone 114 cm bgs to undetectable in the transiently saturated fine grained nrzs 122 cm 172 cm and 182 cm depth bgs fig 3c concomitantly fe sulfide minerals ranged from 21 to 43 fig 3c the remaining fraction of fe of the solid fraction in the transiently saturated fine grained nrzs was present as fe ii and fe iii phyllosilicate minerals 32 64 and to lesser extent as magnetite 4 14 and hematite 2 9 the mössbauer spectra of samples at 114 and 172 cm depth bgs fig 4b and c corroborate these conclusions also suggesting the presence of fe sulfide minerals indeed a higher relative contribution of the central doublet 0 1 mm s compared to the spectrum from the permanently unsaturated oxic zone sample implies that this feature is a mix of silicate fe iii and pyrite mackinawite fe ii detailed in si 5 1 further the mössbauer spectroscopy measurements confirm that the contribution of combined fe hydroxy oxides content is lower in transiently saturated fine grained nrzs than in the permanently unsaturated oxic zone sample fig 4 in the upper transiently saturated fine grained nrz sample at the interface between the permanently unsaturated oxic zone and upper transiently saturated fine grained nrz 114 cm depth bgs mössbauer spectral modeling suggests lower amounts of smaller sized compositional domain less crystalline nano goethite nano al goethite 3 than in the overlying permanently unsaturated oxic zone sediment fig 4 more importantly in the deeper transiently saturated fine grained nrz sample 172 cm depth bgs fig 4c sextet peaks for both types of less crystalline nano goethite particles nano al goethtie 2 and nano al goethite 3 are absent in addition to fe hydroxy oxides fe sulfide minerals detailed in si 5 1 and silicate fe peaks a spectral feature that could be attributed to ilmenite fetio3 was distinguished no evidence was found in the mössbauer spectrum of species normally expected under reducing conditions siderite peretyazhko et al 2013 adsorbed fe ii on the surfaces of hematite larese casanova and scherer 2007 or more globally fe ii spiked onto rifle sediment proxy of ucrb sediments fox et al 2013 3 3 fe sulfide mineral variability in transiently saturated fine grained nrzs fe sulfide minerals in the shallow transiently saturated fine grained nrz 110 125 cm bgs consisted mostly of pyrite in contrast fe sulfide minerals in the deeper transiently saturated fine grained nrz 172 200 cm bgs contained abundant mackinawite moreover fe sulfide minerals transition from mostly pyrite in the shallower portion deeper of the transiently saturated fine grained nrz 172 cm bgs to dominantly mackinawite at 182 cm depth bgs and below elemental sulfur decreased in abundance as mackinawite increased fig 3b and si 4 this change in fe sulfide mineralogy is also reflected in the fe speciation detailed in si mössbauer and fe xas data from the samples collected at 114 and 172 cm depth bgs shallowest suggested the presence of pyrite and mackinawite without precipitation of greigite fe3s4 noël et al 2017a conversely the lc ls fitting of the 182 cm and 192 cm deeper transiently saturated fine grained nrz samples did not indicate any detectable pyrite and the best fits for the 182 cm sample were obtained by including both mackinawite 18 and greigite 12 moreover the greigite component significantly improved the quality of the lc ls fits estimated by an r factor parameter rf of the following form rf χexp χcalc 2 χexp 2 by 22 3 4 vertical distribution and oxidation state of usol the trend in sediment concentrations of total usol was similar to that of fe sulfide minerals fig 2c and d total usol concentrations increased from an average low concentration of 6 2 μg g in the permanently unsaturated oxic zone up to 202 μg g in the upper transiently saturated fine grained nrz 122 cm bgs and an average maximum of 245 6 μg g in the deeper transiently saturated fine grained nrz between 172 and 182 cm bgs sediments from the transiently saturated suboxic zone exhibited an intermediate average total usol concentration of 34 8 μg g 132 162 cm bgs and 197 240 cm bgs fig 2d tables si 2 in contrast to results from previous studies of nrzs campbell et al 2012 janot et al 2016 noël et al 2017b stetten et al 2018 the u liii edge xanes spectra of the transiently saturated fine grained nrz samples from shiprock indicated that significant concentrations of u vi sol fig 2d and si 9 table 1 and si 4 the proportion of u iv sol was systematically elevated in the transiently saturated fine grained nrz samples with u iv sol concentrations reaching up to 132 and 196 μg g at 122 and 182 cm depth bgs respectively fig 2d nevertheless u vi sol proportions in transiently saturated suboxic zone and fine grained nrz sediments ranged from 14 10 to 58 10 of total usol i e between 19 and 62 μg g in comparison total usol concentrations in permanently unsaturated oxic zone sediments were much lower between 0 and 11 μg g table 1 and si 4 3 5 u iv sol and vi sol extractions variability and distribution of non crystalline and residual u iv sol and vi sol oxygen free milli q water was used to extract weakly associated u iv sol and vi sol whereas oxygen free 1 0 m bicarbonate extractions were used to estimate the concentration of strongly sorbed complexes including both u iv sol and u vi sol adsorbed on mineral surfaces and organic matter elias et al 2003 zhou and gu 2005 alessi et al 2012 any u iv sol and u vi sol not extracted by these two techniques was assigned as residual previously this pool has been referred to as crystalline alessi et al 2012 however we suspect that some white evaporite minerals were still present after water and bicarbonate extraction this observation suggests that a portion of the residual u vi sol could be sorbed complexed with minerals trapped in the dissolution resistant evaporite assemblages observed at the time of excavation see 3 2 subsequently we use residual u iv sol and u vi sol to include u iv and u vi bearing minerals both crystalline minerals and amorphous mineraloids but also u vi sol sorbed complexed in the dissolution resistant evaporite assemblages not solubilized by oxygen free water and 1 0 m bicarbonate extractions oxygen free water and bicarbonate extractable u iv sol and u vi sol can be considered available non crystalline u iv sol and u vi sol the residual pool comprised between 24 and 63 of total usol according to the lc ls fitting of u liii edge xanes data for samples collected at 122 and 182 cm depth bgs this pool contained both u iv sol and u vi sol figure si 9 to estimate the proportion of residual u iv sol we used an additional step of the 1 0 m bicarbonate extractions in oxic conditions this step was performed sequentially after the oxygen free 1 0 m bicarbonate extraction we assumed that u iv sol from minerals such as uraninite would be oxidized under oxic conditions to avoid adsorption of oxidized u released in this step the extraction was performed in the presence of oxygenated 1 0 m bicarbonate solution however we cannot exclude the possibility that some u vi sol incorporated in the structure of redox sensitive minerals was released during extraction or that some residual u iv sol remained in the solid phase after the extraction further work is therefore needed to refine this chemical extraction step oxygen free vs oxygenated 1 0 m bicarbonate extraction and confirm that it targets the entire residual u iv sol pool and only this pool the results of the chemical extractions of u iv sol and u vi sol from transiently saturated suboxic and fine grained nrz sediments are shown in figs 3c and 5 3 6 total uaq concentration groundwater vs pore water groundwater samples were collected by doe legacy management from wells 620 621 and 622 between 1985 and 2017 fig 1c groundwater flow vectors computed before during and after peak runoff in the river between may and july 2011 suggest that these three wells are located immediately downgradient of transiently saturated fine grained nrzs regardless of seasonal water table variations m kautsky personal communication fig 1b total uaq concentrations i e u iv aq and u vi aq in the groundwater of wells 620 622 decreased over the 30 past years from an average of 2 11 mg l to 0 45 mg l fig 1d total uaq concentrations 0 49 mg l measured in water in trench 03 close to the location of the dm02 core was chosen as a proxy for total uaq concentration in groundwater near the dm02 transiently saturated fine grained nrzs this concentration is the same order of magnitude of uaq concentrations as the current total uaq concentrations of wells 620 622 in contrast the total uaq concentrations of pore water from the transiently saturated fine grained nrzs within the dm02 core at the time of sampling april 2015 ranged between 1 46 and 9 46 mg l which are 29 to 192 fold higher than groundwater from trench 03 and 620 622 wells at this time fig 1d tables si 2 this observation indicates that chemical hydrological processes operating in the transiently saturated fine grained nrz act to produce elevated uaq concentrations 4 discussion 4 1 stability of mackinawite and non crystalline u iv sol our mössbauer data suggest that short range ordered nano goethites composed of smaller sized compositional domain lower crystallinity nano al goethite 2 and nano al goethite 3 are unstable under anoxic conditions conversely larger sized compositional domain higher crystallinity nano goethites nano al goethite 1 large particle magnetite 50 nm and hematite 15 nm appear to be kinetically stable under reducing conditions fig 4 and fig si 5 this implies that smaller sized compositional domain nano goethites are more readily bio available than the larger particle fe hydroxy oxides kukkadapu et al 2001 ekstrom et al 2010 chen et al 2017 and the decrease of their proportion concomitant with the apparition of fe sulfide minerals suggests that these smaller sized compositional domain nano goethites are susceptible to reductive dissolution kumar et al 2018 reductive dissolution of fe hydroxy oxides and precipitation of fe sulfide minerals occurs when biogenic h2s produced by microbial sulfate respiration rickard 1975 druhan et al 2014 reacts with fe hydroxy oxides to produce elemental sulfur and nano crystalline mackinawite morin et al 2017 alternatively metal reducing heterotrophic bacteria can also directly reduce fe iii coupled to oxidation of oc nielsen and andersen 2003 canfield et al 2005 the produced fe ii then reacts with h2s to precipitate fes as mackinawite rickard and luther 2007 thus the oc microbial decomposition of saturated sediments ultimately facilitates microbial reduction of sulfate and iron which promotes fe hydroxy oxides reductive dissolution and enhances the precipitation of fe sulfide minerals interestingly the presence of organic matter has been proposed to favor fes and pyrite formation wind and conrad 1997 which could help to explain why that fe sulfide mineral abundance is directly correlated to solid fraction oc content in transiently saturated zones fig 2c here the distribution and mineralogy of fe sulfide minerals is used as biogeochemical tracer to predict the ability of sediments to preserve oxidation sensitive minerals within transiently saturated suboxic zones the highest proportion of fe sulfide minerals in the transiently saturated suboxic zones was concomitant with the highest solid fraction oc content at 152 cm bgs fig 2c consistent with idea that microbial consumption of oc creates conditions favorable for accumulation fe sulfide minerals these zones also exhibited the highest proportion of oxidation sensitive mackinawite suggesting that variability in oc content could control the distribution of mackinawite plausibly due to increased microbial oxygen consumption rates keiluweit et al 2015 2016 depending on solid fraction oc composition and limitation of diffusion into sediment keiluweit et al 2017 the availability of dissolved oc can protect mackinawite but also u iv sol from oxidation bi and hayes 2014 carpenter et al 2015 paradis et al 2016 bone et al 2017b within transiently saturated fine grained nrzs at increased depth 172 182 cm bgs we observed a shift in fe sulfide mineralogy in favor of mackinawite over pyrite fig 3b and c and elemental sulfur mackinawite metastable is widely regarded as precursors to thermodynamically favored pyrite eqs 1 and 2 rickard and luther 2007 burton et al 2011 furthermore mackinawite is also highly susceptible to being oxidized in the presence of o2 bearing solutions at near neutral ph eq 3 burton et al 2009 producing elemental sulfur rickard and luther 2007 1 fes sn 2 fes2 s n 1 2 2 fes h2s fes2 h2 3 fes 0 75 o2 0 5 h2o s0 feooh therefore high abundances of mackinawite combined with the absence of pyrite and low abundance of elemental sulfur suggest that mackinawite is more kinetically stable and oxidizes much more slowly below 172 cm bgs this observation specifically from eq 3 suggests that transiently saturated fine grained nrz sediments below 172 cm bgs are less frequently exposed to o2 than those above this elevation noël et al 2017a the solid fraction oc concentration and sediment texture did not change significantly from 172 to 182 cm depth bgs consequently these parameters cannot explain the variability of mackinawite abundance below 172 cm depth instead we assume that preservation of mackinawite is a result of less frequent wet dry cycling with the deepest portion of the fluctuating groundwater zone being infrequently drained figure si 3 and therefore exhibiting the most continuously sustained anoxia within transiently saturated suboxic and fine grained nrz sediments the abundance of available non crystalline u iv sol and u vi sol oxygen free water extractable and oxygen free bicarbonate extractable u iv sol and u vi sol species correlates well with the proportion of mackinawite and likely greigite normalized to total fe sulfide minerals fig 5 these results corroborate the conclusions of noël et al 2017b which concluded that accumulation of sorbed u iv sol is most effective under conditions of sustained anoxia and can be predicted based on the relative abundance of mackinawite these results suggest that non crystalline u iv sol proposed to be mainly complexed to sediment associated oc and possibly to mineral surfaces fletcher et al 2010 alessi et al 2014 stetten et al 2018 should be most abundant below 172 cm depth 4 2 contribution of u iv bearing mineral under reduced conditions bone et al 2017a and mikutta et al 2016 showed that the precipitation of u iv bearing minerals e g uraninite uo2 is thermodynamically inhibited when natural organic matter functional groups are available and u vi aq concentrations to be reduced are low 2 38 mg l at higher u vi aq concentrations between 2 38 and 11 90 mg l u vi aq converted to u iv lead to uo2 precipitation in most permanently saturated nrzs that we have observed total uaq concentrations 2 mg l noël et al 2017b are significantly below the threshold concentrations needed to precipitate u iv bearing mineral in contrast total uaq concentrations in dm02 transiently saturated fine grained nrz pore water ranged from 1 45 to 9 46 mg l fig 1d at these concentrations it is plausible that a part of u vi aq can precipitate as uo2 during reducing conditions back this conclusion is supported by our chemical extractions which reveal the presence of a residual u iv sol phase 4 3 evidence for redox resistant u vi sol accumulation our findings show that u can accumulate in transiently saturated fine grained nrzs as u vi sol at roughly equal proportion to u iv sol with u vi sol concentrations up to 69 μg g estimated in this study fig 2d table 1 and table si 4 the accumulation of residual u vi sol in transiently saturated fine grained nrzs fig 3d suggests that a part of u vi sol could be either i a newly formed u vi bearing mineral and or ii u vi sol physically trapped inside of dissolution resistant evaporite mineral assemblages the resistance of u vi sol to reducing conditions fig 2d also corroborates the idea that a significant part of u vi sol is not easily bio available to reduction i precipitation of u vi bearing minerals pore water compositions were used to calculate u vi sol phase saturation indices using phreeqc 3 4 0 charlton and parkhurst 2011 with the minteq database modified for uranyl mineral ksp s from gorman lewis et al 2008 total uaq concentration was assumed to be dominated by u vi aq the calculation shows that several uranyl silicates should have been oversaturated including uranophane ca uo2 2 sio3oh 2 5h2o logksp 9 42 log q k 3 4 5 4 na boltwoodite na uo2 sio3oh h2o 1 5 logksp 5 86 log q k 0 8 2 1 and na weeksite na2 uo2 2 si2o5 3 h2o 4 ksp 1 5 log q k 2 7 5 7 uranyl silicates such as uranophane and na bolwoodite were previously proposed to control the solubility of u vi in contaminated unsaturated zone sediments at the us department of energy hanford site liu et al 2004 catalano et al 2004 thermodynamic calculations in transiently saturated sediments at the us department of energy riverton floodplain site indicated that soddyite uo2 2 sio4 2 h2o and other uranyl silicates would become saturated during the evaporation process dam et al 2015 moreover silica species are expected to precipitate from si rich solutions due to evaporation in soils and exposed sediments chadwick et al 1986 which could be the case for the shallow evaporite enriched sediments at shiprock exhibiting high si concentrations in pore water 64 172 mg l tables si 2 if so then usol could be incorporated into amorphous silica likely in association with fe hydroxy oxides massey et al 2014 it is interesting to speculate that u vi sol could be associated with in situ precipitation of amorphous fe silica because fe is strongly remobilized during redox cycling and mössbauer analyses detected the presence of fe silica however the fe silica detected by mössbauer spectroscopy was most likely ottrelite and albite detailed in 3 2 which we suspect to be inherited from burial of sediments along active river margins and not precipitated during redox cycling which suggests they are not likely u vi hosts as soils dry calcite precipitates rapidly in an ionic diffusion controlled reaction while monosolicic acid which requires greater activation energy for si o bond breakage prior to precipitation is concentrated in the solution phase chadwick et al 1986 thus carbonate could precipitate during evaporation tables si 2 and trap uranyl from pore waters carlisle 1978 indeed thermodynamic calculation using uranyl carbonate ksp s calculated from gibbs free energy of formation gorman lewis et al 2008 suggests that shiprock pore waters were oversaturated for uranyl carbonate minerals including andersonite na2ca uo2 co3 3 h2o 6 logksp 38 alwan and williams 1980 log q k 2 3 3 3 consequently it is energetically likely that the reduction resistant u vi sol observed in shiprock transiently saturated fine grained nrzs is contained in evaporate minerals depending on the favorability of hydrological conditions to facilitate evaporite formation ii trapping u vi into dissolution resistant evaporite mineral assemblages due to a combination of high dissolved sulfate concentrations in the groundwater around 250 mg l doe 2013 and high capillary rise due to evapotranspiration dam et al 2015 doe 2016a b evaporite minerals can precipitate from the surface to deep sediments and have been proposed to partially control u mobility in these environments dam et al 2015 evaporite mineral assemblages were observed at the time of excavation within transiently saturated fine grained nrz sediments that were saturated in water see 3 2 indicating that they are resistant to the dissolution and thus likely carbonates indeed recent laboratory experiments by our group show that the groundwater lead quickly to supersaturation of sulfate due to natural high concentration of dissolved sulfate subsequently inhibiting total dissolution of evaporites unpublished data thus we propose that a part of u vi sol could be trapped inside of such evaporite mineral assemblages resistant to dissolution physically protecting u vi sol from reduction and oxygen free water and 1 0 m bicarbonate extractions 4 4 role of wet dry redox cycling on u vi sol accumulation the low permeability of fine grained nrzs together with high sorptive capacity from abundant organic ligands and clays limits the diffusion of u vi aq from the aquifer and increases its interaction with solid interfaces microorganisms and slow chemical reactions such as evaporate precipitation inside the fine grained nrzs when nrzs are water saturated intense reducing conditions enable the reduction of u vi to u iv which decreases the proportion of u vi associated with solids lovley et al 1991 1992 liger et al 1999 senko et al 2002 o loughlin et al 2003 behrends and van cappellen 2005 jeon et al 2005 wall and krumholz 2006 abdelouas 2006 chakraborty et al 2010 boland et al 2011 hyun et al 2012 veeramani et al 2013 moreover u vi sol phases have not previously been reported in permanently saturated nrzs of similar mineralogical and chemical composition campbell et al 2012 noël et al 2017b consequently we exclude the possibility that u vi sol could be protected from reducing conditions by sorption complexation mineral and organic surfaces the sorptive capacity of fine grained sediments alone cannot explain u vi sol accumulation as high as 69 μg g instead we propose the abundances of u vi sol in the transiently saturated fine grained nrz sediments at shiprock site must be attributed to wet dry redox cycling non crystalline u iv sol pools accumulated under reducing conditions are relatively susceptible to rapid oxidative mobilization during water table fluctuations 4 1 which could locally release u vi aq to pore water a portion of the u iv aq may also be remobilized in its reduced form such as in u iv colloids wang et al 2013 nrz pore water total uaq concentrations were elevated compared to the surrounding aquifer by 30 200x fig 1d which could indicate that oxic geochemical conditions in transiently saturated fine grained nrzs significantly re solubilize u but with limited export from the fine grained nrz pore waters to groundwater thus we conclude that under the diffusion limited conditions that prevail in transiently saturated fine grained nrzs released u vi aq and to lesser extend as likely u iv aq may accumulate to relatively high concentrations in pore waters bone et al 2017b evapotranspiration driven water loss from shallow unsaturated sediments yabusaki et al 2017 may also contribute to concentrating u vi aq in transiently saturated fine grained nrz pore waters consequently we propose that within the transiently saturated fine grained nrzs at shiprock and similar fine grained environments the combination of strong evapotranspiration and low permeability promotes a hyper accumulation of u vi aq during oxidation of u iv sol these u vi enriched microenvironments can then facilitate u vi accumulation in the solid phase through several mechanisms including i adsorption complexation of u vi on surfaces of for example nano particle al substituted goethite nano goethite ferrihydrite fig 4 dublet et al 2017 organic matter fig 2c stetten et al 2018 and phyllosilicate clays ii association with evaporite mineral assemblages resistant to dissolution 4 3 and iii precipitation of u vi uranyl mineral 4 3 4 5 a new process model for u iv sol and u vi sol accumulation in nrz sediments based on the results of this study we propose a new process model where each draining cycle leads to successive conversion of oxidation sensitive u iv sol pools to u vi sol some of which is incorporated into redox resistant u vi sol pools schematically illustrated in graphical abstract step 1 in water saturated conditions graphical abstract left part anoxia prevails and creates conditions that promote the conversion of u vi aq to u iv which predominantly accumulates as non crystalline u iv sol 4 1 step 2 when fine grained nrz sediments are partially desaturated graphical abstract right part incursion of o2 promotes the oxidative dissolution of non crystalline u iv sol to u vi aq the constraints generated by evapotranspiration and low permeability sediments limit the export of u vi aq to groundwater resulting in u vi aq accumulation step 3 u vi aq sorbs on minerals and organics associated precipitated in evaporite mineral assemblages and possibly precipitates as uranyl minerals 4 3 step 4 once sediments are seasonally re saturated reducing conditions are re established u vi sol incorporated in minerals or trapped in dissolution resistant evaporite mineral assemblages persists in spite of these reducing conditions the remaining dissolved colloidal and adsorbed u vi aq is reduced to u iv u iv can be newly complexed to sediment associated oc and possibly to mineral surfaces stetten et al 2018 however the elevated u vi aq concentrations in fine grained nrz also could favor neo formation of u iv bearing minerals 4 2 which are more immobile than the non crystalline phases thus further decreasing u susceptibility to being exported to groundwater we conclude that two conditions are necessary to promote u vi sol storage and mineralization after oxidation of u iv sol pools i redox oscillations and ii limited export of oxidatively mobilized u vi aq to groundwater due to evapotranspiration and or low permeability sediments fluctuating saturation combined with low sediment permeability and or evapotranspiration could contribute to long term u vi sol immobilization 5 conclusion fine grained sulfidic organic enriched sediments fine grained nrzs across the upper colorado river basin accumulate uranium originating from groundwater u vi aq plumes while previous studies have examined u behavior in permanently saturated fine grained low permeability nrzs none have looked at u speciation in fine grained low permeability nrz sediments that experience intense seasonal wet dry cycling under reducing conditions uranium accumulates retained in its reduced form u iv sol which can build up to relatively high concentrations during the oxidation stage u iv sol is oxidized to u vi sol faster than u vi aq can be transported away as u vi aq helped by low diffusion in fine grained sediments and evapotranspiration mechanisms becomes more concentrated in solution it is suspected to precipitate in solid phases that are kinetically stable against dissolution overall strong wet dry and redox cycling is required to accumulate both u iv sol and u vi sol this behavior suggests somewhat surprisingly that low permeability sulfidic zones could provide long term storage for u vi sol which has major environmental implications for floodplain water quality further research is needed to better define the key physico chemical requirements during wet dry redox cycling that promotes

19044,viruses are thought to control bacterial abundance affect community composition and influence ecosystem function in natural environments yet their dynamics have seldom been studied in engineered systems or indeed in any system for long periods of time we measured virus abundance in a full scale activated sludge plant every week for two years total bacteria and ammonia oxidising bacteria aob abundances bacterial community profiles and a suite of environmental and operational parameters were also monitored mixed liquor virus abundance fluctuated over an order of magnitude 3 18 108 3 41 109 virus s ml 1 and that variation was statistically significantly associated with total bacterial and aob abundance community composition and effluent concentrations of cod and nh4 n and thus system function this suggests viruses play a far more important role in the dynamics of activated sludge systems than previously realised and could be one of the key factors controlling bacterial abundance community structure and functional stability and may cause reactors to fail these findings are based on statistical associations not mechanistic models nevertheless viral associations with abiotic factors such as ph make physical sense giving credence to these findings and highlighting the role that physical factors play in virus ecology further work is needed to identify and quantify specific bacteriophage and their hosts to enable us to develop mechanistic models of the ecology of viruses in wastewater treatment systems however since we have shown that viruses can be related to effluent quality and virus quantification is simple and cheap practitioners would probably benefit from quantifying viruses now graphical abstract image 1 keywords viruses activated sludge wastewater treatment

dynamics have been largely overlooked the absence of methods to link viruses to their hosts and couple their abundances dang and sullivan 2014 brum and sullivan 2015 is undoubtedly a contributing factor however even total abundance methods which sparked a transformation in virus ecology in the 1980s bergh et al 1989 and 1990s hara et al 1991 marie et al 1999 have only found limited application in activated sludge systems being used to compare different activated sludge plants wu and liu 2009 brown et al 2015 or across very modest time scales otawa et al 2007 this is in contrast to the

and freshwater environments e g hennes and simon 1995 hofer and sommaruga 2001 bettarel et al 2004 and jacquet et al 2005 although even here the spatial and temporal scale of such studies are typically modest a consequence of limited ship time and other logistical constraints thus multiyear studies at functionally relevant temporal scales and which incorporate time varying exogenous factors have recently been called for in viral ecology breitbart 2012 brum and sullivan 2015 wigington et al 2016 to this end we used a recently adapted flow cytometry fcm method brown et al 2015 to measure virus abundance weekly for two years in a full scale nitrifying activated sludge plant the sampling frequency and duration was considered logistically feasible and biologically and functionally relevant considering nitrifying activated sludge systems maintain solid retention times srt 7 days the average period of time biomass remains within a system tchobanoglous et al 2003 the relationship between virus abundance and the dynamics of total and ammonia oxidising bacteria aob as well as community structure was evaluated and the influence of exogenous factors environmental and operational parameters was also examined the role of viruses in the microbial ecology and performance removal of cod and nh4 n of activated sludge systems was established 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection mixed liquor ml grab samples were collected from the aeration basin 3600 m3 of a conventional nitrifying domestic wastewater treatment plant wwtp 6751 m3 day 1 situated in the north east of england united kingdom on a weekly basis for a period of two years from june 2011 to may 2013 104 weeks samples were collected in 50 ml polypropylene containers and transported to the lab on ice for immediate processing concurrent primary settled sewage influent and effluent samples were also collected in addition to a number of operational variables 2 2 analytical methods for all samples influent ml and effluent suspended volatile suspended solids ss vss soluble chemical oxygen demand cods and soluble ammonium nh4 n were determined according to standard methods apha 1998 and using merck cod and nh4 n test kits vwr uk respectively anion concentrations including nitrate nitrite sulphate and phosphate were determined using high performance ion chromatography dionex ics 1000 with

plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes vista mpx axial icp oes varian uk as described by martin et al 1994 samples were acidified on collection to ph 2 digested and then filtered through a 0 45

determined using a parshall flume and sludge age was obtained from plant operators 2 3 molecular methods 2 3 1 flow cytometry for virus enumeration 1 ml sub samples of influent ml and effluent were taken transferred into 2 ml cryovials and fixed at a final concentration of 0 5 glutaraldehyde for 15 30 min at 4 c in the dark samples were then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c after defrosting samples were pre treated and analysed in triplicate as described by brown et al 2015 using a facscan flow cytometer becton dickinson usa equipped with a 15 mw 488 nm air cooled argon ion laser and a standard filter setup using this fcm method not all events detected are necessarily viruses membrane derived vesicles and gene transfer agents non virus particles could simultaneously be detected and quantified forterre et al 2013 biller et al 2017 hence the term virus like particle vlp being coined and used within marine viral ecology however in an earlier study brown et al 2015 regression analysis of fcm and transmission electron microscopy virus counts yielded a highly significant positive correlation coefficient p 0 05 a high coefficient of determination r 2 0 77 and an intercept and slope coefficient statistically indistinguishable from 0 and 1 not explicitly stated in brown et al 2015 respectively thus robust statistical evidence that non virus particles affect fcm virus counts in activated sludge is lacking indeed biller et al 2017 concluded that non virus particles are unlikely to systematically inflate measurements to a notable degree it is however conceivable given the r 2 of 0 77 in brown et al 2015 that non virus like particles contribute to random measurement error thus in the absence of a systematic measurement error we have elected to use the simpler term virus over vlp 2 3 2 dna extraction dna was extracted from 250 μl of ml and from 15 ml of influent the latter being centrifuged at 3392 g for 15 min and the supernatant removed down

poorer fig 2 fig s5 a and s6 a the models explained only 53 and 47 of the variation in the bacterial and aob abundances respectively however mixed liquor virus abundances had strong positive

variables significantly contributing to each model are summarised in the supplementary information 3 4 virus interactions with bacteria community structure the cca ordination accounted for the

significant associations were found between mixed liquor aob bacteria abundance and mixed liquor and effluent nh4 n cod concentrations and virus abundance fig 6 the only exception being the negative association found between mixed liquor aob and effluent virus abundance p 0 01 fig 6 a overall the sem analysis was able to explain 28 and 12 of effluent nh4 n and cod concentrations respectively 4 discussion this work provides evidence that viruses play an important role in the ecology and function of activated sludge plants the statistical associations imply they interact with the abundance and dynamics of key bacterial groups to such an extent that community function and therefore effluent quality is affected it seems plausible that viruses could cause outright failure either directly affecting key functional groups or indirectly by influencing filamentous bacteria and thus foaming and bulking such a prominent role for bacteriophage is consistent with the high virus to bacteria ratio we observed evidence from other engineered systems hantula et al 1991 lee et al 2007 barr et al 2010 shapiro et al 2010 and knowledge of their role in the ecology of marine and freshwater environments suttle 2007 rohwer and thurber 2009 breitbart 2012 where viruses are thought to kill 50 of bacteria every day noble and fuhrman 2000 ram et al 2013 and therefore influence nutrient cycling and community function inferring the role of viruses in the environment is however problematic we are only able to quantify total virus numbers and the abundance or proportional abundance of relatively broad bacterial groups moreover the virus community will comprise numerous species strains breitbart et al 2007 each with varying host ranges khan et al 2002a 2002b and most will likely be in unsynchronised predator prey cycles with their hosts in addition the relationship between phage and host may be non linear and lagged thus in the absence of more detailed measurements of viruses and their hosts we utilised multiple statistical approaches to identify significant relationships between total virus numbers and various measures of biomass community structure and function this is a crude and probably insensitive approach however if we can find significant relationships with relatively weak tests this does imply that viruses play a very strong role in this system likewise though the underlying basis of the observed correlations is uncertain and could be indirect they could provide the impetus for the more detailed and challenging work required to obtain a mechanistic understanding of how bacteriophage affect engineered biological systems all four lines of enquiry we used suggested a role for viruses regression and structural equation modelling to determine an impact on biomass and function effluent quality and cca and local similarity analysis to evaluate the effect of viruses on community structure a detailed consideration of every statistically significant relationship would be tedious and speculative nevertheless some commentary is warranted viruses emerged as having a significant and positive correlation with the variation in bacterial and aob biomass over time more biomass prey meant more viruses predator which is plausible in individual predator prey cycle s the predator lags the prey but will still be positively correlated it would appear that when many such cycles are aggregated this correlation is still detectable the overall fit of the regression models were modest and the mechanistic basis for many of the other statistically significant variables is not immediately apparent however some have an obvious physical basis that lends credence to the exercise for example ph and the divalent cation magnesium were associated with virus numbers both regulate surface charge and electrostatic interactions and would cause viruses to adsorb desorb from the biomass and so decrease increase their abundance michen and graule 2010 nap et al 2014 likewise viruses in the mixed liquor were influenced by viruses in the influent despite the latter constituting only a small fraction of the former the difference between the number of viruses in the influent and the mixed liquor can only be accounted for by the lysis of biomass in the mixed liquor yet though the time series of mixed liquor virus abundance could be modelled quite well there was no statistical relationship between the number of viruses and the amount of bacterial biomass this reinforces the limitations of a purely statistical approach in principle if viruses affect mixed liquor aob and bacterial biomass this in turn should affect the effluent cod and ammonia concentration and so the system s function the structural equation modelling was an attempt to show this chain of causality it partially succeeded though it is clear that viruses affected the effluent concentrations directly and indirectly it was not possible to demonstrate that they did this through a linear effect on bacterial concentrations however predation remains the most plausible mechanism by which viruses could affect effluent quality indeed key functional groups are known to have signatures of viral infection prophages and crispr sequences in their genomes kunin et al 2008 choi et al 2010 motlagh et al 2015 viruses appear to have an important possibly very important role in community structure being the third most important factor in the canonical correspondence analysis cca after temperature and potassium the importance of temperature is well established and to some extent obvious wells et al 2009 2011 as is the significance of potassium which constitute about 1 of cell biomass e g brdjanovic et al 1996 and barat et al 2005 it follows that the prominent role of viruses is credible though largely ignored in both research and practice and poorly understood in detail unfortunately though a cca can tell us what is important it cannot tell us why some preliminary insights can be garnered from the local similarity analysis of individual taxonomic groups significant associations were found between viruses and some of the most abundant taxa which is consistent with the killing the winner hypothesis ktw thingstad 2000 winter et al 2010 however given viruses of the most abundant taxa should constitute the bulk of the virus count such relationships are perhaps expected thus it is in some ways more remarkable that total viruses were seen to correlate with microthrix thiothrix and tetrasphaera genera problematic blooming filamentous bacteria blackall et al 1996 martins et al 2004 guo and zhang 2012 that cause foaming and bulking and whose abundance is a matter of great interest and importance to practitioners a more prosaic explanation could be that some deterministic factor for example ph could be affecting both viruses and these problematic bacteria leading to spurious correlations however our observations are consistent with findings elsewhere kotay et al 2011 petrovski et al 2012 khairnar et al 2014 liu et al 2015b the time lag in some of the relationships we observe probably reflect the asynchrony in the underlying dynamics 5 conclusion we conclude that this paper provides plausible evidence that bacteriophage are key players in the ecology of activated sludge affecting not only the dynamics of the biomass and the community structure but the function of the system carbon and ammonia removal we posit that bacteriophages cause failure either directly through effluent concentrations or indirectly through their interactions with filamentous organisms there seems no reason why this finding will not extend to other functions especially p removal and all other biological treatment systems we caution that all findings are based on statistical associations and their basis is not yet certain clearly deeper mechanistic research is needed to determine the detailed species specific mechanisms this endeavour will be strengthened by the ongoing revolution in viral metagenomics and single cell analysis dang and sullivan 2014 brum and sullivan 2015 however practitioners need not wait for this detailed work to be undertaken the quantification of bacteriophage is cheap and simple using flow cytometry and total virus counts can as we have shown be empirically related to plant performance we would suggest that operators

19044,viruses are thought to control bacterial abundance affect community composition and influence ecosystem function in natural environments yet their dynamics have seldom been studied in engineered systems or indeed in any system for long periods of time we measured virus abundance in a full scale activated sludge plant every week for two years total bacteria and ammonia oxidising bacteria aob abundances bacterial community profiles and a suite of environmental and operational parameters were also monitored mixed liquor virus abundance fluctuated over an order of magnitude 3 18 108 3 41 109 virus s ml 1 and that variation was statistically significantly associated with total bacterial and aob abundance community composition and effluent concentrations of cod and nh4 n and thus system function this suggests viruses play a far more important role in the dynamics of activated sludge systems than previously realised and could be one of the key factors controlling bacterial abundance community structure and functional stability and may cause reactors to fail these findings are based on statistical associations not mechanistic models nevertheless viral associations with abiotic factors such as ph make physical sense giving credence to these findings and highlighting the role that physical factors play in virus ecology further work is needed to identify and quantify specific bacteriophage and their hosts to enable us to develop mechanistic models of the ecology of viruses in wastewater treatment systems however since we have shown that viruses can be related to effluent quality and virus quantification is simple and cheap practitioners would probably benefit from quantifying viruses now graphical abstract image 1 keywords viruses activated sludge wastewater treatment

2009 winter et al 2010 breitbart 2012 liu et al 2015a yet their dynamics have seldom been monitored in activated sludge or indeed any other engineered microbial ecosystem recent advances in molecular

seen in the microbial composition and performance of such systems ofiteru et al 2010 given the prominent role of viruses in the microbial ecology of natural environments viral infection could be

dynamics have been largely overlooked the absence of methods to link viruses to their hosts and couple their abundances dang and sullivan 2014 brum and sullivan 2015 is undoubtedly a contributing factor however even total abundance methods which sparked a transformation in virus ecology in the 1980s bergh et al 1989 and 1990s hara et al 1991 marie et al 1999 have only found limited application in activated sludge systems being used to compare different activated sludge plants wu and liu 2009 brown et al 2015 or across very modest time scales otawa et al 2007 this is in contrast to the

and freshwater environments e g hennes and simon 1995 hofer and sommaruga 2001 bettarel et al 2004 and jacquet et al 2005 although even here the spatial and temporal scale of such studies are typically modest a consequence of limited ship time and other logistical constraints thus multiyear studies at functionally relevant temporal scales and which incorporate time varying exogenous factors have recently been called for in viral ecology breitbart 2012 brum and sullivan 2015 wigington et al 2016 to this end we used a recently adapted flow cytometry fcm method brown et al 2015 to measure virus abundance weekly for two years in a full scale nitrifying activated sludge plant the sampling frequency and duration was considered logistically feasible and biologically and functionally relevant considering nitrifying activated sludge systems maintain solid retention times srt 7 days the average period of time biomass remains within a system tchobanoglous et al 2003 the relationship between virus abundance and the dynamics of total and ammonia oxidising bacteria aob as well as community structure was evaluated and the influence of exogenous factors environmental and operational parameters was also examined the role of viruses in the microbial ecology and performance removal of cod and nh4 n of activated sludge systems was established 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection mixed liquor ml grab samples were collected from the aeration basin 3600 m3 of a conventional nitrifying domestic wastewater treatment plant wwtp 6751 m3 day 1 situated in the north east of england united kingdom on a weekly basis for a period of two years from june 2011 to may 2013 104 weeks samples were collected in 50 ml polypropylene containers and transported to the lab on ice for immediate processing concurrent primary settled sewage influent and effluent samples were also collected in addition to a number of operational variables 2 2 analytical methods for all samples influent ml and effluent suspended volatile suspended solids ss vss soluble chemical oxygen demand cods and soluble ammonium nh4 n were determined according to standard methods apha 1998 and using merck cod and nh4 n test kits vwr uk respectively anion concentrations including nitrate nitrite sulphate and phosphate were determined using high performance ion chromatography dionex ics 1000 with as40 auto sampler samples were filtered through a 0 2 μm polyethersulfone membrane prior to analysis influent trace metals including cadmium zinc lead and copper were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes vista mpx axial icp oes varian uk as described by martin et al 1994 samples were acidified on collection to ph 2 digested and then filtered through a 0 45

determined using a parshall flume and sludge age was obtained from plant operators 2 3 molecular methods 2 3 1 flow cytometry for virus enumeration 1 ml sub samples of influent ml and effluent were taken transferred into 2 ml cryovials and fixed at a final concentration of 0 5 glutaraldehyde for 15 30 min at 4 c in the dark samples were then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c after defrosting samples were pre treated and analysed in triplicate as described by brown et al 2015 using a facscan flow cytometer becton dickinson usa equipped with a 15 mw 488 nm air cooled argon ion laser and a standard filter setup using this fcm method not all events detected are necessarily viruses membrane derived vesicles and gene transfer agents non virus particles could simultaneously be detected and quantified forterre et al 2013 biller et al 2017 hence the term virus like particle vlp being coined and used within marine viral ecology however in an earlier study brown et al 2015 regression analysis of fcm and transmission electron microscopy virus counts yielded a highly significant positive correlation coefficient p 0 05 a high coefficient of determination r 2 0 77 and an intercept and slope coefficient statistically indistinguishable from 0 and 1 not explicitly stated in brown et al 2015 respectively thus robust statistical evidence that non virus particles affect fcm virus counts in activated sludge is lacking indeed biller et al 2017 concluded that non virus particles are unlikely to systematically inflate measurements to a notable degree it is however conceivable given the r 2 of 0 77 in brown et al 2015 that non virus like particles contribute to random measurement error thus in the absence of a systematic measurement error we have elected to use the simpler term virus over vlp 2 3 2 dna extraction dna was extracted from 250 μl of ml and from 15 ml of influent the latter being centrifuged at 3392 g for 15 min and the supernatant removed down

influent flow rates were highly variable over the two year study period table s1 and fig s1 leading to fluctuating hydraulic and solids retention times 10 6 3 1 h and 11 1 3 1 days respectively fig s1 and reactor biomass concentrations 2 7 0 5 g l 1 mlss and 2 01 0 4 g l 1 mlvss fig s2 reactor temperature varied on a seasonal basis with a summer maximum and winter minimum of 17 9 c august 2012 and 6 3 c january 2013 recorded respectively fig s1 do concentrations were moderately variable 2 5 0 8 mg l 1 and ph was maintained within a narrow range 6 6 0 2 through flow dependent dosing of sodium hydroxide fig s1 the discharge consent a legislated maximum final effluent concentration of cods 125 mg l 1 was achieved 96 1 of the time thus mean removal efficiency 82 1 18 1 and effluent

were highly variable 0 76 4 and 0 5 3 mg l 1 and the discharge consent 5 mg l 1 ammonia was adhered to only 57 8 of the time fig s2 certainly nitrite accumulation thus incomplete nitrification was periodically evident particularly from day 500 onwards fig s2 e of the trace metals monitored in the influent calcium potassium and magnesium were present at the highest concentrations mean values of

with fluctuations generally but not exclusively occurring concurrently fig 1b and c the mean mixed liquor virus to total bacteria ratio vbr was 6 15 although this varied greatly 0 52 76 86 the abundance of all three communities within the influent was orders of magnitude lower fig 1 with mean abundances of 1 52 0 83 108 viruses ml 1 2 35 4 24 107 bacteria ml 1 and 1 14 2 98 105 aob ml 1 recorded respectively synchronous order of magnitude abundance fluctuations analogous to those in the mixed liquor were again evident 1 79 106 4 38 108 viruses ml 1 2 81 105 23 62 108 bacteria ml 1 and 2 1 103 2 8 106 aob ml 1 fig 1 effluent virus abundance 6 1 2 39 108 viruses ml 1 was also highly variable 1 1 108 1 27 109 viruses ml 1 fig 1 a and often mimicked abundance fluctuations in the mixed liquor indeed mixed liquor and effluent virus abundance were positively correlated p 0 001 fig 1 as viruses in the mixed liquor were lost in effluent wastewater 3 3 virus interactions with

negatively associated table s2 with total virus numbers however the fits of the mixed liquor total bacteria and aob gls regression models when compared to that produced for mixed liquor viruses were poorer fig 2 fig s5 a and s6 a the models explained only 53 and 47 of the variation in the bacterial and aob abundances respectively however mixed liquor virus abundances had strong positive associations with both bacteria and aob concentrations p 0 01 and p 0 001 respectively tables s3 and s4 the aob were even positively correlated with viruses in the effluent p 0 01 other explanatory variables significantly contributing to each model are summarised in the supplementary information 3 4 virus interactions with bacteria community structure the cca ordination accounted for the majority of observed variance in otu environment associations 77 6 table s5 and fig 3 mixed liquor virus abundance p 0 001 was the third most important variable after water temperature p 0 001 and influent potassium p 0 001 fig 3 and table s5 mixed liquor virus abundance was found to have a significant ls 0 3 p 0 05 and q 0 01 and complex association with 6 of the 10 most abundant otus and a further 11 of the 50 most abundant taxa fig 4 a group of 5 taxa had a significant association with the virus concentration at the time of sampling both negative otus 8 and 24 and positive otus 5 9 and 26 this group of otus were highly interconnected otus 5 9 and 26 being positively associated and otu pairs 8 and 5 8 and 9 8 and 26 and 24 and 9 being negatively associated fig 4 all associations were non lagged all 5 were persistent in the mixed liquor par 5 fig 4 and included the workhorse genus zoogloea otu 5 however other taxa had associations with a time delay varying from 1 week otu 11 positive and otus 33 37 and 44 negative 2 weeks positive otus 2 and 50 and negative otus 5 34 and 46 and even 3 weeks positive otu 19 and negative otus 4 and 22 these otus were found intermittently par 5 10 or transiently par 10 and included well known filamentous organisms microthrix otus 2 11 and 37 thiothrix otu 50 and the phosphorous removing genus tetrasphaera otu 4 mixed liquor virus

correlated with both mixed liquor cod p 0 001 and p 0 01 and nh4 n p 0 001 and p 0 05 concentrations and weakly positively correlated with effluent nh4 n concentrations p 0 1 and p 0 1 fig 5 b the sem

were directly influencing and being influenced by corresponding effluent p 0 001 and p 0 01 fig 6 and influent concentrations p 0 001 and p 0 05 fig 6 respectively effluent virus abundance was also none directionally positively associated with effluent nh4 n p 0 05 fig 6 a and cod p 0 01 fig 6 b concentrations whilst being directly positively influenced by mixed liquor virus abundance p 0 001 and p 0 001 fig 6 mixed liquor virus abundance p 0 001 fig 6 a as well as mixed liquor aob abundance p 0 1 fig 6 a was also directly positively influenced by influent concentrations of nh4 n no significant associations were found between mixed liquor aob bacteria abundance and mixed liquor and effluent nh4 n cod concentrations and virus abundance fig 6 the only exception being the negative association found between mixed liquor aob and effluent virus abundance p 0 01 fig 6 a overall the sem analysis was able to explain 28 and 12 of effluent nh4 n and cod concentrations respectively 4 discussion this work provides evidence that viruses play an important role in the ecology and function of activated sludge plants the statistical associations imply they interact with the abundance and dynamics of key bacterial groups to such an extent that community function and therefore effluent quality is affected it seems plausible that viruses could cause outright failure either directly affecting key functional groups or indirectly by influencing filamentous bacteria and thus foaming and bulking such a prominent role for bacteriophage is consistent with the high virus to bacteria ratio we observed evidence from other engineered systems hantula et al 1991 lee et al 2007 barr et al 2010 shapiro et al 2010 and knowledge of their role in the ecology of marine and freshwater environments suttle 2007 rohwer and thurber 2009 breitbart 2012 where viruses are thought to kill 50 of bacteria every day noble and fuhrman 2000 ram et al 2013 and therefore influence nutrient cycling and community function inferring the role of viruses in the environment is however problematic we are only able to quantify total virus numbers and the abundance or proportional abundance of relatively broad bacterial groups moreover the virus community will comprise numerous species strains breitbart et al 2007 each with varying host ranges khan et al 2002a 2002b and most will likely be in unsynchronised predator prey cycles with their hosts in addition the relationship between phage and host may be non linear and lagged thus in the absence of more detailed measurements of viruses and their hosts we utilised multiple statistical approaches to identify significant relationships between total virus numbers and various measures of biomass community structure and function this is a crude and probably insensitive approach however if we can find significant relationships with relatively weak tests this does imply that viruses play a very strong role in this system likewise though the underlying basis of the observed correlations is uncertain and could be indirect they could provide the impetus for the more detailed and challenging work required to obtain a mechanistic understanding of how bacteriophage affect engineered biological systems all four lines of enquiry we used suggested a role for viruses regression and structural equation modelling to determine an impact on biomass and function effluent quality and cca and local similarity analysis to evaluate the effect of viruses on community structure a detailed consideration of every statistically significant relationship would be tedious and speculative nevertheless some commentary is warranted viruses emerged as having a significant and positive correlation with the variation in bacterial and aob biomass over time more biomass prey meant more viruses predator which is plausible in individual predator prey cycle s the predator lags the prey but will still be positively correlated it would appear that when many such cycles are aggregated this correlation is still detectable the overall fit of the regression models were modest and the mechanistic basis for many of the other statistically significant variables is not immediately apparent however some have an obvious physical basis that lends credence to the exercise for example ph and the divalent cation magnesium were associated with virus numbers both regulate surface charge and electrostatic interactions and would cause viruses to adsorb desorb from the biomass and so decrease increase their abundance michen and graule 2010 nap et al 2014 likewise viruses in the mixed liquor were influenced by viruses in the influent despite the latter constituting only a small fraction of the former the difference between the number of viruses in the influent and the mixed liquor can only be accounted for by the lysis of biomass in the mixed liquor yet though the time series of mixed liquor virus abundance could be modelled quite well there was no statistical relationship between the number of viruses and the amount of bacterial biomass this reinforces the limitations of a purely statistical approach in principle if viruses affect mixed liquor aob and bacterial biomass this in turn should affect the effluent cod and ammonia concentration and so the system s function the structural equation modelling was an attempt to show this chain of causality it partially succeeded though it is clear that viruses affected the effluent concentrations directly and indirectly it was not possible to demonstrate that they did this through a linear effect on bacterial concentrations however predation remains the most plausible mechanism by which viruses could affect effluent quality indeed key functional groups are known to have signatures of viral infection prophages and crispr sequences in their genomes kunin et al 2008 choi et al 2010 motlagh et al 2015 viruses appear to have an important possibly very important role in community structure being the third most important factor in the canonical correspondence analysis cca after temperature and potassium the importance of temperature is well established and to some extent obvious wells et al 2009 2011 as is the significance of potassium which constitute about 1 of cell biomass e g brdjanovic et al 1996 and barat et al 2005 it follows that the prominent role of viruses is credible though largely ignored in both research and practice and poorly understood in detail unfortunately though a cca can tell us what is important it cannot tell us why some preliminary insights can be garnered from the local similarity analysis of individual taxonomic groups significant associations were found between viruses and some of the most abundant taxa which is consistent with the killing the winner hypothesis ktw thingstad 2000 winter et al 2010 however given viruses of the most abundant taxa should constitute the bulk of the virus count such relationships are perhaps expected thus it is in some ways more remarkable that total viruses were seen to correlate with microthrix thiothrix and tetrasphaera genera problematic blooming filamentous bacteria blackall et al 1996 martins et al 2004 guo and zhang 2012 that cause foaming and bulking and whose abundance is a matter of great interest and importance to practitioners a more prosaic explanation could be that some deterministic factor for example ph could be affecting both viruses and these problematic bacteria leading to spurious correlations however our observations are consistent with findings elsewhere kotay et al 2011 petrovski et al 2012 khairnar et al 2014 liu et al 2015b the time lag in some of the relationships we observe probably reflect the asynchrony in the underlying dynamics 5 conclusion we conclude that this paper provides plausible evidence that bacteriophage are key players in the ecology of activated sludge affecting not only the dynamics of the biomass and the community structure but the function of the system carbon and ammonia removal we posit that bacteriophages cause failure either directly through effluent concentrations or indirectly through their interactions with filamentous organisms there seems no reason why this finding will not extend to other functions especially p removal and all other biological treatment systems we caution that all findings are based on statistical associations and their basis is not yet certain clearly deeper mechanistic research is needed to determine the detailed species specific mechanisms this endeavour will be strengthened by the ongoing revolution in viral metagenomics and single cell analysis dang and sullivan 2014 brum and sullivan 2015 however practitioners need not wait for this detailed work to be undertaken the quantification of bacteriophage is cheap and simple using flow cytometry and total virus counts can as we have shown be empirically related to plant performance we would suggest that operators initiate the use of flow cytometry to count viruses or vlp in treatment plants now acknowledgements this work was carried out as part of a frontiers in engineering research project nufeb http research
