8400,study region this study investigates the annual and seasonal trends in precipitation and temperature at meteorological stations in mexico city and compares them with gridded datasets and projections from general circulation models study focus the outputs of climatic trend analysis are highly sensitive to the quality and continuity of data as well as natural variability effects including low frequency persistence this study evaluates the changes in average annual precipitation and temperature from approximately 1950 2013 and projected changes for 2036 2065 new hydrological insights for the region results shows statistically significant increasing trends in the winter mean temperature and the summer precipitation by average rates of 0 1 c decade and 17 8 mm decade respectively within the next 30 years temperature is projected to continue to increase between 1 to 3 with an unclear signal in precipitation change but possibly an increase in late season monsoon rainfall keywords temperature precipitation trend analysis mann kendall test sen s slope estimator mexico city 1 introduction according to the fifth ipcc report the future air temperature and humidity are expected to gradually increase ipcc 2015 the annual mean precipitation at the global scale is expected to increase by the end of this century ipcc 2013 global land precipitation demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 2 since the beginning of the 20th century while tropical land surface precipitation measurements indicate that precipitation has probably increased by about 0 2 to 0 3 per decade over the 20th century dore 2005 the adverse climate conditions are also projected to increase as a result of accelerated anthropogenic climate change ipcc 2012 awareness of climate change consequences is therefore crucial for those planning and managing human infrastructure systems e g water sewer transportation telecommunications in the decades to come numerous studies have been conducted to detect the existing trends of climatic variables globally for example e g serbia 1980 2010 gocic and trajkovic 2013 serbia 1946 2012 gocic et al 2016 northwest turkey 1975 2006

et al 2018 and switzerland 1959 2008 ceppi et al 2012 the typical practice has been to use the non parametric mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator method to detect statistically significant trends in climate variables with time periods of at least 30 years kundzewicz and robson 2000 bosch et al 2007 local scale explorations of climate indicators are essential checks on the fidelity of global gridded meteorological datasets and the relative agreement between observed historical trends and global circulation model projections provides important context for the credibility of those models to reproduce local climate phenomena to date the focus of this analysis is mexico city where concern is growing regarding the vulnerability of the water system to shocks and the capacity of the system to accommodate climate and demographic change in terms of water supply mexico city is similar to cities such as sao paulo beijing and dhaka in the sense that is primarily reliant on groundwater and interbasin water transfers li et al 2015 however given its elevation in a high mountain valley and its geology mostly clay and volcanic rock overlaying a historical lake and marshland mexico city faces particular challenges related to water supply and drainage olli et al 2005 in response to these concerns a number of studies have analyzed the existing water management plans in mexico city and sought improvements to the system s resilience and sustainability martinez et al 2015 carrera hernández jaime j and gaskin 2009 carrera hernández and gaskin 2009 for example presented a brief description of how water has been managed in the basin of mexico as well as the possible water management plans that would change water management policies in the basin using a very approximate mass balance relationship framed by one intermediate a1b and one pessimistic a2 carbon emission scenario martinez et al 2015 estimated that climate change could decrease annual water availability in mexico city s three most important catchment areas cutzamala lerma local wells by 10 17 by 2050 martinez et al 2015 also found that the annual mean temperature in the mexico city area might be increasing by 1 6 by 2050 other studies have investigated the changes of climatological variables in the basin of mexico birkle et al 1998 carrera hernández and gaskin 2007 carrera hernández and gaskin 2007 studied the temporal variation of both minimum and maximum temperature and rainfall its correlation with elevation and whether or not this relationship should be used when daily data are interpolated their analysis used daily climatological data from approximately 200 stations located in the basin of mexico for only seven years june 1978 and june 1985 brikle et al 1998 calculated the amount of precipitation evapotranspiration and recharge for the basin of mexico they compared the amount of natural recharge with the recent exploitation and consumption rates in order to derive a hydrological model for the water cycle of the region they also summarized the potential options to help solve the imbalance in the water system of the basin of mexico bravo et al 2014 studied the beginning and end of the rainy season as well as the spatial and temporal distributions for 23 climatological stations located in the federal district for the period 1954 1988 they found out that the variability of extended rains is larger at the beginning than at the end of the year therefore the final period of the rainy season is sharper and clearer in addition they recognized that the spatial variation of precipitation closely resembles the orography low high altitudes correspond to low high precipitation almanza and batyrshin 2011 studied the relationships between five atmospheric pollutants so2 o3 no2 nox and pm2 5 and seven meteorological variables mean wind velocity minimum average and maximum values of both temperature and relative humidity the meteorological variables in their study were measured daily at three meteorological stations located within the mexico city metropolitan area mcma during one year only conclusions regarding long term statistical indicators and trends were therefore not possible estrada and guerrero 2014 proposed a new methodology for generating climate change scenarios at the local scale based on multivariate time series models and restricted forecasting techniques to the best of the authors knowledge no previous study has evaluated the spatial and long term temporal variations of precipitation and temperature in mexico city this study therefore presents an investigation of the trend characteristics of climatic variables as well as the projected impacts inside the mexico city boundaries the present study is dedicated to the analysis of four main meteorological variables precipitation minimum maximum and average temperature observed at more than 50 stations inside the federal district within the period of 1950 2013 the main objectives of the present study are 1 to detect the existing trends of meteorological variables 2 to quantify the significance of changes by using the mann kendall test and the sen s slope estimator 3 to compare two global gridded databases of climatologic information with the ground observations and 4 to evaluate the projected precipitation and temperature using general circulation models gcms where future projections are not well supported by current trends water managers and city planners can become paralyzed by uncertainty the interpretation of this trend and projection information presented here with whatever degree of confidence can be attached will therefore inform water managers and city planners in their designs and management plans 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area as shown in fig 1 the study area of the present research is mexico city mexico city is located in the lower part of the basin of mexico one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world with more than 20 million residents in the central region of mexico the city has a mean altitude of 2240 m above sea level masl and is surrounded by mountains with peaks above 5000 masl carrera hernández and gaskin 2009 more than 8 million people reside in mexico city with a land area of 1485 km2 national institute of statistics and geography 2010 due to the effect of nearby mountains the southwest of mexico city receives the greatest precipitation while the lowest rainfall occurs in the northeast bravo et al 2014 2 2 data in the present study time series of maximum minimum and average temperature as well as precipitation are analyzed different sources including ground observation data and global gridded databases are analyzed and compared 2 2 1 ground observation data climate data are extracted from the national climatological data base website cicese 2019 the observed daily values are collected from 59 weather stations inside mexico city the spatial distribution of meteorological stations are shown in fig 1 while the periods of data coverage for all stations are presented in fig 2 table 1 summarizes the annual mean values with standard deviation of the variables studied in this research for the observed period as presented the annual mean values of temperature at all stations demonstrate minor differences which vary in the range of 22 26 c 6 11 c and 15 18 c for tmax tmin and tavg respectively however the precipitation throughout the study region has a wide range of 357 1298 mm year 2 2 2 global gridded databases in addition to local meteorological ground stations a number of global gridded databases of climatologic information are available for the area including mexico city two such databases are the daily observational hydrometeorology data set north american extent with data coverage from 1950 to 2013 livneh et al 2013 hereafter referred to as the livneh dataset and the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monthly precipitation dataset from 1901 to 2013 hereafter referred to as the gpcc dataset schneider et al 2014 fig 3 illustrates the grid size and spatial coverage for each dataset the gridsize of the livneh dataset is 1 16 latitude longitude while the gpcc dataset gridsize is 0 5 latitude longitude gpcc data is monthly precipitation only whereas livneh data consists of daily total precipitation minimum temperature tmin maximum temperature tmax and wind speed a quality check is performed on each of the gridded datasets by comparing their area weighted average values to the arithmetic average of the meteorological station observations from 1950 to 2013 an arithmetic average is used to combine meteorological station observations instead of a thiessen polygon approach because the spatial coverage of station data is different at almost every year which would require a different set of thiessen polygons to be developed every year station coverage is reasonably uniform throughout the méxico city municipal area the arithmetic average is therefore assumed to be a fair approximation of municipality wide precipitation the conclusion from the quality check performed on the precipitation data figs 4 and 5 is that the livneh precipitation data is a better fit to historical precipitation observations in mexico city than is the gpcc data no bias correction is performed on livneh precipitation data the conclusion from the quality check performed on the temperature data gpcc includes no temperature data is that the livneh temperature data require bias correction figs 6 8 present the bias corrected livneh temperature data as well as its annual and seasonal distribution compared to the ground observations 2 3 statistical tests in trend analysis both parametric and non parametric methods can be used to detect the significant trends of meteorological variables parametric trend tests linear regression require data to be independent and normally distributed while for non parametric trend tests mann kendall mann 1945 kendall 1975 and sen s slope estimator the data do not need to be normally distributed gocic and trajkovic 2013 furthermore the non parametric mann kendall test has a low sensitivity to abrupt breaks due to inhomogeneous time series jaagus 2006 in the present study the non parametric mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator are applied to detect the significant trends in the long term temperature and precipitation time series 2 3 1 mann kendall test the non parametric mann kendall test is mainly useful since the missing values are allowed and the data do not need to conform to any particular distribution the mann kendall test has been extensively applied to detect the significance of the trends of the meteorological variables modarres and silva 2007 tabari and talaee 2010 tabari and marofi 2011 the mann kendall test statistic s with the zero mean is calculated by 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i and the sign function sgn xj xi and the variance are defined by eqs 2 and 3 2 s g n x j x i 1 i f x j x i 0 0 i f x j x i 0 1 i f x j x i 0 where n is the number of data points xi and xj are the data values in time series i and j j i respectively 3 v s n n 1 2 n 5 k 1 m t k t k 1 2 t k 5 18 here m is the number of tied groups and tk represents the number of ties of extent i a tied group is a set of sample data having the same values in cases with n 10 the standard normal test statistic zs is calculated as 4 z s s 1 v s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 v s i f s 0 positive values of zs represent increasing trends while negative zs indicate decreasing trends the null hypothesis is rejected and the trend is significant at the level of α if zs z1 α 2 z1 α 2 is obtained from the standard normal distribution tables modarres and de paulo rodrigues da silva 2007 in the present work a significance level of α 0 05 is applied 2 3 2 sen s slope estimator the slope of a detected linear trend in time series may be estimated using a non parametric procedure developed by sen 1968 first the trend slope in the sample of n pairs of data is calculated as 5 q i x j x k j k f o r i 1 n here xj and xk are the data values at times j and k j k respectively the sen s slope is estimated based on the median of these n values of q i ranked from smallest to largest the median of sen s slope estimator is calculated as tabari and talaee 2010 6 q m e d q n 1 2 i f n i s o d d 1 2 q n 2 q n 2 2 i f n i s e v e n q med sign reflects data trend direction while its value indicates the steepness of the trend to determine whether the median slope is statistically different from zero one should obtain the confidence interval of q med at specific probability the confidence interval may be computed as gocic and trajkovic 2013 7 c α z 1 α 2 v a r s in this study the confidence interval is computed at level of α 0 05 3 2 4 serial correlation effect almost all climatic data are somehow correlated in time von storch and navarra 1995 kulkarni and von storch 1995 showed that with a positive serial correlation the mann kendall test may falsely detect a significant trend in the time series especially over insufficiently long time periods several modifications have been proposed to the conventional mann kendall test to account for the autocorrelation in data for instance a pre whitening e g storch and navarra 1995 and b trend free pre whitening e g yue et al 2002 are two different methods developed based on the correction for significant lag 1 autocorrelation in the data some other approaches emphasize on variance correction based on the effective sample size ess e g hamed and rao 1998 to increase the accuracy of the mann kendall test without losing any power for autocorrelated data in this paper the trend analysis is presented with four different approaches a mkttest mk test with no modification b mmkh mk test with modification to the variance hamed and rao 1998 c pwmk pre whitening method with lag 1 autocorrelation yue et al 2002 d tfpwmk trend free pre whitening method storch and navarra 1995 the trend analysis is implemented through an r programming environment using the package modifiedmk patakamuri et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 trend analysis of the meteorological variables based on ground observations in this section the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator are applied to the time series obtained from ground observations for the four meteorological variables of mexico city minimum temperature tmin maximum temperature tmax average temperature tavg and precipitation p the effect of serial correlation is examined by evaluating the autocorrelation function for each meteorological variable according to the significance of the autocorrelation the linear trends of variables with or without the pre whitening process are estimated 3 1 1 serial correlation of the meteorological variables the autocorrelation function acf represents the relation between the data points in a time series presented in fig 9 are the acf plots of annual time series for precipitation and temperature in mexico city for different lag numbers it is observed that the precipitation is not auto correlated as the acf values lie within the 95 significance level shown by dashed lines whereas the temperature time series are auto correlated for lag 1 hence pre whitening procedure proposed by von storch and navarra 1995 is applied only to temperature 3 1 2 analysis of annual and seasonal precipitation and temperature the annual and seasonal trend analysis of temperature and precipitation are carried out using the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator and is summarized in figs 10 and 11 the analysis has been applied to the basin wide average equally weighted precipitation and temperature time series reported for all stations inside mexico city the slope and level of significance of the trends are shown on each plot in addition if the time series observed at the station under study is pre whitened it is stated on the related plot fig 10 displays the linear trend of annual precipitation and temperature obtaining from averaging observations at all meteorological stations inside mexico city during the period of 1950 2013 it indicates a downward trend for precipitation and upward trends for temperature with insignificant rates since there are no significant trends at the 5 significance level though the trend for tavg is very close significant at the 10 level for the annual changes in climatic variables a seasonal trend analysis is also conducted on the precipitation and mean temperature of mexico city a seasonal trend analysis is also performed on the precipitation and temperature over the entire mexico city according to the temperature distribution presented in fig 8 the summer is identified from june to september jjas in mexico city while the winter is from november to february ndjf as shown in fig 11 the winter is getting warmer with a rate of 0 1 decade at 1 significance level and precipitation is increasing during the summer moreover the spatial distribution of seasonal trends at the selected weather stations inside mexico city are shown in fig 12 fifteen stations are selected based on the best spatial and temporal data coverage to represent the spatial heterogeneity the presented trends are categorized based on the 5 significance level on each plot where markers shape and sizes are representing the change and significance level respectively as indicated in fig 12 a precipitation is significantly increasing during the summer season in most stations which are located at the northwestern part of mexico city the mean temperature is increasing during the winter season as shown in fig 12 b fig 12 increases the challenge faced by water managers in mexico city as it indicates wetter wet seasons and drier dry seasons wetter wet seasons may increase flooding in the city s densely populated northwest drier dry season may increase evapotranspiration associated with higher mean temperatures in winter as shown in in fig 12 b during the season in which water resources are already scarce 3 2 trend analysis of the meteorological variables based on the livneh dataset analysis of precipitation and temperature trends from gauge observations is challenging for mexico city as it typically is globally due to the complex topography of the region as shown in fig 1 it is a high altitude basin surrounded by higher elevation mountains it has been demonstrated that topography would produce large variations in precipitation over small spatial scales frei and schar 1998 minder et al 2008 in addition gauge networks are relatively sparse in high elevation areas because of limited access and infrastructure henn et al 2018 therefore the ground observations may include substantial uncertainty due to the temporal and spatial variability in the absence of adequate ground observations gridded meteorological datasets become very useful because of their spatial and temporal continuity 3 2 1 comparison of detected trends for livneh and ground observation data for mexico city as shown in fig 2 a substantial decline in station density is observed after 1985 in order to evaluate the climatic trends based on the uniformly distributed data then the livneh dataset 1 16 resolution for the period 1950 2013 is analyzed for the study region and is compared with the ground observation results the livneh dataset is built based on several data sources including the servicio meteorológico nacional smn under the comisión nacional del agua conagua as well as conagua s regional offices and north american monsoon experiment event rain gauge network nern livneh et al 2015 the trend analysis on livneh gridded dataset is done by evaluating the weighted average of the data given at each grid point weighted by the fraction of the cell within the political boundaries inside mexico city as specified in fig 3 the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator are applied to the livneh time series and the detected annual and seasonal trends are compared to the historical observations analysis in table 2 and fig 13 as shown in fig 13 a trend analysis on livneh dataset confirms the finding of the ground station data that precipitation is increasing during the summer season by the average rate of 17 8 mm decade however the livneh annual precipitation is increasing while the observed precipitation shows an insignificant decreasing trend in this case the expectation is that livneh results are more likely to be accurate due to the absence of data records for many of the ground stations after 1985 a check on this assumption would be measurements of citywide drainage e g storm sewers or groundwater recharge rates over the past couple of decades unfortunately such information is not available for this study the livneh dataset shown in fig 13 a also finds no statistically significant decrease in winter precipitation the livneh data in fig 13 b agree with the station ground data that the winter season is warming by the rate of approximately 0 1 c decade and find a similar increase at the 12 significance level in the annual mean temperature 3 2 2 analysis of annual and seasonal precipitation and temperature the results of annual and seasonal trend analysis based on livneh data are presented in table 3 with four approaches described in section 2 4 regardless of the choice to pre treat the series or perform the mk test directly the agreement on the magnitude and sign of the sen s slope is practically uniform only the treatments involving pre whitening for the precipitation during the jjas season created different estimates for the sign of the sen s slope which regardless are all estimated to be decidedly statistically insignificant additionally the treatments involving pre whitening are the only cases in which the estimated p value of a treatment is below the p value for the mann kendall statistic of the unaltered time series the variance correction approach by default provides the most conservative p values either being equal to or above the p value for the mann kendall statistic of the unaltered time series only the analysis on minimum temperature created disagreeing decisions on the significance of a trend between methods 3 3 low frequency periodicity in the climate signal as a supplement to explorations of serial correlation the morlet wavelet spectrum and the global wavelet spectrum gws of total annual precipitation based on livneh data at mexico city for the period 1950 2013 is calculated and shown in fig 14 the dashed line is the 90 confidence level for a white noise background as shown a strong signal is detected at 11 12 years though the authors are not aware of any physical climate phenomena el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo etc responsible for the quasi oscillatory behavior observed in the precipitation signal evaluating a number of the most important streams in the cutzamala basin not reproduced here no significant enso signal is found rio grande 1946 2011 showed a significant signal at approximately 10 years however a corresponding signal is not found in the rio grande valley precipitation record though anecdotal evidence for the importance of enso to water system operations was offered by local practitioners evidence was not found for it in the literature the reason may be that mexico city is located between regions that dry and regions that wet during el niño events the semi oscillatory found at approximately 10 years of periodicity means that caution should be taken in the evaluation of historical linear trends a historical record of greater than 50 years duration was therefore adopted in this case 3 4 general circulation model gcm projection analysis in order to assess the possible future impacts of the climate change on climatic variables in mexico city in this section the changes in annual and monthly precipitation and temperature projected for the upcoming years using the cmip5 gcms are evaluated for the gcms analysis the full ensemble is used and all available gcms are analyzed for all rcp runs with no distinctions between the likelihood of each scenario or the skill of each gcm in reproducing particular climate behaviors of importance to mexico city all gcms are presented in this paper as independent dots on fig 15 shown in fig 15 is the change in average annual precipitation and temperature projected for 2036 2065 relative to the historical period 1971 2000 from the ensemble of cmip5 gcms projections for mexico city within the next 30 years temperature is projected to continue to increase by between 1 c and 3 c with unknown effect on precipitation possibly a decrease in precipitation the authors recognize that others have recommended grouping gcms by family e g steinschneider et al 2015 or selecting only the subset that is most highly performing in the region of interest e g schwarz et al 2018 but such assessments in this case are outside of the present scope precipitation and temperature data are not bias corrected or downscaled rather delta shifts are calculated which are independent of bias correction approaches on the raw gcms output a delta shift is the percent change for precipitation or the ratio for temperature of the average conditions between two time periods of interest as used in brown et al 2011 to create temperature precipitation response surfaces across multiple gcms the percent change in historical average annual or monthly precipitation is calculated the period 2035 2065 relative to the period 1970 2000 similarly the change in historical average temperature the period 2035 2065 relative to the period 1970 2000 the historical baseline is chosen to be 1970 2000 because that is the most recent 30 year period for which the gcms are run using historical data though some are run through 2005 the future projected period is chosen to be a 30 year trace occurring approximately at midcentury this is done mostly because that is the tail end of the current planning horizon while we could look to the year 2100 most water system planners certainly those in mexico city are not planning 80 years out they are planning 30 years out the confidence in near future precipitation and temperature within say the next 20 years before 2040 is much higher in historical trends than it is in gcms projections hawkins and sutton 2011 schelf et al 2018 and dominated by natural variability the confidence in long term end of century projections is very low figs 16 and 17 present boxplots of monthly precipitation temperature change from the ensemble of cmip5 gcms projections for mexico city change in average annual precipitation temperature in 2036 2065 relative to 1971 2000 the boxplots represent the distribution of delta shifts calculated on a monthly basis for each gcm in the respective grouping therefore the uncertainty depicted in figs 16 and 17 is not representative of predicted precipitation temperature time series from each gcm but rather the uncertainty in the predicted average conditions the number of data points for each rcp corresponds to the number of all gcms available for each rcp 23 for rcp2 6 36 for rcp4 5 20 for rcp6 0 and 33 for rcp8 5 large uncertainty exists regarding the change to the summer monsoon in fig 16 the pronounced dip below zero seen in june july combined with the pronounced increase in october seen in rcp6 0 rcp8 5 reflects a general shift of the summer monsoon to later in the season none of the plots indicate a tendency towards a uniform increase decrease in precipitation but rather a redistribution with the most uncertainty in the months that bookend and comprise the current rainy season fig 17 indicates that there is no scenario in which the future temperature could be lower than the current conditions the most pronounced increase in temperature across all rcps occurs in the late winter spring months of march may unlike the precipitation gcm predictions the variance of future temperature predictions remains relatively stable across the year with december may and april having the highest variance in predictions in summary the monthly cmip5 ensemble indicates wetter conditions in early winter and increased temperatures in spring early summer 3 5 the future projection of extreme precipitation under changed climate condition the intensity of precipitation is likely to increase due to temperature rise under the influence of climate change in the future blöschl et al 2017 herath and sarukkalige 2018 jakob and walland 2016 the water holding capacity of the atmosphere are likely to increase as well and this phenomenon can be explained by the concept of clausius clapeyron cc relationship cc relationship predicts an increase in the water holding capacity of air approximately by 7 per degree celsius skliris et al 2016 such increase in the water holding capacity of the atmosphere can significantly affect the behavior of hydrologic cycle causing an early spring or a late winter the relationship between extreme rainfall and average temperature may be identified to assess the precipitation variation characteristics thuy et al 2019 in the present study the effect of cc relationship for an increase in 2 c temperature is estimated as the trend suggested in the historic temperature dataset a quantile mapping approach to scale the distribution of precipitation is utilized in a way that replicates the effect of warming temperature on the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere pendergrass and hartmann 2014 according to world meteorological organization wmo the 99 99 th percentile of the daily precipitation is defined as an extreme precipitation wmo 2009 based on the results for mexico city shown in fig 18 left there is an increase in the precipitation in historic wet years e g 1965 1968 2009 and 2011 from the qq plot in the fig 18 right there is a visible increase in the extreme daily precipitation values 35 mm due to the cc scaling effect 4 conclusions there is growing concern for the vulnerability of the mexico city water system to shocks and the capacity of the system to accommodate climate and demographic change in the present paper the change of precipitation and temperature in mexico city was comprehensively studied in order to inform thinking regarding current climate trends and future climate projections for mexico city historical observation data and gridded datasets were analyzed and compared the existing trends were explored for both spatial and temporal variations in precipitation and temperature as well as the possible future impacts of the climate change on these climatic variables the trend analysis was conducted on the time series using the non parametric mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator trend analysis on ground observation and livneh dataset revealed statistically significant increasing trends of the winter mean temperature and the summer precipitation by average rates of 0 1 c decade and 17 8 mm decade respectively the present detected trend of precipitation shows a good agreement with ipcc evaluations which estimates an increase in precipitation by 0 2 to 0 3 per decade giving mexico city s tropical location ipcc 2015 increases in winter temperature increase evapotranspiration at a time of already scarce water availability and increases in summer precipitation especially in the city s densely populated northwest exacerbate already substantial flood problems although the trend is not significant at the 5 level both datasets livneh and observations indicate that the winter is drying besides there is a strong signal in the results obtained from observations the livneh data and the gcms indicating that the monsoon season is likely to get wetter and has already been getting wetter the results of this study are consistent with the changing temperature in mexico city based on the state of the climate reports blunden et al 2018 which have shown an increasing temperature throughout the mexico by an average of 1 3 c above the 1971 2000 normal these reports also indicate that mexico is experiencing its warmest years and the year 2017 has been marked as the 14th consecutive year with an above average annual temperature blunden et al 2018 furthermore analyzing the projected changes in annual and monthly precipitation and temperature using cmip5 gcms indicated that within the next 30 years temperature is projected to continue to increase between 1 to 3 by a rate of 0 3 c decade to 1 c decade with unknown effect on precipitation possibly a decrease in precipitation the results are consistent with the projected mean temperature by martinez et al 2015 which was shown to continue to increase 1 6 c by 2050 one can note that the projected increasing trend in temperature is similar to the trend analysis results in the previous sections meaning that mexico city is already being impacted and likely to be impacted more acutely by climate change in the coming decades water management policy implications the seasonal patterns in overall annual increases in precipitation and average minimum temperature pose particular problems for water managers of the valley of mexico the increase in minimum average temperature during the winter dry season implies an increase in evapotranspiration reducing the effective moisture of the area water use for dry season irrigation throughout the region is likely to increase and aquifer recharge from the light rains during this time of year is similarly likely expected to decrease the increase in wet season precipitation was not attributed to either increased extreme events or the baseline condition regardless potential future increases in wet season precipitation would further challenge already strained drainage system infrastructure in the city the findings reported in this paper point toward the potential benefit of capacity recovery projects and projects upgrading the maximum capacity of the drainage system in critical areas the increase in summer precipitation cannot be concluded to be an equalizing force to increased dry season evapotranspiration without hydrologic modeling or knowledge of how rainy season intensity may be redistributed which were outside of the scope of the current study disagreements between historic trends and gcm projections present water managers with crises of confidence and can paralyze otherwise productive investments in water system robustness and resilience while historical observations indicate a trend towards warmer winters and wetter summers the ensemble of cmip5 gcms indicates that the greatest increase in temperature will be seen in the early summer months while precipitation levels and variability may increase during the early winter months the cmip5 ensemble does not indicate any decrease in temperatures seasonally which is indicated without high statistical significance for the summer months in the historical observations using these conflicting visions for planning is therefore difficult in the face of such uncertainty likely the best approach is to 1 increase efforts at hydro climatologic data collection 2 supplement the available observations and projections with the insights of local water managers and scientists with expertise in the local climate and 3 design flexible and adaptable systems that can be easily modified to account for futures different from the expected declaration of competing

insights for the region results shows statistically significant increasing trends in the winter mean temperature and the summer precipitation by average rates of 0 1 c decade and 17 8 mm decade respectively within the next 30 years temperature is projected to continue to increase between 1 to 3 with an unclear signal in precipitation change but possibly an increase in late season monsoon rainfall keywords temperature precipitation trend analysis mann kendall test sen s slope estimator mexico city 1 introduction according to the fifth ipcc report the future air temperature and humidity are expected to gradually increase ipcc 2015 the annual mean precipitation at the global scale is expected to increase by the end of this century ipcc 2013 global land precipitation demonstrated a statistically significant increase of 2 since the beginning of the 20th century while tropical land surface precipitation measurements indicate that precipitation has probably increased by about 0 2 to 0 3 per decade over the 20th century dore 2005 the adverse climate conditions are also projected to increase as a result of accelerated anthropogenic climate change ipcc 2012 awareness of climate change consequences is therefore crucial for those planning and managing human infrastructure systems e g water sewer transportation telecommunications in the decades to come numerous studies have been conducted to detect the existing trends of climatic variables globally for example e g serbia 1980 2010 gocic and trajkovic 2013 serbia 1946 2012 gocic et al 2016 northwest turkey 1975 2006

et al 2018 and switzerland 1959 2008 ceppi et al 2012 the typical practice has been to use the non parametric mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator method to detect statistically significant trends in climate variables with time periods of at least 30 years kundzewicz and robson 2000 bosch et al 2007 local scale explorations of climate indicators are essential checks on the fidelity of global gridded meteorological datasets and the relative agreement between observed historical trends and global circulation model projections provides important context for the credibility of those models to reproduce local climate phenomena to date the focus of this analysis is mexico city where concern is growing regarding the vulnerability of the water system to shocks and the capacity of the system to accommodate climate and demographic change in terms of water supply mexico city is similar to cities such as sao paulo beijing and dhaka in the sense that is primarily reliant on groundwater and interbasin water transfers li et al 2015 however given its elevation in a high mountain valley and its geology mostly clay and volcanic rock overlaying a historical lake and marshland mexico city faces particular challenges related to water supply and drainage olli et al 2005 in response to these concerns a number of studies have analyzed the existing water management plans in mexico city and sought improvements to the system s resilience and sustainability martinez et al 2015 carrera hernández jaime j and gaskin 2009 carrera hernández and gaskin 2009 for example presented a brief description of how water has been managed in the basin of mexico as well as the possible water management plans that would change water management policies in the basin using a very approximate mass balance relationship framed by one intermediate a1b and one pessimistic a2 carbon emission scenario martinez et al 2015 estimated that climate change could decrease annual water availability in mexico city s three most important catchment areas cutzamala lerma local wells by 10 17 by 2050 martinez et al 2015 also found that the annual mean temperature in the mexico city area might be increasing by 1 6 by 2050 other studies have investigated the changes of climatological variables in the basin of mexico birkle et al 1998 carrera hernández and gaskin 2007 carrera hernández and gaskin 2007 studied the temporal variation of both minimum and maximum temperature and rainfall its correlation with elevation and whether or not this relationship should be used when daily data are interpolated their analysis used daily climatological data from approximately 200 stations located in the basin of mexico for only seven years june 1978 and june 1985 brikle et al 1998 calculated the amount of precipitation evapotranspiration and recharge for the basin of mexico they compared the amount of natural recharge with the recent exploitation and consumption rates in order to derive a hydrological model for the water cycle of the region they also summarized the potential options to help solve the imbalance in the water system of the basin of mexico bravo et al 2014 studied the beginning and end of the rainy season as well as the spatial and temporal distributions for 23 climatological stations located in the federal district for the period 1954 1988 they found out that the variability of extended rains is larger at the beginning than at the end of the year therefore the final period of the rainy season is sharper and clearer in addition they recognized that the spatial variation of precipitation closely resembles the orography low high altitudes correspond to low high precipitation almanza and batyrshin 2011 studied the relationships between five atmospheric pollutants so2 o3 no2 nox and pm2 5 and seven meteorological variables mean wind velocity minimum average and maximum values of both temperature and relative humidity the meteorological variables in their study were measured daily at three meteorological stations located within the mexico city metropolitan area mcma during one year only conclusions regarding long term statistical indicators and trends were therefore not possible estrada and guerrero 2014 proposed a new methodology for generating climate change scenarios at the local scale based on multivariate time series models and restricted forecasting techniques to the best of the authors knowledge no previous study has evaluated the spatial and long term temporal variations of precipitation and temperature in mexico city this study therefore presents an investigation of the trend characteristics of climatic variables as well as the projected impacts inside the mexico city boundaries the present study is dedicated to the analysis of four main meteorological variables precipitation minimum maximum and average temperature observed at more than 50 stations inside the federal district within the period of 1950 2013 the main objectives of the present study are 1 to detect the existing trends of meteorological variables 2 to quantify the significance of changes by using the mann kendall test and the sen s slope estimator 3 to compare two global gridded databases of climatologic information with the ground observations and 4 to evaluate the projected precipitation and temperature using general circulation models gcms where future projections are not well supported by current trends water managers and city planners can become paralyzed by uncertainty the interpretation of this trend and projection information presented here with whatever degree of confidence can be attached will therefore inform water managers and city planners in their designs and management plans 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area as shown in fig 1 the study area of the present research is mexico city mexico city is located in the lower part of the basin of mexico one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world with more than 20 million residents in the central region of mexico the city has a mean altitude of 2240 m above sea level masl and is surrounded by mountains with peaks above 5000 masl carrera hernández and gaskin 2009 more than 8 million people reside in mexico city with a land area of 1485 km2 national institute of statistics and geography 2010 due to the effect of nearby mountains the southwest of mexico city receives the greatest precipitation while the lowest rainfall occurs in the northeast bravo et al 2014 2 2 data in the present study time series of maximum minimum and average temperature as well as precipitation are analyzed different sources including ground observation data and global gridded databases are analyzed and compared 2 2 1 ground observation data climate data are extracted from the national climatological data base website cicese 2019 the observed daily values are collected from 59 weather stations inside mexico city the spatial distribution of meteorological stations are shown in fig 1 while the periods of data coverage for all stations are presented in fig 2 table 1 summarizes the annual mean values with standard deviation of the variables studied in this research for the observed period as presented the annual mean values of temperature at all stations demonstrate minor differences which vary in the range of 22 26 c 6 11 c and 15 18 c for tmax tmin and tavg respectively however the precipitation throughout the study region has a wide range of 357 1298 mm year 2 2 2 global gridded databases in addition to local meteorological ground stations a number of global gridded databases of climatologic information are available for the area including mexico city two such databases are the daily observational hydrometeorology data set north american extent with data coverage from 1950 to 2013 livneh et al 2013 hereafter referred to as the livneh dataset and the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monthly precipitation dataset from 1901 to 2013 hereafter referred to as the gpcc dataset schneider et al 2014 fig 3 illustrates the grid size and spatial coverage for each dataset the gridsize of the livneh dataset is 1 16 latitude longitude while the gpcc dataset gridsize is 0 5 latitude longitude gpcc data is monthly precipitation only whereas livneh data consists of daily total precipitation minimum temperature tmin maximum temperature tmax and wind speed a quality check is performed on each of the gridded datasets by comparing their area weighted average values to the arithmetic average of the meteorological station observations from 1950 to 2013 an arithmetic average is used to combine meteorological station observations instead of a thiessen polygon approach because the spatial coverage of station data is different at almost every year which would require a different set of thiessen polygons to be developed every year station coverage is reasonably uniform throughout the méxico city municipal area the arithmetic average is therefore assumed to be a fair approximation of municipality wide precipitation the conclusion from the quality check performed on the precipitation data figs 4 and 5 is that the livneh precipitation data is a better fit to historical precipitation observations in mexico city than is the gpcc data no bias correction is performed on livneh precipitation data the conclusion from the quality check performed on the temperature data gpcc includes no temperature data is that the livneh temperature data require bias correction figs 6 8 present the bias corrected livneh temperature data as well as its annual and seasonal distribution compared to the ground observations 2 3 statistical tests in trend analysis both parametric and non parametric methods can be used to detect the significant trends of meteorological variables parametric trend tests linear regression require data to be independent and normally distributed while for non parametric trend tests mann kendall mann 1945 kendall 1975 and sen s slope estimator the data do not need to be normally distributed gocic and trajkovic 2013 furthermore the non parametric mann kendall test has a low sensitivity to abrupt breaks due to inhomogeneous time series jaagus 2006 in the present study the non parametric mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator are applied to detect the significant trends in the long term temperature and precipitation time series 2 3 1 mann kendall test the non parametric mann kendall test is mainly useful since the missing values are allowed and the data do not need to conform to any particular distribution the mann kendall test has been extensively applied to detect the significance of the trends of the meteorological variables modarres and silva 2007 tabari and talaee 2010 tabari and marofi 2011 the mann kendall test statistic s with the zero mean is calculated by 1 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i and the sign function sgn xj xi and the variance are defined by eqs 2 and 3 2 s g n x j x i 1 i f x j x i 0 0 i f x j x i 0 1 i f x j x i 0 where n is the number of data points xi and xj are the data values in time series i and j j i respectively 3 v s n n 1 2 n 5 k 1 m t k t k 1 2 t k 5 18 here m is the number of tied groups and tk represents the number of ties of extent i a tied group is a set of sample data having the same values in cases with n 10 the standard normal test statistic zs is calculated as 4 z s s 1 v s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 v s i f s 0 positive values of zs represent increasing trends while negative zs indicate decreasing trends the null hypothesis is rejected and the trend is significant at the level of α if zs z1 α 2 z1 α 2 is obtained from the standard normal distribution tables modarres and de paulo rodrigues da silva 2007 in the present work a significance level of α 0 05 is applied 2 3 2 sen s slope estimator the slope of a detected linear trend in time series may be estimated using a non parametric procedure developed by sen 1968 first the trend slope in the sample of n pairs of data is calculated as 5 q i x j x k j k f o r i 1 n here xj and xk are the data values at times j and k j k respectively the sen s slope is estimated based on the median of these n values of q i ranked from smallest to largest the median of sen s slope estimator is calculated as tabari and talaee 2010 6 q m e d q n 1 2 i f n i s o d d 1 2 q n 2 q n 2 2 i f n i s e v e n q med sign reflects data trend direction while its value indicates the steepness of the trend to determine whether the median slope is statistically different from zero one should obtain the confidence interval of q med at specific probability the confidence interval may be computed as gocic and trajkovic 2013 7 c α z 1 α 2 v a r s in this study the confidence interval is computed at level of α 0 05 3 2 4 serial correlation effect almost all climatic data are somehow correlated in time von storch and navarra 1995 kulkarni and von storch 1995 showed that with a positive serial correlation the mann kendall test may falsely detect a significant trend in the time series especially over insufficiently long time periods several modifications have been proposed to the conventional mann kendall test to account for the autocorrelation in data for instance a pre whitening e g storch and navarra 1995 and b trend free pre whitening e g yue et al 2002 are two different methods developed based on the correction for significant lag 1 autocorrelation in the data some other approaches emphasize on variance correction based on the effective sample size ess e g hamed and rao 1998 to increase the accuracy of the mann kendall test without losing any power for autocorrelated data in this paper the trend analysis is presented with four different approaches a mkttest mk test with no modification b mmkh mk test with modification to the variance hamed and rao 1998 c pwmk pre whitening method with lag 1 autocorrelation yue et al 2002 d tfpwmk trend free pre whitening method storch and navarra 1995 the trend analysis is implemented through an r programming environment using the package modifiedmk patakamuri et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 trend analysis of the meteorological variables based on ground observations in this section the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator are applied to the time series obtained from ground observations for the four meteorological variables of mexico city minimum temperature tmin maximum temperature tmax average temperature tavg and precipitation p the effect of serial correlation is examined by evaluating the autocorrelation function for each meteorological variable according to the significance of the autocorrelation the linear trends of variables with or without the pre whitening process are estimated 3 1 1 serial correlation of the meteorological variables the autocorrelation function acf represents the relation between the data points in a time series presented in fig 9 are the acf plots of annual time series for precipitation and temperature in mexico city for different lag numbers it is observed that the precipitation is not auto correlated as the acf values lie within the 95 significance level shown by dashed lines whereas the temperature time series are auto correlated for lag 1 hence pre whitening procedure proposed by von storch and navarra 1995 is applied only to temperature 3 1 2 analysis of annual and seasonal precipitation and temperature the annual and seasonal trend analysis of temperature and precipitation are carried out using the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator and is summarized in figs 10 and 11 the analysis has been applied to the basin wide average equally weighted precipitation and temperature time series reported for all stations inside mexico city the slope and level of significance of the trends are shown on each plot in addition if the time series observed at the station under study is pre whitened it is stated on the related plot fig 10 displays the linear trend of annual precipitation and temperature obtaining from averaging observations at all meteorological stations inside mexico city during the period of 1950 2013 it indicates a downward trend for precipitation and upward trends for temperature with insignificant rates since there are no significant trends at the 5 significance level though the trend for tavg is very close significant at the 10 level for the annual changes in climatic variables a seasonal trend analysis is also conducted on the precipitation and mean temperature of mexico city a seasonal trend analysis is also performed on the precipitation and temperature over the entire mexico city according to the temperature distribution presented in fig 8 the summer is identified from june to september jjas in mexico city while the winter is from november to february ndjf as shown in fig 11 the winter is getting warmer with a rate of 0 1 decade at 1 significance level and precipitation is increasing during the summer moreover the spatial distribution of seasonal trends at the selected weather stations inside mexico city are shown in fig 12 fifteen stations are selected based on the best spatial and temporal data coverage to represent the spatial heterogeneity the presented trends are categorized based on the 5 significance level on each plot where markers shape and sizes are representing the change and significance level respectively as indicated in fig 12 a precipitation is significantly increasing during the summer season in most stations which are located at the northwestern part of mexico city the mean temperature is increasing during the winter season as shown in fig 12 b fig 12 increases the challenge faced by water managers in mexico city as it indicates wetter wet seasons and drier dry seasons wetter wet seasons may increase flooding in the city s densely populated northwest drier dry season may increase evapotranspiration associated with higher mean temperatures in winter as shown in in fig 12 b during the season in which water resources are already scarce 3 2 trend analysis of the meteorological variables based on the livneh dataset analysis of precipitation and temperature trends from gauge observations is challenging for mexico city as it typically is globally due to the complex topography of the region as shown in fig 1 it is a high altitude basin surrounded by higher elevation mountains it has been demonstrated that topography would produce large variations in precipitation over small spatial scales frei and schar 1998 minder et al 2008 in addition gauge networks are relatively sparse in high elevation areas because of limited access and infrastructure henn et al 2018 therefore the ground observations may include substantial uncertainty due to the temporal and spatial variability in the absence of adequate ground observations gridded meteorological datasets become very useful because of their spatial and temporal continuity 3 2 1 comparison of detected trends for livneh and ground observation data for mexico city as shown in fig 2 a substantial decline in station density is observed after 1985 in order to evaluate the climatic trends based on the uniformly distributed data then the livneh dataset 1 16 resolution for the period 1950 2013 is analyzed for the study region and is compared with the ground observation results the livneh dataset is built based on several data sources including the servicio meteorológico nacional smn under the comisión nacional del agua conagua as well as conagua s regional offices and north american monsoon experiment event rain gauge network nern livneh et al 2015 the trend analysis on livneh gridded dataset is done by evaluating the weighted average of the data given at each grid point weighted by the fraction of the cell within the political boundaries inside mexico city as specified in fig 3 the mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator are applied to the livneh time series and the detected annual and seasonal trends are compared to the historical observations analysis in table 2 and fig 13 as shown in fig 13 a trend analysis on livneh dataset confirms the finding of the ground station data that precipitation is increasing during the summer season by the average rate of 17 8 mm decade however the livneh annual precipitation is increasing while the observed precipitation shows an insignificant decreasing trend in this case the expectation is that livneh results are more likely to be accurate due to the absence of data records for many of the ground stations after 1985 a check on this assumption would be measurements of citywide drainage e g storm sewers or groundwater recharge rates over the past couple of decades unfortunately such information is not available for this study the livneh dataset shown in fig 13 a also finds no statistically significant decrease in winter precipitation the livneh data in fig 13 b agree with the station ground data that the winter season is warming by the rate of approximately 0 1 c decade and find a similar increase at the 12 significance level in the annual mean temperature 3 2 2 analysis of annual and seasonal precipitation and temperature the results of annual and seasonal trend analysis based on livneh data are presented in table 3 with four approaches described in section 2 4 regardless of the choice to pre treat the series or perform the mk test directly the agreement on the magnitude and sign of the sen s slope is practically uniform only the treatments involving pre whitening for the precipitation during the jjas season created different estimates for the sign of the sen s slope which regardless are all estimated to be decidedly statistically insignificant additionally the treatments involving pre whitening are the only cases in which the estimated p value of a treatment is below the p value for the mann kendall statistic of the unaltered time series the variance correction approach by default provides the most conservative p values either being equal to or above the p value for the mann kendall statistic of the unaltered time series only the analysis on minimum temperature created disagreeing decisions on the significance of a trend between methods 3 3 low frequency periodicity in the climate signal as a supplement to explorations of serial correlation the morlet wavelet spectrum and the global wavelet spectrum gws of total annual precipitation based on livneh data at mexico city for the period 1950 2013 is calculated and shown in fig 14 the dashed line is the 90 confidence level for a white noise background as shown a strong signal is detected at 11 12 years though the authors are not aware of any physical climate phenomena el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo etc responsible for the quasi oscillatory behavior observed in the precipitation signal evaluating a number of the most important streams in the cutzamala basin not reproduced here no significant enso signal is found rio grande 1946 2011 showed a significant signal at approximately 10 years however a corresponding signal is not found in the rio grande valley precipitation record though anecdotal evidence for the importance of enso to water system operations was offered by local practitioners evidence was not found for it in the literature the reason may be that mexico city is located between regions that dry and regions that wet during el niño events the semi oscillatory found at approximately 10 years of periodicity means that caution should be taken in the evaluation of historical linear trends a historical record of greater than 50 years duration was therefore adopted in this case 3 4 general circulation model gcm projection analysis in order to assess the possible future impacts of the climate change on climatic variables in mexico city in this section the changes in annual and monthly precipitation and temperature projected for the upcoming years using the cmip5 gcms are evaluated for the gcms analysis the full ensemble is used and all available gcms are analyzed for all rcp runs with no distinctions between the likelihood of each scenario or the skill of each gcm in reproducing particular climate behaviors of importance to mexico city all gcms are presented in this paper as independent dots on fig 15 shown in fig 15 is the change in average annual precipitation and temperature projected for 2036 2065 relative to the historical period 1971 2000 from the ensemble of cmip5 gcms projections for mexico city within the next 30 years temperature is projected to continue to increase by between 1 c and 3 c with unknown effect on precipitation possibly a decrease in precipitation the authors recognize that others have recommended grouping gcms by family e g steinschneider et al 2015 or selecting only the subset that is most highly performing in the region of interest e g schwarz et al 2018 but such assessments in this case are outside of the present scope precipitation and temperature data are not bias corrected or downscaled rather delta shifts are calculated which are independent of bias correction approaches on the raw gcms output a delta shift is the percent change for precipitation or the ratio for temperature of the average conditions between two time periods of interest as used in brown et al 2011 to create temperature precipitation response surfaces across multiple gcms the percent change in historical average annual or monthly precipitation is calculated the period 2035 2065 relative to the period 1970 2000 similarly the change in historical average temperature the period 2035 2065 relative to the period 1970 2000 the historical baseline is chosen to be 1970 2000 because that is the most recent 30 year period for which the gcms are run using historical data though some are run through 2005 the future projected period is chosen to be a 30 year trace occurring approximately at midcentury this is done mostly because that is the tail end of the current planning horizon while we could look to the year 2100 most water system planners certainly those in mexico city are not planning 80 years out they are planning 30 years out the confidence in near future precipitation and temperature within say the next 20 years before 2040 is much higher in historical trends than it is in gcms projections hawkins and sutton 2011 schelf et al 2018 and dominated by natural variability the confidence in long term end of century projections is very low figs 16 and 17 present boxplots of monthly precipitation temperature change from the ensemble of cmip5 gcms projections for mexico city change in average annual precipitation temperature in 2036 2065 relative to 1971 2000 the boxplots represent the distribution of delta shifts calculated on a monthly basis for each gcm in the respective grouping therefore the uncertainty depicted in figs 16 and 17 is not representative of predicted precipitation temperature time series from each gcm but rather the uncertainty in the predicted average conditions the number of data points for each rcp corresponds to the number of all gcms available for each rcp 23 for rcp2 6 36 for rcp4 5 20 for rcp6 0 and 33 for rcp8 5 large uncertainty exists regarding the change to the summer monsoon in fig 16 the pronounced dip below zero seen in june july combined with the pronounced increase in october seen in rcp6 0 rcp8 5 reflects a general shift of the summer monsoon to later in the season none of the plots indicate a tendency towards a uniform increase decrease in precipitation but rather a redistribution with the most uncertainty in the months that bookend and comprise the current rainy season fig 17 indicates that there is no scenario in which the future temperature could be lower than the current conditions the most pronounced increase in temperature across all rcps occurs in the late winter spring months of march may unlike the precipitation gcm predictions the variance of future temperature predictions remains relatively stable across the year with december may and april having the highest variance in predictions in summary the monthly cmip5 ensemble indicates wetter conditions in early winter and increased temperatures in spring early summer 3 5 the future projection of extreme precipitation under changed climate condition the intensity of precipitation is likely to increase due to temperature rise under the influence of climate change in the future blöschl et al 2017 herath and sarukkalige 2018 jakob and walland 2016 the water holding capacity of the atmosphere are likely to increase as well and this phenomenon can be explained by the concept of clausius clapeyron cc relationship cc relationship predicts an increase in the water holding capacity of air approximately by 7 per degree celsius skliris et al 2016 such increase in the water holding capacity of the atmosphere can significantly affect the behavior of hydrologic cycle causing an early spring or a late winter the relationship between extreme rainfall and average temperature may be identified to assess the precipitation variation characteristics thuy et al 2019 in the present study the effect of cc relationship for an increase in 2 c temperature is estimated as the trend suggested in the historic temperature dataset a quantile mapping approach to scale the distribution of precipitation is utilized in a way that replicates the effect of warming temperature on the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere pendergrass and hartmann 2014 according to world meteorological organization wmo the 99 99 th percentile of the daily precipitation is defined as an extreme precipitation wmo 2009 based on the results for mexico city shown in fig 18 left there is an increase in the precipitation in historic wet years e g 1965 1968 2009 and 2011 from the qq plot in the fig 18 right there is a visible increase in the extreme daily precipitation values 35 mm due to the cc scaling effect 4 conclusions there is growing concern for the vulnerability of the mexico city water system to shocks and the capacity of the system to accommodate climate and demographic change in the present paper the change of precipitation and temperature in mexico city was comprehensively studied in order to inform thinking regarding current climate trends and future climate projections for mexico city historical observation data and gridded datasets were analyzed and compared the existing trends were explored for both spatial and temporal variations in precipitation and temperature as well as the possible future impacts of the climate change on these climatic variables the trend analysis was conducted on the time series using the non parametric mann kendall test and sen s slope estimator trend analysis on ground observation and livneh dataset revealed statistically significant increasing trends of the winter mean temperature and the summer precipitation by average rates of 0 1 c decade and 17 8 mm decade respectively the present detected trend of precipitation shows a good agreement with ipcc evaluations which estimates an increase in precipitation by 0 2 to 0 3 per decade giving mexico city s tropical location ipcc 2015 increases in winter temperature increase evapotranspiration at a time of already scarce water availability and increases in summer precipitation especially in the city s densely populated northwest exacerbate already substantial flood problems although the trend is not significant at the 5 level both datasets livneh and observations indicate that the winter is drying besides there is a strong signal in the results obtained from observations the livneh data and the gcms indicating that the monsoon season is likely to get wetter and has already been getting wetter the results of this study are consistent with the changing temperature in mexico city based on the state of the climate reports blunden et al 2018 which have shown an increasing temperature throughout the mexico by an average of 1 3 c above the 1971 2000 normal these reports also indicate that mexico is experiencing its warmest years and the year 2017 has been marked as the 14th consecutive year with an above average annual temperature blunden et al 2018 furthermore analyzing the projected changes in annual and monthly precipitation and temperature using cmip5 gcms indicated that within the next 30 years temperature is projected to continue to increase between 1 to 3 by a rate of 0 3 c decade to 1 c decade with unknown effect on precipitation possibly a decrease in precipitation the results are consistent with the projected mean temperature by martinez et al 2015 which was shown to continue to increase 1 6 c by 2050 one can note that the projected increasing trend in temperature is similar to the trend analysis results in the previous sections meaning that mexico city is already being impacted and likely to be impacted more acutely by climate change in the coming decades water management policy implications the seasonal patterns in overall annual increases in precipitation and average minimum temperature pose particular problems for water managers of the valley of mexico the increase in minimum average temperature during the winter dry season implies an increase in evapotranspiration reducing the effective moisture of the area water use for dry season irrigation throughout the region is likely to increase and aquifer recharge from the light rains during this time of year is similarly likely expected to decrease the increase in wet season precipitation was not attributed to either increased extreme events or the baseline condition regardless potential future increases in wet season precipitation would further challenge already strained drainage system infrastructure in the city the findings reported in this paper point toward the potential benefit of capacity recovery projects and projects upgrading the maximum capacity of the drainage system in critical areas the increase in summer precipitation cannot be concluded to be an equalizing force to increased dry season evapotranspiration without hydrologic modeling or knowledge of how rainy season intensity may be redistributed which were outside of the scope of the current study disagreements between historic trends and gcm projections present water managers with crises of confidence and can paralyze otherwise productive investments in water system robustness and resilience while historical observations indicate a trend towards warmer winters and wetter summers the ensemble of cmip5 gcms indicates that the greatest increase in temperature will be seen in the early summer months while precipitation levels and variability may increase during the early winter months the cmip5 ensemble does not indicate any decrease in temperatures seasonally which is indicated without high statistical significance for the summer months in the historical observations using these conflicting visions for planning is therefore difficult in the face of such uncertainty likely the best approach is to 1 increase efforts at hydro climatologic data collection 2 supplement the available observations and projections with the insights of local water managers and scientists with expertise in the local climate and 3 design flexible and adaptable systems that can be easily modified to account for futures different from the expected declaration of competing

satellite and reanalysis precipitation 1 introduction hydrometeorological datasets have significant importance on the sustainable water resources management as well as for different socio economic activities however it is noted that acquiring accurate and consistent set of precipitation data is a challenging task throughout the world especially in africa the data assessment report of africa african climate policy centre acpc 2011 summarized as having poor spatial coverage with many stations became either non operational or report poor quality data with missing information lakew et al 2017 it is indicated that in some cases even the existing stations neither provide accurate observations nor quality controlled and transmitted to the database system hence the importance of improved global data remains one of the future hopes for the design and management of water resources in data scarce parts of the world the advent of global data sets such as satellite and reanalysis products play a great role in building a consistent set of hydrometeorological data that can be utilized for various purposes of water resources development and management in africa and globally however these globally available datasets have the limitations to estimate the observed rainfall and should be evaluated at the local basin scale for water resources applications evaluation of the amount of

gpcc and mswep the crest fully distributed hydrological model shen and hong 2014 is used for the evaluation and comparision 2 data and method 2 1 the study area this study is conducted in the upper blue nile basin at three nested watersheds gilgel abbay small abbay at kessie station middle upper blue nile and the upper blue nile at eldiem at the border of ethiopia and sudan the descriptions of the watersheds are provided below 2 1 1 small scale gilgel abbay watershed gilgel abbay watershed which has a drainage area of 1656 km2 is located in the upper part of the abbay basin between 36 42 e 39 48 e and 9 15 n 12 45 n the streamflow station is located upstream of lake tana before it joins the lake fig 1 the landscape is complex topography with elevation ranging from 1880 m to 3530 m the watershed gets high amount of rainfall relative to the two medium and large scale case studies hence this small scale watershed is located at the central part of the basin of the highlands relatively high amount of rainfall is observed 2 1 2 medium scale kessie station abbay at kessie gauging station is located at the mid of the abbay basin including gilgel abbay watershed and lake tana which has a drainage area of 65 784 km2 in the upper blue nile basin between 36 42 e 39 48 e and 9 15 n 12 45 n fig 1 the landscape is complex topography with elevation range between 1102 m 4176 m the medium scale covers more area of the lowlands and arid regions with small amount of rainfall relative to the small scale of gilgel abbay 2 1 3 large scale eldiem eldiem station is located at the outlet of the abbay basin boarder of ethiopia and sudan and has a drainage area of 199 812 km2 including gilgel abbay and kessie is the main part of the ethiopian highlands between 34 24 e 39 48 e and 7 42 n 12 30 n the landscape is complex topography together with plain flatter area on the north west part and highly elevated complex mountains on the other parts of the basin with elevation range between 503 m 4176 m the large scale consists more are coverage of the low lands relative to the small and medium scale case studies high amount of rainfall at the central part of the basin and insignificant amount of rainfall is observed in wider area of the north west part of the basin with low elevation and arid area coverage the location of the three spatial scales and the rain gauge distribution is shown in fig 1 lakew et al 2019 2 2 hydrometeorological data the daily stream flow of the three case studies and the daily rainfall historical data are collected from ethiopia ministry of water irrigation and electricity and ethiopian meteorological agency respectively a total of 89 in situ rainfall measuring stations are used for the three case studies from the total 5 stations are used for gilgel abbay 51 stations for kessie and 89 stations for abbay at eldiem station as shown in fig 1 most of the available stations are located in the central and northern highlands that have a relatively higher amount of rainfall records the western part of the basin the lowlands has relatively lower rain gauge station coverage as shown in fig 1 the grid based 0 5 with daily temporal scale of potential evapotranspiration pet mm day that is derived from penman monteith method allen et al 1998 is used as an input to setup crest model for the hydrologic simulations the potential evapotranspiration of a given crop is defined as soil evaporation and plant transpiration under unlimited soil water supply and actual meteorological conditions it is an important agrometeorological parameter for climatological and hydrological studies as well as for irrigation planning and management labedzki et al 2011 the grid pet data is accessed from the earth2observe data portal https wci earth2observe eu portal 2 3 global gridded precipitation products in this study multiple precipitation products with daily temporal scale are considered for hydrological evaluation of daily simulation flow for different basin scale in the upper blue nile basin the products are described below climate prediction centre s morphing technique cmorph products are derived using the morphing technique that uses precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave mw observations and propagates these features in space using motion vectors derived from half hourly geostationary satellite infrared data joyce et al 2004 this is one of the satellite precipitation products available with different temporal and spatial scales for this study the gauge adjusted with 0 25 grid resolution at daily temporal scales is considered tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa post real time research version product 3b42v7 uses mw data to calibrate the infrared ir derived estimates and creates estimates that contain mw derived rainfall estimates when and where mw data are available and the calibrated ir estimates where mw data are not available huffman et al 2007 the same with the satellite product of cmorph the daily temporal scale with 0 25 spatial scale of trmm is considered for this study like satellite precipitation products reanalysis precipitation products are considered in the hydrological evaluation in this study reanalysis data provide a reconstruction of the historical global atmospheric circulation patterns through assimilation of available observation data into global climate model gcm predictions thus reanalysis data are widely considered to be a robust proxy of historic atmospheric observations that reproduce observed climate dynamics and are therefore useful for climate application studies where there are inadequate meteorological input data hwang et al 2013 reanalysis studies that merge climate model predictions and observation data have been undertaken to develop long term historical spatially and temporally distributed climatic variables such as precipitation temperature solar radiation humidity and wind speed era interim erai is reanalysis precipitation product with 0 25 spatial scales era interim land is a global land surface reanalysis data set covering the period 1979 2010 it describes the evolution of soil moisture soil temperature and snowpack era interim land is the result of a single 32 year simulation with the latest ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts land surface model driven by meteorological forcing from the era interim atmospheric reanalysis and precipitation adjustments based on monthly gpcp v2 1 global precipitation climatology project the horizontal resolution is about 80 km and the time frequency is 3 hly balsamo et al 2015 dee et al 2011 for this study the 3 hly precipitation data are aggregated into daily for the daily flow computation global precipitation climatology centre gpcc has been established in1989 on request of the world meteorological organization wmo and it is new global precipitation climatology version 1 1 and available from 1979 to 2015 beck et al 2017 schneider et al 2015 the product is available at different spatial scales 2 5 x 2 5 1 0 x 1 0 0 5 x 0 5 and 0 25 x 0 25 resolution with daily based estimates for this study the finer with 0 25 spatial and daily temporal scale is considered multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep retrospective is a new fully global precipitation dataset 1979 2015 with a high 3 hly temporal and 0 25 spatial resolutions beck et al 2017 the dataset is unique in that it takes advantage of a wide range of data sources including gauges satellites and atmospheric reanalysis models to obtain the best possible precipitation estimates at global scale for this study the 3 hly precipitation data are aggregated into a daily temporal scale for the simulation of daily flow 2 4 crest fully distributed hydrological model the coupled routing and excess storage model shen and hong 2014 is a distributed hydrological model developed to simulate the spatial and temporal variation of land surface and subsurface water fluxes and storages by cell to cell simulation crest s distinguishing characteristics include 1 distributed rainfall runoff generation and cell to cell routing 2 coupled runoff generation and routing 3 representation of sub grid cell variability of soil moisture storage capacity and sub grid cell routing via linear reservoirs the coupling between the runoff generation and routing mechanisms allows detailed and realistic treatment of hydrological variables such as soil moisture furthermore the representation of soil moisture variability and routing processes at the sub grid scale enables the crest model to be readily scalable to multi scale modelling research in this study crest v2 1 which involves an updated routing scheme based on fully distributed linear reservoir fdlrr scheme shen and hong 2014 has been implemented 2 4 1 model setup the requirements of data to setup the crest hydrological model is discussed below two types of datasets are required i the geospatial input data which are static in nature and ii the hydrometeorological input data which are dynamic time series in nature the geospatial data with the resolution of 1 km by 1 km resolution digital elevation model dem is extracted from the united states geological survey usgs national elevation dataset ned the dem is used to derive the geospatial data for crest model such as slope flow direction and flow accumulation and drainage area of the case studies the second input consists of the dynamic hydrometeorological datasets the meteorological datasets rainfall pet are geo referenced with the geographic location of the upper blue nile and gridded to the model grid resolution that is consistent with the satellite and reanalysis resolution of 0 25 the process of geo referencing and gridding is carried out using matlab daily time series observed streamflow hydrological dataset is used at the outlet of the watersheds to calibrate model parameters 2 4 2 calibration and parameters many of the parameters in the crest model are physical in nature and can in principle be estimated from field surveyed data such as soil texture land cover maps and vegetation coverage however in many large basins worldwide and particularly in the african context it is much more difficult to estimate model parameters from ancillary data models need to be trained through calibrated either manually automatically or using combined approaches given observations of rainfall and streamflow wang et al 2011 crest has 12 parameters and the model is calibrated for the three case studies using daily in situ gauge observed rainfall potential evapotranspiration pet and observed streamflow data calibration is done from 2000 to 2007 and validated from 2008 to 2012 two step approach is used to calibrate the crest model manual calibration of multi parameter model is time consuming and less practical first automatic calibration has been implemented to estimate the model parameters crest uses shuffle complex evolution university of arizona sce ua automatic kernel algorithm for calibration of the model using in situ gauged rainfall crest directly uses the screen output of sce ua codes in matlab written by duan et al 1992 the objective function value is the nsce of each simulation the automatic calibration results are shown in table 1 second sensitivity analysis is done to identify the most sensitive or dominant parameter in our previous paper lakew et al 2017 the rainfact parameter which is the multiplier on the precipitation field is identified as the most dominant parameter controlling the accuracy of the model performance the parameters that are calibrated using the gauged rainfall are used for the simulation forcing the global precipitation products the rainfact parameter is tweaked for each global precipitation product for the performance improvement of each watershed and precipitation products 2 5 performance in discharge simulation the performance of the model for the various precipitation products and catchments is evaluated using statistical comparisons between observed flow o and simulated flow c on the daily temporal resolution scale the q q plot is also used as additional visual comparison tool first for statistical goodness of fit of simulated flows we utilized the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 1 n s c e 1 q i o q i c 2 q i o q o 2 where q i o is the observed discharge of the ith day q i c is the simulated discharge of ith day and q o the average of all the daily observed discharge values if nsce 0 then the model provides no skill in relation to using the observed mean as a predictor and higher values indicating better agreement 2 c c q i o q o q i c q c q i o q o 2 q i c q c 2 second the pearson correlation coefficient cc is used to assess the agreement between simulated and observed discharge as follows where q c the average of all daily simulated discharge values third relative bias ratio assesses the systematic bias of the simulated discharge 3 b i a s q i c q i o q i o 100 the best skill occurs with nsce 1 cc 1 and bias 0 3 result and discussion 3 1 rainfall analysis the areal average global precipitation products used in this study are compared with the in situ gauged rainfall data fig 2 the areal mean annual observed rainfall of gilgel abbay kessie and eldiem watersheds for the study period 2000 2012 is 1750 1100 and 1400 mmyr 1 respectively in comparison to the in situ gauged rainfall most of the global precipitation products exhibit good agreement with gauged data except the erai product which overestimates the observed rainfall for the three case studies it is also noted that the accuracy of the areal average precipitation except erai slightly increases as a function of the size of the watershed and the magnitude of the areal mean annual observed rainfall decreases as the basin scale increases this is due to as the basin size increases it has the tendency to incorporate more lowlands that have insignificant amount of observed rainfall compared with the highlands and vice versa 3 2 simulated runoff analysis runoff simulations are carried out for multiple global precipitation products of gauge adjusted cmorph trmm tmpa 3b42v7 erai mswep and gpcc described in global gridded precipitation products section the model is calibrated using in situ gauge observed daily rainfall data for 8 years period 2000 2007 and validated for 5 years 2008 2012 the final list of parameters is shown in table 1 for illustration the focus is on the rainfact parameter sensitive which is the multiplier on the precipitation field and the adjustment factor of the precipitation either due to canopy interception or bias increasing the value of the rainfact result in increasing runoff and vice versa and has value of greater than zero if the parameter value is greater than one it shows that the average areal rainfall amount that is taken for that watershed underestimate the actual average areal rainfall of the region to capture the observed flow and vice versa the effect of the parameter shows that as the scale of the watershed increases the rainfact parameter value decreases from 1 4 to 0 67 as the basin scale increases it has the tendency to incorporate more lowlands and in this study more gauging station are taken from highlands that have a high amount of rainfall this makes as the basin scale increases the tendency to overestimate the actual rainfall of the region increases to correct this effect crest uses the rainfact value less than one of 0 67 for eldiem large scale and 0 76 for kessie medium scale that have relatively large and medium lowland coverage respectively gilgel abbay watershed has well distributed rain gauges that are set up in the central highlands of the basin the rainfact parameter is expected to be close to 1 however the parameter is 1 4 which is more than the expected value this indicates that there is a high groundwater contribution in the streamflow of gilgel abbay watershed that makes the rainfact parameter value greater than 1 melesse and abtew 2015 also investigated that the hydrological process governing runoff generation in gilgel abbay is dominated by saturation access and base flow contribution comes from the groundwater the performance of the simulated flow forcing the multiple global precipitation for gilgel abbay watershed is shown in fig 3 gilgel abbay watershed that has relatively very good rain gauge coverage the simulated flows from different products perform very well in the nsce evaluation from 0 70 to 0 81 at calibration period especially mswep shows outstanding performance of nsce 0 81 and gpcc also shows very good performance of nsce 0 80 the satellite precipitation product of cmorh 0 75 and trmm 0 70 shows also encouraging performance with slightly reduced performance from mswep and gpcc products as shown in fig 3 this shows that the newly released products of mswep and gpcc show significant improvement over the satellite products to fit with the observed runoff of gilgel abbay watershed that has relatively good rainfall coverage with high amount of records in the calibration period in the validation period the global precipitation products perform poorly relative to the calibration period together with the gauged rainfall this may be ascribable to the gauging station located near the bridge along the main road from bahir dar to addis ababa is shifted hundreds meters downstream from the original site due to the road construction after 2006 and the rating curve is not updated yet based on the bias performance evaluation in the gilgel abbay watershed the simulated flows from all products including satellite and reanalysis products underestimates the annual volume of the observed flow relatively cmorph shows the minimum bias value of 4 8 in the calibration period from the rest products this indicates that the simulated flow of satellite precipitation product of cmorph outperforms the rest global products including mswep 18 9 and gpcc 18 6 based on bias performance evaluation in the gilgel abbay watershed the validation period bias evaluation of the global products shows poor performance but still cmorph shows relatively better performance from the rest products this indicate that the newly released products mswep gpcc have the limitation to capture the total annual flow volume for the small scale of the basin gilgel abbay relative to the satellite products the correlation coefficient cc evaluation manifests that each product shows very good coefficient performance above 0 84 for both calibration and validation periods especially mswep shows the highest of 0 92 in the calibration period these all show that based on nsce cc statistical metrics performance measurement mswep product shows high performance over the rest precipitation products and it can be an alternative data source for water resources applications in the gilgel abbay watershed however based on bias evaluation it still requires improvement to capture the total observed annual flow volume of the gilgel abbay watershed relative to the gauged rainfall and even from the satellite product of cmorph the medium spatial scale of this study kessie has the effect of lake tana the lake is located at some upstream distance from the streamflow gauging station of kessie the daily performance of nsce for the simulated flows for the entire products show less performance ncse 0 73 at kessie relative to the gilgel abbay watershed in the calibration period this is imputable to the effect of lake tana that has a reservoir surface area 3500 square km located at the upstream of kessie streamflow gauging station the fully distributed hydrological model crest has the limitation to capture watersheds with the effect of reservoirs and doesn t incorporate the simulation of the reservoir in to the cell to cell routing for medium scale basin kessie to the effect of lake tana similar to gilgel abbay the simulated flow of the recently released products mswep 0 72 and gpcc 0 71 show better nsce performance over the satellite products of cmorph 0 62 and trmm 0 67 in the calibration period as shown in fig 4 for validation period except erai the global products show competitive nsce performance ranges from 0 60 to 0 64 the product erai shows the worst skill performance of nsce with a negative value for both calibration and validation periods relative to the small scale case study the medium scale of kessie nsce performance of the entire global products show relatively reduced performance that is due to the lake effect on the performance of the distributed model crest the bias performance of kessie is similar with gilgel abbay watershed the satellite driven simulation flow from cmorph manifests the minimum bias value of 16 in calibration and 22 in validation periods however attributable to the effect of lake tana the bias value in calibration period shows high value relative to gilgel abbay unlike the calibration period the validation period bias performance for kessie shows better performance relative to gilgel abbay watersheds as we discussed in the gilgel abbay performance the validation period shows poor performance due to the gauging station was moved from the original position onwards late of 2006 the medium scale of kessie station has the same correlation coefficient cc efficiency with the gilgel abbay it has very good performance of above 0 77 for the entire products for both calibration and validation periods the product from mswep shows the best correlation coefficient of 0 87 and 0 80 for calibration and validation periods respectively the product form mswep shows outstanding performance from the rest precipitation products and also yields consistent performance with the small scale watershed of gilgel abbay based on nsce and cc statistical metrics this indicates that mswep is also applicable for water resources application for medium scale of data scarce region in the upper blue nile basin ethiopia however similar to the small scale of gilgel abbay the medium scale of kessie the mswep bias performance needs improvement to capture the total volume annual flow compared with the gauged rainfall and even from the satellite product of cmorph both satellite and reanalysis except erai precipitation products show excellent performance nsce 0 75 in large scale eldiem compared with small and medium scale of the upper blue nile basin in both calibration and validation periods this is because that i the distributed hydrological model crest performance increases as the watershed area increases as distributed hydrological model the model error decreases with the increase of the drainage area ii eldiem station is located far from the lake tana reservoir effect in which the reservoir has insignificant effect for the measured flow iii it has consistent flow data with better quality records for both calibration and validation periods unlike gilgel abbay these reasons make the global precipitation product perform well from the small and medium scales based on ncse performance evaluation the mswep shows the highest performance of nsce 0 89 for both calibration and validation periods for the large scale of eldiem as shown in fig 5 erai shows encouraging skill to capture the observed flow with nsce value of 0 57 and 0 81 for calibration and validation periods respectively resembling the other case studies of small and medium scale basin minimum bias value is observed in satellite driven simulated flow of trmm 9 9 and cmorph 11 2 over the rest products in large basin scale eldiem in the calibration period the same with the previous small and medium scale case studies the bias statistic metric indicate that mswep product needs improvement to capture the total annual flow volume of the large basin scale eldiem in the upper blue nile high cc metric performance is observed at eldiem for both calibration and validation periods especially mswep shows the best cc performance of 0 96 for both calibration and validation periods the same with the small and medium spatial scale case studies mswep shows high performance metrics of ncse and cc this shows the product of mswep is a priori alternative data sources for water resources applications for the large basin scale of eldiem if precipitation adjustment is introduced to reduce the bias and to perform like the gauged rainfall the result of this study shows that the simulated flow forcing with both satellite and reanalysis products perform well to capture the observed flow however the product from erai shows poor skill and needs improvement to perform like the other products the newly released product of mswep shows consistent and very good performance based on nsce and cc performance evaluation for all three case studies for both calibration and validation periods in the upper blue nile basin the bias values reveal that the simulated flows have negative values indicates that all products have limitation to capture the peaks and underestimate the total volume of observed flows satellite products show minimum bias value and better performance to capture the observed flow over the rest for both calibration and validation periods the newly released products mswep and gpcc don t show any improvement regarding on bias performance to estimate the total volume of the runoff over the satellite products for different spatial scale case studies in the upper blue nile basin generally the mswep product perform very well and shows outstanding performance from the rest products including satellite and reanalysis precipitation products the rest global precipitation except mswep datasets do not take full advantage of the complementary nature of satellite and reanalysis data the product of mswep specifically designed for hydrological modeling the design philosophy of mswep was to optimally merge the highest quality precipitation data sources available as a function of timescale and location 3 2 1 quantile quantile evaluation the quantile quantile q q plot is a graphical technique for determining if two data sets come from populations with a common distribution a 45 degree reference line is also plotted if the two sets come from a population with the same distribution the points should fall approximately along this reference line wilk and gnanadesikan 1968 the greater the departure from this reference line the greater the evidence for the conclusion that the two data sets come from populations with different distributions or with the same distribution but biased or shifted with the mean fig 6 shows the q q plots of the simulated flow of multiple satellite and reanalysis precipitation products with a reference line of the observed flow for the three case studies in upper blue nile basin the result of the q q plot of the simulation mode for small scale basin study of gilgel abbay watershed shows that the global precipitation products try to capture very well the observed flow including erai especially the satellite product of cmorph shows good agreement with the reference line next to the simulated flow from gauged rainfall as shown in fig 6 a for medium spatial case study kessie with the exception of erai the whole global datasets of including the reanalysis products show good performance to capture the reference line as shown in fig 6 b especially mswep and gpcc products show high agreement with the reference line even from the gauged rainfall and the rest products to estimate the quantiles of the observed flow the q q plot of the simulation mode for the large spatial scale of eldiem manifests that the same with the kessie station the whole global precipitation products except erai perform very well to estimate the quantiles as well the products from mswep and gpcc shows the better agreement with reference line the result of q q plots of this study confirms that the global precipitation products mswep and gpcc products perform well erai shows poor performance for all case studies to estimate the quantiles of observed flow and it needs some improvement to perform like the other global precipitation products that are considered in this study generally mswep and gpcc show consistent and higher performance to estimate the quantile observed flow of each case study over the other products especially mswep can be an alternative source of data to estimate the quantile flow for water resources planning and management in data scarce areas of africa 4 conclusion the main purpose of this study is comparison and evaluation of globally available different precipitation products over a multi scale 1656 199 812 km2 and multi year 2000 2012 over three nested watersheds in the upper blue nile basin abbay using a fully distributed hydrological model crest the watersheds included are gilgel abbay 1656 km2 abbay at kessie 65 784 km2 and abbay at eldiem 199 812 km2 two satellite precipitation products of gauge adjusted cmorph and trmm tmpa 3b42v7 as well three different precipitation products of erai gpcc and mswep with 0 25 spatial resolution are evaluated for daily simulated flow the comparison is made between the simulated flow using rain gauge calibrated parameters forcing to the global precipitation products only tweaking the sensitive parameter of rainfact is carried out which is the rainfall adjustment factor on the field to improve the performance of the product for water resources application the overall performance evaluation of the statistical metrics nsce cc and the graphical technique of q q plot show that the products from mswep manifests consistent and higher performance for the nested watersheds with high improvement from the satellite products of trmm and cmorph as well from the rest precipitation products we can conclude that mswep reanalysis precipitation product can be a prior alternative source of data for various water resources applications in the blue nile basin for its predictive ability and the length of data availability which the product has advantage over the satellite products however based on the bias statistical metrics evaluation the product needs improvement to estimate the total annual flow volume of the observed flow for the three nested watersheds to perform close to the gauged rainfall and even from the satellite precipitation products of cmorph and trmm this study has considered only three different sized watersheds for the analysis further investigation is desirable to consider more watersheds on the basin

satellite and reanalysis precipitation 1 introduction hydrometeorological datasets have significant importance on the sustainable water resources management as well as for different socio economic activities however it is noted that acquiring accurate and consistent set of precipitation data is a challenging task throughout the world especially in africa the data assessment report of africa african climate policy centre acpc 2011 summarized as having poor spatial coverage with many stations became either non operational or report poor quality data with missing information lakew et al 2017 it is indicated that in some cases even the existing stations neither provide accurate observations nor quality controlled and transmitted to the database system hence the importance of improved global data remains one of the future hopes for the design and management of water resources in data scarce parts of the world the advent of global data sets such as satellite and reanalysis products play a great role in building a consistent set of hydrometeorological data that can be utilized for various purposes of water resources development and management in africa and globally however these globally available datasets have the limitations to estimate the observed rainfall and should be evaluated at the local basin scale for water resources applications evaluation of the amount of

the hydrological performance of gilgel abbay 1656 km2 watershed compared to the uncorrected cmorph product the products were simulated using semi distributed hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv hydrological model from 2003 to 2004 the above studies that were conducted in the upper blue nile basin ethiopia were carried out in small watersheds and for short simulation periods and they didn t reflect the effect of the size of nested watersheds with different spatial scales for different global precipitation products on multi year this research mainly aims to evaluate multiple global precipitation products for their hydrological performance and their potentials for water resources applications in data scarce basins the study is conducted in the upper blue nile basin over three nested watersheds 1656 199 812 km2 and multi year 2000 2012 using a daily temporal scale the multiple precipitation products included in the study are the gauge adjusted cmorph trmm tmpa 3b42v7 erai gpcc and mswep the crest fully distributed hydrological model shen and hong 2014 is used for the evaluation and comparision 2 data and method 2 1 the study area this study is conducted in the upper blue nile basin at three nested watersheds gilgel abbay small abbay at kessie station middle upper blue nile and the upper blue nile at eldiem at the border of ethiopia and sudan the descriptions of the watersheds are provided below 2 1 1 small scale gilgel abbay watershed gilgel abbay watershed which has a drainage area of 1656 km2 is located in the upper part of the abbay basin between 36 42 e 39 48 e and 9 15 n 12 45 n the streamflow station is located upstream of lake tana before it joins the lake fig 1 the landscape is complex topography with elevation ranging from 1880 m to 3530 m the watershed gets high amount of rainfall relative to the two medium and large scale case studies hence this small scale watershed is located at the central part of the basin of the highlands relatively high amount of rainfall is observed 2 1 2 medium scale kessie station abbay at kessie gauging station is located at the mid of the abbay basin including gilgel abbay watershed and lake tana which has a drainage area of 65 784 km2 in the upper blue nile basin between 36 42 e 39 48 e and 9 15 n 12 45 n fig 1 the landscape is complex topography with elevation range between 1102 m 4176 m the medium scale covers more area of the lowlands and arid regions with small amount of rainfall relative to the small scale of gilgel abbay 2 1 3 large scale eldiem eldiem station is located at the outlet of the abbay basin boarder of ethiopia and sudan and has a drainage area of 199 812 km2 including gilgel abbay and kessie is the main part of the ethiopian highlands between 34 24 e 39 48 e and 7 42 n 12 30 n the landscape is complex topography together with plain flatter area on the north west part and highly elevated complex mountains on the other parts of the basin with elevation range between 503 m 4176 m the large scale consists more are coverage of the low lands relative to the small and medium scale case studies high amount of rainfall at the central part of the basin and insignificant amount of rainfall is observed in wider area of the north west part of the basin with low elevation and arid area coverage the location of the three spatial scales and the rain gauge distribution is shown in fig 1 lakew et al 2019 2 2 hydrometeorological data the daily stream flow of the three case studies and the daily rainfall historical data are collected from ethiopia ministry of water irrigation and electricity and ethiopian meteorological agency respectively a total of 89 in situ rainfall measuring stations are used for the three case studies from the total 5 stations are used for gilgel abbay 51 stations for kessie and 89 stations for abbay at eldiem station as shown in fig 1 most of the available stations are located in the central and northern highlands that have a relatively higher amount of rainfall records the western part of the basin the lowlands has relatively lower rain gauge station coverage as shown in fig 1 the grid based 0 5 with daily temporal scale of potential evapotranspiration pet mm day that is derived from penman monteith method allen et al 1998 is used as an input to setup crest model for the hydrologic simulations the potential evapotranspiration of a given crop is defined as soil evaporation and plant transpiration under unlimited soil water supply and actual meteorological conditions it is an important agrometeorological parameter for climatological and hydrological studies as well as for irrigation planning and management labedzki et al 2011 the grid pet data is accessed from the earth2observe data portal https wci earth2observe eu portal 2 3 global gridded precipitation products in this study multiple precipitation products with daily temporal scale are considered for hydrological evaluation of daily simulation flow for different basin scale in the upper blue nile basin the products are described below climate prediction centre s morphing technique cmorph products are derived using the morphing technique that uses precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave mw observations and propagates these features in space using motion vectors derived from half hourly geostationary satellite infrared data joyce et al 2004 this is one of the satellite precipitation products available with different temporal and spatial scales for this study the gauge adjusted with 0 25 grid resolution at daily temporal scales is considered tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa post real time research version product 3b42v7 uses mw data to calibrate the infrared ir derived estimates and creates estimates that contain mw derived rainfall estimates when and where mw data are available and the calibrated ir estimates where mw data are not available huffman et al 2007 the same with the satellite product of cmorph the daily temporal scale with 0 25 spatial scale of trmm is considered for this study like satellite precipitation products reanalysis precipitation products are considered in the hydrological evaluation in this study reanalysis data provide a reconstruction of the historical global atmospheric circulation patterns through assimilation of available observation data into global climate model gcm predictions thus reanalysis data are widely considered to be a robust proxy of historic atmospheric observations that reproduce observed climate dynamics and are therefore useful for climate application studies where there are inadequate meteorological input data hwang et al 2013 reanalysis studies that merge climate model predictions and observation data have been undertaken to develop long term historical spatially and temporally distributed climatic variables such as precipitation temperature solar radiation humidity and wind speed era interim erai is reanalysis precipitation product with 0 25 spatial scales era interim land is a global land surface reanalysis data set covering the period 1979 2010 it describes the evolution of soil moisture soil temperature and snowpack era interim land is the result of a single 32 year simulation with the latest ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecasts land surface model driven by meteorological forcing from the era interim atmospheric reanalysis and precipitation adjustments based on monthly gpcp v2 1 global precipitation climatology project the horizontal resolution is about 80 km and the time frequency is 3 hly balsamo et al 2015 dee et al 2011 for this study the 3 hly precipitation data are aggregated into daily for the daily flow computation global precipitation climatology centre gpcc has been established in1989 on request of the world meteorological organization wmo and it is new global precipitation climatology version 1 1 and available from 1979 to 2015 beck et al 2017 schneider et al 2015 the product is available at different spatial scales 2 5 x 2 5 1 0 x 1 0 0 5 x 0 5 and 0 25 x 0 25 resolution with daily based estimates for this study the finer with 0 25 spatial and daily temporal scale is considered multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep retrospective is a new fully global precipitation dataset 1979 2015 with a high 3 hly temporal and 0 25 spatial resolutions beck et al 2017 the dataset is unique in that it takes advantage of a wide range of data sources including gauges satellites and atmospheric reanalysis models to obtain the best possible precipitation estimates at global scale for this study the 3 hly precipitation data are aggregated into a daily temporal scale for the simulation of daily flow 2 4 crest fully distributed hydrological model the coupled routing and excess storage model shen and hong 2014 is a distributed hydrological model developed to simulate the spatial and temporal variation of land surface and subsurface water fluxes and storages by cell to cell simulation crest s distinguishing characteristics include 1 distributed rainfall runoff generation and cell to cell routing 2 coupled runoff generation and routing 3 representation of sub grid cell variability of soil moisture storage capacity and sub grid cell routing via linear reservoirs the coupling between the runoff generation and routing mechanisms allows detailed and realistic treatment of hydrological variables such as soil moisture furthermore the representation of soil moisture variability and routing processes at the sub grid scale enables the crest model to be readily scalable to multi scale modelling research in this study crest v2 1 which involves an updated routing scheme based on fully distributed linear reservoir fdlrr scheme shen and hong 2014 has been implemented 2 4 1 model setup the requirements of data to setup the crest hydrological model is discussed below two types of datasets are required i the geospatial input data which are static in nature and ii the hydrometeorological input data which are dynamic time series in nature the geospatial data with the resolution of 1 km by 1 km resolution digital elevation model dem is extracted from the united states geological survey usgs national elevation dataset ned the dem is used to derive the geospatial data for crest model such as slope flow direction and flow accumulation and drainage area of the case studies the second input consists of the dynamic hydrometeorological datasets the meteorological datasets rainfall pet are geo referenced with the geographic location of the upper blue nile and gridded to the model grid resolution that is consistent with the satellite and reanalysis resolution of 0 25 the process of geo referencing and gridding is carried out using matlab daily time series observed streamflow hydrological dataset is used at the outlet of the watersheds to calibrate model parameters 2 4 2 calibration and parameters many of the parameters in the crest model are physical in nature and can in principle be estimated from field surveyed data such as soil texture land cover maps and vegetation coverage however in many large basins worldwide and particularly in the african context it is much more difficult to estimate model parameters from ancillary data models need to be trained through calibrated either manually automatically or using combined approaches given observations of rainfall and streamflow wang et al 2011 crest has 12 parameters and the model is calibrated for the three case studies using daily in situ gauge observed rainfall potential evapotranspiration pet and observed streamflow data calibration is done from 2000 to 2007 and validated from 2008 to 2012 two step approach is used to calibrate the crest model manual calibration of multi parameter model is time consuming and less practical first automatic calibration has been implemented to estimate the model parameters crest uses shuffle complex evolution university of arizona sce ua automatic kernel algorithm for calibration of the model using in situ gauged rainfall crest directly uses the screen output of sce ua codes in matlab written by duan et al 1992 the objective function value is the nsce of each simulation the automatic calibration results are shown in table 1 second sensitivity analysis is done to identify the most sensitive or dominant parameter in our previous paper lakew et al 2017 the rainfact parameter which is the multiplier on the precipitation field is identified as the most dominant parameter controlling the accuracy of the model performance the parameters that are calibrated using the gauged rainfall are used for the simulation forcing the global precipitation products the rainfact parameter is tweaked for each global precipitation product for the performance improvement of each watershed and precipitation products 2 5 performance in discharge simulation the performance of the model for the various precipitation products and catchments is evaluated using statistical comparisons between observed flow o and simulated flow c on the daily temporal resolution scale the q q plot is also used as additional visual comparison tool first for statistical goodness of fit of simulated flows we utilized the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 1 n s c e 1 q i o q i c 2 q i o q o 2 where q i o is the observed discharge of the ith day q i c is the simulated discharge of ith day and q o the average of all the daily observed discharge values if nsce 0 then the model provides no skill in relation to using the observed mean as a predictor and higher values indicating better agreement 2 c c q i o q o q i c q c q i o q o 2 q i c q c 2 second the pearson correlation coefficient cc is used to assess the agreement between simulated and observed discharge as follows where q c the average of all daily simulated discharge values third relative bias ratio assesses the systematic bias of the simulated discharge 3 b i a s q i c q i o q i o 100 the best skill occurs with nsce 1 cc 1 and bias 0 3 result and discussion 3 1 rainfall analysis the areal average global precipitation products used in this study are compared with the in situ gauged rainfall data fig 2 the areal mean annual observed rainfall of gilgel abbay kessie and eldiem watersheds for the study period 2000 2012 is 1750 1100 and 1400 mmyr 1 respectively in comparison to the in situ gauged rainfall most of the global precipitation products exhibit good agreement with gauged data except the erai product which overestimates the observed rainfall for the three case studies it is also noted that the accuracy of the areal average precipitation except erai slightly increases as a function of the size of the watershed and the magnitude of the areal mean annual observed rainfall decreases as the basin scale increases this is due to as the basin size increases it has the tendency to incorporate more lowlands that have insignificant amount of observed rainfall compared with the highlands and vice versa 3 2 simulated runoff analysis runoff simulations are carried out for multiple global precipitation products of gauge adjusted cmorph trmm tmpa 3b42v7 erai mswep and gpcc described in global gridded precipitation products section the model is calibrated using in situ gauge observed daily rainfall data for 8 years period 2000 2007 and validated for 5 years 2008 2012 the final list of parameters is shown in table 1 for illustration the focus is on the rainfact parameter sensitive which is the multiplier on the precipitation field and the adjustment factor of the precipitation either due to canopy interception or bias increasing the value of the rainfact result in increasing runoff and vice versa and has value of greater than zero if the parameter value is greater than one it shows that the average areal rainfall amount that is taken for that watershed underestimate the actual average areal rainfall of the region to capture the observed flow and vice versa the effect of the parameter shows that as the scale of the watershed increases the rainfact parameter value decreases from 1 4 to 0 67 as the basin scale increases it has the tendency to incorporate more lowlands and in this study more gauging station are taken from highlands that have a high amount of rainfall this makes as the basin scale increases the tendency to overestimate the actual rainfall of the region increases to correct this effect crest uses the rainfact value less than one of 0 67 for eldiem large scale and 0 76 for kessie medium scale that have relatively large and medium lowland coverage respectively gilgel abbay watershed has well distributed rain gauges that are set up in the central highlands of the basin the rainfact parameter is expected to be close to 1 however the parameter is 1 4 which is more than the expected value this indicates that there is a high groundwater contribution in the streamflow of gilgel abbay watershed that makes the rainfact parameter value greater than 1 melesse and abtew 2015 also investigated that the hydrological process governing runoff generation in gilgel abbay is dominated by saturation access and base flow contribution comes from the groundwater the performance of the simulated flow forcing the multiple global precipitation for gilgel abbay watershed is shown in fig 3 gilgel abbay watershed that has relatively very good rain gauge coverage the simulated flows from different products perform very well in the nsce evaluation from 0 70 to 0 81 at calibration period especially mswep shows outstanding performance of nsce 0 81 and gpcc also shows very good performance of nsce 0 80 the satellite precipitation product of cmorh 0 75 and trmm 0 70 shows also encouraging performance with slightly reduced performance from mswep and gpcc products as shown in fig 3 this shows that the newly released products of mswep and gpcc show significant improvement over the satellite products to fit with the observed runoff of gilgel abbay watershed that has relatively good rainfall coverage with high amount of records in the calibration period in the validation period the global precipitation products perform poorly relative to the calibration period together with the gauged rainfall this may be ascribable to the gauging station located near the bridge along the main road from bahir dar to addis ababa is shifted hundreds meters downstream from the original site due to the road construction after 2006 and the rating curve is not updated yet based on the bias performance evaluation in the gilgel abbay watershed the simulated flows from all products including satellite and reanalysis products underestimates the annual volume of the observed flow relatively cmorph shows the minimum bias value of 4 8 in the calibration period from the rest products this indicates that the simulated flow of satellite precipitation product of cmorph outperforms the rest global products including mswep 18 9 and gpcc 18 6 based on bias performance evaluation in the gilgel abbay watershed the validation period bias evaluation of the global products shows poor performance but still cmorph shows relatively better performance from the rest products this indicate that the newly released products mswep gpcc have the limitation to capture the total annual flow volume for the small scale of the basin gilgel abbay relative to the satellite products the correlation coefficient cc evaluation manifests that each product shows very good coefficient performance above 0 84 for both calibration and validation periods especially mswep shows the highest of 0 92 in the calibration period these all show that based on nsce cc statistical metrics performance measurement mswep product shows high performance over the rest precipitation products and it can be an alternative data source for water resources applications in the gilgel abbay watershed however based on bias evaluation it still requires improvement to capture the total observed annual flow volume of the gilgel abbay watershed relative to the gauged rainfall and even from the satellite product of cmorph the medium spatial scale of this study kessie has the effect of lake tana the lake is located at some upstream distance from the streamflow gauging station of kessie the daily performance of nsce for the simulated flows for the entire products show less performance ncse 0 73 at kessie relative to the gilgel abbay watershed in the calibration period this is imputable to the effect of lake tana that has a reservoir surface area 3500 square km located at the upstream of kessie streamflow gauging station the fully distributed hydrological model crest has the limitation to capture watersheds with the effect of reservoirs and doesn t incorporate the simulation of the reservoir in to the cell to cell routing for medium scale basin kessie to the effect of lake tana similar to gilgel abbay the simulated flow of the recently released products mswep 0 72 and gpcc 0 71 show better nsce performance over the satellite products of cmorph 0 62 and trmm 0 67 in the calibration period as shown in fig 4 for validation period except erai the global products show competitive nsce performance ranges from 0 60 to 0 64 the product erai shows the worst skill performance of nsce with a negative value for both calibration and validation periods relative to the small scale case study the medium scale of kessie nsce performance of the entire global products show relatively reduced performance that is due to the lake effect on the performance of the distributed model crest the bias performance of kessie is similar with gilgel abbay watershed the satellite driven simulation flow from cmorph manifests the minimum bias value of 16 in calibration and 22 in validation periods however attributable to the effect of lake tana the bias value in calibration period shows high value relative to gilgel abbay unlike the calibration period the validation period bias performance for kessie shows better performance relative to gilgel abbay watersheds as we discussed in the gilgel abbay performance the validation period shows poor performance due to the gauging station was moved from the original position onwards late of 2006 the medium scale of kessie station has the same correlation coefficient cc efficiency with the gilgel abbay it has very good performance of above 0 77 for the entire products for both calibration and validation periods the product from mswep shows the best correlation coefficient of 0 87 and 0 80 for calibration and validation periods respectively the product form mswep shows outstanding performance from the rest precipitation products and also yields consistent performance with the small scale watershed of gilgel abbay based on nsce and cc statistical metrics this indicates that mswep is also applicable for water resources application for medium scale of data scarce region in the upper blue nile basin ethiopia however similar to the small scale of gilgel abbay the medium scale of kessie the mswep bias performance needs improvement to capture the total volume annual flow compared with the gauged rainfall and even from the satellite product of cmorph both satellite and reanalysis except erai precipitation products show excellent performance nsce 0 75 in large scale eldiem compared with small and medium scale of the upper blue nile basin in both calibration and validation periods this is because that i the distributed hydrological model crest performance increases as the watershed area increases as distributed hydrological model the model error decreases with the increase of the drainage area ii eldiem station is located far from the lake tana reservoir effect in which the reservoir has insignificant effect for the measured flow iii it has consistent flow data with better quality records for both calibration and validation periods unlike gilgel abbay these reasons make the global precipitation product perform well from the small and medium scales based on ncse performance evaluation the mswep shows the highest performance of nsce 0 89 for both calibration and validation periods for the large scale of eldiem as shown in fig 5 erai shows encouraging skill to capture the observed flow with nsce value of 0 57 and 0 81 for calibration and validation periods respectively resembling the other case studies of small and medium scale basin minimum bias value is observed in satellite driven simulated flow of trmm 9 9 and cmorph 11 2 over the rest products in large basin scale eldiem in the calibration period the same with the previous small and medium scale case studies the bias statistic metric indicate that mswep product needs improvement to capture the total annual flow volume of the large basin scale eldiem in the upper blue nile high cc metric performance is observed at eldiem for both calibration and validation periods especially mswep shows the best cc performance of 0 96 for both calibration and validation periods the same with the small and medium spatial scale case studies mswep shows high performance metrics of ncse and cc this shows the product of mswep is a priori alternative data sources for water resources applications for the large basin scale of eldiem if precipitation adjustment is introduced to reduce the bias and to perform like the gauged rainfall the result of this study shows that the simulated flow forcing with both satellite and reanalysis products perform well to capture the observed flow however the product from erai shows poor skill and needs improvement to perform like the other products the newly released product of mswep shows consistent and very good performance based on nsce and cc performance evaluation for all three case studies for both calibration and validation periods in the upper blue nile basin the bias values reveal that the simulated flows have negative values indicates that all products have limitation to capture the peaks and underestimate the total volume of observed flows satellite products show minimum bias value and better performance to capture the observed flow over the rest for both calibration and validation periods the newly released products mswep and gpcc don t show any improvement regarding on bias performance to estimate the total volume of the runoff over the satellite products for different spatial scale case studies in the upper blue nile basin generally the mswep product perform very well and shows outstanding performance from the rest products including satellite and reanalysis precipitation products the rest global precipitation except mswep datasets do not take full advantage of the complementary nature of satellite and reanalysis data the product of mswep specifically designed for hydrological modeling the design philosophy of mswep was to optimally merge the highest quality precipitation data sources available as a function of timescale and location 3 2 1 quantile quantile evaluation the quantile quantile q q plot is a graphical technique for determining if two data sets come from populations with a common distribution a 45 degree reference line is also plotted if the two sets come from a population with the same distribution the points should fall approximately along this reference line wilk and gnanadesikan 1968 the greater the departure from this reference line the greater the evidence for the conclusion that the two data sets come from populations with different distributions or with the same distribution but biased or shifted with the mean fig 6 shows the q q plots of the simulated flow of multiple satellite and reanalysis precipitation products with a reference line of the observed flow for the three case studies in upper blue nile basin the result of the q q plot of the simulation mode for small scale basin study of gilgel abbay watershed shows that the global precipitation products try to capture very well the observed flow including erai especially the satellite product of cmorph shows good agreement with the reference line next to the simulated flow from gauged rainfall as shown in fig 6 a for medium spatial case study kessie with the exception of erai the whole global datasets of including the reanalysis products show good performance to capture the reference line as shown in fig 6 b especially mswep and gpcc products show high agreement with the reference line even from the gauged rainfall and the rest products to estimate the quantiles of the observed flow the q q plot of the simulation mode for the large spatial scale of eldiem manifests that the same with the kessie station the whole global precipitation products except erai perform very well to estimate the quantiles as well the products from mswep and gpcc shows the better agreement with reference line the result of q q plots of this study confirms that the global precipitation products mswep and gpcc products perform well erai shows poor performance for all case studies to estimate the quantiles of observed flow and it needs some improvement to perform like the other global precipitation products that are considered in this study generally mswep and gpcc show consistent and higher performance to estimate the quantile observed flow of each case study over the other products especially mswep can be an alternative source of data to estimate the quantile flow for water resources planning and management in data scarce areas of africa 4 conclusion the main purpose of this study is comparison and evaluation of globally available different precipitation products over a multi scale 1656 199 812 km2 and multi year 2000 2012 over three nested watersheds in the upper blue nile basin abbay using a fully distributed hydrological model crest the watersheds included are gilgel abbay 1656 km2 abbay at kessie 65 784 km2 and abbay at eldiem 199 812 km2 two satellite precipitation products of gauge adjusted cmorph and trmm tmpa 3b42v7 as well three different precipitation products of erai gpcc and mswep with 0 25 spatial resolution are evaluated for daily simulated flow the comparison is made between the simulated flow using rain gauge calibrated parameters forcing to the global precipitation products only tweaking the sensitive parameter of rainfact is carried out which is the rainfall adjustment factor on the field to improve the performance of the product for water resources application the overall performance evaluation of the statistical metrics nsce cc and the graphical technique of q q plot show that the products from mswep manifests consistent and higher performance for the nested watersheds with high improvement from the satellite products of trmm and cmorph as well from the rest precipitation products we can conclude that mswep reanalysis precipitation product can be a prior alternative source of data for various water resources applications in the blue nile basin for its predictive ability and the length of data availability which the product has advantage over the satellite products however based on the bias statistical metrics evaluation the product needs improvement to estimate the total annual flow volume of the observed flow for the three nested watersheds to perform close to the gauged rainfall and even from the satellite precipitation products of cmorph and trmm this study has considered only three different sized watersheds for the analysis further investigation is desirable to consider more watersheds on the basin

8402,the purpose of the study was to analyze flooding hazard and risk from geographic information systems gis based multicriteria perspective in ambo town and its watershed and proposes strategic measures for sustainable flooding disaster risk management in urban watershed land use land cover elevation slope drainage density soil and rainfall were considered as important flooding hazard factors analysis of flooding risk was undertaken for ambo town s watershed using flooding hazard layer and the two elements at risk namely human population and land use weighted linear combination wlc method was used in the process of criteria map aggregation for both flooding hazard and flooding risk the result of the flooding hazard in the watershed reveals that more proportion of the watershed is high and very high flooding hazard area 60 58 moreover more proportion of the town is high and very high flooding hazard area 66 87 the result of the flooding risk in the watershed reveals that more proportion of the watershed is high and very high flooding risk area 41 76 moreover half of the town is high and very high flooding risk area 50 09 an integrated basin wide approach to flood management should be practiced as it is essential to address multiple water related issues at watershed level moreover environmental education should be emphasized to build civic responsibility among the citizens keywords flooding hazard land use management risk spatial planning 1 introduction scholars of sustainable disaster risk management assert that spatial planning plays a significant role in integrated disaster risk management particularly through its potential contribution to long term disaster mitigation basawaraja et al 2011 steinberg and lindfield 2012 wapwera and egbu 2013 watson and agbola 2013 undp 2015 in other words effective risk based planning aims to minimize damages to people and assets before a disaster strikes but its performance in disaster mitigation requires a high level of technical and political cooperation and coordination and equally a commitment from other societal stakeholders as partners in sustainable development onyenechere 2010 sutanta 2012 watson and agbola 2013 spatial planning is increasingly being considered as an important mechanism in coping with flood risk schmidt thomé 2006 a dewan 2013 a m dewan 2013 khailani and perera 2013 one of the reasons for this is that engineering approaches are increasingly expensive and cannot provide complete certainty of protection against flooding risk in other words planning is considered as the regulation of physical implementation as well as the process of policy making that guides spatial development this process is claimed to mainly involve the interaction and collaboration between actors both public and private kazmierczak and cavan 2011 lu 2014 however spatial planning is absent in most developing countries due to the stronghold by the traditional master planning approach to achieve controlled urban development and its management watson 2009 wapwera and egbu 2013 it is vital to appreciate the role of geographic information system gis and remote sensing technologies in planning for flooding disaster risks in urban watersheds for instance geospatial technology provides the best potential to analyze and provide results required for prompt and effective decision making on floods dewan and yamaguchi 2009 manfreda et al 2011 suriya and mudgal 2011 albano et al 2014 samela et al 2016 2017b given that flood hazard is spatial phenomenon the application of gis and remote sensing techniques are essential to the flood hazard risk management process for instance geographical information systems gis with their ability to handle spatial data are an appropriate tool for processing spatial data on flood risk alfasi et al 2012 uddin et al 2013 samela et al 2018 moreover flood hazard and risk maps are effective tools for reducing flood damage zerger and smith 2003 marchi et al 2010 sayers et al 2013 wondim 2016 hazard zoning is also appreciated by scholars of disaster risk management in urban watersheds as it provide a detailed overview of the hazard situation and a basis for spatial planning processes balaban 2009 adedeji et al 2012 sutanta 2012 santato et al 2013 despite the aforementioned benefits of spatial planning for sustainable disaster risk management in urban watersheds in developing countries lack of proper spatial planning and land use management coupled with poor adaptive capacity of governments to ensure good urban governance exacerbate the cases of urban flooding disaster risk multi criteria analysis methods are claimed as decision support tools for dealing with complex decision constellations where technological economical ecological and social aspects have to be covered these methods have been repeatedly combined with geographical information systems gis and are therefore suitable to optimize the landuse planning levy 2005 wang et al 2011 bathrellos et al 2012 chowdary et al 2013 li et al 2013 yang et al 2013 guo et al 2014 spatial multi criteria decision assessment analysis mca or multi criteria evaluation mce has received renewed interest because of the following 1 it allows improved decision making 2 it supports developing and evaluating alternative plans and 3 it is predominantly

torrential down pours are common in most parts of the country as the topography of the country is rather rugged with distinctly defined watercourses large scale flooding is rare and limited to the lowland areas where major rivers cross to neighboring countries however intense rainfall in the highlands could cause flooding of settlements close to any stretch of river course achamyeleh 2003 chibssa 2007 alemu 2011 dessie and tadesse 2013 alemu 2015 getahun and gebre 2015 previous studies undertaken on the environmental problems of ambo town and its watershed identified low infiltration

while the lowest elevation of the watershed is 1834 m above sea level the slope of the watershed ranges between 0 and 32 5 the seven soil types dominating the watershed include chromic luvisols chromic vertisols eutric cambisols eutric nitisols leptosols orthic luvisols and pellic vertisos ogato 2019 the watershed is drained by perennial major rivers huluka debis and taltale minor seasonal rivers aleltu awaro boji dobi kerise chafe jara jalina maja solbe jabdu and sankale and a number of intermittent or seasonal streams within the watershed ogato et al 2017 the rainfall of the area is bimodal with unpredictable short rains from march to april and the main season ranging over june to september the highest mean total annual rainfall of the watershed over 32 years 1984 2015 was 1181 mm while the lowest was 1036 mm the lowest and highest annual average temperature are 13 and 27 c respectively atnafe et al 2015 ambo town in the watershed represent the urban feature of the watershed the human population of ambo town has been growing rapidly over the past few years according to csa 2017 the population of the town was 76 544 with the growth rate of 2 5 the poor quality of housing and inability of the administration to increase supply could be taken as key indicators that a wide reform is necessary for ambo town ambo is one of the oldest towns in ethiopia established in 1889 it is among a few privileged towns of its time to have its own municipal administration since 1931 and a master plan since 1983 united nations human settlements programme un habitat 2008 ogato et al 2017 2 2 methods of data collection landsat images of 2015 digital map on shape file with the scale of 1 50 000 from ethiopian mapping authority rainfall data 1984 2015 for the study watershed from the ethiopian metheorology agency digital elevation model dem of the watershed soil types of ethiopia human population and flood points in the watershed were the type of data used for the study the sources of data included central statistical authority csa of ethiopia ethiopian mapping agency ema ethiopian meteorology agency landsat website of www glovis usgs gov urban and rural communities in huluka watershed urban planners of ambo town and land use planners and managers in the watershed to collect relevant data to analyze flooding hazard and risk in the watershed online satellite imagery monkkonen 2008 gondo and zibabgwe 2010 field observation and document review were employed 2 3 methods of data analysis 2 3 1 flooding hazard factors the flooding hazard factors were determined by literature review personal observation and discussion with experts and local residents as far as the key informants experts and local residents are concerned 15 experts and 15 local elders were interviewed to decide the important factors causing flooding hazard accordingly land use land cover elevation slope drainage density soil and rainfall were considered as important flooding hazard factors in ambo town s watershed 1 land use land cover factor many scholars in the field of flooding risk management attest that land use land cover change is one of the major contributor of flooding as urban expansion increases impervious cover increases and forest cover decreases in urban areas contributing to increase in run off tucci 2007 jha et al 2012 fura 2013 mngutyo and ogwuche 2013 hall et al 2014 the existing land use classes of the area were further reclassified into five groups in order of their capacity to increase or decrease the rate of flooding from very highly susceptible to very low susceptible accordingly water body was ranked with the value of 5 as it is very highly susceptible to flooding hazard built up area land use land cover type was assigned the value of 4 as it is highly susceptible to flooding hazard cultivated land use land cover type was assigned the value of 3 as it is moderately susceptible to flooding hazard grassland land use land cover type was assigned the value of 2 as it is low susceptible to flooding hazard forest land use land cover type was assigned the value of 1 as it is very low susceptible to flooding hazard 2 elevation factor elevation has a key role in controlling the movement of the overflow direction and in the depth of the water level gigovi c et al 2017 for elevation factor the elevation raster map was prepared using the digital elevation model dem and slope generation tools in arcgis software the elevation raster layer was further reclassified into five sub groups using standard classification schemes namely equal interval this classification scheme divides the range of attribute values into equal sized sub ranges specifying the number of intervals while arc map determines where the breaks should be and new values re assigned in order of flood hazard rating in this classification process the lowest elevation category is ranked to the value of 5 as it has very high susceptibility to flooding hazard while the highest elevation category is ranked to the value of 1 as it has very low susceptibility 3 slope factor the slope is the ratio of steepness or the degree of inclination of a feature relative to the horizontal plane rimba et al 2017 slope is an important indicator of surface zones which are highly prone to flooding slope is a major factor in determining the rate and duration of water flow on the flatter surface water is moving more slowly collects longer and accumulates so these areas are riskier with respect to the occurrence of floods in relation to the steeper surfaces gigovi c et al 2017 rimba et al 2017 for slope factor the slope raster map was prepared using the digital elevation model dem and slope generation tools in arcgis software the slope raster layer was further reclassified into five sub groups using standard classification schemes namely equal interval this classification scheme divides the range of attribute values into equal sized sub ranges specifying the number of intervals while arc map determines where the breaks should be and new values re assigned in order of flood hazard rating in this classification process the lowest slope category is ranked to the value of 5 as it has very high susceptibility to flooding hazard while the highest slope category is ranked to the value of 1 as it has very low susceptibility 4 drainage density factor drainage density dd a fundamental concept in hydrologic analysis is defined as the ratio of the length of drainage per basin area drainage density is controlled by permeability erodability of surface materials vegetation slope and time flooding in africa has been attributed to inadequate drainage causing overland flow and poor waste collection which can block drainage and water channels causing overland and river fluvial flooding few et al 2004 tucci 2007 rimba et al 2017 drainage density is an inverse function of infiltration greater drainage density indicates high runoff for basin area along with erodible geologic materials and less prone to flood thus the rating for drainage density decreases with increasing drainage density chibssa 2007 wondim 2016 drainage density map could be derived from the drainage map i e drainage map is overlaid on watershed map to find out the ratio of total length of streams in the watershed to total area of watershed and is categorized the drainage density of the watershed is calculated as ouma and tateishi 2014 d l a where d drainage density of watershed l total length of drainage channel in watershed km a total area of watershed km2 for drainage density factor dem was used to extract the drainage network from which the drainage density of the streams was calculated using the spatial analyst extension in arcgis environment line density module was used to compute drainage density of the waterhsed line density module calculates a magnitude per unit area from polyline features that fall within a radius around each cell the density layer is further reclassified into five sub group using standard classification schemes namely equal interval in this classification the highest drainage density category is ranked to 1 as it has very low susceptibility to flooding hazard while the lowest drainage density category is ranked to 5 as it has very high susceptibility 5 soil factor soil characteristics in a watershed such as soil layer thickness permeability infiltration rate and the degree of moisture in the soil before the rain event have a direct effect on the rainfall runoff process zhiyu et al 2013 rimba et al 2017 the structure and infiltration capacity of soils will also have an important impact on the efficiency of the soil to act as a sponge and soak up water different types of soils have differing capacities the chance of flood hazard increases with decrease in soil infiltration capacity which causes increase in surface runoff when water is supplied at a rate that exceeds the soil s infiltration capacity it moves down slope as runoff on sloping land and can lead to flooding ouma and tateishi 2014 for soil factor the soil factor of the study area was derived from the fao standard classification of ethiopian soil mesfine 1998 food and agricultural organization fao 2006 assen and tegene 2008 chekol 2014 assefa 2015 the characteristics of each soil group were analyzed based on hydrologic soil grouping system to this end the soil group of the study area was grouped into five general classes and converted to raster format moreover the soil raster layer group was reclassified into five groups and new values were reassigned in order of their flood hazard rating soil type that has very high capacity to generate very high flood rate is ranked to 5 and the one with very low capacity in generating flood rate is ranked to 1 accordingly pellic and chromic vertisols were ranked to the value of 5 as they have very high susceptibility to flooding hazard leptosols were ranked to the value of 4 as they have high susceptibility orthic and chromic luvisols were ranked to the value of 3 as they have moderate susceptibility eutric nitisols were ranked to the value of 2 as they have low susceptibility eutric cambisols were ranked to the value of 1 as they have very low susceptibility to flooding hazard 6 rainfall factor many scholars in the field of flooding risk management contend that flooding risk is the most widespread climate change related disaster risk in the world and historically floods have been the most prevalent cause of death from natural disasters zhiyu et al 2013 jha et al 2012 santato et al 2013 changes in the global climate and individual climatic variables can affect floods in various ways together with soil moisture and snow storage generally a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapour which may increase heavy precipitation and therefore floods hall et al 2014 ouma and tateishi 2014 more extreme rainfall means more likelihood of floods particularly flash floods few et al 2004 guo et al 2014 moreover flooding is one of the most widespread of climatic hazards and poses multiple risks to human health few et al 2004 dang et al 2011 for rainfall factor point rainfall data for 32 years 1984 2015 collected at ten stations ambo plant protection research center ginchi asgori busa gedo jeldu tikur enchini tulu bolo welenkomi and woliso within and around the watershed were received from the ethiopian metrology agency as the data received were monthly total rainfall total annual rainfall for each year at each station and mean of 32 years 1984 2015 for each station were calculated and then interpolated to inverse distance weight idw in arcgis environment then it was converted to raster layer to create a continuous raster rainfall data within and around the watershed this was finally reclassified into five classes using equal interval in this classification the highest rainfall category was ranked to the value of 5 as it has very high contribution for flooding hazard on the other hand the lowest rainfall category is ranked to the value of 1 as it has very low contribution for flooding hazard 2 3 2 flooding risk factors to analyze flooding risk in ambo town and its watershed flooding hazard layer population density and land use land cover type were considered as three important factors these three factors were considered to be equally important in the weighted overlay process 1 population density factor gross population density calculation method is used to calculate the number of person per square kilometers in the watershed to this end the human population estimation for the year 2017 at each village in the watershed was considered then population shape file was converted to raster layer using conversion tools feature to raster then the data layer was reclassified into five sub factors which are classified using equal interval method and new values re assigned in order of increasing number of population that is more susceptible to flood hazard the population density was reclassified in the assumption that the denser the population the more vulnerable it will be to flood hazard accordingly the highest population density category is ranked to the value of 5 as it is very highly susceptible to flooding risk on the other hand the lowest population density category was ranked to the value of 1 as its susceptibility to flooding risk is very low 2 land use type factor the existing land use classes of the area water body built up cultivated land grass land and forest were reclassified into five groups in order of their susceptibility to flooding risk the land use types of the sub basin were reclassified into a common scale in order of sensitivity for the flood risk analysis accordingly water body was ranked with the value of 5 as it is very highly susceptible to flooding risk built up area land use land cover type was ranked with the value of 4 as it is highly susceptible to flooding risk cultivated land was ranked with the value of 3 as it is moderately susceptible to flooding risk grassland land use land cover type was ranked with the value of 2 as it is low susceptible to flooding risk forest land use land cover type was assigned the value of 1 as it is very low susceptible to flooding risk 3 flooding hazard layer flooding hazard layer was considered as one of the flooding risk contributing factor in ambo town s watershed very low low moderate high and very high flooding hazard classes were reclassified based on their susceptibility to flooding risk very high flood hazard layer was ranked with the value of 5 as it has the highest susceptibility to flooding risk on the other hand very low flooding hazard layer was ranked with the value of 1 as it has the lowest susceptibility to flooding risk 2 3 3 integration of analytical hierarchy process ahp into geographic information systems gis this study employed the geographic information systems gis based multicriateria analysis approach wang et al 2011 zou et al 2013 gigovi c et al 2017 rimba et al 2017 to analyze flood hazard and risk in ambo town and its watershed flood risk evaluation is an intrinsically complex multidimensional process including both quantitative and qualitative factors which may be uncertain yang et al 2013 analytic hierarchy process established by saaty is a method to solve multiple criteria decision problems by setting their priorities analytical hierarchy process ahp was adopted for multicriteria decisions in urban flooding hazard and risk analysis yahaya et al 2010 chowdary et al 2013 li et al 2013 guo et al 2014 rimba et al 2017 in ahp multiple pairwise comparisons are based on a standardized comparison scale of nine levels saaty 1977 the nine points are chosen because psychologists conclude that nine objects are the most that an individual can simultaneously compare and consistently rank table 1 pairwise judgements are made based on the best information available and the decision maker s knowledge and experience chen et al 2011 dang et al 2011 youssef et al 2011 bathrellos et al 2012 ouma and tateishi 2014 gigovi c et al 2017 the process of ahp can be summarized in four steps construct the decision hierarchy determine the relative importance of attributes and sub attributes evaluate each alternative and calculate its overall weight with regard to each attribute and check the consistency of the subjective evaluations bathrellos et al 2012 yang et al 2013 ouma and tateishi 2014 let c cj j 1 2 n be the set of criteria the result of the pairwise comparison on n criteria can be summarized in an n n evaluation matrix a in which every element aij i j 1 2 n is the quotient of weights of the criteria as given in eq 1 ouma and tateishi 2014 1 a a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a a n a n 1 a n 2 a n n a i i 1 a j j 1 a j j a j j 0 the right eigen value v corresponding to the maximum eigen value λmax is calculated to normalize and find the relative weight av of the matrix by following eq 2 ouma and tateishi 2014 2 aw λmax w it is highly recommended that the pairwise comparisons in ahp are completely consistent and in this case the matrix a has rank 1 and λmax n in this case weights can be obtained by normalizing any of the rows or columns of the matrix a the quality of the output of the ahp is claimed to be strictly related to the consistency of the pairwise comparison judgments the consistency is normally defined by the relation between the entries of a aij ajk aik the consistency index ci is given by eq 3 ouma and tateishi 2014 3 ci λmax n n 1 where λmax represents the sum of the products between the sum of each column of the comparison matrix and the relative weights and n represents the size of the matrix the final calculation is the consistency ratio cr which is the ratio of the ci and random index ri as expressed in eq 4 4 cr ci ri where ci represents the consistency index ri is the random index representing the consistency of a randomly generated pairwise comparison matrix it is derived as average random consistency index computed by saaty 1980 cr represent consistency ratio the values of ri are tabulated in table 2 and ri value for six parameters is 1 24 saaty 1980 the maximum threshold of ci is 0 1 and cr 10 the rational value is when the ci and cr have fulfilled the maximum threshold value the usage of cr lets the user to conclude whether the evaluations are sufficiently consistent table 3 the normalized pair wise comparison matrix is derived by making equal to 1 the sum of the entries on each column finally the objective weight of each factor was built by averaging the entries on each row table 4 the basic advantage is that the ahp limits the cognitive demand on the decision maker and provides an approach for checking the consistency of the comparisons the consistency ratio cr is used in order to check inconsistency and limit the possibility of random selection during the construction of the comparison matrix bathrellos et al 2012 ouma and tateishi 2014 λmax for flood contributing factors in the watershed 2 13 0 42 5 0 23 7 9 0 15 12 5 0 1 19 0 06 28 0 04 6 4 cr ci ri ci λmax n n 1 ri random consistency index and ri 1 24 for six factors table 2 n number of criteria 6 λmax represents the sum of the products between the sum of each column of the comparison matrix and the relative weights cr for the flood contributing factors in ambo town s watershed is 0 06 which is less than the standard 0 1 hence the pair wise matrix ranking is accepted to calculate the weight and ranking in each factor the pair wise comparison matrix and factor map are employed the weight value provided the prioritized factor expressed as a percentage value between 0 and 100 using a linear weighted combination the sum of weight was expressed as 100 a summary of targeted factors their weights and rankings are listed in table 5 hereunder the information provided in the table was applied to generate the flooding hazard map in the study watershed the ranking of each reclassified factor is based on the literature review expert interview and local residents interview the range of ranking was 1 5 the highest influence factor was rank 5 and the lowest influence factor was 1 the order of normalized weight was land cover 42 slope 23 soil type 15 rainfall 10 drainage density 6 and elevation 4 looking at the weight of each factor one can see that land cover has the highest weight it implies that land cover has more contribution to flooding than other factors once the weight in each factor was determined the multi criteria analysis was performed to produce a flooding hazard map by using the gis approach in other words weighted linear combination wlc method is used in the process of criteria map aggregation the underpinning reason for employing wlc is that low scores in one criterion are compensated by high scores in another one in the process of aggregating the criteria flooding hazard maps in other words the weighted linear combination wlc method multiplies each fuzzy standardized criteria map with criteria weights obtaining different variations from the ahp method and then sums the results bathrellos et al 2012 gigovi c et al 2017 accordingly flooding hazard map for the watershed was computed as shown in eq 5 5 flooding hazard index 0 42xlanduse landcover 0 23xslope 0 15xsoil type 0 1xrainfall 0 06xdrainage density 0 04xelevation the result was the flooding hazard area in the watershed it was categorized into five hazard classes very low low moderate high and very high to compute the flooding risk map for the watershed a weight linear combination was applied as shown in eq 6 6 flooding risk index 0 3333xflooding hazard 0 3333xpopulation density person per square kilometers 0 3333xland use land cover flood risk analysis and mapping for the watershed was done using the flooding hazard layer and the two elements at risk namely population and land use land cover wondim 2016 these three factors were considered to be equally important in the weighted linear combination wlc process a summary of targeted factors their weights and rankings are listed in table 6 hereunder the information provided in the table was applied to generate the flooding risk map in ambo town s watershed the result was the flooding risk area in the watershed it was categorized into five risk classes very low low moderate high and very high 3 results 3 1 flood hazard analysis and mapping in ambo town s watershed 3 1 1 contributing

figs 6 and 7 4 discussion flood disasters are among the most frequent and devastating types of disasters over the world it is necessary to analyze flood risk to ensure healthy and sustainable economic development and flood risk assessment has become worldwide one of the hot issues in the field of natural science and technology yahaya et al 2010 zou et al 2013 scholars of sustainable urban flooding risk management assert that comprehensive flood risk assessment is a synthetic evaluation and consists of many factors including the hazard of disaster inducing factors and disaster breeding environment as well as the vulnerability of hazards bearing bodies zerger and smith 2003 sayers et al 2013 zou et al 2013 guo et al 2014 for instance assessing areas vulnerable to flooding disasters

moisture in the soil before the rain event have a direct effect on the rainfall runoff process zhiyu et al 2013 ouma and tateishi 2014 rimba et al 2017 observed and projected patterns of climate change can have an amplifying effect on existing flood risk for example changing local rainfall patterns may lead to more frequent and higher level of floods from rivers and more intense flash flooding andjelkovic 2001 few et al 2004 jha et al 2012 berggren et al 2013 hall et al 2014 this study considered flooding hazard layer population density and land use land cover type as the three important factors for flooding risk mapping and these three factors were considered to be equally important in the weighted overlay process chibssa 2007 wondim 2016 scholars of sustainable urban flooding risk management contend that flooding risk is contributed to by two components flood hazard and flood vulnerability the flood hazard component represents physical processes whereas flood vulnerability represents susceptibility to damage or loss the risk of human lives property or human activities dang et al 2011 the flood risk maps thus developed are useful to policy makers and responsible authorities as well as to local residents in finding suitable measures for reducing flood risk in the study area dang et al 2011 without flood risk maps it is not easy to identify the areas at risk and without a systematic way of making development decisions there will be no consistency in deciding how and where to reduce urban encroachment into at risk areas the availability of the land use plan gives readily available guidance to developers planners and others on which areas may be developed for which uses and allows the incorporation of flood risk information into their decisions and judgements zerger and smith 2003 sayers et al 2013 urbanization as the defining feature of the world s demographic growth is implicated in and compounds flood risk few et al 2004 jha et al 2012 santato et al 2013 few et al 2004 contend that human vulnerability to floods is affected by drivers of change like population growth and settlement pattern in other words as cities become larger and larger and as populations become more and more urbanized urban environmental effects will increase andjelkovic 2001 few et al 2004 santato et al 2013 population growth is asserted to be one of the contributors for urban flooding risk as human population in cities and towns in developing countries is rapidly growing and there is settlement of watersheds and valley bottoms greatly altering drainage patterns and destabilizing slopes and resulting in increasing the risks of flooding and landslides dewan et al 2007 diagne 2007 jha et al 2012 wilby and keenan 2012 santato et al 2013 dewan et al 2007 contend that increasing population pressure may force many people to enter the vacant land of cities and towns of least developed countries by filling up of natural channels and floodplains which may result in increased flood risk in other words when population growth is faster than the rate at which the municipal authorities or the private sector can provide housing and basic infrastructure risks can build up quickly moreover settlement of watersheds and valley bottoms has greatly altered drainage patterns and destabilized slopes increasing the risks of flooding and landslides diagne 2007 dewan et al 2007 few et al 2004 santato et al 2013 according to jha et al 2012 the accelerating urbanization and urban development could also increase significantly the risk of flooding independent of climate change the impact of future urban growth on flood risk is influenced by the policies and choices of urban dwellers as they may or may not occupy areas at risk of flooding or adopt suitable urban planning and design few et al 2004 pottier et al 2005 tucci 2007 jha et al 2012 in other words better planned and managed urban development can mitigate the expected growth in future flood risk tucci 2007 jha et al 2012 kobayashi and porter 2012 mngutyo and ogwuche 2013 5 conclusions and recommendations the study focused on analyzing flooding hazard and risk from

risk management measures combination of structural and non structural measures the following recommendations are forwarded institutional framework should be strengthened in relation to institutional arrangements content of urban flood management policies and plans implementation process and legislative framework timely mitigation and preparedness measures should be in place in order to minimize the likely adverse impacts of flooding on lives and livelihoods participatory planning should be encouraged as it can contribute to public acceptance and support avoiding potential conflicts an integrated basin wide approach to flood management should be practiced as it is essential to address multiple water related issues at watershed level land use planning and regulation together with building and infrastructure codes and design practices can substantially reduce the vulnerability of the people and other urban activities for sustainable water resources development and integrated flood management the long term and short term planning should be incorporated no matter what approach is employed for effective management it will not work unless the principles of good governance are being practiced environmental education should be emphasized to build civic responsibility among the citizens sustainable drainage systems suds should be practiced in urban environment as it helps to minimize the impact of urban development on the flooding and pollution of waterways the watershed management plan comprising afforestation reforestation soil and water conservation practices for the upland development should work to regulated discharge of water at downstream distributed rainwater hydrological circulation repair measures examples using water permeable bricks on squares and pavements constructing concave down greenbelts infiltration wells infiltration tubes infiltration channels and infiltration ponds in front and behind the buildings should be taken to construct urban rainwater storage and infiltration spaces which are suitable to local circumstance establishing urban rainwater storage infiltration system is helpful to reduce flood hazard constructing reservoirs to cut down the flood into downstream reach and to reduce the intensity of flooding disaster risk establishing flood diversion area and flood storage area to change the spatial distribution of floods and consequently to reduce the flood threats on high population and assets density area constructing two floor or higher buildings or flat roof buildings with water proof materials to facilitate in situ flood escape constructing flood escape transfer channel and temporary refuge facilities developing reliable communication and data acquisition network building flood alarm and emergency response plan it is necessary to pay attention to the coordination between urban development and flood hazard through appropriate spatial planning and land use management and compiling flood hazard and risk maps

the citizens keywords flooding hazard land use management risk spatial planning 1 introduction scholars of sustainable disaster risk management assert that spatial planning plays a significant role in integrated disaster risk management particularly through its potential contribution to long term disaster mitigation basawaraja et al 2011 steinberg and lindfield 2012 wapwera and egbu 2013 watson and agbola 2013 undp 2015 in other words effective risk based planning aims to minimize damages to people and assets before a disaster strikes but its performance in disaster mitigation requires a high level of technical and political cooperation and coordination and equally a commitment from other societal stakeholders as partners in sustainable development onyenechere 2010 sutanta 2012 watson and agbola 2013 spatial planning is increasingly being considered as an important mechanism in coping with flood risk schmidt thomé 2006 a dewan 2013 a m dewan 2013 khailani and perera 2013 one of the reasons for this is that engineering approaches are increasingly expensive and cannot provide complete certainty of protection against flooding risk in other words planning is considered as the regulation of physical implementation as well as the process of policy making that guides spatial development this process is claimed to mainly involve the interaction and collaboration between actors both public and private kazmierczak and cavan 2011 lu 2014 however spatial planning is absent in most developing countries due to the stronghold by the traditional master planning approach to achieve controlled urban development and its management watson 2009 wapwera and egbu 2013 it is vital to appreciate the role of geographic information system gis and remote sensing technologies in planning for flooding disaster risks in urban watersheds for instance geospatial technology provides the best potential to analyze and provide results required for prompt and effective decision making on floods dewan and yamaguchi 2009 manfreda et al 2011 suriya and mudgal 2011 albano et al 2014 samela et al 2016 2017b given that flood hazard is spatial phenomenon the application of gis and remote sensing techniques are essential to the flood hazard risk management process for instance geographical information systems gis with their ability to handle spatial data are an appropriate tool for processing spatial data on flood risk alfasi et al 2012 uddin et al 2013 samela et al 2018 moreover flood hazard and risk maps are effective tools for reducing flood damage zerger and smith 2003 marchi et al 2010 sayers et al 2013 wondim 2016 hazard zoning is also appreciated by scholars of disaster risk management in urban watersheds as it provide a detailed overview of the hazard situation and a basis for spatial planning processes balaban 2009 adedeji et al 2012 sutanta 2012 santato et al 2013 despite the aforementioned benefits of spatial planning for sustainable disaster risk management in urban watersheds in developing countries lack of proper spatial planning and land use management coupled with poor adaptive capacity of governments to ensure good urban governance exacerbate the cases of urban flooding disaster risk multi criteria analysis methods are claimed as decision support tools for dealing with complex decision constellations where technological economical ecological and social aspects have to be covered these methods have been repeatedly combined with geographical information systems gis and are therefore suitable to optimize the landuse planning levy 2005 wang et al 2011 bathrellos et al 2012 chowdary et al 2013 li et al 2013 yang et al 2013 guo et al 2014 spatial multi criteria decision assessment analysis mca or multi criteria evaluation mce has received renewed interest because of the following 1 it allows improved decision making 2 it supports developing and evaluating alternative plans and 3 it is predominantly appropriate for spatial decision making as the data that the decision makers rely on are mostly related to space kubal et al 2009 chen et al 2011 a dewan 2013 a m dewan 2013 zhiyu et al 2013 rahmati et al 2016 the gis multi criteria decision analysis mcda approach is claimed to use the capabilities of gis in the management of geospatial data and the flexibility mcda to combine factual information

2017 rimba et al 2017 seejata et al 2018 ethiopia is located in northeast africa between 3 and 18 north latitude and 33 and 48 east longitude elevations range between 100 m below and 4600 m above sea level it has a land area of about 1 100 000 sq km achamyeleh 2003 the rainy season in ethiopia is concentrated in the three months between june and september when about 80 of the rains are received torrential down pours are common in most parts of the country as the topography of the country is rather rugged with distinctly defined watercourses large scale flooding is rare and limited to the lowland areas where major rivers cross to neighboring countries however intense rainfall in the highlands could cause flooding of settlements close to any stretch of river course achamyeleh 2003 chibssa 2007 alemu 2011 dessie and tadesse 2013 alemu 2015 getahun and gebre 2015 previous studies undertaken on the environmental problems of ambo town and its watershed identified low infiltration of rain water storm water occurrence inundation of low gradient areas incidence of sheet and gully erosion inefficient and uncoordinated utilization of potential site and resources sanitation problem associated with lack of waste collection system and disposal site for both solid and liquid waste mixed waste disposal in open spaces and rivers water stress urban heat island effects wind storms dust storms flash flood growing water and air pollution and unplanned expansion and deforestation as critical environmental challenges for urban development in ambo town and its watershed ambo town administration office 2013 ogato 2013a moreover un habitat 2008 affirms that the environment of ambo town and its watershed has been in a constant decline characterized with most of the solid waste not properly collected lack of environmental regulations and sanitation absence of sewerage system in place and lack of sanitary dumping site un habita 2008 further contends that the municipality of ambo town is not in a position to address the aforementioned problems due to resource and capacity limitations furthermore ogato 2013a and ogato et al 2017 assert that ambo town and its dwellers are vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change related hazards and mainstreaming climate change adaptation into urban planning is vital this paper focuses on analyzing flooding hazard and risk from geographic information systems gis based multicriteria perspective in ambo town and its watershed and proposes strategic measures for sustainable flooding disaster risk management in urban watershed 2 research methodology 2 1 description of the study area huluka watershed is located in west shoa zone oromia regional state ethiopia geographically it is located between 8 49 26 to 8 55 22 n lat and 37 49 50 to 38 8 08 e long fig 1 the total land area of the watershed is about 81 237 ha and composed of villages mainly from ambo dawo dendi elfeta jeldu tokekutaye and wonchi districts and ambo town the total human population of the watershed is about 303 416 in the year 2017 seven land use land cover types were identified in the watershed in the year 2017 the identified land use land cover types in the watershed were forest area cultivated land area urban built up area bush shrub land area bare land area grassland area and water area fig 2 forest land covered 4232 253 ha 5 2 in 2009 and 4298 85 ha 5 3 in 2017 it increased by 1 6 between 2009 and 2017 cultivated land covered 43 833 98 ha 54 in 2009 and 51329 96 ha 63 2 in 2017 it increased by 17 1 between 2009 and 2017 the increase of cultivated land in the watershed was attributable to the transformation of other land use land cover types into cultivated land use land cover type urban built up area covered 425 79 ha 0 5 in 2009 and 790 74 ha 1 in 2017 it increased by 85 7 between 2009 2017 bush shrub land covered 7907 733 ha 9 7 in 2009 and 5635 09 ha 6 9 in 2017 it decreased by 28 7 between 2009 and 2017 bare land

while the lowest elevation of the watershed is 1834 m above sea level the slope of the watershed ranges between 0 and 32 5 the seven soil types dominating the watershed include chromic luvisols chromic vertisols eutric cambisols eutric nitisols leptosols orthic luvisols and pellic vertisos ogato 2019 the watershed is drained by perennial major rivers huluka debis and taltale minor seasonal rivers aleltu awaro boji dobi kerise chafe jara jalina maja solbe jabdu and sankale and a number of intermittent or seasonal streams within the watershed ogato et al 2017 the rainfall of the area is bimodal with unpredictable short rains from march to april and the main season ranging over june to september the highest mean total annual rainfall of the watershed over 32 years 1984 2015 was 1181 mm while the lowest was 1036 mm the lowest and highest annual average temperature are 13 and 27 c respectively atnafe et al 2015 ambo town in the watershed represent the urban feature of the watershed the human population of ambo town has been growing rapidly over the past few years according to csa 2017 the population of the town was 76 544 with the growth rate of 2 5 the poor quality of housing and inability of the administration to increase supply could be taken as key indicators that a wide reform is necessary for ambo town ambo is one of the oldest towns in ethiopia established in 1889 it is among a few privileged towns of its time to have its own municipal administration since 1931 and a master plan since 1983 united nations human settlements programme un habitat 2008 ogato et al 2017 2 2 methods of data collection landsat images of 2015 digital map on shape file with the scale of 1 50 000 from ethiopian mapping authority rainfall data 1984 2015 for the study watershed from the ethiopian metheorology agency digital elevation model dem of the watershed soil types of ethiopia human population and flood points in the watershed were the type of data used for the study the sources of data included central statistical authority csa of ethiopia ethiopian mapping agency ema ethiopian meteorology agency landsat website of www glovis usgs gov urban and rural communities in huluka watershed urban planners of ambo town and land use planners and managers in the watershed to collect relevant data to analyze flooding hazard and risk in the watershed online satellite imagery monkkonen 2008 gondo and zibabgwe 2010 field observation and document review were employed 2 3 methods of data analysis 2 3 1 flooding hazard factors the flooding hazard factors were determined by literature review personal observation and discussion with experts and local residents as far as the key informants experts and local residents are concerned 15 experts and 15 local elders were interviewed to decide the important factors causing flooding hazard accordingly land use land cover elevation slope drainage density soil and rainfall were considered as important flooding hazard factors in ambo town s watershed 1 land use land cover factor many scholars in the field of flooding risk management attest that land use land cover change is one of the major contributor of flooding as urban expansion increases impervious cover increases and forest cover decreases in urban areas contributing to increase in run off tucci 2007 jha et al 2012 fura 2013 mngutyo and ogwuche 2013 hall et al 2014 the existing land use classes of the area were further reclassified into five groups in order of their capacity to increase or decrease the rate of flooding from very highly susceptible to very low susceptible accordingly water body was ranked with the value of 5 as it is very highly susceptible to flooding hazard built up area land use land cover type was assigned the value of 4 as it is highly susceptible to flooding hazard cultivated land use land cover type was assigned the value of 3 as it is moderately susceptible to flooding hazard grassland land use land cover type was assigned the value of 2 as it is low susceptible to flooding hazard forest land use land cover type was assigned the value of 1 as it is very low susceptible to flooding hazard 2 elevation factor elevation has a key role in controlling the movement of the overflow direction and in the depth of the water level gigovi c et al 2017 for elevation factor the elevation raster map was prepared using the digital elevation model dem and slope generation tools in arcgis software the elevation raster layer was further reclassified into five sub groups using standard classification schemes namely equal interval this classification scheme divides the range of attribute values into equal sized sub ranges specifying the number of intervals while arc map determines where the breaks should be and new values re assigned in order of flood hazard rating in this classification process the lowest elevation category is ranked to the value of 5 as it has very high susceptibility to flooding hazard while the highest elevation category is ranked to the value of 1 as it has very low susceptibility 3 slope factor the slope is the ratio of steepness or the degree of inclination of a feature relative to the horizontal plane rimba et al 2017 slope is an important indicator of surface zones which are highly prone to flooding slope is a major factor in determining the rate and duration of water flow on the flatter surface water is moving more slowly collects longer and accumulates so these areas are riskier with respect to the occurrence of floods in relation to the steeper surfaces gigovi c et al 2017 rimba et al 2017 for slope factor the slope raster map was prepared using the digital elevation model dem and slope generation tools in arcgis software the slope raster layer was further reclassified into five sub groups using standard classification schemes namely equal interval this classification scheme divides the range of attribute values into equal sized sub ranges specifying the number of intervals while arc map determines where the breaks should be and new values re assigned in order of flood hazard rating in this classification process the lowest slope category is ranked to the value of 5 as it has very high susceptibility to flooding hazard while the highest slope category is ranked to the value of 1 as it has very low susceptibility 4 drainage density factor drainage density dd a fundamental concept in hydrologic analysis is defined as the ratio of the length of drainage per basin area drainage density is controlled by permeability erodability of surface materials vegetation slope and time flooding in africa has been attributed to inadequate drainage causing overland flow and poor waste collection which can block drainage and water channels causing overland and river fluvial flooding few et al 2004 tucci 2007 rimba et al 2017 drainage density is an inverse function of infiltration greater drainage density indicates high runoff for basin area along with erodible geologic materials and less prone to flood thus the rating for drainage density decreases with increasing drainage density chibssa 2007 wondim 2016 drainage density map could be derived from the drainage map i e drainage map is overlaid on watershed map to find out the ratio of total length of streams in the watershed to total area of watershed and is categorized the drainage density of the watershed is calculated as ouma and tateishi 2014 d l a where d drainage density of watershed l total length of drainage channel in watershed km a total area of watershed km2 for drainage density factor dem was used to extract the drainage network from which the drainage density of the streams was calculated using the spatial analyst extension in arcgis environment line density module was used to compute drainage density of the waterhsed line density module calculates a magnitude per unit area from polyline features that fall within a radius around each cell the density layer is further reclassified into five sub group using standard classification schemes namely equal interval in this classification the highest drainage density category is ranked to 1 as it has very low susceptibility to flooding hazard while the lowest drainage density category is ranked to 5 as it has very high susceptibility 5 soil factor soil characteristics in a watershed such as soil layer thickness permeability infiltration rate and the degree of moisture in the soil before the rain event have a direct effect on the rainfall runoff process zhiyu et al 2013 rimba et al 2017 the structure and infiltration capacity of soils will also have an important impact on the efficiency of the soil to act as a sponge and soak up water different types of soils have differing capacities the chance of flood hazard increases with decrease in soil infiltration capacity which causes increase in surface runoff when water is supplied at a rate that exceeds the soil s infiltration capacity it moves down slope as runoff on sloping land and can lead to flooding ouma and tateishi 2014 for soil factor the soil factor of the study area was derived from the fao standard classification of ethiopian soil mesfine 1998 food and agricultural organization fao 2006 assen and tegene 2008 chekol 2014 assefa 2015 the characteristics of each soil group were analyzed based on hydrologic soil grouping system to this end the soil group of the study area was grouped into five general classes and converted to raster format moreover the soil raster layer group was reclassified into five groups and new values were reassigned in order of their flood hazard rating soil type that has very high capacity to generate very high flood rate is ranked to 5 and the one with very low capacity in generating flood rate is ranked to 1 accordingly pellic and chromic vertisols were ranked to the value of 5 as they have very high susceptibility to flooding hazard leptosols were ranked to the value of 4 as they have high susceptibility orthic and chromic luvisols were ranked to the value of 3 as they have moderate susceptibility eutric nitisols were ranked to the value of 2 as they have low susceptibility eutric cambisols were ranked to the value of 1 as they have very low susceptibility to flooding hazard 6 rainfall factor many scholars in the field of flooding risk management contend that flooding risk is the most widespread climate change related disaster risk in the world and historically floods have been the most prevalent cause of death from natural disasters zhiyu et al 2013 jha et al 2012 santato et al 2013 changes in the global climate and individual climatic variables can affect floods in various ways together with soil moisture and snow storage generally a warmer atmosphere can hold more water vapour which may increase heavy precipitation and therefore floods hall et al 2014 ouma and tateishi 2014 more extreme rainfall means more likelihood of floods particularly flash floods few et al 2004 guo et al 2014 moreover flooding is one of the most widespread of climatic hazards and poses multiple risks to human health few et al 2004 dang et al 2011 for rainfall factor point rainfall data for 32 years 1984 2015 collected at ten stations ambo plant protection research center ginchi asgori busa gedo jeldu tikur enchini tulu bolo welenkomi and woliso within and around the watershed were received from the ethiopian metrology agency as the data received were monthly total rainfall total annual rainfall for each year at each station and mean of 32 years 1984 2015 for each station were calculated and then interpolated to inverse distance weight idw in arcgis environment then it was converted to raster layer to create a continuous raster rainfall data within and around the watershed this was finally reclassified into five classes using equal interval in this classification the highest rainfall category was ranked to the value of 5 as it has very high contribution for flooding hazard on the other hand the lowest rainfall category is ranked to the value of 1 as it has very low contribution for flooding hazard 2 3 2 flooding risk factors to analyze flooding risk in ambo town and its watershed flooding hazard layer population density and land use land cover type were considered as three important factors these three factors were considered to be equally important in the weighted overlay process 1 population density factor gross population density calculation method is used to calculate the number of person per square kilometers in the watershed to this end the human population estimation for the year 2017 at each village in the watershed was considered then population shape file was converted to raster layer using conversion tools feature to raster then the data layer was reclassified into five sub factors which are classified using equal interval method and new values re assigned in order of increasing number of population that is more susceptible to flood hazard the population density was reclassified in the assumption that the denser the population the more vulnerable it will be to flood hazard accordingly the highest population density category is ranked to the value of 5 as it is very highly susceptible to flooding risk on the other hand the lowest population density category was ranked to the value of 1 as its susceptibility to flooding risk is very low 2 land use type factor the existing land use classes of the area water body built up cultivated land grass land and forest were reclassified into five groups in order of their susceptibility to flooding risk the land use types of the sub basin were reclassified into a common scale in order of sensitivity for the flood risk analysis accordingly water body was ranked with the value of 5 as it is very highly susceptible to flooding risk built up area land use land cover type was ranked with the value of 4 as it is highly susceptible to flooding risk cultivated land was ranked with the value of 3 as it is moderately susceptible to flooding risk grassland land use land cover type was ranked with the value of 2 as it is low susceptible to flooding risk forest land use land cover type was assigned the value of 1 as it is very low susceptible to flooding risk 3 flooding hazard layer flooding hazard layer was considered as one of the flooding risk contributing factor in ambo town s watershed very low low moderate high and very high flooding hazard classes were reclassified based on their susceptibility to flooding risk very high flood hazard layer was ranked with the value of 5 as it has the highest susceptibility to flooding risk on the other hand very low flooding hazard layer was ranked with the value of 1 as it has the lowest susceptibility to flooding risk 2 3 3 integration of analytical hierarchy process ahp into geographic information systems gis this study employed the geographic information systems gis based multicriateria analysis approach wang et al 2011 zou et al 2013 gigovi c et al 2017 rimba et al 2017 to analyze flood hazard and risk in ambo town and its watershed flood risk evaluation is an intrinsically complex multidimensional process including both quantitative and qualitative factors which may be uncertain yang et al 2013 analytic hierarchy process established by saaty is a method to solve multiple criteria decision problems by setting their priorities analytical hierarchy process ahp was adopted for multicriteria decisions in urban flooding hazard and risk analysis yahaya et al 2010 chowdary et al 2013 li et al 2013 guo et al 2014 rimba et al 2017 in ahp multiple pairwise comparisons are based on a standardized comparison scale of nine levels saaty 1977 the nine points are chosen because psychologists conclude that nine objects are the most that an individual can simultaneously compare and consistently rank table 1 pairwise judgements are made based on the best information available and the decision maker s knowledge and experience chen et al 2011 dang et al 2011 youssef et al 2011 bathrellos et al 2012 ouma and tateishi 2014 gigovi c et al 2017 the process of ahp can be summarized in four steps construct the decision hierarchy determine the relative importance of attributes and sub attributes evaluate each alternative and calculate its overall weight with regard to each attribute and check the consistency of the subjective evaluations bathrellos et al 2012 yang et al 2013 ouma and tateishi 2014 let c cj j 1 2 n be the set of criteria the result of the pairwise comparison on n criteria can be summarized in an n n evaluation matrix a in which every element aij i j 1 2 n is the quotient of weights of the criteria as given in eq 1 ouma and tateishi 2014 1 a a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a a n a n 1 a n 2 a n n a i i 1 a j j 1 a j j a j j 0 the right eigen value v corresponding to the maximum eigen value λmax is calculated to normalize and find the relative weight av of the matrix by following eq 2 ouma and tateishi 2014 2 aw λmax w it is highly recommended that the pairwise comparisons in ahp are completely consistent and in this case the matrix a has rank 1 and λmax n in this case weights can be obtained by normalizing any of the rows or columns of the matrix a the quality of the output of the ahp is claimed to be strictly related to the consistency of the pairwise comparison judgments the consistency is normally defined by the relation between the entries of a aij ajk aik the consistency index ci is given by eq 3 ouma and tateishi 2014 3 ci λmax n n 1 where λmax represents the sum of the products between the sum of each column of the comparison matrix and the relative weights and n represents the size of the matrix the final calculation is the consistency ratio cr which is the ratio of the ci and random index ri as expressed in eq 4 4 cr ci ri where ci represents the consistency index ri is the random index representing the consistency of a randomly generated pairwise comparison matrix it is derived as average random consistency index computed by saaty 1980 cr represent consistency ratio the values of ri are tabulated in table 2 and ri value for six parameters is 1 24 saaty 1980 the maximum threshold of ci is 0 1 and cr 10 the rational value is when the ci and cr have fulfilled the maximum threshold value the usage of cr lets the user to conclude whether the evaluations are sufficiently consistent table 3 the normalized pair wise comparison matrix is derived by making equal to 1 the sum of the entries on each column finally the objective weight of each factor was built by averaging the entries on each row table 4 the basic advantage is that the ahp limits the cognitive demand on the decision maker and provides an approach for checking the consistency of the comparisons the consistency ratio cr is used in order to check inconsistency and limit the possibility of random selection during the construction of the comparison matrix bathrellos et al 2012 ouma and tateishi 2014 λmax for flood contributing factors in the watershed 2 13 0 42 5 0 23 7 9 0 15 12 5 0 1 19 0 06 28 0 04 6 4 cr ci ri ci λmax n n 1 ri random consistency index and ri 1 24 for six factors table 2 n number of criteria 6 λmax represents the sum of the products between the sum of each column of the comparison matrix and the relative weights cr for the flood contributing factors in ambo town s watershed is 0 06 which is less than the standard 0 1 hence the pair wise matrix ranking is accepted to calculate the weight and ranking in each factor the pair wise comparison matrix and factor map are employed the weight value provided the prioritized factor expressed as a percentage value between 0 and 100 using a linear weighted combination the sum of weight was expressed as 100 a summary of targeted factors their weights and rankings are listed in table 5 hereunder the information provided in the table was applied to generate the flooding hazard map in the study watershed the ranking of each reclassified factor is based on the literature review expert interview and local residents interview the range of ranking was 1 5 the highest influence factor was rank 5 and the lowest influence factor was 1 the order of normalized weight was land cover 42 slope 23 soil type 15 rainfall 10 drainage density 6 and elevation 4 looking at the weight of each factor one can see that land cover has the highest weight it implies that land cover has more contribution to flooding than other factors once the weight in each factor was determined the multi criteria analysis was performed to produce a flooding hazard map by using the gis approach in other words weighted linear combination wlc method is used in the process of criteria map aggregation the underpinning reason for employing wlc is that low scores in one criterion are compensated by high scores in another one in the process of aggregating the criteria flooding hazard maps in other words the weighted linear combination wlc method multiplies each fuzzy standardized criteria map with criteria weights obtaining different variations from the ahp method and then sums the results bathrellos et al 2012 gigovi c et al 2017 accordingly flooding hazard map for the watershed was computed as shown in eq 5 5 flooding hazard index 0 42xlanduse landcover 0 23xslope 0 15xsoil type 0 1xrainfall 0 06xdrainage density 0 04xelevation the result was the flooding hazard area in the watershed it was categorized into five hazard classes very low low moderate high and very high to compute the flooding risk map for the watershed a weight linear combination was applied as shown in eq 6 6 flooding risk index 0 3333xflooding hazard 0 3333xpopulation density person per square kilometers 0 3333xland use land cover flood risk analysis and mapping for the watershed was done using the flooding hazard layer and the two elements at risk namely population and land use land cover wondim 2016 these three factors were considered to be equally important in the weighted linear combination wlc process a summary of targeted factors their weights and rankings are listed in table 6 hereunder the information provided in the table was applied to generate the flooding risk map in ambo town s watershed the result was the flooding risk

and land cover types were registered and converted to shape file these point shape files were superimposed with the flood risk map and the flood risk map was verified with the actual field situations figs 6 and 7 4 discussion flood disasters are among the most frequent and devastating types of disasters over the world it is necessary to analyze flood risk to ensure healthy and sustainable economic development and flood risk assessment has become worldwide one of the hot issues in the field of natural science and technology yahaya et al 2010 zou et al 2013 scholars of sustainable urban flooding risk management assert that comprehensive flood risk assessment is a synthetic evaluation and consists of many factors including the hazard of disaster inducing factors and disaster breeding environment as well as the vulnerability of hazards bearing bodies zerger and smith 2003 sayers et al 2013 zou et al 2013 guo et al 2014 for instance assessing areas vulnerable to flooding disasters is one of the parameters in creating a flood risk map for disaster mitigation and urban planning dang et al 2011 wang et al 2011 ouma and tateishi 2014 islam et al 2016 gigovi c et al 2017 rimba et al 2017 this study considered land use land cover elevation slope drainage density soil and rainfall as important flooding hazard factors in ambo town s watershed many scholars in the field of sustainable flooding hazard and risk management attest that land use land cover change is one of the major contributor of flooding hazard as urban expansion increases impervious cover increases and forest cover decreases in urban areas contributing to increase in run off tucci 2007 jha et al 2012 mngutyo and ogwuche 2013 migosi 2014 for scholars like gigovi c et al 2017 elevation has a key role in controlling the movement of the overflow direction and in the depth of the water level slope is a major factor in determining the rate and duration of water flow as flatter surface areas are riskier with respect to the occurrence of floods in relation to the steeper surfaces gigovi c et al 2017 rimba et al 2017 drainage density is one of the important flooding hazard factors and it is an inverse function of infiltration chibssa 2007 ouma and tateishi 2014 wondim 2016 soil characteristics in a watershed such as soil layer thickness permeability infiltration rate and the degree of moisture in the soil before the rain event have a direct effect on the rainfall runoff process zhiyu et al 2013 ouma and tateishi 2014 rimba et al 2017 observed and projected patterns of climate change can have an amplifying effect on existing flood risk for example changing local rainfall patterns may lead to more frequent and higher level of floods from rivers and more intense flash flooding andjelkovic 2001 few et al 2004 jha et al 2012 berggren et al 2013 hall et al 2014 this study considered flooding hazard layer population density and land use land cover type as the three important factors for flooding risk mapping and these three factors were considered to be equally important in the weighted overlay process chibssa 2007 wondim 2016 scholars of sustainable urban flooding risk management contend that flooding risk is contributed to by two components flood hazard and flood vulnerability the flood hazard component represents physical processes whereas flood vulnerability represents susceptibility to damage or loss the risk of human lives property or human activities dang et al 2011 the flood risk maps thus developed are useful to policy makers and responsible authorities as well as to local residents in finding suitable measures for reducing flood risk in the study area dang et al 2011 without flood risk maps it is not easy to identify the areas at risk and without a systematic way of making development decisions there will be no consistency in deciding how and where to reduce urban encroachment into at risk areas the availability of the land use plan gives readily available guidance to developers planners and others on which areas may be developed for which uses and allows the incorporation of flood risk information into their decisions and judgements zerger and smith 2003 sayers et al 2013 urbanization as the defining feature of the world s demographic growth is implicated in and compounds flood risk few et al 2004 jha et al 2012 santato et al 2013 few et al 2004 contend that human vulnerability to floods is affected by drivers of change like population growth and settlement pattern in other words as cities become larger and larger and as populations become more and more urbanized urban environmental effects will increase andjelkovic 2001 few et al 2004 santato et al 2013 population growth is asserted to be one of the contributors for urban flooding risk as human population in cities and towns in developing countries is rapidly growing and there is settlement of watersheds and valley bottoms greatly altering drainage patterns and destabilizing slopes and resulting in increasing the risks of flooding and landslides dewan et al 2007 diagne 2007 jha et al 2012 wilby and keenan 2012 santato et al 2013 dewan et al 2007 contend that increasing population pressure may force many people to enter the vacant land of cities and towns of least developed countries by filling up of natural channels and floodplains which may result in increased flood risk in other words when population growth is faster than the rate at which the municipal authorities or the private sector can provide housing and basic infrastructure risks can build up quickly moreover settlement of watersheds and valley bottoms has greatly altered drainage patterns and destabilized slopes increasing the risks of flooding and landslides diagne 2007 dewan et al 2007 few et al 2004 santato et al 2013 according to jha et al 2012 the accelerating urbanization and urban development could also increase significantly the risk of flooding independent of climate change the impact of future urban growth on flood risk is influenced by the policies and choices of urban dwellers as they may or may not occupy areas at risk of flooding or adopt suitable urban planning and design few et al 2004 pottier et al 2005 tucci 2007 jha et al 2012 in other words better planned and managed urban development can mitigate the expected growth in future flood risk tucci 2007 jha et al 2012 kobayashi and porter 2012 mngutyo and ogwuche 2013 5 conclusions and recommendations the study focused on analyzing flooding hazard and risk from

flooding risk area respectively this implies that half of the town is high and very high flooding risk area 50 09 as sustainable flooding risk management at urban watershed demand integrated flooding risk management measures combination of structural and non structural measures the following recommendations are forwarded institutional framework should be strengthened in relation to institutional arrangements content of urban flood management policies and plans implementation process and legislative framework timely mitigation and preparedness measures should be in place in order to minimize the likely adverse impacts of flooding on lives and livelihoods participatory planning should be encouraged as it can contribute to public acceptance and support avoiding potential conflicts an integrated basin wide approach to flood management should be practiced as it is essential to address multiple water related issues at watershed level land use planning and regulation together with building and infrastructure codes and design practices can substantially reduce the vulnerability of the people and other urban activities for sustainable water resources development and integrated flood management the long term and short term planning should be incorporated no matter what approach is employed for effective management it will not work unless the principles of good governance are being practiced environmental education should be emphasized to build civic responsibility among the citizens sustainable drainage systems suds should be practiced in urban environment as it helps to minimize the impact of urban development on the flooding and pollution of waterways the watershed management plan comprising afforestation reforestation soil and water conservation practices for the upland development should work to regulated discharge of water at downstream distributed rainwater hydrological circulation repair measures examples using water permeable bricks on squares and pavements constructing concave down greenbelts infiltration wells infiltration tubes infiltration channels and infiltration ponds in front and behind the buildings should be taken to construct urban rainwater storage and infiltration spaces which are suitable to local circumstance establishing urban rainwater storage infiltration system is helpful to reduce flood hazard constructing reservoirs to cut down the flood into downstream reach and to reduce the intensity of flooding disaster risk establishing flood diversion area and flood storage area to change the spatial distribution of floods and consequently to reduce the flood threats on high population and assets density area constructing two floor or higher buildings or flat roof buildings with water proof materials to facilitate in situ flood escape constructing flood escape transfer channel and temporary refuge facilities developing reliable communication and data acquisition network building flood alarm and emergency response plan it is necessary to pay attention to the coordination between urban development and flood hazard through appropriate spatial planning and land use management and compiling flood hazard and risk maps

8403,study region this study region is the napa river basin in california whose antecedent soil moisture states and precipitation magnitudes are primary drivers to occur extreme floods study focus this study assessed the influence of antecedent moisture condition on flood frequency based on an experimental application scheme and pre processing for this purpose t year flood simulations were conducted using a distributed hydrologic model distributed precipitation patterns which have an amount of precipitation corresponding to a specific t year return period were generated by representative radar based precipitation fields and precipitation frequency analysis dry normal and wet of antecedent moisture condition were applied to each t year flood simulation to reflect variable initial soil moisture states new hydrological insights for the region the relationship among flood frequency antecedent moisture condition and precipitation frequency was derived for a specific target storm event for normal antecedent moisture states the relation showed that t year precipitation could generate floods having return intervals nearly identical to those derived using gage records for saturated soil conditions a 7 year precipitation event could trigger a 100 year flood conversely a 200 year precipitation event with dry soil conditions might generate only a 15 year flood event the results emphasize the importance of soil moisture to flood runoff and suggest that soil moisture monitoring could aid in improving flood forecasting keywords flood frequency antecedent moisture condition precipitation frequency t year flood simulation distributed hydrologic model radar based precipitation data 1 introduction in hydrology flood frequency ff analysis has been used for decades due to its applicability and utility katz et al 2002 one of the major applications of ff is the prediction of proper design floods for constructing hydraulic structures such as dams bridges levees culverts highways and sewage disposal plants dalrymple 1960 also knowledge of the ff is necessary to quantify and classify risk levels of a flood event in vulnerable areas since floods with t year recurrence intervals are reference values to measure the intensity of flood events ff has informed forecasters operators and decision makers responsible for issuing flood warnings and operating hydraulic infrastructures for example coupling flood forecasting to distributed hydrologic models that generate runoff outputs at any location in the domain enables prediction of flood risk levels for an entire watershed even in ungauged regions the general approach of ff analysis is based on deriving ff curves by estimating the exceedance probability of annual maximum flood series gumbel 1941 powell 1943 eagleson 1972 england et al 2018 most countries including the united states use the ff methodology and have also modified the general approach to characterize uncertainty cameron et al 1999 blazkova and beven 2002 brath et al 2006 halbert et al 2016 regional variability pandey and nguyen 1999 de michele and rosso 2001 ouarda et al 2001 smith et al 2015 climate change impacts cameron et al 2000 kay et al 2009 arnell and gosling 2016 and urbanization impacts hollis 1975 prosdocimi et al 2015 on ff on the other hand there are arguments against employing general ff analysis due to wrong interpretation of ff randomness and probability of annual maximum floods and extrapolations of ff curves klemeš 2006 merz and gunter 2008a 2008b raised up an issue that a number of intrinsic weaknesses of the flood frequency analysis mainly related to the problem that the available flood peak sample cannot be representative of behavior of potential future floods the continuous rainfall runoff simulation opens up several avenues of research notably with respect to uncertainty in estimating flood frequency and the question of consistency of model calibrations i e parameterization for both continuous flow series and flood frequency simulation cameron et al 1999 if a continuous model is provided with observed rainfall data then will one or more sets of parameters that provide acceptable rainfall runoff simulation results could provide acceptable estimates of the flood frequency characteristics a number of previous studies who proposed continuous rainfall runoff simulation to estimate flood frequency showed how the continuous modeling can be used to quantify floods for spillway design bergstrôm et al 1993 and under climate change cameron et al 1999 2000 blazkova and beven 2002 implemented the attempt at flood frequency estimation by continuous simulation to include the possibility of snowmelt and rain on snow flood cases cameron et al 1999 well described the benefits of employing a continuous rainfall runoff simulation for estimating flood frequency although many studies have highlighted the importance of hydrological reasoning in flood frequency estimation most publications in the hydrological literature have focused on subtleties of the estimation problem merz and gunter 2008a 2008b this study intends to address another issue namely the relations between ff antecedent moisture condition amc and precipitation and is to answer the two questions which have not been explored before 1 depending on the states of antecedent moisture content what scale i e flood frequency of flooding can occur and 2 depending on the interactions of antecedent moisture states and precipitation magnitude what scale of flooding can occur since each flood value in the annual maximum flood series used in ff analysis arises from specific precipitation and amc conditions we are interested in the interactions between these conditions and ff we hypothesize that the estimating the thresholds of amc and precipitation that generate an extreme flood return period are the most significant question in terms of flood forecasting however it is difficult to find reasonable answers to the question from ff analysis this is because t year floods only represent probabilistic flood levels by adopting t year recurrence intervals which themselves are based on historic flood events and are not representative of ff amc precipitation relations thus it is necessary to implement an assessment of amc and precipitation on ff to examine the variability of flood frequency in response to them a number of studies have reviewed the effects of amc and precipitation on runoff flows de paola et al 2013 han et al 2019 osborn and hickok 1968 hawkins et al 1985 merz and plate 1997 tucker and bras 2000 tramblay et al 2010 yoo et al 2012 huza et al 2014 as precipitation is the primary source of the variability of runoff responses precipitation magnitude must be predicted prior to a storm event amc also has a large effect on flood discharge as it determines a volume of direct runoff martínez mena et al 1998 castillo et al 2003 tramblay et al 2010 penna et al 2011 kim et al 2018a kim et al 2018b chifflard et al 2018 many studies address the effect of amc on runoff flows de michele and salvadori 2002 analyzed the influence of amc on flood frequency distribution and derived the distribution of peak flows conditioned by the amc statistical law castillo et al 2003 examined the effect of initial soil moisture content on runoff response in the green ampt method by deploying a monte carlo simulation technique for different scenarios javelle et al 2010 emphasized the influence of amc in potential flood vulnerable areas the use of ff is highly efficient but cannot represent interactions and contributions of amc and precipitation to ff the previous studies cited above reviewed the effects of amc and precipitation on runoff but did not investigate the relation between precipitation frequency pf amc states and ff or the effect of the amc pf interactions on ff to resolve the issues it is needed to derive ff amc pf relations and to confirm their interactions with flood discharge it is also necessary to review the contributions of precipitation and amc to a specific t year return period of flood in order to estimate the thresholds of precipitation and amc that could generate an extreme return period of flood the aim of this study is to assess effects of amc on flood frequency the assessment is implemented by using rainfall runoff simulations with various precipitation magnitudes and amc states pf is used to consider various and specific precipitation magnitudes and to generate t year precipitation data multi radar multi sensor mrms is used to reflect the spatial distribution of the observed precipitation field using mrms data and t year precipitation information t year distributed precipitation fields are generated through a simple merging approach the noaa hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm is used as the distributed hydrologic and continuous model it is based on the sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma methodology amc states are estimated and classified using state variables in sac sma finally this study simulates t year floods by forcing the hydrologic model with t year distributed precipitation data and the amc states and diagnoses the impact of precipitation and amc on flood frequency through analysis of total runoff flows trf and peak flows the napa river basin in northern california is selected as an application area section 2 details the distributed hydrologic model the radar based precipitation product and the assessment process and pre processing methods used section 3 explains the application watershed data and the pre processing results which cover analyses of precipitation and flood frequency generation of t year distributed precipitation fields and estimation of the states of amc section 4 provides the assessment results for total runoff flows and peak flows 2 materials and methods 2 1 application basin and data the test basin used is the napa river basin located in northwestern napa county just south of the summit of mt st helena in the mayacamas mountains of the california coast range fig 1 shows the napa river basin showing its elevation and hrap grid network and drainage channel network the napa river begins as the seasonal kimball canyon creek in robert louis stevenson state park at an elevation of 3745 feet 1141 m which descends the southern slopes of mt st helena to kimball canyon dam johnson et al 2016 in 1986 the worst of 23 floods recorded since 1865 on the napa river occurred 5000 people were evacuated 250 homes were destroyed and three people lost their lives the napa river basin has complex terrain with land cover dominated 65 by area by a combination of evergreen forest and grassland this basin has two continuous flow gages managed by the u s geological survey usgs the upper gage is napa r nr st helena ca station called the st helena station herein and the lower gage is usgs 11458000 napa r nr napa ca station napa station fig 1 the napa station was the primary site used for this study it has a drainage area of 564 6 sq km over which the annual average precipitation is 703 8 mm and of which roughly 80 occurs during a rainy season from november to march unfortunately the application basin has no available monitoring system for soil moisture the napa river watershed is covered by two s band next generation radars nexrads kdax and kmux operated by the national weather service nws and kpix radar c band gap filling tv station radar i e kpix mrms qpe products were generated using the combination of nexrad and kpix radar data in this study gridded precipitation fields at a spatial resolution of 1 0 km and an hourly temporal resolution are used to implement the pre processing radar based precipitation data provides a gridded precipitation field representing the spatial variability of precipitation intensity with specific resolutions yoo et al 2013 kim and yoo 2014 kim et al 2015 in the us the multi radar multi sensor mrms product is distinguished by its high accuracy and national consistency willie et al 2016 mrms s automated algorithms integrate data streams from ground based multiple radars air observations lightning detection systems and satellite and forecast based models the primary purpose of the mrms system is to produce severe weather and precipitation products for decision making capability to improve severe weather forecasts and warnings hydrology aviation and numerical weather prediction zhang et al 2016 this study used mrms data produced by willie et al 2016 mrms qpe products include radar only radar only with vpr correction and radar with vpr and gauge correction qpe based on the availability of the relevant input data the radar with vpr and gauge correction qpe is used in this study since its assessment is superior to the other products 2 2 distributed hydrologic model the use of a distributed hydrologic model dhm is an attractive alternative to hydrological process simulation for rainfall runoff analysis and flood prediction with remote sensing inputs and geographic information systems krajewski et al 1991 this study employs a dhm for simulating t year floods because dhms are capable of capturing the spatial distribution of meteorological input variables e g precipitation and physical parameters e g soil saturation and terrain routing related while a lumped or semi distributed hydrologic model is not able to zhang et al 2013 among many of the developed dhms the hydrological laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm developed by the noaa national weather service nws office of hydrologic development ohd can accurately forecast the complex water balance dynamics of watersheds spies et al 2015 the hl rdhm is a combination of physically based and conceptual model features koren et al 2004 this model consists of a conceptual water balance model sorooshian et al 1993 applied on a regular spatial grid linked to physically based kinematic hillslope and channel routing models chow et al 1988 the hl rdhm was designed and implemented for the entire contiguous united states and can be applied for any grid resolution and time step national weather service nws 2011 thorstensen et al 2016 the hl rdhm takes account of the spatial variability of weather variables land use soils and terrain as the model is based on the hydrologic rainfall analysis project hrap grid structure providing an efficient interface for spatially distributed inputs and hydrologic outputs koren et al 2003 in contrast to traditional lumped models advantages of the hl rdhm include the ability to use gridded remote sensing precipitation data and to derive estimates of runoff flow and soil moisture at any location in the watershed the hl rdhm integrates algorithms for spatially distributed precipitation e g radar based precipitation data in hrap soil moisture accounting snowmelt and evapotranspiration conceptual hillslope and channel routing for more detailed descriptions of the method see nws 2011 and thorstensen et al 2016 the core of the hl rdhm is the sac sma model which determines contributions of precipitation to the infiltrated water and runoff flow sorooshian et al 1993 fig 2 shows the conceptual diagram of the model structure within the hydrologic cycle the sac sma model is a conceptual soil moisture accounting model consisting of tension and free water in the upper and lower zones to characterize soil moisture states and runoff components to represent soil moisture storage and movement within each zone the sac sma has 16 parameters including six relating to soil moisture storage capacity three for recession four for percolation and the three related non modified parameters thorstensen et al 2016 the sac sma also has five states of soil moisture content that could be used as boundary conditions of amc adimc is dependent on uztwc and lztwc as shown in fig 2 these states result from antecedent precipitation and interactions of hydrological processes drainage evaporation and transpiration with water in a soil column representing the current amount of tension and free water contents in the upper and lower zones in the upper zone the water content state rapidly decreases due to subsurface runoff by free water and the tension water by evaporation or evapotranspiration in the lower zone free water storage is divided into two sub storages that control supplemental flow fast and primary groundwater flow slow between upper and lower zones percolation is a link to supply water to a lower zone 2 3 application scheme and pre processing we establish an application scheme to implement the assessment of precipitation and amc to ff at the heart of which is simulating t year floods by forcing reasonable alternatives of precipitation and amc the scheme includes the following steps 1 pre processing to generate t year distributed precipitation and amc states to reflect dry normal and wet conditions 2 rainfall runoff modeling to generate runoff outputs from each amc and 3 assessment of the combined precipitation and amc on the runoff outputs fig 3 shows the application algorithm and methods in the pre processing there are three major components as follows a precipitation and flood frequency analysis b generation of t year distributed precipitation fields and c estimation and identification of amc states corresponding to the driest normal and wettest cases to implement component a this study adopts references that provide reasonable frequency analysis results in precipitation and runoff conditions the details of which are described in section 3 3 in component b t year distributed precipitation fields are generated from the mrms qpe product and t year precipitation from the pf analysis the pf from the first component a is used for estimating precipitation magnitudes corresponding to t year recurrence intervals of precipitation in the application watershed the spatial distributions of precipitation are extracted from an actual event defined as the target storm which represents typical climatic precipitation patterns in the napa river watershed to seek the target storm with a spatial distribution most similar to the long term climate precipitation pattern mrms qpe products are compared with prism climate data http www prism oregonstate edu at the hrap resolution 4 0 km from 30 years of recorded data when comparing mrms qpe products and prism climate data the accumulated precipitation fields are used since prism climate data is only available for monthly values the details of the comparison are described in session 3 1 2 to generate t year distributed precipitation fields a simple merging approach is applied using the spatiotemporal distributions of the target storm and t year precipitation for example if the target storm has a duration of 12 h the specific t year distributed precipitation in hourly time steps consists of 12 distributed precipitation fields equal to the target storm the temporal distribution of precipitation also follows that of the target storm the temporal distribution of the target storm is extracted using hourly areal average precipitation aap the aap is calculated from eq 1 1 a a p r g t j 1 m i 1 n r g t i j n m while the temporal distribution of t year precipitation is resolved as that of the target storm by using eq 2 2 r f t r f a a p r g t i 1 d u r a t i o n a a p r g i where aap is the areal average precipitation rg t is the gridded precipitation field e g mrms qpe products at time t rg t i j is each value in the gridded precipitation field and n and m are row and column numbers rf t is the temporally resolved hourly t year precipitation rf is t year precipitation corresponding to a specific recurrence interval the merging approach for distributed precipitation fields using mrms qpe products and t year precipitation is implemented using scale factors to match the hourly precipitation amount of the distributed precipitation fields with the hourly t year precipitation temporally resolved in this process the scale factor is calculated from eq 3 for each time step t and at each grid i j of mrms qpe data from eq 3 mrms qpe fields at each t are normalized using the aap value for whole girds the mrms qpe fields are then scaled up by multiplying the scale factor to the normalized mrms qpe field through eq 4 thus the areal average value of the scaled up precipitation field equals that of the temporally resolved hourly t year precipitation at the same t through this final step t year distributed precipitation can be generated for the duration of a target storm 3 f s c a l e t i j r g t i j a a p r g t 4 r f g t i j r f t f s c a l e t i j in eq 3 fscale is scale factor for each grid value at time t rfg t i j in eq 4 is each grid value in t year distributed precipitation fields in the component c of the pre processing the states of amc are estimated for a variety of soil moisture boundary conditions to the t year flood simulations five states of soil moisture content in sac smc model are used as indices representing the amc states with free and tension waters in the upper and lower zones many sets of the five states comprising the amcs are estimated by simulating multiple storm events and then amc states are classified as either driest normal or wettest conditions in the t year flood simulation process the hl rdhm for the application watershed is established and calibrated and t year flood simulations are implemented by forcing the hl rdhm model with the generated t year distributed precipitation and the estimated states of amc total runoff flows trf in depth and peak flows are used to conduct the assessment and the relations of trf amc pf and ff amc pf are derived in addition this application scheme is specified to smaller watersheds whose amc states and precipitation magnitudes are primary drivers to occur extreme floods also it has no upstream regulation and no effects of snow on streamflows detailed results of the processing described above is addressed in section 3 1 it contains results of hydrological modeling generated t year distributed precipitation fields and estimated antecedent moisture content states 2 4 precipitation and flood frequency this study employed noaa atlas 14 developed by the hydrometeorological design studies center within the office of hydrologic development of the noaa s national weather service perica et al 2014 we selected a range of return periods from 2 to 200 years for a length of 12 h since the target storm has a 12 h duration for the duration of 12 h the drainage area for the saint helena station has t year precipitation areal average depths ranging from 69 1 mm 2 year to 150 6 mm 200 year whole those at napa station range from 50 3 mm to 130 3 mm this study employed regional flood frequency equations from gotvald et al 2012 who implemented regional regression analysis using generalized least squares regression to develop a set of equations with 50 20 10 4 2 1 0 5 and 0 2 percent annual exceedance probabilities the analysis was predicated on the availability of at least 10 years of annual peak flow data and that peak flows were not substantially affected by diversions or urbanization the flood frequency equation in gotvald et al 2012 has two parameters drainage area and average annual precipitation fig 4 shows the estimated peak flows corresponding to t year recurrence intervals at the napa station the range is from 175 to 1224 m3 s for 2 500 year recurrence intervals 5 t y e a r r e t u r n p e r i o d e x p 0 005269 s i m u l a t e d p e a k f l o w 0 785 in addition an equation to convert simulated peak flows to t year return periods is required in this study thus this study derived the equation resulting from regression analysis using the exponential function as shown below in eq 5 since the r squared value for the regression equation is above 0 98 the equation was deemed acceptable to convert the simulated peak flows to t year return periods for deriving the relation of pf amc and ff 3 results 3 1 pre processing results for t year flood simulations 3 1 1 hydrological modeling the hl rdhm model over the napa river basin was calibrated based on the gridded structure hrap approximately 4 0 km grid size this calibration involved refining the a priori parameters to adapt them to the local physiographic soils and vegetative characteristics of the watersheds this study implemented the hl rdhm using a manual calibration method adopted from anderson 2002 although manual calibration can be used to track dynamic interactions in the atmosphere land surface system the process is complicated and highly labor intensive for calibration we simultaneously used several criteria namely hydrograph shape peak flow runoff volume event start time recession rise turning point and recession slope to evaluate the simulated hydrograph the scalar multipliers of the gridded sac sma component and routing parameters were iteratively adjusted it is not our goal to optimize calibration instead we calibrate only to tune the model to an acceptable condition so that the model techniques can appropriately regulate water between surface soil and channels to accommodate various storm situations once the simulated hydrographs reasonably reflect precipitation inputs and initial states in the aforementioned criteria the manual calibration process was stopped in addition table 1 shows the calibration results for the two napa river usgs gage stations the calibration was implemented for a period from february to december 2011 and the results shown in table 1 consist of three statistics for long term period calibration and five statistics for event based calibration since the nash sutcliffe peak flow and time to peak results were reasonable the calibration was deemed acceptable for implementing t year flood simulations 3 1 2 generation of t year distributed precipitation fields a storm event from 20 december 2012 is selected as the target storm this storm yielded total areal average precipitation of 58 3 mm for 12 h according to noaa atlas 14 precipitation frequency table 3 the target storm represents between a 1 and 2 year return period storm event fig 6 shows hourly precipitation fields of the target storm observed peak flow was 371 0 m3 s 0800 pst 24 december 2012 at the usgs napa station close to a 5 year recurrence interval the california nevada river forecast center cnrfc issued a flood warning in response to the high flows there are two main reasons for selecting the 20 december 2012 event as the target storm firstly the target storm has a spatial distribution similar to that of the prism climate precipitation distribution fig 5 shows the spatial distributions of digital elevation model dem prism climate fields for mean annual precipitation and 30 year mean december precipitation and the target storm precipitation field from the mrms qpe product radar vpr gr this comparison showed the heaviest precipitation in the higher elevation regions of the upper napa river basin the correlation coefficients of the spatial distributions for the target storm precipitation field with annual average precipitation and average precipitation on december were 0 638 and 0 750 respectively secondly the target storm represents a typical event during the california rainy season generally during the rainy season precipitation ranging from 406 4 mm to 558 8 mm which is 80 of annual average precipitation occurs in the napa river basin this study confirmed that the primary water vapor of the target storm event was created in the pacific ocean and came through san francisco bay area which is a common route water vapor comes into due to the complex terrain of the napa river basin the target storm event showed convective precipitation which is generally more intense and of shorter duration than stratiform precipitation this is a reason for the heaviest precipitation in the higher elevation regions of the application basin according to the historical record at the usgs napa station most of annual maximum peak flows are recorded during this period the temporal distribution was extracted from the target storm to reflect a consistent time distribution to all the t year distributed precipitation fields and is then identified according to theory established by huff 1967 who suggested four first second third and fourth quartile storms of time distribution of a storm depending on a point of the time for a peak depth of precipitation according to huff 1967 the time distribution of the target storm is defined as the third quartile storm which has a peak at the third quartile 2 200 year distributed precipitation derived from the radar based precipitation fields and t year precipitation through the merging approach were generated as shown in fig 6 the spatial distribution of the precipitation fields is consistent but the qpe represent different amounts depending on the t year return periods 3 1 3 estimation of antecedent moisture content states this pre processing step focuses on estimating and defining the states of amc from various storm events the five state variables uztwc uzfwc lztwc lzfsc and lzfpc analogous to soil moisture contents in the sac smc model are used to estimate and define amc states fig 7 shows the maximum capacity of the five state variables across the napa river basin in terms of spatial variability state variables in the upper zone represent a more homogeneous pattern than those in the lower zone the coefficients of variation across the application basin are uztwc 0 264 uzfwc 0 310 lztwc 0 518 lzfsc 0 477 and lzfpc 0 470 soil moisture capacities in the lower zone are higher along stream channels on an areal average basis the lower zone capacity 231 0 mm is over twice that of the upper zone 109 5 mm in a comparison result of the capacities between tension and free waters it was found that the tension water capacity naturally plays a more dominant role in retaining water than free water capacity in both zones as the free water is easily moved by gravity fourteen storm events were used to estimate amc states using simulations from the calibrated hl rdhm table 2 shows the estimation results of amc mm soil saturation and fraction of total soil moisture content for each of the conceptual soil moisture storages in the estimation results the states of amc are binned into three categories dry normal and wet among the fourteen cases event 10 is the driest case event 05 represents the normal case and event 03 is the wettest case in the driest case total amc is 21 8 mm corresponding to 6 1 saturation according to the two surface weather stations st helena and napa hospital located in the napa river basin there had been no rain for five days prior with only intermittent antecedent precipitation totaling 20 3 mm for the previous 30 days which means the amc state at the time was a moderately dry condition on the other hand the wettest case was derived from a complex storm generating two or more peak flows yielding a total amc of 184 8 mm or 51 4 saturation which is 8 5 times more saturated than the driest case additionally the total amc in the normal case which is close to average conditions among the fourteen cases is 89 9 mm or 23 3 saturation 3 2 assessment of effects on total runoff flow to examine the effects of precipitation and amc on flood frequency total runoff flows trf and peak flows simulated from a variety of t year distributed precipitation fields and amc states were used the trf expressed as an areal average depth was used to review the variability of total runoff volume and the peak flow was used to derive the relation of ff amc pf in the amc states the minimum 21 8 mm and maximum 184 8 mm values indicate the driest and the wettest cases of amc respectively and the normal state is 83 3 mm corresponding to 23 2 saturation in this section the three representative amc states and 2 and 200 year precipitation ranges were mainly used to analyze the results as mentioned above table 3 and fig 8 show the results of the trfs simulated with t year precipitation and amc states the trfs were simulated to a range from 20 3 mm in the case of 2 year precipitation and the driest state to 252 9 mm in the case of 200 year precipitation and the wettest state notable is the contribution of amc to runoff flows when amc states exceed a specific threshold in some cases trfs are generated with more than the actual total amount of precipitation even when accounting for the initial loss of the precipitation in the wettest case for example the runoff coefficients range from 1 80 to 2 13 indicating contributions of the amc to trfs the results were found when exceeding 23 1 normal amc of soil saturation there are three cases 3 7 and 14 that are more saturated than the normal state this translates to the soil water leading to higher trf as the soil had been retaining enough water to produce surface run off or the water was already running off when a complex storm with two or more independent precipitation pulses occurs in a short interval and antecedent precipitation has saturated the soil this result is realizable as the first precipitation infiltrated into the soil could flow out together with the second precipitation pulse however since the runoff coefficient cannot exceed 1 0 generally it should be noted that the results are based on the procedures established in this study technically the amc states which is a boundary condition and the target event are independent and the boundary condition may have enough amount of water which could flow out as a baseflow especially in the wet cases this is a part of this study to maximize the effect of the amc states on runoff flows to assess the effect of different amc states on trfs the trfs simulated for the same precipitation condition were compared in the case of 2 year precipitation for example the trf from the driest state is 34 of total precipitation while the trf from the wettest state is 202 9 of total precipitation the difference between the two trfs is 106 8 mm larger than 25 year precipitation amount in depth 104 4 mm referring to table 3 this result means that the driest state of amc absorbs roughly 33 4 mm or 56 0 of total precipitation assuming a 10 initial loss of total precipitation on the other hand the wettest amc state contributed 74 4 mm to the trf assuming total precipitation after initial loss was completely drained out the other results showed the same effect as this 2 year precipitation case in addition even for a 200 year precipitation return period for example the trf in the driest case is lower than that arising from a 2 year precipitation event with the wettest amc state see fig 8 additionally in the case of the normal amc state the 10 year precipitation trf is similar to the 200 year precipitation trf under the driest amc considering the extremes the maximum trf 200 year precipitation wettest amc state is a factor of 12 5 times the minimum trf 2 year precipitation driest amc state how trfs changed for the same amc state was examined for 2 and 200 year precipitation magnitudes for the driest amc state the trf difference between 2 and 200 year precipitation events is 54 1 mm for the wettest amc state the difference is 125 8 mm this result suggests that variability of precipitation under the wettest amc state has a larger effect on the trf than under the driest fig 9 shows an incremental trend of the trfs y axis by precipitation increments x axis and linear regression lines to analyze the trend of the increment the precipitation and trf increments are calculated for each t year precipitation event relative to the 2 year precipitation event the effect of the precipitation magnitude on trf is nearly linear linear regression lines have r squared values of 0 99 with saturated soil precipitation magnitude has a large effect on the trf since the regression line slope of the wettest amc state slope 0 63 is steeper than that for the driest amc state slope 0 46 3 3 assessment of effects on peak flow simulated peak flows their t year return periods and the forcing precipitation and amc states are tabulated in table 4 clearly peak flow varies considerably with precipitation and amc in the table the range of peak flow is from 68 6 to 2037 8 m3 s corresponding to a range from 1 1 year to over 1000 year recurrence intervals for a given precipitation condition simulated peak flows differ significantly depending on amc state for 2 year return periods for precipitation maximum peak flow 542 4 m3 s corresponding to a 13 7 year flow is 7 9 times than minimum peak flow 68 6 m3 s corresponding to a 1 1 year flow in terms of flood frequency the maximum return period is 12 5 times the minimum return period for the 200 year return period for precipitation maximum peak flow 2037 8 m3 s corresponding to a 1000 year flow is 3 6 times the minimum peak flow 565 8 m3 s corresponding to a 15 5 year flow in terms of flood frequency the maximum return period is at least 64 5 times the minimum depending on precipitation magnitudes simulated peak flows also vary significantly for a given amc state in the driest amc state maximum peak flow is 8 2 times the minimum in terms of flood frequency the maximum return period is 14 1 times the minimum in the wettest amc state maximum peak flow is 3 8 times the minimum in terms of flood frequency the maximum return period is over 73 0 times the minimum table 4 shows an interesting contrast in runoff characteristics between events 7 45 8 saturation and 14 46 0 saturation despite an almost negligible difference in the degree of saturation 0 2 but the peak flow for event 7 is 1 24 times that of event 14 in both cases tension water dominates the soil water retention but the water content in the upper and lower zones are different in event 7 lower zone tension water is around twice the upper zone tension water see table 4 however in the case of event 14 the tension water content in both of zones is similar upper zone tension water is 73 8 mm the lower zone tension water is 62 8 mm though these results are determined by complicated hydrological processes antecedent precipitation and climatic features during days with no rain it is clear that the state of total amc plays a significant role in generating peak flows and moisture contents in soil layers fig 10 shows how peak flows y axis change with the states of amc the top x axis is a degree of saturation the bottom is amc in depth specifically demonstrating the effect of amc state on peak flows from different precipitation conditions 2 and 200 year recurrence intervals exponential and linear regression lines fitted to the peak flow responses to the state of amc demonstrate that peak flows increase considerably with increasing amc states in both of the 2 and 200 year precipitation cases r squared values of the exponential and linear regression lines exceed 0 96 the regression lines are comparable in terms of statistics the linear regression lines for example show that the impact of amc on peak flows is obviously different depending on the precipitation magnitudes since the slope of linear regression line resulted from 200 year precipitation is roughly 3 times the 2 year precipitation case similar to the case of the trf relationship this indicates peak flows could be more sensitive to precipitation magnitudes when the soil is saturated peak flows estimated from hydrologic frequency analysis ffa flood and simulated from distributed hydrologic modeling dhm flood in this study are compared in fig 11 ffa flood is a set of peak flows corresponding to 2 200 year return periods of flood as tabulated in table 4 dhm flood is a set of peak flows simulated using 2 200 year precipitation fields and the states of amc there are several interesting issues to discuss 1 the relation of the ffa flood and the dhm flood 2 the effect of the state of amc on the relation of the ffa flood and the dhm flood and 3 whether the dhm flood approach can properly simulate the ffa floods the issues can be addressed by first considering whether t year precipitation can generate identical return periods of ffa flood also it was found that the relation of t year ffa floods and dhm floods are nearly linear as the r squared ranges from 0 98 to 0 99 the regression lines are naturally moving up and down by the states of amc the slopes of the wettest the normal and the driest states are 1 98 0 94 and 0 47 respectively this result indicates that the effect of the amc states has a larger effect on the relation as the amc state is getting saturated issue 2 above regarding the third issue it was possible to simulate nearly identical ffa floods using the normal state of amc dhm floods from the normal state of amc are quite similar with the ffa floods in fig 14 the scatter points of peak flows between ffa flood and dhm flood from the normal state are remarkably close to y x and the linear regression line has r squared value 0 99 which is enough to regard the relation of ffa flood and dhm flood as linear this result indicates that t year precipitation fields can generate peak flows corresponding to nearly identical recurrence intervals of flood through adopting the normal state of amc as a boundary condition for the t year flood simulation process using the hydrologic model thus we could define the normal amc condition of approximately 23 3 saturation as the standard state of amc which could simulate t year floods by using corresponding return periods of precipitation fig 12 shows the relation of precipitation frequency pf the state of amc and flood frequency it contains the potentially feasible range of flood frequency by pf and amc this figure consists of three lines representing each relation depending on the three states of amc the range of flooding return periods was considerable depending on the states of amc and the pfs in the driest state of amc 1 1 15 5 year flood could be generated and in the wettest state of amc 13 7 over 1000 year flood could be generated by the pfs a remarkable feature in this result is that 200 year precipitation in the driest state can generate only a peak flow corresponding to 21 year recurrence interval which demonstrates that the state of amc has a large effect on flood frequency in the case of the normal state of amc however t year precipitation yielded approximately the same t year return period of flood in the wettest state of amc only 5 year precipitation could generate a 50 year flood event 4 discussion and conclusions this study assessed the effects of antecedent moisture condition on flood frequency using the hl rdhm distributed hydrologic model forced with t year distributed precipitation data under a range of amc states this study described the need of pre processings to generate the t year distributed precipitations and to estimate the amc states the assessment was conducted in terms of reviewing the relations among trf amc pf and ff amc pf to focus on the effect of precipitation magnitudes and amc states on discharge however we have several assumptions which might generate uncertainties and it should be shared with readers and for future works the methodology used in this study is for smaller watersheds whose amc states and precipitation magnitudes are primary drivers to occur extreme floods also it is for specific watersheds with no upstream regulation and no effects of snow on streamflows the hl rdhm used in this study was calibrated using the observed streamflow data while the sac sma model was not calibrated as the application area has no soil moisture observation sensors according to the calibration results described in the chapter 3 2 the results showed the acceptable statistics of the simulated hydrographs against to the observed data but it should be noted that the estimated soil moisture contents might have bias compared to true values as the fact could occur systematic errors of the sac sma state variables understanding uncertainties in the rainfall runoff modelling needs for meaningful quantification of the results beven 1993 pappenberger and beven 2006 since the hl rdhm used in this study is one of rainfall runoff models potential uncertainties due to hydrological modelling should be discussed in this chapter in general the uncertainties may arise from the model structure butts et al 2004 parameterization process etter et al 2018 and boundary conditions pappenberger et al 2006 especially the parameterization process depends on how many observation points and long data record are used to calibrate a model for a watershed matter etter et al 2018 in this study two streamflow observation points were used to calibrate and verify the model but soil moisture variables were not verified due to the absent of soil moisture monitoring system in the application watershed the soil moisture variables e g volumetric soil moisture contents such as an amount of free and tension waters are important to derive direct runoff flows which determine a magnitude and timing of peak flows in hydrological modeling considering the comments from previous studies and the study procedure it should be noted that the results could be slightly varied with hydrologic models and calibration conditions however it is speculated that the uncertainties will be not big enough to change the results and conclusions below in addition this study is an experimental regional study and has a hypothesis and constraint a this study assumed the application basin as a small medium category size whose antecedent soil moisture states and precipitation magnitudes are main drivers to occur extreme floods thus artificial effects e g dam operation on estimating flood frequency is excluded b since this study is implemented using a target storm event which has specific features the results might be varied in features of an applied target storm event especially a duration period based on these hypothesis constraint and methodology the conclusions are described as follows the maximum trf for the 200 year precipitation and wettest amc state is 12 5 times the minimum trf for 2 year precipitation and driest amc state for wetter than normal amc states trfs were generating more runoff than the total precipitation amount due to the soil already running off or retaining enough water to run off such cases are likely in a complex storm event with multiple pulses of precipitation we found that the relation of the precipitation magnitude on trf is nearly linear given the constraints of this study overall results demonstrate that the effect of amc state is larger than precipitation magnitude on trfs the relation of ffa flood and dhm flood based on the normal state of amc were remarkably close to 1 1 meaning that the relation of ffa flood and dhm flood is interchangeable this result suggests that when amc is near normal a 100 year precipitation event could generate a peak flow corresponding to approximately the 100 year flood frequency thus we could define the normal state to the standard state of amc which can simulate t year ffa floods by using hydrologic modeling with corresponding t year precipitation inputs the amc state has a large effect on flood frequency demonstrated by the fact that a 200 year precipitation event in the driest amc state generates a peak flow only corresponding to a 15 5 year recurrence interval also a 10 year precipitation event in the wettest amc state could generate a 150 year flow based on our results in the study region a rainy season with a saturated soil condition a roughly 7 year precipitation event could trigger an extreme flood event with over a 100 year return period on the other hand a 200 year precipitation event could generate around a 15 year flood event during a dry season with drier than normal soils in conclusion this study derived the relations of ff amc pf and confirmed the considerable effects of amc and precipitation and their interaction on flood discharge in t year recurrence intervals it is expected that this analysis could be applied to many flood related areas in terms of hydrological analysis of flood the relations could be used to assess contributions of amc state and precipitation magnitude to flood frequency thresholds for rainy and dry seasons using the relations and predicted precipitation we are able to estimate predicted flood intensity to a t year return period finally the importance of soil moisture to flood runoff should be emphasized clearly soil moisture monitoring could aid in improving flood forecasting declaration

8403,study region this study region is the napa river basin in california whose antecedent soil moisture states and precipitation magnitudes are primary drivers to occur extreme floods study focus this study assessed the influence of antecedent moisture condition on flood frequency based on an experimental application scheme and pre processing for this purpose t year flood simulations were conducted using a distributed hydrologic model distributed precipitation patterns which have an amount of precipitation corresponding to a specific t year return period were generated by representative radar based precipitation fields and precipitation frequency analysis dry normal and wet of antecedent moisture condition were applied to each t year flood simulation to reflect variable initial soil moisture states new hydrological insights for the region the relationship among flood frequency antecedent moisture condition and precipitation frequency was derived for a specific target storm event for normal antecedent moisture states the relation showed that t year precipitation could generate floods having return intervals nearly identical to those derived using gage records for saturated soil conditions a 7 year precipitation event could trigger a 100 year flood conversely a 200 year precipitation event with dry soil conditions might generate only a 15 year flood event the results emphasize the importance of soil moisture to flood runoff and suggest that soil moisture monitoring could aid in improving flood forecasting keywords flood frequency antecedent moisture condition precipitation frequency t year flood simulation distributed hydrologic model radar based precipitation data 1 introduction in hydrology flood frequency ff analysis has been used for decades due to its applicability and utility katz et al 2002 one of the major applications of ff is the prediction of proper design floods for constructing hydraulic structures such as dams bridges levees culverts highways and sewage disposal plants dalrymple 1960 also knowledge of the ff is necessary to quantify and classify risk levels of a flood event in vulnerable areas since floods with t year recurrence intervals are reference values to measure the intensity of flood events ff has informed forecasters operators and decision makers responsible for issuing flood warnings and operating hydraulic infrastructures for example coupling flood forecasting to distributed hydrologic models that generate runoff outputs at any location in the domain enables prediction of flood risk levels for an entire watershed even in ungauged regions the general approach of ff analysis is based on deriving ff curves by estimating the exceedance probability of annual maximum flood series gumbel 1941 powell 1943 eagleson 1972 england et al 2018 most countries including the united states use the ff methodology and have also modified the general approach to characterize uncertainty cameron et al 1999 blazkova and beven 2002 brath et al 2006 halbert et al 2016 regional variability pandey and nguyen 1999 de michele and rosso 2001 ouarda et al 2001 smith et al 2015 climate change impacts cameron et al 2000 kay et al 2009 arnell and gosling 2016 and urbanization impacts hollis 1975 prosdocimi et al 2015 on ff on the other hand there are arguments against employing general ff analysis due to wrong interpretation of ff randomness and probability of annual maximum floods and extrapolations of ff curves klemeš 2006 merz and gunter 2008a 2008b raised up an issue that a number of intrinsic weaknesses of the flood frequency analysis mainly related to the problem that the available flood peak sample cannot be representative of behavior of potential future floods the continuous rainfall runoff simulation opens up several avenues of research notably with respect to uncertainty in estimating flood frequency and the question of consistency of model calibrations i e parameterization for both continuous flow series and flood frequency simulation cameron et al 1999 if a continuous model is provided with observed rainfall data then will one or more sets of parameters that provide acceptable rainfall runoff simulation results could provide acceptable estimates of the flood frequency characteristics a number of previous studies who proposed continuous rainfall runoff simulation to estimate flood frequency showed how the continuous modeling can be used to quantify floods for spillway design bergstrôm et al 1993 and under climate change cameron et al 1999 2000 blazkova and beven 2002 implemented the attempt at flood frequency estimation by continuous simulation to include the possibility of snowmelt and rain on snow flood cases cameron et al 1999 well described the benefits of employing a continuous rainfall runoff simulation for estimating flood frequency although many studies have highlighted the importance of hydrological reasoning in flood frequency estimation most publications in the hydrological literature have focused on subtleties of the estimation problem merz and gunter 2008a 2008b this study intends to address another issue namely the relations between ff antecedent moisture condition amc and precipitation and is to answer the two questions which have not been explored before 1 depending on the states of antecedent moisture content what scale i e flood frequency of flooding can occur and 2 depending on the interactions of antecedent moisture states and precipitation magnitude what scale of flooding can occur since each flood value in the annual maximum flood series used in ff analysis arises from specific precipitation and amc conditions we are interested in the interactions between these conditions and ff we hypothesize that the estimating the thresholds of amc and precipitation that generate an extreme flood return period are the most significant question in terms of flood forecasting however it is difficult to find reasonable answers to the question from ff analysis this is because t year floods only represent probabilistic flood levels by adopting t year recurrence intervals which themselves are based on historic flood events and are not representative of ff amc precipitation relations thus it is necessary to implement an assessment of amc and precipitation on ff to examine the variability of flood frequency in response to them a number of studies have reviewed the effects of amc and precipitation on runoff flows de paola et al 2013 han et al 2019 osborn and hickok 1968 hawkins et al 1985 merz and plate 1997 tucker and bras 2000 tramblay et al 2010 yoo et al 2012 huza et al 2014 as precipitation is the primary source of the variability of runoff responses precipitation magnitude must be predicted prior to a storm event amc also has a large effect on flood discharge as it determines a volume of direct runoff martínez mena et al 1998 castillo et al 2003 tramblay et al 2010 penna et al 2011 kim et al 2018a kim et al 2018b chifflard et al 2018 many studies address the effect of amc on runoff flows de michele and salvadori 2002 analyzed the influence of amc on flood frequency distribution and derived the distribution of peak flows conditioned by the amc statistical law castillo et al 2003 examined the effect of initial soil moisture content on runoff response in the green ampt method by deploying a monte carlo simulation technique for different scenarios javelle et al 2010 emphasized the influence of amc in potential flood vulnerable areas the use of ff is highly efficient but cannot represent interactions and contributions of amc and precipitation to ff the previous studies cited above reviewed the effects of amc and precipitation on runoff but did not investigate the relation between precipitation frequency pf amc states and ff or the effect of the amc pf interactions on ff to resolve the issues it is needed to derive ff amc pf relations and to confirm their interactions with flood discharge it is also necessary to review the contributions of precipitation and amc to a specific t year return period of flood in order to estimate the thresholds of precipitation and amc that could generate an extreme return period of flood the aim of this study is to assess effects of amc on flood frequency the assessment is implemented by using rainfall runoff simulations with various precipitation magnitudes and amc states pf is used to consider various and specific precipitation magnitudes and to generate t year precipitation data multi radar multi sensor mrms is used to reflect the spatial distribution of the observed precipitation field using mrms data and t year precipitation information t year distributed precipitation fields are generated through a simple merging approach the noaa hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm is used as the distributed hydrologic and continuous model it is based on the sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma methodology amc states are estimated and classified using state variables in sac sma finally this study simulates t year floods by forcing the hydrologic model with t year distributed precipitation data and the amc states and diagnoses the impact of precipitation and amc on flood frequency through analysis of total runoff flows trf and peak flows the napa river basin in northern california is selected as an application area section 2 details the distributed hydrologic model the radar based precipitation product and the assessment process and pre processing methods used section 3 explains the application watershed data and the pre processing results which cover analyses of precipitation and flood frequency generation of t year distributed precipitation fields and estimation of the states of amc section 4 provides the assessment results for total runoff flows and peak flows 2 materials and methods 2 1 application basin and data the test basin used is the napa river basin located in northwestern napa county just south of the summit of mt st helena in the mayacamas mountains of the california coast range fig 1 shows the napa river basin showing its elevation and hrap grid network and drainage channel network the napa river begins as the seasonal kimball canyon creek in robert louis stevenson state park at an elevation of 3745 feet 1141 m which descends the southern slopes of mt st helena to kimball canyon dam johnson et al 2016 in 1986 the worst of 23 floods recorded since 1865 on the napa river occurred 5000 people were evacuated 250 homes were destroyed and three people lost their lives the napa river basin has complex terrain with land cover dominated 65 by area by a combination of evergreen forest and grassland this basin has two continuous flow gages managed by the u s geological survey usgs the upper gage is napa r nr st helena ca station called the st helena station herein and the lower gage is usgs 11458000 napa r nr napa ca station napa station fig 1 the napa station was the primary site used for this study it has a drainage area of 564 6 sq km over which the annual average precipitation is 703 8 mm and of which roughly 80 occurs during a rainy season from november to march unfortunately the application basin has no available monitoring system for soil moisture the napa river watershed is covered by two s band next generation radars nexrads kdax and kmux operated by the national weather service nws and kpix radar c band gap filling tv station radar i e kpix mrms qpe products were generated using the combination of nexrad and kpix radar data in this study gridded precipitation fields at a spatial resolution of 1 0 km and an hourly temporal resolution are used to implement the pre processing radar based precipitation data provides a gridded precipitation field representing the spatial variability of precipitation intensity with specific resolutions yoo et al 2013 kim and yoo 2014 kim et al 2015 in the us the multi radar multi sensor mrms product is distinguished by its high accuracy and national consistency willie et al 2016 mrms s automated algorithms integrate data streams from ground based multiple radars air observations lightning detection systems and satellite and forecast based models the primary purpose of the mrms system is to produce severe weather and precipitation products for decision making capability to improve severe weather forecasts and warnings hydrology aviation and numerical weather prediction zhang et al 2016 this study used mrms data produced by willie et al 2016 mrms qpe products include radar only radar only with vpr correction and radar with vpr and gauge correction qpe based on the availability of the relevant input data the radar with vpr and gauge correction qpe is used in this study since its assessment is superior to the other products 2 2 distributed hydrologic model the use of a distributed hydrologic model dhm is an attractive alternative to hydrological process simulation for rainfall runoff analysis and flood prediction with remote sensing inputs and geographic information systems krajewski et al 1991 this study employs a dhm for simulating t year floods because dhms are capable of capturing the spatial distribution of meteorological input variables e g precipitation and physical parameters e g soil saturation and terrain routing related while a lumped or semi distributed hydrologic model is not able to zhang et al 2013 among many of the developed dhms the hydrological laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm developed by the noaa national weather service nws office of hydrologic development ohd can accurately forecast the complex water balance dynamics of watersheds spies et al 2015 the hl rdhm is a combination of physically based and conceptual model features koren et al 2004 this model consists of a conceptual water balance model sorooshian et al 1993 applied on a regular spatial grid linked to physically based kinematic hillslope and channel routing models chow et al 1988 the hl rdhm was designed and implemented for the entire contiguous united states and can be applied for any grid resolution and time step national weather service nws 2011 thorstensen et al 2016 the hl rdhm takes account of the spatial variability of weather variables land use soils and terrain as the model is based on the hydrologic rainfall analysis project hrap grid structure providing an efficient interface for spatially distributed inputs and hydrologic outputs koren et al 2003 in contrast to traditional lumped models advantages of the hl rdhm include the ability to use gridded remote sensing precipitation data and to derive estimates of runoff flow and soil moisture at any location in the watershed the hl rdhm integrates algorithms for spatially distributed precipitation e g radar based precipitation data in hrap soil moisture accounting snowmelt and evapotranspiration conceptual hillslope and channel routing for more detailed descriptions of the method see nws 2011 and thorstensen et al 2016 the core of the hl rdhm is the sac sma model which determines contributions of precipitation to the infiltrated water and runoff flow sorooshian et al 1993 fig 2 shows the conceptual diagram of the model structure within the hydrologic cycle the sac sma model is a conceptual soil moisture accounting model consisting of tension and free water in the upper and lower zones to characterize soil moisture states and runoff components to represent soil moisture storage and movement within each zone the sac sma has 16 parameters including six relating to soil moisture storage capacity three for recession four for percolation and the three related non modified parameters thorstensen et al 2016 the sac sma also has five states of soil moisture content that could be used as boundary conditions of amc adimc is dependent on uztwc and lztwc as shown in fig 2 these states result from antecedent precipitation and interactions of hydrological processes drainage evaporation and transpiration with water in a soil column representing the current amount of tension and free water contents in the upper and lower zones in the upper zone the water content state rapidly decreases due to subsurface runoff by free water and the tension water by evaporation or evapotranspiration in the lower zone free water storage is divided into two sub storages that control supplemental flow fast and primary groundwater flow slow between upper and lower zones percolation is a link to supply water to a lower zone 2 3 application scheme and pre processing we establish an application scheme to implement the assessment of precipitation and amc to ff at the heart of which is simulating t year floods by forcing reasonable alternatives of precipitation and amc the scheme includes the following steps 1 pre processing to generate t year distributed precipitation and amc states to reflect dry normal and wet conditions 2 rainfall runoff modeling to generate runoff outputs from each amc and 3 assessment of the combined precipitation and amc on the runoff outputs fig 3 shows the application algorithm and methods in the pre processing there are three major components as follows a precipitation and flood frequency analysis b generation of t year distributed precipitation fields and c estimation and identification of amc states corresponding to the driest normal and wettest cases to implement component a this study adopts references that provide reasonable frequency analysis results in precipitation and runoff conditions the details of which are described in section 3 3 in component b t year distributed precipitation fields are generated from the mrms qpe product and t year precipitation from the pf analysis the pf from the first component a is used for estimating precipitation magnitudes corresponding to t year recurrence intervals of precipitation in the application watershed the spatial distributions of precipitation are extracted from an actual event defined as the target storm which represents typical climatic precipitation patterns in the napa river watershed to seek the target storm with a spatial distribution most similar to the long term climate precipitation pattern mrms qpe products are compared with prism climate data http www prism oregonstate edu at the hrap resolution 4 0 km from 30 years of recorded data when comparing mrms qpe products and prism climate data the accumulated precipitation fields are used since prism climate data is only available for monthly values the details of the comparison are described in session 3 1 2 to generate t year distributed precipitation fields a simple merging approach is applied using the spatiotemporal distributions of the target storm and t year precipitation for example if the target storm has a duration of 12 h the specific t year distributed precipitation in hourly time steps consists of 12 distributed precipitation fields equal to the target storm the temporal distribution of precipitation also follows that of the target storm the temporal distribution of the target storm is extracted using hourly areal average precipitation aap the aap is calculated from eq 1 1 a a p r g t j 1 m i 1 n r g t i j n m while the temporal distribution of t year precipitation is resolved as that of the target storm by using eq 2 2 r f t r f a a p r g t i 1 d u r a t i o n a a p r g i where aap is the areal average precipitation rg t is the gridded precipitation field e g mrms qpe products at time t rg t i j is each value in the gridded precipitation field and n and m are row and column numbers rf t is the temporally resolved hourly t year precipitation rf is t year precipitation corresponding to a specific recurrence interval the merging approach for distributed precipitation fields using mrms qpe products and t year precipitation is implemented using scale factors to match the hourly precipitation amount of the distributed precipitation fields with the hourly t year precipitation temporally resolved in this process the scale factor is calculated from eq 3 for each time step t and at each grid i j of mrms qpe data from eq 3 mrms qpe fields at each t are normalized using the aap value for whole girds the mrms qpe fields are then scaled up by multiplying the scale factor to the normalized mrms qpe field through eq 4 thus the areal average value of the scaled up precipitation field equals that of the temporally resolved hourly t year precipitation at the same t through this final step t year distributed precipitation can be generated for the duration of a target storm 3 f s c a l e t i j r g t i j a a p r g t 4 r f g t i j r f t f s c a l e t i j in eq 3 fscale is scale factor for each grid value at time t rfg t i j in eq 4 is each grid value in t year distributed precipitation fields in the component c of the pre processing the states of amc are estimated for a variety of soil moisture boundary conditions to the t year flood simulations five states of soil moisture content in sac smc model are used as indices representing the amc states with free and tension waters in the upper and lower zones many sets of the five states comprising the amcs are estimated by simulating multiple storm events and then amc states are classified as either driest normal or wettest conditions in the t year flood simulation process the hl rdhm for the application watershed is established and calibrated and t year flood simulations are implemented by forcing the hl rdhm model with the generated t year distributed precipitation and the estimated states of amc total runoff flows trf in depth and peak flows are used to conduct the assessment and the relations of trf amc pf and ff amc pf are derived in addition this application scheme is specified to smaller watersheds whose amc states and precipitation magnitudes are primary drivers to occur extreme floods also it has no upstream regulation and no effects of snow on streamflows detailed results of the processing described above is addressed in section 3 1 it contains results of hydrological modeling generated t year distributed precipitation fields and estimated antecedent moisture content states 2 4 precipitation and flood frequency this study employed noaa atlas 14 developed by the hydrometeorological design studies center within the office of hydrologic development of the noaa s national weather service perica et al 2014 we selected a range of return periods from 2 to 200 years for a length of 12 h since the target storm has a 12 h duration for the duration of 12 h the drainage area for the saint helena station has t year precipitation areal average depths ranging from 69 1 mm 2 year to 150 6 mm 200 year whole those at napa station range from 50 3 mm to 130 3 mm this study employed regional flood frequency equations from gotvald et al 2012 who implemented regional regression analysis using generalized least squares regression to develop a set of equations with 50 20 10 4 2 1 0 5 and 0 2 percent annual exceedance probabilities the analysis was predicated on the availability of at least 10 years of annual peak flow data and that peak flows were not substantially affected by diversions or urbanization the flood frequency equation in gotvald et al 2012 has two parameters drainage area and average annual precipitation fig 4 shows the estimated peak flows corresponding to t year recurrence intervals at the napa station the range is from 175 to 1224 m3 s for 2 500 year recurrence intervals 5 t y e a r r e t u r n p e r i o d e x p 0 005269 s i m u l a t e d p e a k f l o w 0 785 in addition an equation to convert simulated peak flows to t year return periods is required in this study thus this study derived the equation resulting from regression analysis using the exponential function as shown below in eq 5 since the r squared value for the regression equation is above 0 98 the equation was deemed acceptable to convert the simulated peak flows to t year return periods for deriving the relation of pf amc and ff 3 results 3 1 pre processing results for t year flood simulations 3 1 1 hydrological modeling the hl rdhm model over the napa river basin was calibrated based on the gridded structure hrap approximately 4 0 km grid size this calibration involved refining the a priori parameters to adapt them to the local physiographic soils and vegetative characteristics of the watersheds this study implemented the hl rdhm using a manual calibration method adopted from anderson 2002 although manual calibration can be used to track dynamic interactions in the atmosphere land surface system the process is complicated and highly labor intensive for calibration we simultaneously used several criteria namely hydrograph shape peak flow runoff volume event start time recession rise turning point and recession slope to evaluate the simulated hydrograph the scalar multipliers of the gridded sac sma component and routing parameters were iteratively adjusted it is not our goal to optimize calibration instead we calibrate only to tune the model to an acceptable condition so that the model techniques can appropriately regulate water between surface soil and channels to accommodate various storm situations once the simulated hydrographs reasonably reflect precipitation inputs and initial states in the aforementioned criteria the manual calibration process was stopped in addition table 1 shows the calibration results for the two napa river usgs gage stations the calibration was implemented for a period from february to december 2011 and the results shown in table 1 consist of three statistics for long term period calibration and five statistics for event based calibration since the nash sutcliffe peak flow and time to peak results were reasonable the calibration was deemed acceptable for implementing t year flood simulations 3 1 2 generation of t year distributed precipitation fields a storm event from 20 december 2012 is selected as the target storm this storm yielded total areal average precipitation of 58 3 mm for 12 h according to noaa atlas 14 precipitation frequency table 3 the target storm represents between a 1 and 2 year return period storm event fig 6 shows hourly precipitation fields of the target storm observed peak flow was 371 0 m3 s 0800 pst 24 december 2012 at the usgs napa station close to a 5 year recurrence interval the california nevada river forecast center cnrfc issued a flood warning in response to the high flows there are two main reasons for selecting the 20 december 2012 event as the target storm firstly the target storm has a spatial distribution similar to that of the prism climate precipitation distribution fig 5 shows the spatial distributions of digital elevation model dem prism climate fields for mean annual precipitation and 30 year mean december precipitation and the target storm precipitation field from the mrms qpe product radar vpr gr this comparison showed the heaviest precipitation in the higher elevation regions of the upper napa river basin the correlation coefficients of the spatial distributions for the target storm precipitation field with annual average precipitation and average precipitation on december were 0 638 and 0 750 respectively secondly the target storm represents a typical event during the california rainy season generally during the rainy season precipitation ranging from 406 4 mm to 558 8 mm which is 80 of annual average precipitation occurs in the napa river basin this study confirmed that the primary water vapor of the target storm event was created in the pacific ocean and came through san francisco bay area which is a common route water vapor comes into due to the complex terrain of the napa river basin the target storm event showed convective precipitation which is generally more intense and of shorter duration than stratiform precipitation this is a reason for the heaviest precipitation in the higher elevation regions of the application basin according to the historical record at the usgs napa station most of annual maximum peak flows are recorded during this period the temporal distribution was extracted from the target storm to reflect a consistent time distribution to all the t year distributed precipitation fields and is then identified according to theory established by huff 1967 who suggested four first second third and fourth quartile storms of time distribution of a storm depending on a point of the time for a peak depth of precipitation according to huff 1967 the time distribution of the target storm is defined as the third quartile storm which has a peak at the third quartile 2 200 year distributed precipitation derived from the radar based precipitation fields and t year precipitation through the merging approach were generated as shown in fig 6 the spatial distribution of the precipitation fields is consistent but the qpe represent different amounts depending on the t year return periods 3 1 3 estimation of antecedent moisture content states this pre processing step focuses on estimating and defining the states of amc from various storm events the five state variables uztwc uzfwc lztwc lzfsc and lzfpc analogous to soil moisture contents in the sac smc model are used to estimate and define amc states fig 7 shows the maximum capacity of the five state variables across the napa river basin in terms of spatial variability state variables in the upper zone represent a more homogeneous pattern than those in the lower zone the coefficients of variation across the application basin are uztwc 0 264 uzfwc 0 310 lztwc 0 518 lzfsc 0 477 and lzfpc 0 470 soil moisture capacities in the lower zone are higher along stream channels on an areal average basis the lower zone capacity 231 0 mm is over twice that of the upper zone 109 5 mm in a comparison result of the capacities between tension and free waters it was found that the tension water capacity naturally plays a more dominant role in retaining water than free water capacity in both zones as the free water is easily moved by gravity fourteen storm events were used to estimate amc states using simulations from the calibrated hl rdhm table 2 shows the estimation results of amc mm soil saturation and fraction of total soil moisture content for each of the conceptual soil moisture storages in the estimation results the states of amc are binned into three categories dry normal and wet among the fourteen cases event 10 is the driest case event 05 represents the normal case and event 03 is the wettest case in the driest case total amc is 21 8 mm corresponding to 6 1 saturation according to the two surface weather stations st helena and napa hospital located in the napa river basin there had been no rain for five days prior with only intermittent antecedent precipitation totaling 20 3 mm for the previous 30 days which means the amc state at the time was a moderately dry condition on the other hand the wettest case was derived from a complex storm generating two or more peak flows yielding a total amc of 184 8 mm or 51 4 saturation which is 8 5 times more saturated than the driest case additionally the total amc in the normal case which is close to average conditions among the fourteen cases is 89 9 mm or 23 3 saturation 3 2 assessment of effects on total runoff flow to examine the effects of precipitation and amc on flood frequency total runoff flows trf and peak flows simulated from a variety of t year distributed precipitation fields and amc states were used the trf expressed as an areal average depth was used to review the variability of total runoff volume and the peak flow was used to derive the relation of ff amc pf in the amc states the minimum 21 8 mm and maximum 184 8 mm values indicate the driest and the wettest cases of amc respectively and the normal state is 83 3 mm corresponding to 23 2 saturation in this section the three representative amc states and 2 and 200 year precipitation ranges were mainly used to analyze the results as mentioned above table 3 and fig 8 show the results of the trfs simulated with t year precipitation and amc states the trfs were simulated to a range from 20 3 mm in the case of 2 year precipitation and the driest state to 252 9 mm in the case of 200 year precipitation and the wettest state notable is the contribution of amc to runoff flows when amc states exceed a specific threshold in some cases trfs are generated with more than the actual total amount of precipitation even when accounting for the initial loss of the precipitation in the wettest case for example the runoff coefficients range from 1 80 to 2 13 indicating contributions of the amc to trfs the results were found when exceeding 23 1 normal amc of soil saturation there are three cases 3 7 and 14 that are more saturated than the normal state this translates to the soil water leading to higher trf as the soil had been retaining enough water to produce surface run off or the water was already running off when a complex storm with two or more independent precipitation pulses occurs in a short interval and antecedent precipitation has saturated the soil this result is realizable as the first precipitation infiltrated into the soil could flow out together with the second precipitation pulse however since the runoff coefficient cannot exceed 1 0 generally it should be noted that the results are based on the procedures established in this study technically the amc states which is a boundary condition and the target event are independent and the boundary condition may have enough amount of water which could flow out as a baseflow especially in the wet cases this is a part of this study to maximize the effect of the amc states on runoff flows to assess the effect of different amc states on trfs the trfs simulated for the same precipitation condition were compared in the case of 2 year precipitation for example the trf from the driest state is 34 of total precipitation while the trf from the wettest state is 202 9 of total precipitation the difference between the two trfs is 106 8 mm larger than 25 year precipitation amount in depth 104 4 mm referring to table 3 this result means that the driest state of amc absorbs roughly 33 4 mm or 56 0 of total precipitation assuming a 10 initial loss of total precipitation on the other hand the wettest amc state contributed 74 4 mm to the trf assuming total precipitation after initial loss was completely drained out the other results showed the same effect as this 2 year precipitation case in addition even for a 200 year precipitation return period for example the trf in the driest case is lower than that arising from a 2 year precipitation event with the wettest amc state see fig 8 additionally in the case of the normal amc state the 10 year precipitation trf is similar to the 200 year precipitation trf under the driest amc considering the extremes the maximum trf 200 year precipitation wettest amc state is a factor of 12 5 times the minimum trf 2 year precipitation driest amc state how trfs changed for the same amc state was examined for 2 and 200 year precipitation magnitudes for the driest amc state the trf difference between 2 and 200 year precipitation events is 54 1 mm for the wettest amc state the difference is 125 8 mm this result suggests that variability of precipitation under the wettest amc state has a larger effect on the trf than under the driest fig 9 shows an incremental trend of the trfs y axis by precipitation increments x axis and linear regression lines to analyze the trend of the increment the precipitation and trf increments are calculated for each t year precipitation event relative to the 2 year precipitation event the effect of the precipitation magnitude on trf is nearly linear linear regression lines have r squared values of 0 99 with saturated soil precipitation magnitude has a large effect on the trf since the regression line slope of the wettest amc state slope 0 63 is steeper than that for the driest amc state slope 0 46 3 3 assessment of effects on peak flow simulated peak flows their t year return periods and the forcing precipitation and amc states are tabulated in table 4 clearly peak flow varies considerably with precipitation and amc in the table the range of peak flow is from 68 6 to 2037 8 m3 s corresponding to a range from 1 1 year to over 1000 year recurrence intervals for a given precipitation condition simulated peak flows differ significantly depending on amc state for 2 year return periods for precipitation maximum peak flow 542 4 m3 s corresponding to a 13 7 year flow is 7 9 times than minimum peak flow 68 6 m3 s corresponding to a 1 1 year flow in terms of flood frequency the maximum return period is 12 5 times the minimum return period for the 200 year return period for precipitation maximum peak flow 2037 8 m3 s corresponding to a 1000 year flow is 3 6 times the minimum peak flow 565 8 m3 s corresponding to a 15 5 year flow in terms of flood frequency the maximum return period is at least 64 5 times the minimum depending on precipitation magnitudes simulated peak flows also vary significantly for a given amc state in the driest amc state maximum peak flow is 8 2 times the minimum in terms of flood frequency the maximum return period is 14 1 times the minimum in the wettest amc state maximum peak flow is 3 8 times the minimum in terms of flood frequency the maximum return period is over 73 0 times the minimum table 4 shows an interesting contrast in runoff characteristics between events 7 45 8 saturation and 14 46 0 saturation despite an almost negligible difference in the degree of saturation 0 2 but the peak flow for event 7 is 1 24 times that of event 14 in both cases tension water dominates the soil water retention but the water content in the upper and lower zones are different in event 7 lower zone tension water is around twice the upper zone tension water see table 4 however in the case of event 14 the tension water content in both of zones is similar upper zone tension water is 73 8 mm the lower zone tension water is 62 8 mm though these results are determined by complicated hydrological processes antecedent precipitation and climatic features during days with no rain it is clear that the state of total amc plays a significant role in generating peak flows and moisture contents in soil layers fig 10 shows how peak flows y axis change with the states of amc the top x axis is a degree of saturation the bottom is amc in depth specifically demonstrating the effect of amc state on peak flows from different precipitation conditions 2 and 200 year recurrence intervals exponential and linear regression lines fitted to the peak flow responses to the state of amc demonstrate that peak flows increase considerably with increasing amc states in both of the 2 and 200 year precipitation cases r squared values of the exponential and linear regression lines exceed 0 96 the regression lines are comparable in terms of statistics the linear regression lines for example show that the impact of amc on peak flows is obviously different depending on the precipitation magnitudes since the slope of linear regression line resulted from 200 year precipitation is roughly 3 times the 2 year precipitation case similar to the case of the trf relationship this indicates peak flows could be more sensitive to precipitation magnitudes when the soil is saturated peak flows estimated from hydrologic frequency analysis ffa flood and simulated from distributed hydrologic modeling dhm flood in this study are compared in fig 11 ffa flood is a set of peak flows corresponding to 2 200 year return periods of flood as tabulated in table 4 dhm flood is a set of peak flows simulated using 2 200 year precipitation fields and the states of amc there are several interesting issues to discuss 1 the relation of the ffa flood and the dhm flood 2 the effect of the state of amc on the relation of the ffa flood and the dhm flood and 3 whether the dhm flood approach can properly simulate the ffa floods the issues can be addressed by first considering whether t year precipitation can generate identical return periods of ffa flood also it was found that the relation of t year ffa floods and dhm floods are nearly linear as the r squared ranges from 0 98 to 0 99 the regression lines are naturally moving up and down by the states of amc the slopes of the wettest the normal and the driest states are 1 98 0 94 and 0 47 respectively this result indicates that the effect of the amc states has a larger effect on the relation as the amc state is getting saturated issue 2 above regarding the third issue it was possible to simulate nearly identical ffa floods using the normal state of amc dhm floods from the normal state of amc are quite similar with the ffa floods in fig 14 the scatter points of peak flows between ffa flood and dhm flood from the normal state are remarkably close to y x and the linear regression line has r squared value 0 99 which is enough to regard the relation of ffa flood and dhm flood as linear this result indicates that t year precipitation fields can generate peak flows corresponding to nearly identical recurrence intervals of flood through adopting the normal state of amc as a boundary condition for the t year flood simulation process using the hydrologic model thus we could define the normal amc condition of approximately 23 3 saturation as the standard state of amc which could simulate t year floods by using corresponding return periods of precipitation fig 12 shows the relation of precipitation frequency pf the state of amc and flood frequency it contains the potentially feasible range of flood frequency by pf and amc this figure consists of three lines representing each relation depending on the three states of amc the range of flooding return periods was considerable depending on the states of amc and the pfs in the driest state of amc 1 1 15 5 year flood could be generated and in the wettest state of amc 13 7 over 1000 year flood could be generated by the pfs a remarkable feature in this result is that 200 year precipitation in the driest state can generate only a peak flow corresponding to 21 year recurrence interval which demonstrates that the state of amc has a large effect on flood frequency in the case of the normal state of amc however t year precipitation yielded approximately the same t year return period of flood in the wettest state of amc only 5 year precipitation could generate a 50 year flood event 4 discussion and conclusions this study assessed the effects of antecedent moisture condition on flood frequency using the hl rdhm distributed hydrologic model forced with t year distributed precipitation data under a range of amc states this study described the need of pre processings to generate the t year distributed precipitations and to estimate the amc states the assessment was conducted in terms of reviewing the relations among trf amc pf and ff amc pf to focus on the effect of precipitation magnitudes and amc states on discharge however we have several assumptions which might generate uncertainties and it should be shared with readers and for future works the methodology used in this study is for smaller watersheds whose amc states and precipitation magnitudes are primary drivers to occur extreme floods also it is for specific watersheds with no upstream regulation and no effects of snow on streamflows the hl rdhm used in this study was calibrated using the observed streamflow data while the sac sma model was not calibrated as the application area has no soil moisture observation sensors according to the calibration results described in the chapter 3 2 the results showed the acceptable statistics of the simulated hydrographs against to the observed data but it should be noted that the estimated soil moisture contents might have bias compared to true values as the fact could occur systematic errors of the sac sma state variables understanding uncertainties in the rainfall runoff modelling needs for meaningful quantification of the results beven 1993 pappenberger and beven 2006 since the hl rdhm used in this study is one of rainfall runoff models potential uncertainties due to hydrological modelling should be discussed in this chapter in general the uncertainties may arise from the model structure butts et al 2004 parameterization process etter et al 2018 and boundary conditions pappenberger et al 2006 especially the parameterization process depends on how many observation points and long data record are used to calibrate a model for a watershed matter etter et al 2018 in this study two streamflow observation points were used to calibrate and verify the model but soil moisture variables were not verified due to the absent of soil moisture monitoring system in the application watershed the soil moisture variables e g volumetric soil moisture contents such as an amount of free and tension waters are important to derive direct runoff flows which determine a magnitude and timing of peak flows in hydrological modeling considering the comments from previous studies and the study procedure it should be noted that the results could be slightly varied with hydrologic models and calibration conditions however it is speculated that the uncertainties will be not big enough to change the results and conclusions below in addition this study is an experimental regional study and has a hypothesis and constraint a this study assumed the application basin as a small medium category size whose antecedent soil moisture states and precipitation magnitudes are main drivers to occur extreme floods thus artificial effects e g dam operation on estimating flood frequency is excluded b since this study is implemented using a target storm event which has specific features the results might be varied in features of an applied target storm event especially a duration period based on these hypothesis constraint and methodology the conclusions are described as follows the maximum trf for the 200 year precipitation and wettest amc state is 12 5 times the minimum trf for 2 year precipitation and driest amc state for wetter than normal amc states trfs were generating more runoff than the total precipitation amount due to the soil already running off or retaining enough water to run off such cases are likely in a complex storm event with multiple pulses of precipitation we found that the relation of the precipitation magnitude on trf is nearly linear given the constraints of this study overall results demonstrate that the effect of amc state is larger than precipitation magnitude on trfs the relation of ffa flood and dhm flood based on the normal state of amc were remarkably close to 1 1 meaning that the relation of ffa flood and dhm flood is interchangeable this result suggests that when amc is near normal a 100 year precipitation event could generate a peak flow corresponding to approximately the 100 year flood frequency thus we could define the normal state to the standard state of amc which can simulate t year ffa floods by using hydrologic modeling with corresponding t year precipitation inputs the amc state has a large effect on flood frequency demonstrated by the fact that a 200 year precipitation event in the driest amc state generates a peak flow only corresponding to a 15 5 year recurrence interval also a 10 year precipitation event in the wettest amc state could generate a 150 year flow based on our results in the study region a rainy season with a saturated soil condition a roughly 7 year precipitation event could trigger an extreme flood event with over a 100 year return period on the other hand a 200 year precipitation event could generate around a 15 year flood event during a dry season with drier than normal soils in conclusion this study derived the relations of ff amc pf and confirmed the considerable effects of amc and precipitation and their interaction on flood discharge in t year recurrence intervals it is expected that this analysis could be applied to many flood related areas in terms of hydrological analysis of flood the relations could be used to assess contributions of amc state and precipitation magnitude to flood frequency thresholds for rainy and dry seasons using the relations and predicted precipitation we are able to estimate predicted flood intensity to a t year return period finally the importance of soil moisture to flood runoff should be emphasized clearly soil moisture monitoring could aid in improving flood forecasting declaration

concentrations keywords satellite based precipitation hydrologic modeling water quality simulations occoquan watershed tmpa persiann cmorph 1 introduction the performance of both lumped and distributed hydrologic models is significantly influenced by a number of factors that contribute to uncertainty e g observation errors boundary or initial conditions errors model or system errors scale discrepancies and unknown heterogeneity of parameters nevertheless precipitation is widely accepted as the most influential meteorological input in hydrological and water quality investigations reliable and consistent hydrologic predictions for water quantity and quality depend on the accurate measurement of precipitation the accuracy of precipitation data including its intensity duration spatial patterns and extent greatly influences the output of land surface and hydrologic models maggioni et al 2013 sorooshian et al 2011 zeng et al 2018 due to the lack of ground based monitoring systems and rain gauge networks large scale hydrologic models often rely on remotely sensed precipitation data from satellite sensors maggioni and massari 2018 precipitation whether from rain gauges or satellites is characterized by spatial and temporal variability as well as measurement errors although ground based instrument networks including rain gauges and radars represent the most direct surface rainfall measurements and often provide measurements with high temporal frequency there are many limitations with these systems not only are gauges restricted by point scale observations but they are also subject to false readings due to wind effects and evaporation in addition to measurement errors spatial interpolation of point based observations adds uncertainty to the resulting gridded precipitation datasets habib et al 2012a li et al 2008 maggioni et al 2016 mcmillan et al 2011 the spatial distribution and density of gauges play important roles in the adequacy of measurement a number of studies found that hydrologic model uncertainty is greatly impacted by sparse and irregular rain gauge networks and that uncertainty is reduced by increasing gauge density or by optimizing the distribution pattern bardossy and das 2008 girons lopez et al 2015 moulin et al 2009 maggioni et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 conversely ground based radar networks often provide continuous spatial coverage with high spatial and temporal resolution but they are also limited in accuracy by attenuation and extinction of signal surface backscatter brightband effects and uncertainty of the reflectivity rain rate relationship anagnostou et al 2010 habib et al 2012a porcacchia et al 2017 in addition to being limited in accuracy both ground based gauges and radars are often inadequate due to sparse availability especially outside of the united states satellite based precipitation products spps offer a viable alternative to ground based data through continuous monitoring of precipitation with greater spatial coverage over the past twenty years several studies have compared spps to in situ ground observations evaluating the use of spps as a resource in hydrologic modeling nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 noted that major sources of satellite based precipitation uncertainty arise from algorithmic miscalculations as well as instrumentation and sampling errors hydrological modeling using spps as forcing input particularly for simulations in large complex watersheds involving heterogeneous land use influencing soil moisture fluctuations and evaporation and significant terrain changes is not always adequate mei et al 2014a 2014b milewski et al 2015 seyyedi et al 2015 yang and luo 2014 for instance spps often show an elevation dependent bias with an underestimation of light precipitation at higher elevations maggioni et al 2016 mei et al 2016 villarini et al 2011 and xu et al 2014 found that the accuracy of hydrologic model simulations from spps is impacted not only by product resolution but also by storm severity and basin scale where the most accurate simulation of hydrologic models using spps is when a combination of moderate precipitation magnitudes finer product spatial resolutions and larger basin scales are associated with the model aside from the 3 principal measurement sources used to determine precipitation ground based gauge observations ground based radars and satellite remote sensing precipitation estimates can be obtained from atmospheric retrospective analysis models beck et al 2017 two of the most widely accepted atmospheric reanalysis datasets with long term coverage are i the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim a dataset that uses a 4 dimensional variational analysis a revised humidity analysis and variational bias correction for satellite data berrisford et al 2011 and ii nasa s modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra rienecker et al 2011 moreover there are products that combine a set of data from multiple methods models and observations and or instruments ground and satellite based for instance the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep is a fully global dataset from 1979 to 2017 at 3 h and 0 1 temporal and spatial scales respectively this dataset uses various gauge satellite and reanalysis data to provide precipitation estimates globally beck et al 2017 though re analysis datasets and blended products have the potential for providing good quality precipitation estimates beck et al 2017 duque gardeazábal et al 2018 ma et al 2018 these products were not considered in this study since the use of blended products would not allow for the differentiation of results among instruments and algorithms a plethora of research has been conducted over the past 2 decades on the use of remote sensing products for hydrologic model simulation and predictions intended for flood forecasting riverine modeling and climate studies in complex terrains gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 hussain et al 2018 mei et al 2016 sharifi et al 2018 and across various climatic regions bitew et al 2012 guo and liu 2016 guo et al 2015 milewski et al 2015 verdin et al 2016 where current research falls short is the application of spp data in hydrologic models specifically aimed at simulating and forecasting water quality it is well understood that the intensity frequency and duration of precipitation have significant and direct impacts on runoff quantity and thus streamflow in turn precipitation is also a major driver of water quality a number of studies evaluating and quantifying predictions of stream water quality has demonstrated that spatial temporal variations of water quality is strongly dependent on the spatial and temporal scales of analysis barakat et al 2016 bengraı ne and marhaba 2003 chang 2008 jeznach et al 2017 kang et al 2010 mei et al 2014a 2014b wang et al 2011 wunderlin et al 2001 xu et al 2012 the relationship between water quality indicators and streamflow has been investigated using both parametric distribution dependent and non parametric distribution free methods azhar et al 2015 barakat et al 2016 bu et al 2010 chang 2008 fovet et al 2018 johnson et al 2012 jung et al 2016 kisi and ay 2014 nóbrega et al 2018 noori et al 2010 soler et al 2007 von freyberg et al 2017 all of these past studies demonstrated a direct impact in water quality as it relates to streamflow this study fills this gap in the literature by evaluating the performance of a hydrologic model forced with 3 spps in estimating water quality indicators in the occoquan watershed located in the northern virginia suburbs of washington d c united states the overarching purpose of this study is to determine the suitability of spps as a substitute for rain gauge precipitation data for simulating selected water quality indicators in this study the satellite products are compared to the data collected by a dense rain gauge network to determine their capability of 1 accurately characterizing the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation within the study region and 2 simulating water quantity and quality in the occoquan watershed section 2 describes the study area and the data sets adopted in this work section 3 introduces the methodology section 4 presents and discusses the results and section 5 highlights the main conclusions limitations and future directions 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area the focus of this study is the occoquan watershed a 1500 sq km area located in suburban washington d c in the northern portion of virginia fig 1 the watershed supplies water to 2 drinking water reservoirs lake manassas and the run of the river occoquan reservoir which are part of the drinking water supply to approximately 2 million residents the area is urbanized with a mix of suburban and urban land use and has mild topographic variation the occoquan watershed is part of the potomac river watershed ultimately discharging into the chesapeake bay the occoquan watershed has been a major focus of regulatory oversight for the past 40 years due to the unprecedented growth of the d c metropolitan area which resulted in a substantial increase in reclaimed domestic wastewater discharged to receiving waters in the watershed the closure of 11 marginally functioning water reclamation facilities wrfs and the construction of a single state of the art wrf that currently receives wastewater from prince william and fairfax counties and the cities of manassas and manassas park and discharges to 1 of the 2 tributaries bull run of the occoquan reservoir since 1973 the virginia tech occoquan watershed monitoring laboratory has monitored the watershed through data acquisition from a network of rain gauges meteorological stations and stream monitoring stations precipitation streamflow and several indicators of water quality have been measured continuously throughout the watershed using automated rain gauges and steam monitoring stations shown in fig 1 as blue dots and black squares respectively some of the rain gauges were available online in the 2000 01 period during the course of this study period 2008 2012 data were available from all stations presented in fig 1 the occoquan watershed monitoring laboratory has also been using the u s environmental protection agency s epa hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf model to simulate the hydrology nonpoint source runoff and water quality of the watershed described in detail in section 3 1 the model delineates 87 segments within the 7 catchments of the occoquan watershed as depicted in fig 2 the two reservoirs lake manassas and occoquan reservoirs are simulated using the u s army corps of engineers developed 2 dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model ce qual w2 but are not included in this study as they contribute very little to the water budget except for the rain that falls directly on the reservoir water surfaces the study period of 2008 2012 was chosen because the latest occoquan model addresses that period land use in the watershed is updated every 5 years the point at which the model is updated at the time of this study the 2008 2012 model based on the 2010 land use consisted of the latest available data 2 2 precipitation data ground based precipitation observations are obtained from a network of 15 tipping bucket rain gauges independently operated by the occoquan watershed monitoring laboratory located within or approximate to the occoquan watershed fig 1 the quality controlled gauges collect precipitation measurements in increments of 0 254 mm 0 01 in by recording the time of occurrence of successive tips logged hourly throughout the 5 year temporal span of this study 2008 2012 while ground based gauge observations are widely accepted as providing the most accurate method for precipitation measurement tipping buckets have been known to experience significant levels of error at low rainfall intensities habib et al 2012b and may be sensitive to ground vibrations wind effects and orifice opening size the density of gauges is also important when capturing variability of rainfall at fine temporal scales for extreme events or over complex terrain kidd et al 2017 additionally many gauges are typically not able to measure snowfall accurately and therefore may underestimate the corresponding liquid precipitation equivalent rasmussen et al 2012 alternatively spps are used to estimate precipitation quasi globally using a combination of remotely sensed microwave and infrared sensors here we adopt 3 of the most widely used spps 1 the national aeronautics and space administration nasa tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2010 2 the u s national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center s cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 and 3 the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann cloud classification system ccs hsu et al 2010 this study compares these 3 spps of varying spatial and temporal resolutions as forcing inputs of the hydrologic model to simulate water quality in the occoquan watershed the main characteristics of precipitation products used in this study are summarized in table 1 the trmm satellite mission was launched in 1997 and ceased in 2015 during that time trmm based products provided rainfall rates over the tropics and subtropics between 50 n 50 s huffman et al 2007 2010 specifically the tmpa algorithm combines both infrared and microwave sensor data to produce precipitation products with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 3 h in both real time and latent calibrated versions 3b42 rt and 3b42 v7 respectively this study uses the bias adjusted 3b42 v7 product which will be herein referred to as tmpa the cmorph algorithm produces global precipitation analyses at high resolutions using precipitation estimates derived exclusively from low orbiter satellite microwave observations transported via spatial propagation information obtained from geostationary satellite data joyce et al 2004 cmorph interpolates precipitation features between consecutive microwave sensor samples aboard multiple spacecrafts product data cover the 60 n 60 s area over a period of record from december 2002 to present day data used in this study are reprocessed and the bias corrected at a spatial resolution of 8 km exactly 8 km at equator 0 07 and a 30 minute temporal frequency bias correction is performed by matching cmorph raw data against the cpc daily gauge analysis over land xie et al 2017 persiann ccs first released in 2003 is an algorithm based on infrared brightness temperature that extracts cloud features from a number of geostationary satellites operated by several agencies covering an area between 60 n and 60 s hong et al 2007 hsu et al 1997 sorooshian et al 2000 precipitation estimates are assigned using infrared cloud images from segmented cloud features such as statistics textures and geometry at brightness temperature thresholds this information is used to obtain a relationship between brightness temperature and rainfall rates the persiann ccs algorithm uses gauge corrected radar hourly rainfall data to calibrate cloud top brightness temperature and rainfall relationships for the classified cloud groups in order to estimate precipitation hong et al 2007 persiann ccs hereafter called persiann is available at a spatial resolution of 0 04 and a 30 minute temporal frequency gauge observations are interpolated to each of the 87 segments in the watershed using the nearest neighbor method cumulative precipitation of the interpolated gauge data during the study period is shown in fig 2 for each segment of the occoquan watershed fourteen 14 of the 15 rain gauges across the study area provide hourly records however 1 gauge lrtn 150 located at the downstream extents of the watershed collects records at a daily scale the observations from this gauge are used as precipitation input to 6 segments s54 s60 s63 and s78 located in the occoquan catchment daily records collected at lrtn 150 are disaggregated to hourly values for input into the hspf model the percentage of missing records provided in table 1 does not include missing hourly records for gauge lrtn 150 the spps are processed by spatially averaging all pixels falling within the boundaries of each watershed segment since each satellite precipitation product is provided in a different temporal resolution all satellite data matched to the hourly temporal scale the spatially interpolated gauge data and spatially averaged satellite products at the hourly scale are used as input to the hspf model to simulate streamflow and water quality indicators discussed in section 3 3 since the occoquan hspf model output is set to output at a daily scale precipitation data is subsequently aggregated to daily values for comparison of the spps input data and output results to the gauge based data section 3 2 2 3 stream monitoring stations streamflow stream stage and water quality are measured at 8 stations across the watershed flow and stream stage are continuously measured by automated equipment including a sutron datalogger and flow meter flow and stage are continuously measured and recorded on an hourly basis provided there is no change when there is a change in flow such as during storm events flow and stage are recorded every 15 min until streamflow and stage are normalized xu et al 2007 water quality samples for baseflow conditions are typically obtained once each week and storm samples are composited in the field using an automated sampler paced to sample equal aliquots for equal volume of flow that passes the sampling point then adding these to a compositing bottle water quality parameters including stream temperature tw concentrations of total suspended solids tss orthophosphate phosphorus op ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n dissolved oxygen do biochemical oxygen demand bod and total organic carbon toc are obtained for all samples observed information at the 8 stations is used to calibrate and validate the hydrologic and water quality model analyzing the occoquan watershed while data from 8 stations are used for model calibration and validation this study analyzes results from 3 monitoring stations st25 st60 and st70 specifically for streamflow tw tss do and bod which is discussed in detail in section 3 and 4 3 methodology the first step in this study is to compare each spp tmpa cmorph and persiann to the dense rain gauge network in the occoquan watershed in order to identify differences among the satellite products in the region then the hydrologic model is forced with each satellite product and the traditional rain gauge dataset at the hourly scale to simulate streamflow and water quality indicators in the watershed during the 5 year study period 2008 2012 model outputs are evaluated by comparing the results of daily simulated streamflow and selected water quality indicators from the 3 spp simulations to that of the reference model simulation forced with rain gauge based records 3 1 hydrological model the hspf conceptional lumped hydrological model developed by the occoquan watershed monitoring laboratory is designed to simulate various hydrological processes and associated water quality components in the occoquan watershed xu et al 2007 the model is updated every 5 years with current land use information classified into 14 land use categories based on impervious coverage and soil properties obtained from the northern virginia regional commission and is modeled in 5 year increments with in situ meteorological data air temperature cloud cover dew point temperature wind speed solar radiation potential evapotranspiration and precipitation air temperature cloud cover dew point temperature wind speed and solar radiation are all directly measured at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa weather station located at the washington dulles international airport dulles station approximately 27 km from the centroid of the occoquan watershed hourly readings of the aforementioned data from this station are applied to the model each hour as 1 uniform input to the entire watershed for those parameters since a direct measurement of potential evapotranspiration is not available from the dulles meteorological station used in this study potential evapotranspiration was calculated from the modiﬁed penman pan empirical method using air temperature dew point temperature wind movement and solar radiation obtained from the dulles station the temporal and spatial resolution of the retrieved land use data and all meteorological data i e air temperature cloud cover dew point temperature wind speed solar radiation and potential evapotranspiration aside from precipitation are consistently maintained and are not altered in any way during model simulations precipitation input is retrieved on an hourly basis from the 15 rain gauges within or in proximity to the watershed boundaries although neither an evaluation of the parameter input including land use and meteorological data nor a validation of the long established hspf hydrology model is within the scope of this study a brief description of the model s setup is described herein for additional details of model setup and execution we refer the reader to xu 2005 2007 and maldonado and moglen 2012 precipitation input is retrieved and inputted for each segment from the nearest neighbor rain gauge while all other meteorological data used in the model air temperature cloud cover dew point temperature solar radiation wind speed and wind direction are applied consistently throughout all 87 segments during certain periods of this 5 year study rain gauge observations are not recorded at various gauges missing precipitation records are interpolated since the hspf model requires continuous precipitation input for missing gauge records a standardized procedure is employed to estimate the discrete hourly values based on the spatial and temporal infilling strategy outlined by xu 2005 a similar infilling strategy is applied to missing precipitation data for tmpa cmorph and persiann during the study period using similar procedures outlined in multiple meteorological infilling studies hema and kant 2017 kim and ryu 2015 lee and kang 2015 and recommended by the u s epa 2000 meteorological data gaps are classified into categories based on gap duration for gaps up to 4 h temporal linear interpolation is applied for gaps greater than 4 h a combination of temporal linear interpolation and nearest neighbor pixel value is utilized precipitation input from each satellite product is then aggregated for each segment the watershed is comprised of 87 segments within distinct 7 catchments table 2 fig 2 each of the 7 catchments has a separate hspf model that is linked to create the overall watershed model the hspf model used in this analysis is deterministically calibrated and validated between simulated gauge based results and observed data over a 5 year period from january 1 2008 to december 31 2012 while hspf is able to produce output results as low as 15 minute increments which is the increment flow data are recorded and used for model input the occoquan hspf model is set to output results using a daily scale the daily scale is used to minimize the impacts of timing errors often found using lower increment outputs since hspf is prone to timing errors such as under or over predicting when an event starts and or stops each catchment hspf model is calibrated and validated prior to linking into the adjoining downstream model eight 8 stream monitoring stations throughout the watershed that collect streamflow stream stage and water quality constituents are used to calibrate the hspf model the model is first calibrated on both daily and monthly streamflow by comparing simulated flows from gauge records with observed data from stream monitoring stations during the first 2 years of the study period 2008 2009 results of the simulated model are then validated for an independent period 2010 2012 the model provides output for streamflow and water quality indicators including tw tss op tp nh4 n no3 n tn do bod and toc next the model is calibrated for tss tw op nh4 n and no3 n based on monthly and yearly loads to that of observed in stream data the hspf model is used to simulate streamflow and select water quality indicators at 6 designated evaluation points in the occoquan watershed these 6 locations are located within 3 distinct catchments cedar run upper broad run and upper bull run which capture runoff from a number of segments of varying size land use and topography table 2 fig 2 of the 6 model evaluation points 3 points s47 st25 s79 st60 and s86

observations reveal a well calibrated model at each of the 3 observation locations s47 st25 s79 st60 and s86 st70 error analyses of tw and do at a daily scale and tss at a monthly scale also show good

were then aggregated to the daily scale for comparison with the ground observations precipitation was evaluated at the daily scale for consistency with the daily model output results several metrics are considered to quantify the performance of sppss rmse pearson correlation coefficient pcc standard deviation σ and bias b the rmse a measure of the differences between spp and observed gauge values combines the magnitude of errors in the estimation over time into a single measure of error the pcc is the average product of the deviation of variables from their respective means divided by the standard deviation of those variables standard deviation is used to quantify the amount of variation in the data set b measures the average tendency of satellite data to either overestimate or underestimate the gauge measurements whereas rb evaluates the relative difference in percentage between the estimated and the observed data optimum values of pcc σ and b are 1 0 and 0 respectively the

gauge based dataset section 4 1 probability of detection pod false alarm rate far and critical success index csi are used to assess the detection capability of each spp based on the awsa daily precipitation pod corresponds to the ratio of correct detection of the spp to the overall occurrence of precipitation observed conversely far indicates the number of cases when precipitation is estimated by spp however no precipitation is observed csi is a measure of events successfully detected by the spp to the total number of events observed that are either made or needed schaefer 1990 these metrics all range from 0 to 1 with the accuracy of the spp increasing as the far approaches 0 and the pod and csi approach 1 optimum values of pod far and csi are 1 0 and 1 respectively for this study the precipitation threshold is set to 0 254 mm day which is the threshold of the rain gauges pod far and csi are calculated using eqs 7 9 where hits misses and false alarms represent the total

understood that there is a direct relationship between precipitation and streamflow research has also shown a significant and quantifiable correlation between atmospheric conditions and water quality indicator response chang et al 2015 gelca et al 2016 jeznach et al 2017 johnson et al 2012 murdoch et al 2000 soler et al 2007 thorne and fenner 2011 water quality analysis for this study focuses on tw tss do and bod by definition tss are particles that are larger than 2 μm whereas anything smaller than 2 μm is typically considered a dissolved solid since tss is a specific measurement of all suspended solids organic and inorganic by mass it is a good representation of the total sedimentation rate of a watershed tss is both a visible and quantifiable indicator of overall water quality in a waterbody and therefore is selected for further evaluation in this study do is the measurement of gaseous oxygen dissolved in an aqueous solution which results from diffusion by aeration and as a product of photosynthesis do is an important indicator determining the health and quality of a waterbody for its ability to support life similarly bod is the amount of do needed by aerobic organisms to break down organic matter three 3 statistical metrics pcc rmse and b are used to evaluate the performance of the model in simulating streamflow and the 4 water quality indicators the model simulation forced with rain gauge observations is used as a benchmark to assess the performance of the simulations forced with the 3 different spps uncertainties are quantified for simulated streamflow and selected water quality indicators at 6 evaluation points s26 s27 s34 s47 st25 s79 st60 and s86 st70 of varying drainage area within the watershed discussed in detail in section 4 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of satellite based precipitation products fig 3 presents the spatial distribution of cumulative precipitation over the 5 year study period for each spp at their original pixel resolutions left panels and their corresponding areal weighted value for each segment in the watershed foremost fig 3 highlights the degree of detail for which each precipitation product is available i e a total of 6 48 and 133 precipitation values for tmpa cmorph and persiann respectively in terms of cumulative precipitation within the watershed during the 5 year study period the gauges recorded 4909 mm on average whereas tmpa cmorph and persiann resulted in 5298 mm 5267 mm and 5834 mm respectively therefore persiann showing the largest overestimation with respect to the reference dataset tmpa shows the overall lowest variability of precipitation values which can be attributed to its coarse spatial resolution and consequent low representativeness of the local precipitation distribution only 6 pixels covering the entire watershed the spps are compared to gauge observations for all 87 segments of the watershed this comparison is based on the interpolated and aggregated awsas rather than a pixel to point comparison since the main focus of this study is to assess the impact of using different precipitation forcing datasets on simulating streamflow and water quality indicators in the watershed awsa satellite precipitation records aggregated to daily values are compared to daily aggregated gauge based records rmse pcc and σ are calculated and plotted in a taylor diagram to assess the performance of each spp with respect to the gauged based data fig 4 a for the 3 products correlation coefficients are concentrated between 0 26 and 0 60 and rmses range from 7 25 to 9 17 mm day the standard deviations of both tmpa and cmorph are 8 08 mm day which is most likely due to the fact that these products use very similar input retrieval data in their algorithms the standard deviation of persiann however is lower 6 90 mm day which may be due to the fact that persiann only uses one source infrared of observation data whereas tmpa and cmorph use both passive microwave and infrared observations the best overall performance is from the cmorph product followed closely by tmpa persiann shows overall relatively inferior performance with low correlation values against gauge based records while both tmpa and cmorph show good agreement with gauge based records both products overestimate precipitation magnitude rb 20 6 and 13 0 respectively the performance diagram fig 4b suggests that both tmpa and cmorph have lower false alarm rates 0 30 and 0 33 respectively compared to persiann which exhibits a false alarm rate of 0 46 however persiann presents a higher probability of detection at 0 71 compared to tmpa 0 57 and cmorph 0 68 respectively b is relatively low for both tmpa and cmorph at 0 51 and 0 39 mm d respectively while persiann has a slightly higher bias of 0 70 mm d tmpa and cmorph exhibit similar performances whereas simulation results derived from persiann are quite different and show larger error metrics this is most likely due to the fact that cmorph and tmpa merge observations from passive microwave and infrared sensors whereas persiann only uses infrared observations our results corroborate what was previously observed in the scientific literature as summarized by maggioni et al 2016 mean errors and detection capabilities of satellite precipitation estimation vary across precipitation products and different regions of the world a positive bias and season dependent magnitude are reported over the contiguous united states for both cmorph and persiann css tmpa 3b42 is reported as having the lowest bias when compared to other satellite datasets furthermore tmpa 3b42 exhibits a low probability of detection and low false alarm rate whereas cmorph has a higher probability of detection and also a larger number of false alarms persiann has both the highest false alarm rate and highest probability of detection compared to other products ebert et al 2007 yang and luo 2014 results of this study validate that persiann has the highest false alarm rate and probability of detection compared to tmpa and cmorph within this study region 4 2 evaluation of simulated streamflow and water quality indicators this section assesses the skills pcc rmse and b of the complex linked hspf model of the occoquan watershed in terms of both streamflow and water quality indicators tw tss do and bod specifically we evaluate the simulations forced with the 3 different spps tmpa cmorph and persiann with respect to the reference run forced with gauge based precipitation data aside from altering precipitation input no other inputs parameters or model boundary conditions are modified in this experiment each of the 7 catchments that comprise the watershed are fairly uniform in topography soil characteristics and land use conditions therefore it is expected that these conditions will not have a significant impact to the uncertainty analysis based on drainage area size between spps and gauge based simulations the goal of this analysis is to quantify uncertainties in simulated streamflow and selected water quality variables at the 6 evaluation points s26 s27 s34 s47 st25 s79 st60 and s86 st70 in the watershed these locations are chosen based on the representative basin scale ranging between 17 8 km2 and 498 8 km2 refer to table 2 fig 5 shows that for streamflow cmorph outperforms tmpa and persiann in terms of all skill metrics when compared to the gauge forced simulation cmorph presents the highest correlation at all evaluation points with pccs ranging from 0 47 to 0 75 nominally increasing as area increases with a few exceptions these exceptions are most likely due to differences in the hourly precipitation records of cmorph as well as tmpa and persiann in comparison to the rain gauge records in the upper broad run catchment draining to s86 st70 b and rmse associated with streamflow also increase as area increases with cmorph marginally outperforming tmpa persiann shows the worst overall skill consistently for all basin scales all 3 products overestimate daily streamflow in comparison to gauge simulated streamflow which is also observed in the precipitation analysis presented in section 4 1 the increase of b and rmse based on basin scale is expected since the streamflow both simulated and observed at these points increases and generates the potential for greater residuals in hspf most water quality variables are highly dependent on precipitation and its associated sediment and water flows i e sediment loading and overland runoff flow duda et al 2012 satellite based simulations of tss showed the lowest skill among the water quality indicators evaluated in this study again cmorph showed the best performance among the spps outperforming both tmpa and persiann pcc ranged from 0 20 to 0 66 0 29 to 0 75 and 0 04 to 0 40 for tmpa cmorph and persiann respectively the lowest pccs for all 3 products are at point s86 st70 which also corresponds to the lower skill detected in the simulated streamflow each spp overestimates tss with the exception of tmpa at point s47 st25 though both tmpa and cmorph with a b of 2 4 to 5 8 m3 s and 0 46 to 4 9 m3 s respectively have a considerably lower b than persiann which ranges between 2 3 and 15 8 m3 s for tss the basin extent seems to play a factor showing generally decreasing pcc and increasing b and rmse trends as the drainage area increases hspf predicts sediment loading rates based on channel processes of deposition scour and transport that in turn determine both the total sediment load and outflow sediment concentrations in streamflow duda et al 2012 land use and soil type in the model are the major drivers for sediment load calculated as total sediment for simulation of in stream processes since land use is constant between the gauge based and satellite based simulations there is no uncertainty or error associated with that input parameter therefore precipitation and consequently streamflow is the major driver for tss concentration differences presented in this analysis simulated in stream water temperature tw is well captured by all 3 spp simulations with high correlations ranging from 0 97 to 1 0 low biases ranging from 0 21 to 0 24 c and low rmses ranging from 3 3 to 9 9 c while stream temperature is impacted by precipitation and thus streamflow it is most closely correlated to ambient air temperature and therefore shows the lowest variation and highest skills among all output variables evaluated in this study generally all 3 spps slightly underestimate tw with a b of 0 16 to 0 06 c for tmpa 0 17 to 0 05 c for cmorph and 0 21 to 0 03 c for persiann among all 6 evaluation points only s86 st70 overestimates tw consistently among all 3 products 0 00 0 05 and 0 24 c respectively for tmpa cmorph and persiann though cmorph also overestimates tw at s34 and persiann at s47 both do and bod show a large spatial variability among the 3 catchments having separate but interlinked hspf models pcc for do is relatively high ranging from 0 86 to 0 99 0 83 to 0 99 and 0 78 to 0 98 for tmpa cmorph and persiann respectively in the upper bull run and upper broad run catchments however a decreasing skill for tmpa 0 60 and 0 78 cmorph 0 62 and 0 75 and persiann 0 63 and 0 74 in the cedar run catchment at locations s47 st25 and s34 is detected both b and rmse show similar results of increased error with increasing drainage area in the cedar run catchment b for all 3 products ranged from 0 02 to 0 68 mg l 0 01 to 0 76 mg l and 0 02 to 1 16 mg l for tmpa cmorph and persiann respectively while rmse ranges from 0 71 to 2 57 mg l 0 69 to 2 60 mg l and 0 73 to 3 03 mg l for tmpa cmorph and persiann respectively in comparison to streamflow and tss the variability in the do metrics is notably smaller indicating that precipitation has moderate impacts on do compared to other water quality indicators evaluated in this analysis similar to do bod has a satisfactory pcc in the upper bull run catchment but low pcc in the cedar run and upper board run catchments especially when persiann is used as input precipitation the model performs well in terms of b and rmse in the upper bull run and upper board run catchments but has low skill in the cedar run catchment s47 st25 and s34 with the exception of tmpa which outperforms both cmorph and persiann in this catchment 4 3 temporal analysis of simulated streamflow and water quality indicators as shown in the previous section the positive bias in the spps is propagated into simulated streamflow but not in all the water quality indicators here we analyze the temporal variability and seasonality of these variables fig 6 shows time series of daily precipitation streamflow and water quality indicators tss tw do and bod at evaluation point s27 the smallest drainage area among all areas considered in this study for 1 year 2011 of the 5 year study cmorph and tmpa are able to decently capture the timing of the streamflow peaks but tend to underestimate some peaks while peaks in streamflow generally coincide with precipitation it is evident that precipitation during the summer months june through august does not directly translate into streamflow this may be due to a seasonal distribution within the model associated with an increased infiltration component in hspf precipitation runoff is divided into surface runoff and infiltration infiltration then comprises of interflow upper zone soil moisture storage and percolation to lower zone soil moisture and groundwater storage within the hspf model increasing infiltration will reduce immediate surface runoff including interflow and increase the groundwater component which is observed in fig 6 during summer months it is also evident from fig 6 that persiann overestimates precipitation in january and february which is then rendered into an overestimation of both low and peak streamflow during cool months another factor impacting the observed decrease in streamflow during summer months may be due to the fact that higher evapotranspiration rates are typically seen in warmer months from increased ambient air temperature which is sufficient to overcome the impact of increased humidity since drier soil tends to have increased infiltration rates compared to moister soil there is a direct relationship between streamflow and tss concentrations mg l with peaks well represented in both tmpa and cmorph simulations as with streamflow tss tends to be low throughout summer months aside from a few instances where intense precipitation is captured and translated into stream peak flow because persiann overestimates streamflow in winter months it in turn overestimates tss concentrations during these months since tss is a flow dependent variable highly interrelated with streamflow in stream temperature is naturally dependent on ambient air temperature conditions showing higher values in summer months and lower values in winter months aside from a few instances all 3 spps follow the same tw trends as the gauge based simulation as expected concentrations of do follow an inverse pattern with respect to tw lower during warmer seasons and higher during cooler seasons simulated do concentrations for all spps are fairly consistent with gauge based simulations similar to gauge based simulations a strong flux in concentrations of do is seen in warmer months which overlaps with streamflow low flow periods comparatively as shown in fig 6 it appears that persiann displays the greatest number of daily fluctuations of bod in comparison to tmpa and cmorph this fluctuation is especially true during january and february which is likely due to the overestimation of precipitation during these months when compared to other products conversely simulated bod concentrations mg l increase in warmer periods and drop during cooler periods following patterns associated with tw yet this indicator also appears to be influenced by tss concentrations during peak events 5 conclusions this work investigated for the first time the potential of using spps for water quality monitoring and predictions three 3 spps tmpa cmorph and persiann of different spatial resolutions are compared to gauge based records over a 5 year period january 2008 december 2012 across the occoquan watershed this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the errors associated with streamflow and 4 water quality indicators tw tss do and bod simulated by forcing a hydrological model the complexly linked hspf with the 3 spps these simulations are compared to a reference run forced with gauge based observations the major findings of this research are summarized as follows all 3 spps show moderate skill with respect to the daily gauge based dataset cmorph shows the best overall performance followed closely by tmpa persiann shows overall relatively inferior performance with low correlation with the gauge based records while both tmpa and cmorph have good agreement with reference dataset both products overestimate precipitation magnitude rb 20 6 and 13 0 respectively in terms of cumulative precipitation during the 5 year study period persiann shows the largest overestimation with respect to the gauges tmpa shows the overall lowest variability which can be attributed to its coarse spatial resolution and consequent low representativeness of the local precipitation distribution only 6 pixels covering the entire watershed both tmpa and cmorph present lower false alarm rates compared to persiann across the occoquan watershed however persiann presents a higher probability of detection compared to the other 2 products especially during winter months satellite based simulations of streamflow show that cmorph outperforms both tmpa and persiann when compared to the reference simulation forced with gauge observations cmorph has the highest skill for daily streamflow across all evaluation points with a pcc ranging from 0 47 to 0 75 nominally increasing as drainage area increases cmorph and tmpa are able to capture the timing of the streamflow peaks well but tend to underestimate some peaks while peaks in streamflow generally coincide with precipitation it is evident that precipitation during the summer months june through august do not directly translate to streamflow satellite based simulations of tss show the lowest skill among the water quality indicators evaluated in this study cmorph shows the best performance among the spps which generally all overestimate tss with a few exceptions the seasonal analysis confirms that peaks of tss are fairly well represented for both tmpa and cmorph simulations simulated in stream water temperature is well captured by all 3 spp simulations with high correlations low biases and low rmses while stream temperature is impacted by precipitation and thus streamflow it is most closely correlated to ambient air temperature and therefore presents the lowest variation and highest skills among all output variables evaluated in this study both do and bod show a large spatial variability among the 3 catchments in this study skills of all 3 spps are high for do in the upper bull run and upper broad run catchments however a decreasing skill for each product is detected in the cedar run catchment in comparison to streamflow and tss the variability in the do metrics is notably smaller indicating that precipitation has moderate impact on do than on other water quality indicators evaluated in this analysis simulated do concentrations for all 3 spps are fairly consistent with gauge based simulations similar to gauge based simulations a strong flux in concentrations is seen in warmer months which also overlaps with streamflow low flow periods the spps show satisfactory skills for bod in the upper bull run catchment but low pcc in the cedar run and upper board run catchments especially when persiann is used as input precipitation the model performs well in terms of b and rmse in the upper bull run and upper board run catchments but has low skill in the cedar run catchment simulated bod concentrations mg l increase in warmer periods and drop during cooler periods following patterns associated with tw yet this indicator also appears to be influenced by tss concentrations during peak events overall results indicate that the spatiotemporal variability of the spps along with the algorithms used by these products to estimate precipitation have a quantifiable impact not only on streamflow but also on water quality output from the hydrology model however it should be noted that there are limitations to this study foremost this analysis was conducted in a single location situated in the suburban washington d c area characterized by a temperate climate and mild topographic variation additionally this study only considered 1 hydrology water quality model in this analysis i e hspf while this model is well calibrated and has been validated to observation results a different model may respond differently to changes in streamflow and water quality constituents resulting from forcing precipitation inputs nevertheless this work represents a first attempt to utilize spps for water quality modeling which could be of critical importance in areas of the world where rain gauge networks or monitoring stations are either sparse or not available altogether future research should observe different regions and models and other precipitation products such as re analysis and blended products additionally an in depth analysis of the error propagation from the precipitation input to the water quality output could be performed to understand the performance from each sppp to gauge based data of the simulated water quality output from the hspf hydrologic and water quality model multivariate statistical techniques could also be potentially applied to evaluate the seasonal and regional

concentrations keywords satellite based precipitation hydrologic modeling water quality simulations occoquan watershed tmpa persiann cmorph 1 introduction the performance of both lumped and distributed hydrologic models is significantly influenced by a number of factors that contribute to uncertainty e g observation errors boundary or initial conditions errors model or system errors scale discrepancies and unknown heterogeneity of parameters nevertheless precipitation is widely accepted as the most influential meteorological input in hydrological and water quality investigations reliable and consistent hydrologic predictions for water quantity and quality depend on the accurate measurement of precipitation the accuracy of precipitation data including its intensity duration spatial patterns and extent greatly influences the output of land surface and hydrologic models maggioni et al 2013 sorooshian et al 2011 zeng et al 2018 due to the lack of ground based monitoring systems and rain gauge networks large scale hydrologic models often rely on remotely sensed precipitation data from satellite sensors maggioni and massari 2018 precipitation whether from rain gauges or satellites is characterized by spatial and temporal variability as well as measurement errors although ground based instrument networks including rain gauges and radars represent the most direct surface rainfall measurements and often provide measurements with high temporal frequency there are many limitations with these systems not only are gauges restricted by point scale observations but they are also subject to false readings due to wind effects and evaporation in addition to measurement errors spatial interpolation of point based observations adds uncertainty to the resulting gridded precipitation datasets habib et al 2012a li et al 2008 maggioni et al 2016 mcmillan et al 2011 the spatial distribution and density of gauges play important roles in the adequacy of measurement a number of studies found that hydrologic model uncertainty is greatly impacted by sparse and irregular rain gauge networks and that uncertainty is reduced by increasing gauge density or by optimizing the distribution pattern bardossy and das 2008 girons lopez et al 2015 moulin et al 2009 maggioni et al 2017 zeng et al 2018 conversely ground based radar networks often provide continuous spatial coverage with high spatial and temporal resolution but they are also limited in accuracy by attenuation and extinction of signal surface backscatter brightband effects and uncertainty of the reflectivity rain rate relationship anagnostou et al 2010 habib et al 2012a porcacchia et al 2017 in addition to being limited in accuracy both ground based gauges and radars are often inadequate due to sparse availability especially outside of the united states satellite based precipitation products spps offer a viable alternative to ground based data through continuous monitoring of precipitation with greater spatial coverage over the past twenty years several studies have compared spps to in situ ground observations evaluating the use of spps as a resource in hydrologic modeling nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 noted that major sources of satellite based precipitation uncertainty arise from algorithmic miscalculations as well as instrumentation and sampling errors hydrological modeling using spps as forcing input particularly for simulations in large complex watersheds involving heterogeneous land use influencing soil moisture fluctuations and evaporation and significant terrain changes is not always adequate mei et al 2014a 2014b milewski et al 2015 seyyedi et al 2015 yang and luo 2014 for instance spps often show an elevation dependent bias with an underestimation of light precipitation at higher elevations maggioni et al 2016 mei et al 2016 villarini et al 2011 and xu et al 2014 found that the accuracy of hydrologic model simulations from spps is impacted not only by product resolution but also by storm severity and basin scale where the most accurate simulation of hydrologic models using spps is when a combination of moderate precipitation magnitudes finer product spatial resolutions and larger basin scales are associated with the model aside from the 3 principal measurement sources used to determine precipitation ground based gauge observations ground based radars and satellite remote sensing precipitation estimates can be obtained from atmospheric retrospective analysis models beck et al 2017 two of the most widely accepted atmospheric reanalysis datasets with long term coverage are i the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim a dataset that uses a 4 dimensional variational analysis a revised humidity analysis and variational bias correction for satellite data berrisford et al 2011 and ii nasa s modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra rienecker et al 2011 moreover there are products that combine a set of data from multiple methods models and observations and or instruments ground and satellite based for instance the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep is a fully global dataset from 1979 to 2017 at 3 h and 0 1 temporal and spatial scales respectively this dataset uses various gauge satellite and reanalysis data to provide precipitation estimates globally beck et al 2017 though re analysis datasets and blended products have the potential for providing good quality precipitation estimates beck et al 2017 duque gardeazábal et al 2018 ma et al 2018 these products were not considered in this study since the use of blended products would not allow for the differentiation of results among instruments and

and liu 2016 guo et al 2015 milewski et al 2015 verdin et al 2016 where current research falls short is the application of spp data in hydrologic models specifically aimed at simulating and forecasting water quality it is well understood that the intensity frequency and duration of precipitation have significant and direct impacts on runoff quantity and thus streamflow in turn precipitation is also a major driver of water quality a number of studies evaluating and quantifying predictions of stream water quality has demonstrated that spatial temporal variations of water quality is strongly dependent on the spatial and temporal scales of analysis barakat et al 2016 bengraı ne and marhaba 2003 chang 2008 jeznach et al 2017 kang et al 2010 mei et al 2014a 2014b wang et al 2011 wunderlin et al 2001 xu et al 2012 the relationship between water quality indicators and streamflow has been investigated using both parametric distribution dependent and non parametric distribution free methods azhar et al 2015 barakat et al 2016 bu et al 2010 chang 2008 fovet et al 2018 johnson et al 2012 jung et al 2016 kisi and ay 2014 nóbrega et al 2018 noori et al 2010 soler et al 2007 von freyberg et al 2017 all of these past studies demonstrated a direct impact in water quality as it relates to streamflow this study fills this gap in the literature by evaluating the performance of a hydrologic model forced with 3 spps in estimating water quality indicators in the occoquan watershed located in the northern virginia suburbs of washington d c united states the overarching purpose of this study is to determine the suitability of spps as a substitute for rain gauge precipitation data for simulating selected water quality indicators in this study the satellite products are compared to the data collected by a dense rain gauge network to determine their capability of 1 accurately characterizing the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation within the study region and 2 simulating water quantity and quality in the occoquan watershed section 2 describes the study area and the data sets adopted in this work section 3 introduces the methodology section 4 presents and discusses the results and section 5 highlights the main conclusions limitations and future directions 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area the focus of this study is the occoquan watershed a 1500 sq km area located in suburban washington d c in the northern portion of virginia fig 1 the watershed supplies water to 2 drinking water reservoirs lake manassas and the run of the river occoquan reservoir which are part of the drinking water supply to approximately 2 million residents the area is urbanized with a mix of suburban and urban land use and has mild topographic variation the occoquan watershed is part of the potomac river watershed ultimately discharging into the chesapeake bay the occoquan watershed has been a major focus of regulatory oversight for the past 40 years due to the unprecedented growth of the d c metropolitan area which resulted in a substantial increase in reclaimed domestic wastewater discharged to receiving waters in the watershed the closure of 11 marginally functioning water reclamation facilities wrfs and the construction of a single state of the art wrf that currently receives wastewater from prince william and fairfax counties and the cities of manassas and manassas park and discharges to 1 of the 2 tributaries bull run of the occoquan reservoir since 1973 the virginia tech occoquan watershed monitoring laboratory has monitored the watershed through data acquisition from a network of rain gauges meteorological stations and stream monitoring stations precipitation streamflow and several indicators of water quality have been measured continuously throughout the watershed using automated rain gauges and steam monitoring stations shown in fig 1 as blue dots and black squares respectively some of the rain gauges were available online in the 2000 01 period during the course of this study period 2008 2012 data were available from all stations presented in fig 1 the occoquan watershed monitoring laboratory has also been using the u s environmental protection agency s epa hydrologic simulation program fortran hspf model to simulate the hydrology nonpoint source runoff and water quality of the watershed described in detail in section 3 1 the model delineates 87 segments within the 7 catchments of the occoquan watershed as depicted in fig 2 the two reservoirs lake manassas and occoquan reservoirs are simulated using the u s army corps of engineers developed 2 dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model ce qual w2 but are not included in this study as they contribute very little to the water budget except for the rain that falls directly on the reservoir water surfaces the study period of 2008 2012 was chosen because the latest occoquan model addresses that period land use in the watershed is updated every 5 years the point at which the model is updated at the time of this study the 2008 2012 model based on the 2010 land use consisted of the latest available data 2 2 precipitation data ground based precipitation observations are obtained from a network of 15 tipping bucket rain gauges independently operated by the occoquan watershed monitoring laboratory located within or approximate to the occoquan watershed fig 1 the quality controlled gauges collect precipitation measurements in increments of 0 254 mm 0 01 in by recording the time of occurrence of successive tips logged hourly throughout the 5 year temporal span of this study 2008 2012 while ground based gauge observations are widely accepted as providing the most accurate method for precipitation measurement tipping buckets have been known to experience significant levels of error at low rainfall intensities habib et al 2012b and may be sensitive to ground vibrations wind effects and orifice opening size the density of gauges is also important when capturing variability of rainfall at fine temporal scales for extreme events or over complex terrain kidd et al 2017 additionally many gauges are typically not able to measure snowfall accurately and therefore may underestimate the corresponding liquid precipitation equivalent rasmussen et al 2012 alternatively spps are used to estimate precipitation quasi globally using a combination of remotely sensed microwave and infrared sensors here we adopt 3 of the most widely used spps 1 the national aeronautics and space administration nasa tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2010 2 the u s national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center s cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 and 3 the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann cloud classification system ccs hsu et al 2010 this study compares these 3 spps of varying spatial and temporal resolutions as forcing inputs of the hydrologic model to simulate water quality in the occoquan watershed the main characteristics of precipitation products used in this study are summarized in table 1 the trmm satellite mission was launched in 1997 and ceased in 2015 during that time trmm based products provided rainfall rates over the tropics and subtropics between 50 n 50 s huffman et al 2007 2010 specifically the tmpa algorithm combines both infrared and microwave sensor data to produce precipitation products with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 3 h in both real time and latent calibrated versions 3b42 rt and 3b42 v7 respectively this study uses the bias adjusted 3b42 v7 product which will be herein referred to as tmpa the cmorph algorithm produces global precipitation analyses at high resolutions using precipitation estimates derived exclusively from low orbiter satellite microwave observations transported via spatial propagation information obtained from geostationary satellite data joyce et al 2004 cmorph interpolates precipitation features between consecutive microwave sensor samples aboard multiple spacecrafts product data cover the 60 n 60 s area over a period of record from december 2002 to present day data used in this study are reprocessed and the bias corrected at a spatial resolution of 8 km exactly 8 km at equator 0 07 and a 30 minute temporal frequency bias correction is performed by matching cmorph raw data against the cpc daily gauge analysis over land xie et al 2017 persiann ccs first released in 2003 is an algorithm based on infrared brightness temperature that extracts cloud features from a number of geostationary satellites operated by several agencies covering an area between 60 n and 60 s hong et al 2007 hsu et al 1997 sorooshian et al 2000 precipitation estimates are assigned using infrared cloud images from segmented cloud features such as statistics textures and geometry at brightness temperature thresholds this information is used to obtain a relationship between brightness temperature and rainfall rates the persiann ccs algorithm uses gauge corrected radar hourly rainfall data to calibrate cloud top brightness temperature and rainfall relationships for the classified cloud groups in order to estimate precipitation hong et al 2007 persiann ccs hereafter called persiann is available at a spatial resolution of 0 04 and a 30 minute temporal frequency gauge observations are interpolated to each of the 87 segments in the watershed using the nearest neighbor method cumulative precipitation of the interpolated gauge data during the study period is shown in fig 2 for each segment of the occoquan watershed fourteen 14 of the 15 rain gauges across the study area provide hourly records however 1 gauge lrtn 150 located at the downstream extents of the watershed collects records at a daily scale the observations from this gauge are used as precipitation input to 6 segments s54 s60 s63 and s78 located in the occoquan catchment daily records collected at lrtn 150 are disaggregated to hourly values for input into the hspf model the percentage of missing records provided in table 1 does not include missing hourly records for gauge lrtn 150 the spps are processed by spatially averaging all pixels falling within the boundaries of each watershed segment since each satellite precipitation product is provided in a different temporal resolution all satellite data matched to the hourly temporal scale the spatially interpolated gauge data and spatially averaged satellite products at the hourly scale are used as input to the hspf model to simulate streamflow and water quality indicators discussed in section 3 3 since the occoquan hspf model output is set to output at a daily scale precipitation data is subsequently aggregated to daily values for comparison of the spps input data and output results to the gauge based data section 3 2 2 3 stream monitoring stations streamflow stream stage and water quality are measured at 8 stations across the watershed flow and stream stage are continuously measured by automated equipment including a sutron datalogger and flow meter flow and stage are continuously measured and recorded on an hourly basis provided there is no change when there is a change in flow such as during storm events flow and stage are recorded every 15 min until streamflow and stage are normalized xu et al 2007 water quality samples for baseflow conditions are typically obtained once each week and storm samples are composited in the field using an automated sampler paced to sample equal aliquots for equal volume of flow that passes the sampling point then adding these to a compositing bottle water quality parameters including stream temperature tw concentrations of total suspended solids tss orthophosphate phosphorus op ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n dissolved oxygen do biochemical oxygen demand bod and total organic carbon toc are obtained for all samples observed information at the 8 stations is used to calibrate and validate the hydrologic and water quality model analyzing the occoquan watershed while data from 8 stations are used for model calibration and validation this study analyzes results from 3 monitoring stations st25 st60 and st70 specifically for streamflow tw tss do and bod which is discussed in detail in section 3 and 4 3 methodology the first step in this study is to compare each spp tmpa cmorph and persiann to the dense rain gauge network in the occoquan watershed in order to identify differences among the satellite products in the region then the hydrologic model is forced with each satellite product and the traditional rain gauge dataset at the hourly scale to simulate streamflow and water quality indicators in the watershed during the 5 year study period 2008 2012 model outputs are evaluated by comparing the results of daily simulated streamflow and selected water quality indicators from the 3 spp simulations to that of the reference model simulation forced with rain gauge based records 3 1 hydrological model the hspf conceptional lumped hydrological model developed by the occoquan watershed monitoring laboratory is designed to simulate various hydrological processes and associated water quality components in the occoquan watershed xu et al 2007 the model is updated every 5 years with current land use information classified into 14 land use categories based on impervious coverage and soil properties obtained from the northern virginia regional commission and is modeled in 5 year increments with in situ meteorological data air temperature cloud cover dew point temperature wind speed solar radiation potential evapotranspiration and precipitation air temperature cloud cover dew point temperature wind speed and solar radiation are all directly measured at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa weather station located at the washington dulles international airport dulles station approximately 27 km from the centroid of the occoquan watershed hourly readings of the aforementioned data from this station are applied to the model each hour as 1 uniform input to the entire watershed for those parameters since a direct measurement of potential evapotranspiration is not available from the dulles meteorological station used in this study potential evapotranspiration was calculated from the modiﬁed penman pan empirical method using air temperature dew point temperature wind movement and solar radiation obtained from the dulles station the temporal and spatial resolution of the retrieved land use data and all meteorological data i e air temperature cloud cover dew point temperature wind speed solar radiation and potential evapotranspiration aside from precipitation are consistently maintained and are not altered in any way during model simulations precipitation input is retrieved on an hourly basis from the 15 rain gauges within or in proximity to the watershed boundaries although neither an evaluation of the parameter input including land use and meteorological data nor a validation of the long established hspf hydrology model is within the scope of this study a brief description of the model s setup is described herein for additional details of model setup and execution we refer the reader to xu 2005 2007 and maldonado and moglen 2012 precipitation input is retrieved and inputted for each segment from the nearest neighbor rain gauge while all other meteorological data used in the model air temperature cloud cover dew point temperature solar radiation wind speed and wind direction are applied consistently throughout all 87 segments during certain periods of this 5 year study rain gauge observations are not recorded at various gauges missing precipitation records are interpolated since the hspf model requires continuous precipitation input for missing gauge records a standardized procedure is employed to estimate the discrete hourly values based on the spatial and temporal infilling strategy outlined by xu 2005 a similar infilling strategy is applied to missing precipitation data for tmpa cmorph and persiann during the study period using similar procedures outlined in multiple meteorological infilling studies hema and kant 2017 kim and ryu 2015 lee and kang 2015 and recommended by the u s epa 2000 meteorological data gaps are classified into categories based on gap duration for gaps up to 4 h temporal linear interpolation is applied for gaps greater than 4 h a combination of temporal linear interpolation and nearest neighbor pixel value is utilized precipitation input from each satellite product is then aggregated for each segment the watershed is comprised of 87 segments within distinct 7 catchments table 2 fig 2 each of the 7 catchments has a separate hspf model that is linked to create the overall watershed model the hspf model used in this analysis is deterministically calibrated and validated between simulated gauge based results and observed data over a 5 year period from january 1 2008 to december 31 2012 while hspf is able to produce output results as low as 15 minute increments which is the increment flow data are recorded and used for model input the occoquan hspf model is set to output results using a daily scale the daily scale is used to minimize the impacts of timing errors often found using lower increment outputs since hspf is prone to timing errors such as under or over predicting when an event starts and or stops each catchment hspf model is calibrated and validated prior to linking into the adjoining downstream model eight 8 stream monitoring stations throughout the watershed that collect streamflow stream stage and water quality constituents are used to calibrate the hspf model the model is first calibrated on both daily and monthly streamflow by comparing simulated flows from gauge records with observed data from stream monitoring stations during the first 2 years of the study period 2008 2009 results of the simulated model are then validated for an independent period 2010 2012 the model provides output for streamflow and water quality indicators including tw tss op tp nh4 n no3 n tn do bod and toc next the model is calibrated for tss tw op nh4 n and no3 n based on monthly and yearly loads to that of observed in stream data the hspf model is used to simulate streamflow and select water quality indicators at 6 designated evaluation points in the occoquan watershed these 6 locations are located within 3 distinct catchments cedar run upper broad run and upper bull run which capture runoff from a number of segments of varying size land use and topography table 2 fig 2 of the 6 model evaluation points 3 points s47 st25 s79 st60 and s86 st70 are equipped with stream monitoring stations which are also used in the original model calibration validation process the streamflow error analysis performed with respect to in stream observations reveal a well calibrated model at each of the 3 observation locations s47 st25 s79 st60 and s86 st70 error analyses of tw and do at a daily scale and tss at a monthly scale also show good

dimensionless whereas rmse is provided in respective units m3 s c mg l and rb is a percentage the model is next forced with precipitation data from each of the 3 spps to simulate streamflow and water quality at the 6 evaluation points 3 2 precipitation analysis as previously discussed hourly precipitation data were areal weighted and segment aggregated awsa for input into the model the hourly data were then aggregated to the daily scale for comparison with the ground observations precipitation was evaluated at the daily scale for consistency with the daily model output results several metrics are considered to quantify the performance of sppss rmse pearson correlation coefficient pcc standard deviation σ and bias b the rmse a measure of the differences between spp and observed gauge values combines the magnitude of errors in the estimation over time into a single measure of error the pcc is the average product of the deviation of variables from their respective means divided by the standard deviation of those variables standard deviation is used to quantify the amount of variation in the data set b measures the average tendency of satellite data to either overestimate or underestimate the gauge measurements whereas rb evaluates the relative difference in percentage between the estimated and the observed data optimum values of pcc σ and b are 1 0 and 0 respectively the definitions of the statistical metrics are provided in eqs 3 6 4 p c c i 1 n p o i p o p s i p s i 1 n p o i p o 2 i 1 n p s i p s 2 5 σ 1 n i 1 n p i p 6 b i 1 n p s i p o i n where n is the total number of events p o i is the ith observed rain gauge precipitation or observed streamflow and p s i is the ith simulated satellite precipitation or simulated streamflow p is the corresponding mean value pcc is dimensionless whereas σ and b are in mm d the rmse pcc and σ are summarized using a taylor diagram taylor 2001 which shows the overall skill associated with each spp in relation to the gauge based dataset section 4 1 probability of detection pod false alarm rate far and critical success index csi are used to assess the detection capability of each spp based on the awsa daily precipitation pod corresponds to the ratio of correct detection of the spp to the overall occurrence of precipitation observed conversely far indicates the number of cases when precipitation is estimated by spp however no precipitation is observed csi is a measure of events successfully detected by the spp to the total number of events observed that are either made or needed schaefer 1990 these metrics all range from 0 to 1 with the accuracy of the spp increasing as the far approaches 0 and the pod and csi approach 1 optimum values of pod far and csi are 1 0 and 1 respectively for this study the precipitation threshold is set to 0 254 mm day which is the threshold of the rain gauges pod far and csi are calculated using eqs 7 9 where hits misses and false alarms represent the total number of spp observations that either correctly detect an event miss an event or incorrectly detect an event respectively in relation to the gauge observation 7 p o d h i t s h i t s m i s s e s 8 f

presents the pod success ratio 1 far csi and b associated with each spp in relation to gauge based data for the 5 year study period section 4 1 3 3 streamflow and water quality analysis it is well understood that there is a direct relationship between precipitation and streamflow research has also shown a significant and quantifiable correlation between atmospheric conditions and water quality indicator response chang et al 2015 gelca et al 2016 jeznach et al 2017 johnson et al 2012 murdoch et al 2000 soler et al 2007 thorne and fenner 2011 water quality analysis for this study focuses on tw tss do and bod by definition tss are particles that are larger than 2 μm whereas anything smaller than 2 μm is typically considered a dissolved solid since tss is a specific measurement of all suspended solids organic and inorganic by mass it is a good representation of the total sedimentation rate of a watershed tss is both a visible and quantifiable indicator of overall water quality in a waterbody and therefore is selected for further evaluation in this study do is the measurement of gaseous oxygen dissolved in an aqueous solution which results from diffusion by aeration and as a product of photosynthesis do is an important indicator determining the health and quality of a waterbody for its ability to support life similarly bod is the amount of do needed by aerobic organisms to break down organic matter three 3 statistical metrics pcc rmse and b are used to evaluate the performance of the model in simulating streamflow and the 4 water quality indicators the model simulation forced with rain gauge observations is used as a benchmark to assess the performance of the simulations forced with the 3 different spps uncertainties are quantified for simulated streamflow and selected water quality indicators at 6 evaluation points s26 s27 s34 s47 st25 s79 st60 and s86 st70 of varying drainage area within the watershed discussed in detail in section 4 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation of satellite based precipitation products fig 3 presents the spatial distribution of cumulative precipitation over the 5 year study period for each spp at their original pixel resolutions left panels and their corresponding areal weighted value for each segment in the watershed foremost fig 3 highlights the degree of detail for which each precipitation product is available i e a total of 6 48 and 133 precipitation values for tmpa cmorph and persiann respectively in terms of cumulative precipitation within the watershed during the 5 year study period the gauges recorded 4909 mm on average whereas tmpa cmorph and persiann resulted in 5298 mm 5267 mm and 5834 mm respectively therefore persiann showing the largest overestimation with respect to the reference dataset tmpa shows the overall lowest variability of precipitation values which can be attributed to its coarse spatial resolution and consequent low representativeness of the local precipitation distribution only 6 pixels covering the entire watershed the spps are compared to gauge observations for all 87 segments of the watershed this comparison is based on the interpolated and aggregated awsas rather than a pixel to point comparison since the main focus of this study is to assess the impact of using different precipitation forcing datasets on simulating streamflow and water quality indicators in the watershed awsa satellite precipitation records aggregated to daily values are compared to daily aggregated gauge based records rmse pcc and σ are calculated and plotted in a taylor diagram to assess the performance of each spp with respect to the gauged based data fig 4 a for the 3 products correlation coefficients are concentrated between 0 26 and 0 60 and rmses range from 7 25 to 9 17 mm day the standard deviations of both tmpa and cmorph are 8 08 mm day which is most likely due to the fact that these products use very similar input retrieval data in their algorithms the standard deviation of persiann however is lower 6 90 mm day which may be due to the fact that persiann only uses one source infrared of observation data whereas tmpa and cmorph use both passive microwave and infrared observations the best overall performance is from the cmorph product followed closely by tmpa persiann shows overall relatively inferior performance with low correlation values against gauge based records while both tmpa and cmorph show good agreement with gauge based records both products overestimate precipitation magnitude rb 20 6 and 13 0 respectively the performance diagram fig 4b suggests that both tmpa and cmorph have lower false alarm rates 0 30 and 0 33 respectively compared to persiann which exhibits a false alarm rate of 0 46 however persiann presents a higher probability of detection at 0 71 compared to tmpa 0 57 and cmorph 0 68 respectively b is relatively low for both tmpa and cmorph at 0 51 and 0 39 mm d respectively while persiann has a slightly higher bias of 0 70 mm d tmpa and cmorph exhibit similar performances whereas simulation results derived from persiann are quite different and show larger error metrics this is most likely due to the fact that cmorph and tmpa merge observations from passive microwave and infrared sensors whereas persiann only uses infrared observations our results corroborate what was previously observed in the scientific literature as summarized by maggioni et al 2016 mean errors and detection capabilities of satellite precipitation estimation vary across precipitation products and different regions of the world a positive bias and season dependent magnitude are reported over the contiguous united states for both cmorph and persiann css tmpa 3b42 is reported as having the lowest bias when compared to other satellite datasets furthermore tmpa 3b42 exhibits a low probability of detection and low false alarm rate whereas cmorph has a higher probability of detection and also a larger number of false alarms persiann has both the highest false alarm rate and highest probability of detection compared to other products ebert et al 2007 yang and luo 2014 results of this study validate that persiann has the highest false alarm rate and probability of detection compared to tmpa and cmorph within this study region 4 2 evaluation of simulated streamflow and water quality indicators this section assesses the skills pcc rmse and b of the complex linked hspf model of the occoquan watershed in terms of both streamflow and water quality indicators tw tss do and bod specifically we evaluate the simulations forced with the 3 different spps tmpa cmorph and persiann with respect to the reference run forced with gauge based precipitation data aside from altering precipitation input no other inputs parameters or model boundary conditions are modified in this experiment each of the 7 catchments that comprise the watershed are fairly uniform in topography soil characteristics and land use conditions therefore it is expected that these conditions will not have a significant impact to the uncertainty analysis based on drainage area size between spps and gauge based simulations the goal of this analysis is to quantify uncertainties in simulated streamflow and selected water quality variables at the 6 evaluation points s26 s27 s34 s47 st25 s79 st60 and s86 st70 in the watershed these locations are chosen based on the representative basin scale ranging between 17 8 km2 and 498 8 km2 refer to table 2 fig 5 shows that for streamflow cmorph outperforms tmpa and persiann in terms of all skill metrics when compared to the gauge forced simulation cmorph presents the highest correlation at all evaluation points with pccs ranging from 0 47 to 0 75 nominally increasing as area increases with a few exceptions these exceptions are most likely due to differences in the hourly precipitation records of cmorph as well as tmpa and persiann in comparison to the rain gauge records in the upper broad run catchment draining to s86 st70 b and rmse associated with streamflow also increase as area increases with cmorph marginally outperforming tmpa persiann shows the worst overall skill consistently for all basin scales all 3 products overestimate daily streamflow in comparison to gauge simulated streamflow which is also observed in the precipitation analysis presented in section 4 1 the increase of b and rmse based on basin scale is expected since the streamflow both simulated and observed at these points increases and generates the potential for greater residuals in hspf most water quality variables are highly dependent on precipitation and its associated sediment and water flows i e sediment loading and overland runoff flow duda et al 2012 satellite based simulations of tss showed the lowest skill among the water quality indicators evaluated in this study again cmorph showed the best performance among the spps outperforming both tmpa and persiann pcc ranged from 0 20 to 0 66 0 29 to 0 75 and 0 04 to 0 40 for tmpa cmorph and persiann respectively the lowest pccs for all 3 products are at point s86 st70 which also corresponds to the lower skill detected in the simulated streamflow each spp overestimates tss with the exception of tmpa at point s47 st25 though both tmpa and cmorph with a b of 2 4 to 5 8 m3 s and 0 46 to 4 9 m3 s respectively have a considerably lower b than persiann which ranges between 2 3 and 15 8 m3 s for tss the basin extent seems to play a factor showing generally decreasing pcc and increasing b and rmse trends as the drainage area increases hspf predicts sediment loading rates based on channel processes of deposition scour and transport that in turn determine both the total sediment load and outflow sediment concentrations in streamflow duda et al 2012 land use and soil type in the model are the major drivers for sediment load calculated as total sediment for simulation of in stream processes since land use is constant between the gauge based and satellite based simulations there is no uncertainty or error associated with that input parameter therefore precipitation and consequently streamflow is the major driver for tss concentration differences presented in this analysis simulated in stream water temperature tw is well captured by all 3 spp simulations with high correlations ranging from 0 97 to 1 0 low biases ranging from 0 21 to 0 24 c and low rmses ranging from 3 3 to 9 9 c while stream temperature is impacted by precipitation and thus streamflow it is most closely correlated to ambient air temperature and therefore shows the lowest variation and highest skills among all output variables evaluated in this study generally all 3 spps slightly underestimate tw with a b of 0 16 to 0 06 c for tmpa 0 17 to 0 05 c for cmorph and 0 21 to 0 03 c for persiann among all 6 evaluation points only s86 st70 overestimates tw consistently among all 3 products 0 00 0 05 and 0 24 c respectively for tmpa cmorph and persiann though cmorph also overestimates tw at s34 and persiann at s47 both do and bod show a large spatial variability among the 3 catchments having separate but interlinked hspf models pcc for do is relatively high ranging from 0 86 to 0 99 0 83 to 0 99 and 0 78 to 0 98 for tmpa cmorph and persiann respectively in the upper bull run and upper broad run catchments however a decreasing skill for tmpa 0 60 and 0 78 cmorph 0 62 and 0 75 and persiann 0 63 and 0 74 in the cedar run catchment at locations s47 st25 and s34 is detected both b and rmse show similar results of increased error with increasing drainage area in the cedar run catchment b for all 3 products ranged from 0 02 to 0 68 mg l 0 01 to 0 76 mg l and 0 02 to 1 16 mg l for tmpa cmorph and persiann respectively while rmse ranges from 0 71 to 2 57 mg l 0 69 to 2 60 mg l and 0 73 to 3 03 mg l for tmpa cmorph and persiann respectively in comparison to streamflow and tss the variability in the do metrics is notably smaller indicating that precipitation has moderate impacts on do compared to other water quality indicators evaluated in this analysis similar to do bod has a satisfactory pcc in the upper bull run catchment but low pcc in the cedar run and upper board run catchments especially when persiann is used as input precipitation the model performs well in terms of b and rmse in the upper bull run and upper board run catchments but has low skill in the cedar run catchment s47 st25 and s34 with the exception of tmpa which outperforms both cmorph and persiann in this catchment 4 3 temporal analysis of simulated streamflow and water quality indicators as shown in the previous section the positive bias in the spps is propagated into simulated streamflow but not in all the water quality indicators here we analyze the temporal variability and seasonality of these variables fig 6 shows time series of daily precipitation streamflow and water quality indicators tss tw do and bod at evaluation point s27 the smallest drainage area among all areas considered in this study for 1 year 2011 of the 5 year study cmorph and tmpa are able to decently capture the timing of the streamflow peaks but tend to underestimate some peaks while peaks in streamflow generally coincide with precipitation it is evident that precipitation during the summer months june through august does not directly translate into streamflow this may be due to a seasonal distribution within the model associated with an increased infiltration component in hspf precipitation runoff is divided into surface runoff and infiltration infiltration then comprises of interflow upper zone soil moisture storage and percolation to lower zone soil moisture and groundwater storage within the hspf model increasing infiltration will reduce immediate surface runoff including interflow and increase the groundwater component which is observed in fig 6 during summer months it is also evident from fig 6 that persiann overestimates precipitation in january and february which is then rendered into an overestimation of both low and peak streamflow during cool months another factor impacting the observed decrease in streamflow during summer months may be due to the fact that higher evapotranspiration rates are typically seen in warmer months from increased ambient air temperature which is sufficient to overcome the impact of increased humidity since drier soil tends to have increased infiltration rates compared to moister soil there is a direct relationship between streamflow and tss concentrations mg l with peaks well represented in both tmpa and cmorph simulations as with streamflow tss tends to be low throughout summer months aside from a few instances where intense precipitation is captured and translated into stream peak flow because persiann overestimates streamflow in winter months it in turn overestimates tss concentrations during these months since tss is a flow dependent variable highly interrelated with streamflow in stream temperature is naturally dependent on ambient air temperature conditions showing higher values in summer months and lower values in winter months aside from a few instances all 3 spps follow the same tw trends as the gauge based simulation as expected concentrations of do follow an inverse pattern with respect to tw lower during warmer seasons and higher during cooler seasons simulated do concentrations for all spps are fairly consistent with gauge based simulations similar to gauge based simulations a strong flux in concentrations of do is seen in warmer months which overlaps with streamflow low flow periods comparatively as shown in fig 6 it appears that persiann displays the greatest number of daily fluctuations of bod in comparison to tmpa and cmorph this fluctuation is especially true during january and february which is likely due to the overestimation of precipitation during these months when compared to other products conversely simulated bod concentrations mg l increase in warmer periods and drop during cooler periods following patterns associated with tw yet this indicator also appears to be influenced by tss concentrations during peak events 5 conclusions this work investigated for the first time the potential of using spps for water quality monitoring and predictions three 3 spps tmpa cmorph and persiann of different spatial resolutions are compared to gauge based records over a 5 year period january 2008 december 2012 across the occoquan watershed this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the errors associated with streamflow and 4 water quality indicators tw tss do and bod simulated by forcing a hydrological model the complexly linked hspf with the 3 spps these simulations are compared to a reference run forced with gauge based observations the major findings of this research are summarized as follows all 3 spps show moderate skill with respect to the daily gauge based dataset cmorph shows the best overall performance followed closely by tmpa persiann shows overall relatively inferior performance with low correlation with the gauge based records while both tmpa and cmorph have good agreement with reference dataset both products overestimate precipitation magnitude rb 20 6 and 13 0 respectively in terms of cumulative precipitation during the 5 year study period persiann shows the largest overestimation with respect to the gauges tmpa shows the overall lowest variability which can be attributed to its coarse spatial resolution and consequent low representativeness of the local precipitation distribution only 6 pixels covering the entire watershed both tmpa and cmorph present lower false alarm rates compared to persiann across the occoquan watershed however persiann presents a higher probability of detection compared to the other 2 products especially during winter months satellite based simulations of streamflow show that cmorph outperforms both tmpa and persiann when compared to the reference simulation forced with gauge observations cmorph has the highest skill for daily streamflow across all evaluation points with a pcc ranging from 0 47 to 0 75 nominally increasing as drainage area increases cmorph and tmpa are able to capture the timing of the streamflow peaks well but tend to underestimate some peaks while peaks in streamflow generally coincide with precipitation it is evident that precipitation during the summer months june through august do not directly translate to streamflow satellite based simulations of tss show the lowest skill among the water quality indicators evaluated in this study cmorph shows the best performance among the spps which generally all overestimate tss with a few exceptions the seasonal analysis confirms that peaks of tss are fairly well represented for both tmpa and cmorph simulations simulated in stream water temperature is well captured by all 3 spp simulations with high correlations low biases and low rmses while stream temperature is impacted by precipitation and thus streamflow it is most closely correlated to ambient air temperature and therefore presents the lowest variation and highest skills among all output variables evaluated in this study both do and bod show a large spatial variability among the 3 catchments in this study skills of all 3 spps are high for do in the upper bull run and upper broad run catchments however a decreasing skill for each product is detected in the cedar run catchment in comparison to streamflow and tss the variability in the do metrics is notably smaller indicating that precipitation has moderate impact on do than on other water quality indicators evaluated in this analysis simulated do concentrations for all 3 spps are fairly consistent with gauge based simulations similar to gauge based simulations a strong flux in concentrations is seen in warmer months which also overlaps with streamflow low flow periods the spps show satisfactory skills for bod in the upper bull run catchment but low pcc in the cedar run and upper board run catchments especially when persiann is used as input precipitation the model performs well in terms of b and rmse in the upper bull run and upper board run catchments but has low skill in the cedar run catchment simulated bod concentrations mg l increase in warmer periods and drop during cooler periods following patterns associated with tw yet this indicator also appears to be influenced by tss concentrations during peak events overall results indicate that the spatiotemporal variability of the spps along with the algorithms used by these products to estimate precipitation have a quantifiable impact not only on streamflow but also on water quality output from the hydrology model however it should be noted that there are limitations to this study foremost this analysis was conducted in a single location situated in the suburban washington d c area characterized by a temperate climate and mild topographic variation additionally this study only considered 1 hydrology water quality model in this analysis i e hspf while this model is well calibrated and has been validated to observation results a different model may respond differently to changes in streamflow and water quality constituents resulting from forcing precipitation inputs nevertheless this work represents a first attempt to utilize spps for water quality modeling which could be of critical importance in areas of the world where rain gauge networks or monitoring stations are either sparse or not available altogether future research should observe different regions and models and other precipitation products such as re analysis and blended products additionally an in depth analysis of the error propagation from the precipitation input to the water quality output could be performed to understand the performance from each sppp to gauge based data of the simulated water quality output from the hspf hydrologic and water quality model multivariate statistical techniques could also be potentially applied to evaluate the seasonal and regional characteristics of watershed hydrology and additional water quality indicators by identifying spatial temporal variations and trends in water quality at the watershed scale funding this research did
