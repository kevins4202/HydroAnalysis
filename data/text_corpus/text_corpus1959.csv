9795,a deep understanding of root soil microbe interactions in response to drip irrigation can help optimize drip irrigation techniques and improve crop yield however relevant knowledge remains limited in this study field experiments were conducted for two consecutive years to investigate the effects of surface drip irrigation di subsurface drip irrigation sdi and alternate drip irrigation adi on root soil microbe interactions and tomato yield the results showed that the soil moisture distribution uniformity in the root zone 0 60 cm depth was reduced in the order sdi di adi in the sdi treatment the tomato root lengths were 4 83 and 3 94 fold higher than those in the di and adi treatments respectively and the relative abundances of patescibacteria in the bacterial community and blastocladiomycota in the fungal community were significantly elevated in the adi treatment the root length was 1 23 fold higher than that in the di treatment and the relative abundance of patescibacteria also increased significantly compared with that in the di treatment these changes led to distinct root soil microbe interactions the most intensive positive root soil microbe interactions occurred in the sdi treatment followed by the adi and di treatments the differences in the root soil microbe interactions regulated tomato yield the tomato yield in the sdi treatment was increased by 19 77 and 7 77 compared with that in the di and adi treatments respectively in the adi treatment the tomato yield was 24 09 higher than that in the di treatment therefore the different drip irrigation methods can regulate tomato yield by affecting root soil microbe interactions the results provide a reference for the optimization of the drip irrigation mode to regulate root soil microbe interactions and increase tomato yield keywords drip irrigation mode soil bacterial community soil fungal community root soil microbe interactions tomato yield 1 introduction mulched drip irrigation is an efficient water saving irrigation technique widely used in agricultural production in the yellow river basin china qin et al 2016 this practice can be classified according to the arrangement of drip irrigation pipes as follows surface drip irrigation di in which the drip irrigation pipe is located on the ground surface with water infiltrating downward from the ground surface to the crop root system at a low flow rate and high frequency martínez and reca 2014 subsurface drip irrigation sdi which delivers water directly to the crop root zone through the buried drip irrigation pipe liu et al 2020a and alternate drip irrigation adi in which the drip irrigation pipe is positioned on both sides of the crop root system to keep the root zone soil moist on one side and dry on the other side artificially creating alternation of wet and dry soil on the two sides of the root zone jovanovic and stikic 2018 both sdi and adi are superior to di in terms of saving water and increasing yield because the more direct water supply by sdi facilitates root growth iqbal et al 2020 kong et al 2012 while the wet dry alternation by adi induces abscisic acid signals further facilitating root growth a vigorous root system can enhance soil nutrient activity and supply more nutrients to plants thereby increasing crop growth wang et al 2019a the basic nutrients required for plant growth all come from the soil the distribution of soil moisture varies under different drip irrigation modes potentially affecting soil nutrient cycling soil root interactions and crop growth and yield shan et al 2019 however the specific mechanisms remain unclear this lack of knowledge limits our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the water saving and yield increasing advantages of sdi and adi over di from the perspective of soil microecology and restricts further enhancement of the water saving potential of drip irrigation by aboveground belowground coupled regulation microbes directly participate in the processes of soil nutrient cycling and plant nutrient acquisition microbial community composition and variation are the drivers of nutrient transfer and transformation in the soil plant system while they are also the key factors affecting root soil interactions trivedi et al 2020 soil moisture as a factor limiting microbial community diversity and crop growth regulates the intensity of root soil interactions and the growth and yield of crops by affecting soil aeration and nutrient availability prudent et al 2020 differences in moisture distribution caused by different drip irrigation modes further affect soil structure aeration and nutrient heterogeneity moussa et al 2020 all these changes alter the composition and metabolic function of soil microbial communities and affect the metabolic activity of essential nutrients carbon nitrogen and phosphorus for plant growth which in turn changes the growth status of crop roots the intensity of root soil interactions nutrient transfer and rates of exchange between roots and plants centenaro et al 2018 ultimately regulating plant growth and yield balasubramanian et al 2020 we believe that this is the fundamental reason sdi and adi are more advantageous than di in terms of saving water and increasing yield to reveal the specific internal mechanisms responsible for these advantages it is crucial to understand the responses of major soil microbes bacteria and fungi to different drip irrigation modes zhu et al 2019 found that aerated drip irrigation can remarkably increase the abundance of cultivable soil microbes wang et al 2017 2018 found that sdi and adi can optimize soil bacterial community composition and increase the relative abundances of soil nitrogen and phosphorus metabolizing bacteria however similar associated studies are still lacking while most of the existing studies only investigated the effect of a single drip irrigation mode on a specific class of soil microbes there remains a dearth of studies on soil microbial community variation and root soil interactions in response to different drip irrigation modes jovanovic and stikic 2018 therefore it is imperative to deepen our understanding of these aspects of drip irrigation a further assumption is that different drip irrigation modes shape crop root morphologies and root microbial community compositions through changes in the soil moisture environment thereby regulating root soil microbe interactions and affecting crop yield however the key factors involved in root soil microbe interactions and their influence on crop yield under different drip irrigation modes have not been well addressed therefore the present study mainly focused on the effects of di sdi and adi on soil environmental factors in the crop root zone the associated bacterial and fungal community compositions and root growth we analyzed the response of crop growth and yield to root soil microbe interactions and explored the soil microecological mechanisms underpinning the effects of different drip irrigation modes on crop growth and yield the results of this study could provide new evidence and serve as a reference for the optimization of drip irrigation techniques 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design greenhouse cultivation experiments were conducted with tomato at the experimental base of northwest a f university 108 09 e 34 15 n during september 2018 april 2019 and september 2019 april 2020 the experimental site is within a warm temperate semihumid zone with a mean annual temperature of 13 c mean annual precipitation of 600 mm and mean annual daylight duration of 2163 h the experimental soil contained 17 g kg 1 organic matter 1 16 g kg 1 total nitrogen and 0 42 g kg 1 total phosphorus the cultivation plots were established with double ridges which had an inverted trapezoid shape in cross section length 7 m ridge width 0 6 m ditch width 0 4 m and height 0 3 m fig 1 tomato plants were grown in double rows with 20 plants per row three treatments were included di sdi and adi there were three replicates per treatment for a total of 9 plots all plots were covered with plastic mulch in each plot of the di and sdi treatments a drip irrigation pipe was buried at depths of 0 and 20 cm respectively in the middle of the spacing between adjacent tomato rows in each plot of the adi treatment drip irrigation pipes were positioned 30 cm from the base of the tomato plants on both sides the drip irrigation pipe on only one side was turned on for each irrigation and the pipes on the two sides were alternately used for irrigation integrating the planting experience of local farmers and previous research the irrigation lower limits of the di plot sdi plot and each side of the adi plot were set to 70 of the field water holding capacity soil moisture was measured by a tdr 200 soil moisture meter for this measurement three probe tubes were installed at a depth of 100 cm in the middle of each plot of sdi and di and in the midline position between the drip irrigation pipe of each end of the adi plot and the tomato plant in addition the soil moisture was determined by soil coring and the oven drying method bittelli et al 2008 when the soil moisture content reached the lower limit water was supplied according to the method of wang et al 2017 during the entire tomato season from september 2018 to april 2019 di sdi and adi were irrigated 13 11 and 14 times respectively while in the tomato growing season from october 2019 to march 2020 di sdi and adi were irrigated 11 times 9 and 12 times respectively in the tomato seedling period irrigation was performed every 8 10 days and during the flowering and fruit set period and fruit maturation period irrigation was performed every 5 7 days the experimental site is a vegetable planting field with relatively sufficient soil nutrients nevertheless before tomato planting bioorganic fertilizer with an organic matter content of 35 was applied as a base fertilizer at a rate of 300 kg ha 1 and no topdressing was applied during the tomato growing period therefore the fertilization conditions of all treatments were uniform 2 2 measurement indices 2 2 1 soil moisture ph and porosity three 100 cm probes were arranged in each plot the 0 60 cm soil moisture content was measured at equal intervals of 10 cm using a fieldscout tdr 200 spectrum technologies aurora co usa and corrected by soil sampling and oven drying the experimental treatments were initiated 20 days after tomato planting soil moisture content was measured before and after each irrigation and between irrigations and the measurements continued until the harvest of tomato fruit during each measurement of soil moisture content three tomato plants per plot were selected a small soil auger with an inner diameter of 2 0 cm was used to collect 0 60 cm root zone soil samples at 10 cm intervals the soil ph was measured using a phb 4 acidity meter soil water 1 5 w v after the harvest of tomatoes three sampling points were set in each plot and a 100 cm3 cutting ring was used to collect 0 40 cm soil samples at 10 cm intervals soil porosity was measured following the method of wang et al 2018 2 2 2 tomato yield root systems and dry matter tomato fruit were harvested in each plot to estimate the tomato yield t hm 2 of each treatment in each plot three tomato plants with uniform growth were selected and their aboveground parts were cut off to excavate the roots a rectangular block length 40 cm width 30 cm depth 50 cm was dug by taking the midline of the spacing between two adjacent plants as a boundary the whole root system was collected and large blocks of soil were removed then the soil adhering to the roots was shaken off and placed into sterile tubes for soil microbial community composition analysis root samples were analyzed using winrhizo pro2004b version 5 0 regent instrument inc quebec qc canada to measure root length root surface area and the number of root forks the root and plant samples were deactivated in an oven at 105 c for 30 min and dried at 75 c for 36 h after which the dry matter was weighed 2 2 3 soil bacterial and fungal community composition the soil samples used for microbial community composition analysis were rhizospheric soil samples collected as described in

root lengths d 2 mm were 6 11 and 5 49 fold higher than those in the di and adi treatments respectively in addition the root volumes of tomato plants and the numbers of root forks were significantly elevated by 34 91 and 101 56 in the sdi treatment compared with those in the di treatment the root length root volume and number of root forks in the adi treatment were 1 23 1 38 and 1 84 fold higher than those in the di treatment respectively table 1 3 2 soil bacterial community composition based on an overall evaluation of soil bacterial communities in the two consecutive experiments the shannon

whereas the simpson index of the adi treatment was significantly higher than that of the sdi treatment the ace and chao indices of the sdi treatment were significantly higher than those of the di and adi treatments fig 3 the bacterial community mainly comprised 19 bacterial taxa at the phylum level including proteobacteria chloroflexi and actinobacteria fig 4 a in the di treatment the relative abundance of proteobacteria was significantly increased by 53 40 and 6 71 compared with the values in the sdi and adi treatments respectively in the sdi treatment the relative abundances of seven bacterial taxa including patescibacteria nitrospirota and planctomycetota were elevated for example the relative abundance of patescibacteria was significantly increased by 107 98 and 16 84 compared with those in the di and adi treatments respectively whereas the relative abundance of nitrospirota was 42 68 and 74 63 higher respectively the relative abundance of planctomycetota was 1 75 and 1 99 fold higher in the di and adi treatments respectively in the adi treatment the relative abundances of patescibacteria cyanobacteria and fibrobacterota were 1 78 4 78 and 2 00 fold higher than those in the di treatment there were also significant differences in the relative abundances of certain genera 2 in the bacterial community across treatments fig 4 b specifically the abundances of three bacterial genera including porticoccus and marmoricola were increased in the di treatment the abundances of 15 bacterial genera such as pseudolabrys and niastella were elevated in the sdi treatment the abundances of eight bacterial genera were elevated in the adi treatment including bacillus aeromicrobium and mycobacterium 3 3 soil fungal community composition there were no significant differences in the diversity indices of soil fungal communities among treatments fig 5 the relative abundance of blastocladiomycota in the sdi treatment was 9 00 and 53 98 fold higher than that in the di and adi treatments respectively whereas blastocladiomycota abundance in the di treatment was 6 00 fold higher than that in the adi treatment fig 6 a the relative abundance of sar k amoebozoa was 11

in the di and adi treatments respectively the relative abundance of torula was 1 80 and 2 63 fold higher in the di and adi treatments respectively and the relative abundance of sorodiplophrys was 6 67 and 11 67 fold higher in the di and adi treatments respectively in the adi treatment the relative abundance of chaetomium was 2 75 fold higher than that in the di treatment fig 6 b 3 4 root soil

forks explained 0 178 0 350 and 0 340 of the variation in soil fungal communities respectively root length volume and forks significantly affected both soil bacterial and fungal communities table 2 root length exhibited the greatest effect on the soil bacterial community followed by root volume and then root forks root length also exerted the greatest effect on soil fungal community composition while root volume and forks had lower effects than root length in the soil fungi bacteria interaction network fig 7 c table 3 chloroflexi deinococcota and planctomycetota were the top three bacterial taxa in contribution whereas blastocladiomycota sar k norank and sar k amoebozoa were the top three fungal taxa the fungal phylum blastocladiomycota was significantly positively correlated with the bacterial phyla cyanobacteria verrucomicrobiota and elusimicrobiota whereas the fungal phylum sar k amoebozoa was significantly negatively correlated with the bacterial phyla planctomycetota and verrucomicrobiota 3 5 tomato yield and dry matter in the sdi treatment the total dry weight of plants was 1 92 and 1 26 fold higher than the values in the di and adi treatments respectively the corresponding root dry weight was 1 58 and 1 27 fold higher the stem dry weight was 1 55 and 1 08 fold higher and the leaf dry weight was 2 58 and 1 51 fold higher respectively the tomato yield in the sdi treatment was 19 77 and 7 77 higher than those in the di and adi treatments while the corresponding total nitrogen in roots was elevated by 23 07 and 17 51 respectively in the adi treatment the tomato yield root dry weight stem dry weight leaf dry weight and total dry weight were increased by 11 14 24 09 43 18 74 16 and 52 26 respectively compared with those in the di treatment table 4 the results of structural equation modeling showed that soil bacteria especially patescibacteria r 0 63 root dry weight r 0 24 and total nitrogen in roots r 0 25 exerted significant direct effects on tomato yield soil bacteria were significantly affected by root dry weight r 0 80 and soil moisture r 0 48 soil moisture and bacteria exhibited significant direct effects on root dry weight and total nitrogen in roots respectively r 0 25 and r 0 16 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 effects of drip irrigation mode on the root zone soil environment the effects of different drip irrigation modes on the migration reallocation and distribution of soil moisture in the root zones of crops remain unclear in the present study we found that under di and adi high soil moisture content occurred in the surface layer 0 10 cm whereas under sdi the soil layer with high moisture content moved down to the subsurface 20 cm however the distribution of soil moisture was relatively uniform under sdi while the uniformity of the soil moisture distribution decreased under adi and di exhibited wet dry stratification in the 0 60 cm soil layer these differences occurred because under adi the soil on the two sides of the root zone was alternately wetted and dried frequently sun et al 2013 under di soil moisture moved downward from the ground surface with relatively high resistance to soil moisture migration within the depth of 0 60 cm elmaloglou et al 2013 under sdi soil moisture moved up and down from the depth of the drip irrigation pipe with decreased resistance to soil water migration arbat et al 2010 the distribution of soil moisture in the root zone was the most uniform under sdi where continuous and stable water movement formed a desalinated area in the root zone phogat et al 2012 however the wet dry alternation of soil under adi and the wet dry stratification of soil under di could lead to local accumulation of salt in the soil of root zones tecon and or 2017 as a result the soil ph was remarkably lower under sdi than under di or adi in addition compared with di the soil above the drip irrigation pipe in sdi was relatively dry and loose which improved soil porosity moreover a high frequency of wet dry alternation can reduce soil porosity while a lower frequency of dry wet alternation can increase soil porosity wang et al 2017 2020 in the present study the frequency of soil wet dry alternation under adi was relatively low which was beneficial for enhancing soil aeration under di water infiltrated downward from the ground surface compacting soil to a greater degree and reducing soil porosity with increasing irrigation period and frequency fu et al 2019 furthermore the moisture distribution considerably affected the growth of crop roots zotarelli et al 2008 under sdi the uniform distribution of soil moisture in the root zone significantly increased root length fine root length and the number of root forks under adi the uniformity of the soil moisture distribution was reduced nevertheless frequent wet dry alternation on either side of the root zone was conducive to the growth of lateral roots sampathkumar et al 2012 consequently adi resulted in the greatest root volume while root growth in adi was second only to that under sdi 4 2 effects of drip irrigation mode on soil bacterial and fungal communities cheng et al 2020 found that the soil bacterial community associated with tomato mainly comprised proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and actinobacteria whereas we also found another 15 bacterial taxa such as chloroflexi gemmatimonadetes and patescibacteria in the present study the experimental soil in the previous study by cheng et al 2020 was slightly acidic whereas our experimental soil was weakly alkaline a decrease in ph would reduce the diversity of soil bacteria liu et al 2020c here we found that soil bacterial community composition was mainly affected by root length root volume and the number of root forks of tomato plants in addition root length was significantly correlated with soil ph moisture content and porosity under different drip irrigation modes in the experimental analysis the effects of other environmental factors such as soil ph on bacterial communities were masked by the roots an increase in root biomass indicates an increase in root exudates providing rich metabolic substrates for microbes and promoting the colonization and reproduction of root bacteria tan et al 2013 here the best root growth was observed under sdi thus the corresponding soil bacterial community diversity and abundance indices were the highest for this mode of irrigation the drip irrigation mode also resulted in significant differences in soil bacterial community composition for example patescibacteria planctomycetota cyanobacteria verrucomicrobiota and fibrobacterota prefer soil with high moisture content dash et al 2020 de araújo et al 2018 holajjer et al 2013 tian et al 2020 wang et al 2019b nitrospirota and elusimicrobiota grow under aerobic conditions huang and jianlei 2019 méheust et al 2020 verrucomicrobiota prefer low ph soil shen et al 2017 under sdi the soil moisture distribution was the most uniform which increased soil porosity and lowered soil ph all these factors were favorable for increasing the relative abundances of the abovementioned bacteria more importantly sdi promoted root growth while vigorous roots could secrete more exudates and thereby recruit more specific microbes to colonize the rhizosphere huang et al 2014 although the overall condition of root growth under adi was inferior to that under sdi it was remarkably superior to that under di compared with di adi also substantially improved the relative abundances of patescibacteria cyanobacteria and fibrobacterota however its positive effect on these bacteria was evidently lower than that of sdi overall the soil porosity and root growth under di were inferior to those under the other two drip irrigation modes and di only increased the relative abundance of proteobacteria during colonization by rhizospheric microbes a few low abundance bacteria dominated the rhizosphere specific responses of plants wayne et al 2017 for example marmoricola and porticoccus facilitate soil organic carbon metabolism araujo et al 2020 shiwen et al 2018 pseudolabrys can fix soil nitrogen arfarita et al 2019 niastella and mycobacterium participate in and enhance the synergy of root microbe interactions mohanram and kumar 2019 zhang et al 2020 and bacillus and aeromicrobium suppress the growth of harmful bacteria and improve the bacterial community shen et al 2018 xu et al 2016 the relative abundances of these bacteria differed significantly among the three drip irrigation treatments and may contribute to the variation in tomato growth however more evidence is needed to test this hypothesis in this study the three types of drip irrigation treatments exhibited significant effects on certain low abundance taxa in the fungal community sdi substantially increased the relative abundance of blastocladiomycota while this fungal phylum was significantly positively correlated with root length fig 7 previous research has indicated that there is a significant positive correlation between the relative abundance of blastocladiomycota and the soil organic carbon content tong et al 2020 in the present study the root length under sdi was more than 4 fold greater than those under di and adi vigorous roots could provide abundant organic carbon exudates for blastocladiomycota and thereby promote considerable fungal growth in addition adi and di increased the relative abundance of sorodiplophrys as an indicator of soil drought huang et al 2020 which corresponded to soil wet dry alternation in the root zone and soil wet dry stratification under adi and di respectively 4 3 effects of drip irrigation mode on root soil microbe interactions and tomato growth sdi and adi can prominently alter the soil bacterial community structure promote root growth and enhance the activity of soil nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism wang et al 2008 2018 2020 however existing studies have not explored the intensity and key factors of root soil microbe interactions in the present study we found that root length root volume and the number of root forks of tomato plants were the factors directly affecting the composition of soil bacterial and fungal communities and they were key factors maintaining the root microbe interaction network fig 7 tables 2 and 3 root length root volume and the number of root forks determine root distribution and architecture in the soil high values of these indices can improve the ability of plant roots to acquire soil moisture and nutrients recruit additional microbes to colonize the roots and enhance the intensity of root microbe interactions wang et al 2006 because the most favorable root growth was achieved under sdi followed by adi and then di sdi exhibited a considerably greater effect on bacterial and fungal community composition than did adi or di whereas the effect of adi was greater than that of di moreover we found that the fungal phylum blastocladiomycota was a keystone taxon for bacteria fungi interactions and played a vital role in enhancing positive bacteria fungi interactions fig 7 sdi significantly increased the relative abundance of blastocladiomycota and thus promoted positive bacteria fungi interactions under adi the relative abundance of blastocladiomycota was second only to that under sdi so the effect of adi on positive bacteria fungi interactions was also lower than that of sdi the effect of drip irrigation mode on root soil microbe interactions will inevitably influence tomato yield moran zuloaga et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 found that tomato yield was significantly correlated with bacterial community abundance indices under sdi liu et al 2020b reported that adi improved soil nitrogen and phosphorus activity and tomato growth our previous research also found that sdi and adi could regulate soil bacterial community composition while facilitating tomato growth wang et al 2020 however the abovementioned studies did not thoroughly explore the root soil microbe interaction mechanisms by which sdi and adi improve tomato yield here we found that under drip irrigation conditions root dry weight the relative abundance of the soil bacterial group patescibacteria and total nitrogen in roots were the main factors directly affecting tomato yield the drip irrigation mode directly affected root dry weight and soil bacteria and indirectly affected root microbe interactions through soil moisture to regulate tomato yield under sdi the soil moisture distribution in the root zone was uniform which significantly increased root dry weight the relative abundance of patescibacteria and total nitrogen in roots the resultant tomato yield was 19 77 and 7 77 higher than the yields under di and adi respectively these results provide a reference for regulating root soil microbe interactions and increasing tomato yield via the optimization of drip irrigation mode but the associated mechanisms still need to be further studied 5 conclusion the drip irrigation mode significantly affected the soil moisture distribution ph porosity and tomato root growth root length root volume and the number of root forks were key factors affecting soil bacterial and fungal communities and maintaining the root microbe interaction network differences in root growth caused by differences in drip irrigation mode led to distinct root soil microbe interactions with the roots as the center which in turn regulated tomato yield subsurface drip irrigation featured the most uniform tomato root zone 0 60 cm soil layer moisture distribution the greatest root index values the most intense positive root soil microbe interactions and the highest tomato yield under alternate drip irrigation the uniformity of the soil moisture distribution in the tomato root zone was the lowest but frequent wet dry alternation of soil also promoted root growth overall the root growth under alternate drip irrigation was inferior to that under subsurface drip irrigation but was superior to that under surface drip irrigation alternate drip irrigation also enhanced positive root soil microbe interactions with tomato yield being second only to that under subsurface drip irrigation the effects of surface drip irrigation on the promotion of tomato roots and soil microbial communities were lower than those for the other two drip irrigation modes and the resultant tomato yield was also the lowest for di declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

arrangement of drip irrigation pipes as follows surface drip irrigation di in which the drip irrigation pipe is located on the ground surface with water infiltrating downward from the ground surface to the crop root system at a low flow rate and high frequency martínez and reca 2014 subsurface drip irrigation sdi which delivers water directly to the crop root zone through the buried drip irrigation pipe liu et al 2020a and alternate drip irrigation adi in which the drip irrigation pipe is positioned on both sides of the crop root system to keep the root zone soil moist on one side and dry on the other side artificially creating alternation of wet and dry soil on the two sides of the root zone jovanovic and stikic 2018 both sdi and adi are superior to di in terms of saving water and increasing yield because the more direct water supply by sdi facilitates root growth iqbal et al 2020 kong et al 2012 while the wet dry alternation by adi induces abscisic acid signals further facilitating root growth a vigorous root system can enhance soil nutrient activity and supply more nutrients to plants thereby increasing crop growth wang et al 2019a the basic nutrients required for plant growth all come from the soil the distribution of soil moisture varies under different drip irrigation modes potentially affecting soil nutrient cycling soil root interactions and crop growth and yield shan et al 2019 however the specific mechanisms remain unclear this lack of knowledge limits our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the water saving and yield increasing advantages of sdi and adi over di from the perspective of soil microecology and restricts further enhancement of the water saving potential of drip irrigation by aboveground belowground coupled regulation microbes directly participate in the processes of soil nutrient cycling and plant nutrient acquisition microbial community composition and variation are the drivers of nutrient transfer and transformation in the soil plant system while they are also the key factors affecting root soil interactions trivedi et al 2020 soil moisture as a factor limiting microbial community diversity and crop growth regulates the intensity of root soil interactions and the growth and yield of crops by affecting soil aeration and nutrient availability prudent et al 2020 differences in moisture distribution caused by different drip irrigation modes further affect soil structure aeration and nutrient heterogeneity moussa et al 2020 all these changes alter the composition and metabolic function of soil microbial communities and affect the metabolic activity of essential nutrients carbon nitrogen and phosphorus for plant growth which in turn changes the growth status of crop roots the intensity of root soil interactions nutrient transfer and rates of exchange between roots and plants centenaro et al 2018 ultimately regulating plant growth and yield balasubramanian et al 2020 we believe that this is the fundamental reason sdi and adi are more advantageous than di in terms of saving water and increasing yield to reveal the specific internal mechanisms responsible for these advantages it is crucial to understand the responses of major soil microbes bacteria and fungi to different drip irrigation modes zhu et al 2019 found that aerated drip irrigation can remarkably increase the abundance of cultivable soil microbes wang et al 2017 2018 found that sdi and adi can optimize soil bacterial community composition and increase the relative abundances of soil nitrogen and phosphorus metabolizing bacteria however similar associated studies are still lacking while most of the existing studies only investigated the effect of a single drip irrigation mode on a specific class of soil microbes there remains a dearth of studies on soil microbial community variation and root soil interactions in response to different drip irrigation modes jovanovic and stikic 2018 therefore it is imperative to deepen our understanding of these aspects of drip irrigation a further assumption is that different drip irrigation modes shape crop root morphologies and root microbial community compositions through changes in the soil moisture environment thereby regulating root soil microbe interactions and affecting crop yield however the key factors involved in root soil microbe interactions and their influence on crop yield under different drip irrigation modes have not been well addressed therefore the present study mainly focused on the effects of di sdi and adi on soil environmental factors in the crop root zone the associated bacterial and fungal community compositions and root growth we analyzed the response of crop growth and yield to root soil microbe interactions and explored the soil microecological mechanisms underpinning the effects of different drip irrigation modes on crop growth and yield the results of this study could provide new evidence and serve as a reference for the optimization of drip irrigation techniques 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design greenhouse cultivation experiments were conducted with tomato at the experimental base of northwest a f university 108 09 e 34 15 n during september 2018 april 2019 and september 2019 april 2020 the experimental site is within a warm temperate semihumid zone with a mean annual temperature of 13 c mean annual precipitation of 600 mm and mean annual daylight duration of 2163 h the experimental soil contained 17 g kg 1 organic matter 1 16 g kg 1 total nitrogen and 0 42 g kg 1 total phosphorus the cultivation plots were established with double ridges which had an inverted trapezoid shape in cross section length 7 m ridge width 0 6 m ditch width 0 4 m and height 0 3 m fig 1 tomato plants were grown in double rows with 20 plants per row three treatments were included di sdi and adi there were three replicates per treatment for a total of 9 plots all plots were covered with plastic mulch in each plot of the di and sdi treatments a drip irrigation pipe was buried at depths of 0 and 20 cm respectively in the middle of the spacing between adjacent tomato rows in each plot of the adi treatment drip irrigation pipes were positioned 30 cm from the base of the tomato plants on both sides the drip irrigation pipe on only one side was turned on for each irrigation and the pipes on the two sides were alternately used for irrigation integrating the planting experience of local farmers and previous research the irrigation lower limits of the di plot sdi plot and each side of the adi plot were set to 70 of the field water holding capacity soil moisture was measured by a tdr 200 soil moisture meter for this measurement three probe tubes were installed at a depth of 100 cm in the middle of each plot of sdi and di and in the midline position between the drip irrigation pipe of each end of the adi plot and the tomato plant in addition the soil moisture was determined by soil coring and the oven drying method bittelli et al 2008 when the soil moisture content reached the lower limit water was supplied according to the method of wang et al 2017 during the entire tomato season from september 2018 to april 2019 di sdi and adi were irrigated 13 11 and 14 times respectively while in the tomato growing season from october 2019 to march 2020 di sdi and adi were irrigated 11 times 9 and 12 times respectively in the tomato seedling period irrigation was performed every 8 10 days and during the flowering and fruit set period and fruit maturation period irrigation was performed every 5 7 days the experimental site is a vegetable planting field with relatively sufficient soil nutrients nevertheless before tomato planting bioorganic fertilizer with an organic matter content of 35 was applied as a base fertilizer at a rate of 300 kg ha 1 and no topdressing was applied during the tomato growing period therefore the fertilization conditions of all treatments were uniform 2 2 measurement indices 2 2 1 soil moisture ph and porosity three 100 cm probes were arranged in each plot the 0 60 cm soil moisture content was measured at equal intervals of 10 cm using a fieldscout tdr 200 spectrum technologies aurora co usa and corrected by soil sampling and oven drying the experimental treatments were initiated 20 days after tomato planting soil moisture content was measured before and after each irrigation and between irrigations and the measurements continued until the harvest of tomato fruit during each measurement of soil moisture content three tomato plants per plot were selected a small soil auger with an inner diameter of 2 0 cm was used to collect 0 60 cm root zone soil samples at 10 cm intervals the soil ph was measured using a phb 4 acidity meter soil water 1 5 w v after the harvest of tomatoes three sampling points were set in each plot and a 100 cm3 cutting ring was used to collect 0 40 cm soil samples at 10 cm intervals soil porosity was measured following the method of wang et al 2018 2 2 2 tomato yield root systems and dry matter tomato fruit were harvested in each plot to estimate the tomato yield t hm 2 of each treatment in each plot three tomato plants with uniform growth were selected and their aboveground parts were cut off to excavate the roots a rectangular block length 40 cm width 30 cm depth 50 cm was dug by taking the midline of the spacing between two adjacent plants as a boundary the whole root system was collected and large blocks of soil were removed then the soil adhering to the roots was shaken off and placed into sterile tubes for soil microbial community composition analysis root samples were analyzed using winrhizo pro2004b version 5 0 regent instrument inc quebec qc

root lengths d 2 mm were 6 11 and 5 49 fold higher than those in the di and adi treatments respectively in addition the root volumes of tomato plants and the numbers of root forks were significantly elevated by 34 91 and 101 56 in the sdi treatment compared with those in the di treatment the root length root volume and number of root forks in the adi treatment were 1 23 1 38 and 1 84 fold higher than those in the di treatment respectively table 1 3 2 soil bacterial community composition based on an overall evaluation of soil bacterial communities in the two consecutive experiments the shannon

whereas the simpson index of the adi treatment was significantly higher than that of the sdi treatment the ace and chao indices of the sdi treatment were significantly higher than those of the di and adi treatments fig 3 the bacterial community mainly comprised 19 bacterial taxa at the phylum level including proteobacteria chloroflexi and actinobacteria fig 4 a in the di treatment the relative abundance of proteobacteria was significantly increased by 53 40 and 6 71 compared with the values in the sdi and adi treatments respectively in the sdi treatment the relative abundances of seven bacterial taxa including patescibacteria nitrospirota and planctomycetota were elevated for example the relative abundance of patescibacteria was significantly increased by 107 98 and 16 84 compared with those in the di and adi treatments respectively whereas the relative abundance of nitrospirota was 42 68 and 74 63 higher respectively the relative abundance of planctomycetota was 1 75 and 1 99 fold higher in the di and adi treatments respectively in the adi treatment the relative abundances of patescibacteria cyanobacteria and fibrobacterota were 1 78 4 78 and 2 00 fold higher than those in the di treatment there were also significant differences in the relative abundances of certain genera 2 in the bacterial community across treatments fig 4 b specifically the abundances of three bacterial genera including porticoccus and marmoricola were increased in the di treatment the abundances of 15 bacterial genera such as pseudolabrys and niastella were elevated in the sdi treatment the abundances of eight bacterial genera were elevated in the adi treatment including bacillus aeromicrobium and mycobacterium 3 3 soil fungal community composition there were no significant differences in the diversity indices of soil fungal communities among treatments fig 5 the relative abundance of blastocladiomycota in the sdi treatment was 9 00 and 53 98 fold higher than that in the di and adi treatments respectively whereas blastocladiomycota abundance in the di treatment was 6 00 fold higher than that in the adi treatment fig 6 a the relative abundance of sar k amoebozoa was 11

forks explained 0 178 0 350 and 0 340 of the variation in soil fungal communities respectively root length volume and forks significantly affected both soil bacterial and fungal communities table 2 root length exhibited the greatest effect on the soil bacterial community followed by root volume and then root forks root length also exerted the greatest effect on soil fungal community composition while root volume and forks had lower effects than root length in the soil fungi bacteria interaction network fig 7 c table 3 chloroflexi deinococcota and planctomycetota were the top three bacterial taxa in contribution whereas blastocladiomycota sar k norank and sar k amoebozoa were the top three fungal taxa the fungal phylum blastocladiomycota was significantly positively correlated with the bacterial phyla cyanobacteria verrucomicrobiota and elusimicrobiota whereas the fungal phylum sar k amoebozoa was significantly negatively correlated with the bacterial phyla planctomycetota and verrucomicrobiota 3 5 tomato yield and dry matter in the sdi treatment the total dry weight of plants was 1 92 and 1 26 fold higher than the values in the di and adi treatments respectively the corresponding root dry weight was 1 58 and 1 27 fold higher the stem dry weight was 1 55 and 1 08 fold higher and the leaf dry weight was 2 58 and 1 51 fold higher respectively the tomato yield in the sdi treatment was 19 77 and 7 77 higher than those in the di and adi treatments while the corresponding total nitrogen in roots was elevated by 23 07 and 17 51 respectively in the adi treatment the tomato yield root dry weight stem dry weight leaf dry weight and total dry weight were increased by 11 14 24 09 43 18 74 16 and 52 26 respectively compared with those in the di treatment table 4 the results of structural equation modeling showed that soil bacteria especially patescibacteria r 0 63 root dry weight r 0 24 and total nitrogen in roots r 0 25 exerted significant direct effects on tomato yield soil bacteria were significantly affected by root dry weight r 0 80 and soil moisture r 0 48 soil moisture and bacteria exhibited significant direct effects on root dry weight and total nitrogen in roots respectively r 0 25 and r 0 16 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 effects of drip irrigation mode on the root zone soil environment the effects of different drip irrigation modes on the migration reallocation and distribution of soil moisture in the root zones of crops remain unclear in the present study we found that under di and adi high soil moisture content occurred in the surface layer 0 10 cm whereas under sdi the soil layer with high moisture content moved down to the subsurface 20 cm however the distribution of soil moisture was relatively uniform under sdi while the uniformity of the soil moisture distribution decreased under adi and di exhibited wet dry stratification in the 0 60 cm soil layer these differences occurred because under adi the soil on the two sides of the root zone was alternately wetted and dried frequently sun et al 2013 under di soil moisture moved downward from the ground surface with relatively high resistance to soil moisture migration within the depth of 0 60 cm elmaloglou et al 2013 under sdi soil moisture moved up and down from the depth of the drip irrigation pipe with decreased resistance to soil water migration arbat et al 2010 the distribution of soil moisture in the root zone was the most uniform under sdi where continuous and stable water movement formed a desalinated area in the root zone phogat et al 2012 however the wet dry alternation of soil under adi and the wet dry stratification of soil under di could lead to local accumulation of salt in the soil of root zones tecon and or 2017 as a result the soil ph was remarkably lower under sdi than under di or adi in addition compared with di the soil above the drip irrigation pipe in sdi was relatively dry and loose which improved soil porosity moreover a high frequency of wet dry alternation can reduce soil porosity while a lower frequency of dry wet alternation can increase soil porosity wang et al 2017 2020 in the present study the frequency of soil wet dry alternation under adi was relatively low which was beneficial for enhancing soil aeration under di water infiltrated downward from the ground surface compacting soil to a greater degree and reducing soil porosity with increasing irrigation period and frequency fu et al 2019 furthermore the moisture distribution considerably affected the growth of crop roots zotarelli et al 2008 under sdi the uniform distribution of soil moisture in the root zone significantly increased root length fine root length and the number of root forks under adi the uniformity of the soil moisture distribution was reduced nevertheless frequent wet dry alternation on either side of the root zone was conducive to the growth of lateral roots sampathkumar et al 2012 consequently adi resulted in the greatest root volume while root growth in adi was second only to that under sdi 4 2 effects of drip irrigation mode on soil bacterial and fungal communities cheng et al 2020 found that the soil bacterial community associated with tomato mainly comprised proteobacteria bacteroidetes acidobacteria and actinobacteria whereas we also found another 15 bacterial taxa such as chloroflexi gemmatimonadetes and patescibacteria in the present study the experimental soil in the previous study by cheng et al 2020 was slightly acidic whereas our experimental soil was weakly alkaline a decrease in ph would reduce the diversity of soil bacteria liu et al 2020c here we found that soil bacterial community composition was mainly affected by root length root volume and the number of root forks of tomato plants in addition root length was significantly correlated with soil ph moisture content and porosity under different drip irrigation modes in the experimental analysis the effects of other environmental factors such as soil ph on bacterial communities were masked by the roots an increase in root biomass indicates an increase in root exudates providing rich metabolic substrates for microbes and promoting the colonization and reproduction of root bacteria tan et al 2013 here the best root growth was observed under sdi thus the corresponding soil bacterial community diversity and abundance indices were the highest for this mode of irrigation the drip irrigation mode also resulted in significant differences in soil bacterial community composition for example patescibacteria planctomycetota cyanobacteria verrucomicrobiota and fibrobacterota prefer soil with high moisture content dash et al 2020 de araújo et al 2018 holajjer et al 2013 tian et al 2020 wang et al 2019b nitrospirota and elusimicrobiota grow under aerobic conditions huang and jianlei 2019 méheust et al 2020 verrucomicrobiota prefer low ph soil shen et al 2017 under sdi the soil moisture distribution was the most uniform which increased soil porosity and lowered soil ph all these factors were favorable for increasing the relative abundances of the abovementioned bacteria more importantly sdi promoted root growth while vigorous roots could secrete more exudates and thereby recruit more specific microbes to colonize the rhizosphere huang et al 2014 although the overall condition of root growth under adi was inferior to that under sdi it was remarkably superior to that under di compared with di adi also substantially improved the relative abundances of patescibacteria cyanobacteria and fibrobacterota however its positive effect on these bacteria was evidently lower than that of sdi overall the soil porosity and root growth under di were inferior to those under the other two drip irrigation modes and di only increased the relative abundance of proteobacteria during colonization by rhizospheric microbes a few low abundance bacteria dominated the rhizosphere specific responses of plants wayne et al 2017 for example marmoricola and porticoccus facilitate soil organic carbon metabolism araujo et al 2020 shiwen et al 2018 pseudolabrys can fix soil nitrogen arfarita et al 2019 niastella and mycobacterium participate in and enhance the synergy of root microbe interactions mohanram and kumar 2019 zhang et al 2020 and bacillus and aeromicrobium suppress the growth of harmful bacteria and improve the bacterial community shen et al 2018 xu et al 2016 the relative abundances of these bacteria differed significantly among the three drip irrigation treatments and may contribute to the variation in tomato growth however more evidence is needed to test this hypothesis in this study the three types of drip irrigation treatments exhibited significant effects on certain low abundance taxa in the fungal community sdi substantially increased the relative abundance of blastocladiomycota while this fungal phylum was significantly positively correlated with root length fig 7 previous research has indicated that there is a significant positive correlation between the relative abundance of blastocladiomycota and the soil organic carbon content tong et al 2020 in the present study the root length under sdi was more than 4 fold greater than those under di and adi vigorous roots could provide abundant organic carbon exudates for blastocladiomycota and thereby promote considerable fungal growth in addition adi and di increased the relative abundance of sorodiplophrys as an indicator of soil drought huang et al 2020 which corresponded to soil wet dry alternation in the root zone and soil wet dry stratification under adi and di respectively 4 3 effects of drip irrigation mode on root soil microbe interactions and tomato growth sdi and adi can prominently alter the soil bacterial community structure promote root growth and enhance the activity of soil nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism wang et al 2008 2018 2020 however existing studies have not explored the intensity and key factors of root soil microbe interactions in the present study we found that root length root volume and the number of root forks of tomato plants were the factors directly affecting the composition of soil bacterial and fungal communities and they were key factors maintaining the root microbe interaction network fig 7 tables 2 and 3 root length root volume and the number of root forks determine root distribution and architecture in the soil high values of these indices can improve the ability of plant roots to acquire soil moisture and nutrients recruit additional microbes to colonize the roots and enhance the intensity of root microbe interactions wang et al 2006 because the most favorable root growth was achieved under sdi followed by adi and then di sdi exhibited a considerably greater effect on bacterial and fungal community composition than did adi or di whereas the effect of adi was greater than that of di moreover we found that the fungal phylum blastocladiomycota was a keystone taxon for bacteria fungi interactions and played a vital role in enhancing positive bacteria fungi interactions fig 7 sdi significantly increased the relative abundance of blastocladiomycota and thus promoted positive bacteria fungi interactions under adi the relative abundance of blastocladiomycota was second only to that under sdi so the effect of adi on positive bacteria fungi interactions was also lower than that of sdi the effect of drip irrigation mode on root soil microbe interactions will inevitably influence tomato yield moran zuloaga et al 2015 zhou et al 2020 found that tomato yield was significantly correlated with bacterial community abundance indices under sdi liu et al 2020b reported that adi improved soil nitrogen and phosphorus activity and tomato growth our previous research also found that sdi and adi could regulate soil bacterial community composition while facilitating tomato growth wang et al 2020 however the abovementioned studies did not thoroughly explore the root soil microbe interaction mechanisms by which sdi and adi improve tomato yield here we found that under drip irrigation conditions root dry weight the relative abundance of the soil bacterial group patescibacteria and total nitrogen in roots were the main factors directly affecting tomato yield the drip irrigation mode directly affected root dry weight and soil bacteria and indirectly affected root microbe interactions through soil moisture to regulate tomato yield under sdi the soil moisture distribution in the root zone was uniform which significantly increased root dry weight the relative abundance of patescibacteria and total nitrogen in roots the resultant tomato yield was 19 77 and 7 77 higher than the yields under di and adi respectively these results provide a reference for regulating root soil microbe interactions and increasing tomato yield via the optimization of drip irrigation mode but the associated mechanisms still need to be further studied 5 conclusion the drip irrigation mode significantly affected the soil moisture distribution ph porosity and tomato root growth root length root volume and the number of root forks were key factors affecting soil bacterial and fungal communities and maintaining the root microbe interaction network differences in root growth caused by differences in drip irrigation mode led to distinct root soil microbe interactions with the roots as the center which in turn regulated tomato yield subsurface drip irrigation featured the most uniform tomato root zone 0 60 cm soil layer moisture distribution the greatest root index values the most intense positive root soil microbe interactions and the highest tomato yield under alternate drip irrigation the uniformity of the soil moisture distribution in the tomato root zone was the lowest but frequent wet dry alternation of soil also promoted root growth overall the root growth under alternate drip irrigation was inferior to that under subsurface drip irrigation but was superior to that under surface drip irrigation alternate drip irrigation also enhanced positive root soil microbe interactions with tomato yield being second only to that under subsurface drip irrigation the effects of surface drip irrigation on the promotion of tomato roots and soil microbial communities were lower than those for the other two drip irrigation modes and the resultant tomato yield was also the lowest for di declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9796,an accurate regional estimate of soil moisture content smc is important for water management and drought monitoring traditional ground measurement methods of smc are limited by the disadvantages of high cost and small scale the development of remote sensing rs technology provides a cost effective tool for estimating smc at regional scale however the estimation of smc by using the combination of multiple sensors has yet to be thoroughly discussed furthermore the way in which vegetation types fraction of vegetation coverage fvc and soil layer depth affect the smc estimation performance remains unclear therefore the objectives in this study are to 1 evaluate the smc estimation performance provided by landsat 8 data and random forest regression rfr algorithm 2 discuss the accuracy of rs based method for smc estimation at different soil layer depths and 3 explore how vegetation types and fvc affect the performance of smc estimation the results can be summarized as 1 the smc estimation performance of multispectral ms and thermal infrared tir based indices single used were comparable in which tir based indices performed better in shallow soil layer while ms based indices performed better in deep soil layer generally ms and tir based indices jointly used outperformed the index single used 2 the accuracy of the proposed method for estimating smc decreased with soil depth 3 the proposed method performed greatest in grassland with relatively low height among the three vegetation types moreover the smc estimation in moderate vegetation coverage fvc ranged from 0 3 to 0 5 was best these results indicate that rs based multimodal data combined with rfr could provide relatively repeatable and accurate smc estimation this approach can thus be used for the regional smc monitoring and water resources management graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil moisture content multimodality multispectral thermal infrared random forest 1 introduction soil moisture content smc is generally defined as the proportion of water stored in unsaturated soil smc is a crucial parameter of ecological environment seneviratne et al 2010 which provides information on the available water for vegetation growth needs luo et al 2019 smc is also a critical indicator for drought monitoring okin et al 2018 an accurate and cost effective smc estimation methods is of great significance in the field of ecology and agricultural research however several traditional smc ground measurement methods are limited in monitoring regional water resources for example gravimetric measurements involving weighing soil samples before and after drying robinson et al 2008 neutron measurements that use radioactive elements as neutron sources hollinger and isard 1994 and time domain reflectometry tdr which is an indirect measurement method that exploits the dependence of soil dielectric permittivity on smc robinson et al 2003 these methods generally employed for small scale monitoring with the disadvantage of high cost therefore a more efficient and scalable smc measurement method is highly desired to developed for smc monitoring at present remote sensing rs technology was developed for regional smc estimates with the advantages of high temporal and spatial resolutions blatchford et al 2019 the rs based smc estimation methods generally estimates smc by fitting the nonlinear or linear function between the remotely sensed data and in situ measured smc mulder et al 2011 these methods can be divided into three categories optical based thermal infrared based and microwave based the optical based methods generally estimate smc by using the spectral information of visible and near infrared bands which contain the reflectance data from surface that can reveal the vegetation properties as a function of smc serrano et al 2019 several vegetation indices vis such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the anomalous vegetation index avi and the vegetation condition index vci have been widely used for characterization of vegetation and further indirectly estimated smc kogan 1990 the thermal infrared based smc estimation methods proposed that land surface temperature is closely related to moisture therefore several temperature indices such as temperature condition index tci were developed to characterize smc by fitting function kogan 1995 but it should be noted satellite thermal infrared data can only reveal the surface temperature while can not measures the deeper soil layer temperature moreover satellite thermal infrared data is limited as well when dealing with vegetation with high coverage therefore several indices which combined the optical and thermal infrared information such as vegetation supply water index vswi toby et al 1994 and temperature vegetation drought index tvdi sandholt et al 2002 were proposed to estimate smc and showed better performance luo et al 2020 the combination of optical based vegetation status information and thermal infrared based vegetation temperature information has the potential to further improve the accuracy of smc estimation the microwave based methods has also been increasingly employed for smc estimation because microwaves can deeply penetrate into the soil so that this technique can probe the dielectric properties of the soil dong et al 2020 be that as it may these methods have the same problem with thermal infrared based smc estimation methods when dealing with the vegetation with high coverage because the microwave cannot penetrate the dense vegetation several smc data products have been generated via microwave remote sensing such as smos kerr et al 2010 amsr e karthikeyan et al 2019 and smap mao et al 2020 however this dataset is discontinuous and incomplete for dense vegetation coverage seneviratne et al 2010 currently there is no dataset or model can estimate deep smc with high resolution fitting the correlation function of remotely sensed data and in situ smc are the main means for remote sensing smc retrieval methods generally the correlation is nonlinear a situation that lends itself to the use of machine learning algorithms which are well suited for dealing with nonlinear heteroscedasticity problems and can be used for intelligent data processing and complete mining of data value jacinta and kerrie 2018 jin et al 2017 machine learning algorithms are already widely used to analyze remote sensing data with excellent results ge et al 2019 jin et al 2020 maimaitijiang et al 2020 random forest regression rfr is one of widely used ensemble machine learning algorithms which was proposed by breiman 2001 rfr performed great accuracy in dealing with nonlinear regression maimaitijiang et al 2020 ge et al 2019 used rfr algorithm to estimate the field scale smc in fukang city xinjiang uygur autonomous region china using unmanned aerial vehicle uav hyperspectral data and obtained good results with coefficient determination r 2 of 0 91 maimaitijiang et al 2020 used rfr algorithm to predict the field soybean yield in usa and obtained good results with 17 4 relative root mean square error rrmse and r 2 of 0 66 in general rfr algorithm has the potential for regional smc accurate estimation soil moisture affects the vegetation growth status to a certain extent therefore when the sensor regardless thermal infrared or microwave cannot detect the bottom of the canopy in the places with dense vegetation the soil moisture status can only be estimated indirectly through vegetation growth status temperature and spectral information although several studies have reported the rs based method to estimate regional scale smc luo et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 for example mohamed et al 2020 used sentinel 1 and landsat 7 data to estimate smc in the east of nile delta of egypt and obtained a good result with r 2 reached 0 83 but the study did not clearly discussed the effect of vegetation cover and soil depth han et al 2021 used weather and soil data and machine learning methods rather than remote sensing to explain the smc variation at different depth correlation coefficient was 0 90 0 98 which is similar to the idea of soil hydrodynamics however it requires detailed ground information such as soil and vegetation parameters which was not easy to obtain on a regional scale chauhan 1997 studied the effect of microwave remote sensing on soil moisture monitoring under vegetation cover but the penetration of microwave was limited the accuracy of microwave estimation of smc in the water absorbing layer of crop roots which is usually tens of centimeters or even deeper was also limited in this study we attempt to explore the estimation accuracy at different depth smc under various vegetation types and vegetation covers therefore the multiple optical based vis and infrared thermal based temperature indices were jointly used to estimate the smc of beijing city based on rfr algorithm the objectives of this study are to 1 compare the accuracy of smc estimates obtained from multimodal data analyzed by machine learning algorithm 2 explore how smc estimation varies with soil depth and 3 analyze how vegetation coverage and vegetation types affect the accuracy of smc estimates 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site is located in beijing city 115 7 117 4 e 39 4 41 6 n in north of china which covers a land area of approximately 16 410 km2 was selected to study the estimation of smc fig 1 in which the vegetation coverage area is approximately 12 086 km2 accounting for 73 65 beijing has warm temperate semi humid and semi arid monsoon climate with high temperature and rainy in summer and cold and dry in winter annual precipitation in beijing is 483 9 mm and annual average temperature is 11

the plain area covers 6200 km2 accounting for 38 of the total area 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 landsat 8 data landsat 8 collection 2 surface reflectance ls 8 data was employed for this study this dataset is the atmospherically corrected surface reflectance from the landsat 8 oli tirs sensors obtained from united states geological survey usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov ls 8 data contains four visible and near infrared vnir bands and two short wave infrared swir bands processed to orthorectified surface reflectance and two thermal infrared tir bands processed to orthorectified brightness temperature eric et al 2016 in this study the visible bands blue green and red near infrared band and thermal infrared band were selected for smc estimation the spatial resolution is 30 m 30 m thermal

10th march 26th may 13th may 29th june 14th august 1st august 17th september 2nd september 18th october 20th november 5th and december 7th the radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction were conducted for all images by using the radiometric calibration tool and flaash atmospheric correction tool of envi software cloud cover was removed from all images by using quality assessment qa band to eliminate the impact on smc estimation shen et al 2015 2 2 2 in situ soil moisture in this study the in situ soil moisture was measured and recorded by beijing soil moisture monitoring system bsmms which established by beijing water science and technology institute bwsti a total of 72 soil moisture monitoring stations of bsmms were set up in beijing the location of stations is shown in fig 1 each station was set up in the evenly distributed vegetation fig 2 the soil moisture monitoring instrument has five probes in different soil layer depth 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 80 cm and is powered by solar energy furthermore the monitored moisture data can be remotely transmitted to the bsmms and recorded the measured smc is volumetric moisture content vmc and in situ bulk density bd g cm3 and in situ field capacity in volumetric fc were used to convert vmc to gravimetric moisture content gmc and relative moisture content rmc respectively eqs 1 and 2 1 g m c v m c b d 2 r m c v m c f c 100 a total of 936 samples of in situ soil moisture measured by bsmms in the selected 13 days were collected for this study in which 494 samples were measured in cropland 247 samples were measured in forest land and 195 samples were measured in grassland 2 3 methods 2 3 1 regression model building random forest regression rfr algorithm which based on classification tree was employed for soil moisture estimation model building breiman 2001 currently rfr algorithm has been widely used for remote sensing model building and obtained excellent results rodriguez galiano et al 2012 samat et al 2015 the essence of rfr is to use a large set of regression trees to study the relationship between independent and dependent variables each tree represents a set of restrictions to decide the input to the output to model the relationship between remotely sensed indices and smc in this study given the set of training input output pairs i e remotely sensed indices smc the main flow of rfr algorithm is as follows belgiu and dragut 2016 1 randomly selecting subset with replacement from the original training set 2 using the subset to build the regression tree model 3 repeating the process 1 and 2 for m times the results of the m regression trees were averaged as the final result it should be noted that the number of regression trees m is an important parameter to influence the model performance here the optimal m was detected using the training set and determination coefficient r 2 that could best estimate the smc as shown in fig 3 the r 2 remained in a high level when the m reached 180 therefore m was set as 180 in this study moreover to ensure a fair and comprehensive evaluation of rfr methods with their given input variables we used 80 of the samples and in situ smc measurements selected at random for training the machine learning methods and the remaining 20 to determine the accuracy of the smc estimates produced by this method 2 3 2 input variables a total of 20 input variables were extracted from ls 8 data table 1 these variables can be divided into two categories multispectral ms indices extracted from visible and infrared bands and thermal tir indices extracted from thermal infrared bands fig 4 shows the overall workflow of the extraction of each index and model building with ls 8 data to compare the performance of the two sensors ms and tir and its combination the different indices were used for model input respectively i e only used ms or tir indices single used and used both the two sensors indices jointly used 2 3 3 anova test in order to compare the model performance under different conditions soil moisture types input variables soil depth and vegetation types a one way variance analysis anova p 0 05 was used to test the significant differences of the estimated smc under different conditions 2 4 validation a fivefold cross validation was used to verify the accuracy of the smc estimation algorithms additionally three evaluation metrics root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse and the adjusted coefficient of determination r 2 were computed to quantify the model performance these three evaluation metrics are calculated as follows jin et al 2020 3 r 2 1 1 i 1 n s m c m i s m c m 2 i 1 n s m c o b i s m c o b 2 n 1 n m 1 4 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s m c m i s m c o b i 2 5 r r m s e r m s e s m c o b 100 where smc m and smc obi are the estimated smc and in situ measured smc respectively n is the number of samples and m is the number of variables 2 5 tools used python version 3 7 google inc mountain view california usa and the scikit learn library version 0 23 0 google inc were used for smc estimation models building arcgis software version 10 4 esri inc redlands california usa and envi software version 5 3 esri inc were used to process raster data python and the spss software version 21 ibm inc armonk new york usa were used for numerical calculation and analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 modeling and validation of soil moisture content rfr algorithm was employed for regional smc estimation using ls 8 data the results are shown as table 2 in general the proposed method performed good results with r 2 varied from 0 67 to 0 81 and rrmse varied from 8 74 to 14 68 moreover the performance of different smc types vmc gmc and rmc and different input variables were analyzed in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 3 1 1 model performance in different soil moisture types fig 5 shows the performance of smc estimation using different moisture types vmc gmc and rmc from the comparison of r 2 the three types of smc showed the comparable value from 0 72 to 0 73 and the difference did not reach significant level p 0 05 fig 5a however the comparison of rrmse showed that using vmc for moisture estimation has the lowest rrmse value 10 41 and was significantly higher than the results using rmc p 0 05 fig 5b in the previous studies the performance of the estimation using different smc types has not been clearly discussed rmc as the ratio of vmc and field capacity fc is able to better represent the water supply condition of vegetation than vmc and gmc to some extent zhu et al 2013 however the estimation results using rmc had lower accuracy than vmc used fig 5b but no significant difference was found between vmc and gmc as described in the eqs 1 and 2 the differences between vmc and gmc and between vmc and rmc were attributed to bulk density bd and field capacity fc respectively for soil bulk density which was proved that can be well estimated using remote sensing data aitkenhead and coull 2020 used remote sensing data and a neural network model to map the distribution of soil bulk density over scotland and obtained a good result with r 2 of 0 79 therefore remote sensing technology have the potential to estimate gmc when it can well estimate vmc however for field capacity which is a complex soil index and may not be well estimated by using remote sensing data few studies reported related researches thus rmc is difficult to be directly monitored by remote sensing compared to vmc currently vmc generally is the optimal moisture types for rs based estimation 3 1 2 contributions of different input variables two types of variables multispectral ms indices extracted from visible and infrared bands and thermal tir indices extracted from thermal infrared bands were independently used and jointly used for smc estimation respectively to compare the difference of results as shown in fig 6 three types input variables two of indices single used and one of jointly used both showed the accuracy of smc estimation to some extent that the scatter points of modeled smc value vs in situ value approached to the 1 1 line for different soil layer depth the r 2 of ms and tir indices jointly used varied from 0 73 to 0 81 and rrmse varied from 8 74 to 11 35 regarding to the two sensors indices single used the r 2 varied from 0 69 to 0 73 and rrmse varied from 9 09 to 11 95 for ms indices used and the r 2 varied from 0 67 to 0 74 and rrmse varied from 9 39 to 12 34 for tir indices used in general ms and tir indices jointly used for smc estimation outperformed the two types indices single used and the difference reached significant level p 0 05 fig 7 as shown in previous studies temperature indices computed from thermal infrared data have become the most popular indices for estimating smc casamitjana et al 2020 ge et al 2019 lu et al 2020 multispectral data may prove to be complementary to thermal data for estimating smc for example temperature data from thermal imagery may be used to overcome the asymptotic saturation of multispectral data maimaitijiang et al 2017 2020 in case of single type of indices used the difference of smc estimation accuracy between ms indices and tir indices did not reached significant level p 0 05 fig 7 it is worth noting that tir indices performed better in shallow 10 20 cm smc estimation than that in deep smc estimation the r 2 of 10 cm deep smc was 0 74 and 20 cm deep smc was 0 75 and they were better than ms used in shallow layer as well in contrast ms performed better in deeper layer for example in 40 cm depth of soil layer the r 2 of ms used reached 0 73 which is higher than other depth of soil layers for tir indices which may estimate smc by measuring the surface temperature however they are not able to remotely sensed deeper layer i e under the canopy temperature gevaert et al 2018 miralles et al 2012 the vis derived from ms data can characterize the vegetation growth status to a certain extent so as to indirectly estimate smc for example the curl of maize leaf caused by drought can be detected by ms sensor so it can further estimate the degree of drought and smc chandel et al 2020 additionally vegetation growth is more related to the smc of vegetation root water uptake layer usually deeper akhtar et al 2019 dardanelli et al 2004 thus ms indices was more advantageous in estimating deep smc in general ms and tir jointly used had good results in both shallow and deep soil layer which showed r 2 more than 0 70 3 2 accuracy of estimates of soil moisture content as a function of soil depth in addition to investigating the smc estimation using different indices the performance of different depth soil layer moisture estimation was analyzed as well the correlation between the in situ smc of different depth soil layer was analyzed as shown in fig 8 in general the in situ smc correlation is poor between two soil layers far apart e g the r value correlation coefficient between the smc of 10 and 80 cm depth was only 0 33 which was not significant p 0 05 while the higher correlation of smc was found between the adjacent soil layers e g the r value between the smc of 10 and 20 cm depth reached 0 82 fig 8 and reached significant level p 0 05 which means the smc estimation accuracy was comparable in these two soil layer depth as shown in fig 6 as explained in section 3 1 2 the estimation of deeper soil layer smc e g 80 cm was indirectly characterized by vegetation growth status which is correlated to the root layer moisture akhtar et al 2019 fig 9 showed the smc accuracy varied with the soil layer depth in general the r 2 decreased with soil depth which means the accuracy was decreased the highest value was found in 20 cm depth soil layer smc estimation r 2 0 79 followed by 10 cm depth r 2 0 78 and the lowest value was found in 60 cm depth r 2 0 72 the lowest rrmse was found in 80 cm depth rrmse 9 09 and the highest value was found in 10 cm depth rrmse 12 55 be that as it may the proposed method still showed a good performance in deeper soil layer as reported in previous studies microwave remote sensing estimates smc through the observed backscattering coefficient which is different from the ms estimation due to the penetration of microwave soil moisture information at a certain depth can be observed dong et al 2020 however its penetration depth is relatively limited so the soil depth observed by microwave is also limited otosaka et al 2020 in general as suggested in this study estimating smc indirectly by using ms based method may had more potential in deeper soil layer moisture estimation 3 3 accuracy of estimates of soil moisture content in different vegetation types different vegetation types have various morphological characteristics vargas luna et al 2019 and various root layer depth cheng et al 2021 which may cause the accuracy difference in smc estimation however few studies have clearly discussed the difference of smc estimation in different vegetation types dong et al 2020 lu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 fig 10 showed the smc estimation accuracy difference among different vegetation types in the five soil layer depth in general the combination of rfr and ms tir data had the greatest results in grassland with the r 2 varied from 0 67 to 0 79 in different soil layer and rrmse varied from 6 97 to 8 92 from the comparison rrmse grassland showed the lowest value among the three vegetation types and reached significant level in all five soil layer depth p 0 05 cropland showed the highest rrmse and reached significant level p 0 05 in the soil layer depth from 10 cm to 60 cm compared to deep soil layer the smc estimation accuracy difference of various vegetation types in shallow soil layer is greater as shown in fig 10e g and i the difference of r2 among 40 60 and 80 cm depth were insignificant p 0 05 grassland generally has the relatively lower height than cropland and forest the soil surface temperature thus is close to grassland canopy temperature which may contributes to the better performance of smc estimation in grassland especially in shallow soil layer przeździecki and zawadzki 2020 zhang et al 2009 for deep soil layer the smc estimation mainly using vegetation growth status or the correlation among different soil layer to indirectly measure therefore the effect of vegetation height is relatively less rodriguez alvarez et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 from the fig 10a the r 2 of forest smc estimation was significantly lower than other vegetation types p 0 05 which may be caused by relatively high height of forest which affect the measuring of soil surface temperature by tir sensor while relatively poor performance higher rrmse value of smc estimation in cropland may be caused by the irrigation which increased the actual value of soil moisture moreover the non uniformity of irrigation amount in one pixel range will caused the error of in situ smc measuring yang et al 2020 3 4 comparison of smc estimation accuracy for different fraction of vegetation coverage as demonstrated in previous studies the fraction of vegetation coverage fvc has a strong correlation with soil moisture yang et al 2020 however the smc estimation accuracy in different fvc levels has not been compared and discussed as described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 rs based smc estimation method is indirectly characterized by using vegetation growth status which are affected by fvc generally the information of vis is limited when the fvc is low gao et al 2020 peng et al 2012 in this study the fvc of beijing was divided into four classifications as shown in table 3 song et al 2021 and further to analyze the smc estimation accuracy respectively in general the greatest performance of smc estimation was found in the fvc of range from 0 3 to 0 5 with average r 2 of 0 75 varied from 0 60 to 0 84 and rrmse of 11 38 varied from 8 91 to 15 78 followed by the fvc of range from 0 1 to 0 3 with average r 2 of 0 73 varied from 0 54 to 0 85 and rrmse of 12 46 varied from 9 86 to 16 98 it should be noted that tir performed better in low fvc range from 0 to 0 1 with r 2 more than 0 70 however the poor performance of tir was found in high fvc range from 0 1 to1 in contrast ms performed better in the high fvc in general ms data was proved to be complementary to tir data for estimating smc in high fvc area in the study of smc estimation jointly using ms and tir based indices the vegetation status including vis and canopy surface temperature were used to indirectly sense the information of smc it should be noted that under higher fvc most of the sensed information may come from canopy rather than soil moreover higher fvc may lead to optical sensor saturation hoffmann et al 2016 rischbeck et al 2016 and thereby produce smc estimates of relatively low accuracy note however that proposed method which is based rfr still produces high accuracy smc estimates even with excessive or insufficient fvc in conclusion rfr and rs based methods of smc estimation are reliable under various levels of fvc 4 conclusions in this study we investigate the combined use of ms and tir based remote sensing data as input for rfr algorithm to estimate regional smc in beijing the four main conclusions are as follows 1 the proposed method can accurately estimate regional smc in which volumetric moisture content is the most suitable smc types for rs based method estimation 2 the smc estimation performance of ms and tir based indices single used were comparable in which tir based indices performed better in shallow soil layer while ms based indices performed better in deep soil layer generally ms and tir based indices jointly used outperformed than the one sensor data single used with the r 2 varied from 0 73 to 0 81 and rrmse varied from 8 74 to 11 35 in various soil layer depth 3 the accuracy of the proposed method for estimating smc decreased with soil depth the highest value was found in 20 cm depth soil layer smc estimation r 2 0 79 followed by 10 cm depth r2 0 78 and the lowest value was found in 60 cm depth r 2 0 72 4 the proposed method performed greatest in grassland with relatively low height among the three vegetation types cropland forest and grassland especially for shallow soil layer moisture estimation moreover fvc has affected to the accuracy of the model to some extent in general the smc estimation in moderate vegetation coverage fvc ranged from 0 3 to 0 5 was best while tir data single used the accuracy in low vegetation coverage fvc less than 0 1 was best the results reported herein reflect the significant potential of rs based smc estimation when rfr are combined with multimodal data the smc estimation method proposed herein provides the foundation of an efficient approach for monitoring soil moisture regional drought and water resources management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9796,an accurate regional estimate of soil moisture content smc is important for water management and drought monitoring traditional ground measurement methods of smc are limited by the disadvantages of high cost and small scale the development of remote sensing rs technology provides a cost effective tool for estimating smc at regional scale however the estimation of smc by using the combination of multiple sensors has yet to be thoroughly discussed furthermore the way in which vegetation types fraction of vegetation coverage fvc and soil layer depth affect the smc estimation performance remains unclear therefore the objectives in this study are to 1 evaluate the smc estimation performance provided by landsat 8 data and random forest regression rfr algorithm 2 discuss the accuracy of rs based method for smc estimation at different soil layer depths and 3 explore how vegetation types and fvc affect the performance of smc estimation the results can be summarized as 1 the smc estimation performance of multispectral ms and thermal infrared tir based indices single used were comparable in which tir based indices performed better in shallow soil layer while ms based indices performed better in deep soil layer generally ms and tir based indices jointly used outperformed the index single used 2 the accuracy of the proposed method for estimating smc decreased with soil depth 3 the proposed method performed greatest in grassland with relatively low height among the three vegetation types moreover the smc estimation in moderate vegetation coverage fvc ranged from 0 3 to 0 5 was best these results indicate that rs based multimodal data combined with rfr could provide relatively repeatable and accurate smc estimation this approach can thus be used for the regional smc monitoring and water resources management graphical abstract ga1 keywords soil moisture content multimodality multispectral thermal infrared random forest 1 introduction soil moisture content smc is generally defined as the proportion of water stored in unsaturated soil smc is a crucial parameter of ecological environment seneviratne et al 2010 which provides information on the available water for vegetation growth needs luo et al 2019 smc is also a critical indicator for drought monitoring okin et al 2018 an accurate and cost effective smc estimation methods is of great significance in the field of ecology and agricultural research however several traditional smc ground measurement methods are limited in monitoring regional water resources for example gravimetric measurements involving weighing soil samples before and after drying robinson et al 2008 neutron measurements that use radioactive elements as neutron sources hollinger and isard 1994 and time domain reflectometry tdr which is an indirect measurement method that exploits the dependence of soil dielectric permittivity on smc robinson et al 2003 these methods generally employed for small scale monitoring with the disadvantage of high cost therefore a more efficient and scalable smc measurement method is highly desired to developed for smc monitoring at present remote sensing rs technology was developed for regional smc estimates with the advantages of high temporal and spatial resolutions blatchford et al 2019 the rs based smc estimation methods generally estimates smc by fitting the nonlinear or linear function between the remotely sensed data and in situ measured smc mulder et al 2011 these methods can be divided into three categories optical based thermal infrared based and microwave based the optical based methods generally estimate smc by using the spectral information of visible and near infrared bands which contain the reflectance data from surface that can reveal the vegetation properties as a function of smc serrano et al 2019 several vegetation indices vis such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the anomalous vegetation index avi and the vegetation condition index vci have been widely used for characterization of vegetation and further indirectly estimated smc kogan 1990 the thermal infrared based smc estimation methods proposed that land surface temperature is closely related to moisture therefore several temperature indices such as temperature condition index tci were developed to characterize smc by fitting function kogan 1995 but it should be noted satellite thermal infrared data can only reveal the surface temperature while can not measures the deeper soil layer temperature moreover satellite thermal infrared data is limited as well when dealing with vegetation with high coverage therefore several indices which combined the optical and thermal infrared information such as vegetation supply water index vswi toby et al 1994 and temperature vegetation drought index tvdi sandholt et al 2002 were proposed to estimate smc and showed better performance luo et al 2020 the combination of optical based vegetation status information and thermal infrared based vegetation temperature information has the potential to further improve the accuracy of smc estimation the microwave based methods has also been increasingly employed for smc estimation because microwaves can deeply penetrate into the soil so that this technique can probe the dielectric properties of the soil dong et al 2020 be that as it may these methods have the same problem with thermal infrared based smc estimation methods when dealing with the vegetation with high coverage because the microwave cannot penetrate the dense vegetation several smc data products have been generated via microwave remote sensing such as smos kerr et al 2010 amsr e karthikeyan et al 2019 and smap mao et al 2020 however this dataset is discontinuous and incomplete for dense vegetation coverage seneviratne et al 2010 currently there is no dataset or model can estimate deep smc with high resolution fitting the correlation function of remotely sensed data and in situ smc are the main means for remote sensing smc retrieval methods generally the correlation is nonlinear a situation that lends itself to the use of machine learning algorithms which are well suited for dealing with nonlinear heteroscedasticity problems and can be used for intelligent data processing and complete mining of data value jacinta and kerrie 2018 jin et al 2017 machine learning algorithms are already widely used to analyze remote sensing data with excellent results ge et al 2019 jin et al 2020 maimaitijiang et al 2020 random forest regression rfr is one of widely used ensemble machine learning algorithms which was proposed by breiman 2001 rfr performed great accuracy in dealing with nonlinear regression maimaitijiang et al 2020 ge et al 2019 used rfr algorithm to estimate the field scale smc in fukang city xinjiang uygur autonomous region china using unmanned aerial vehicle uav hyperspectral data and obtained good results with coefficient determination r 2 of 0 91 maimaitijiang et al 2020 used rfr algorithm to predict the field soybean yield in usa and obtained good results with 17 4 relative root mean square error rrmse and r 2 of 0 66 in general rfr algorithm has the potential for regional smc accurate estimation soil moisture affects the vegetation growth status to a certain extent therefore when the sensor regardless thermal infrared or microwave cannot detect the bottom of the canopy in the places with dense vegetation the soil moisture status can only be estimated indirectly through vegetation growth status temperature and spectral information although several studies have reported the rs based method to estimate regional scale smc luo et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 for example mohamed et al 2020 used sentinel 1 and landsat 7 data to estimate smc in the east of nile delta of egypt and obtained a good result with r 2 reached 0 83 but the study did not clearly discussed the effect of vegetation cover and soil depth han et al 2021 used weather and soil data and machine learning methods rather than remote sensing to explain the smc variation at different depth correlation coefficient was 0 90 0 98 which is similar to the idea of soil hydrodynamics however it requires detailed ground information such as soil and vegetation parameters which was not easy to obtain on a regional scale chauhan 1997 studied the effect of microwave remote sensing on soil moisture monitoring under vegetation cover but the penetration of microwave was limited the accuracy of microwave estimation of smc in the water absorbing layer of crop roots which is usually tens of centimeters or even deeper was also limited in this study we attempt to explore the estimation accuracy at different depth smc under various vegetation types and vegetation covers therefore the multiple optical based vis and infrared thermal based temperature indices were jointly used to estimate the smc of beijing city based on rfr algorithm the objectives of this study are to 1 compare the accuracy of smc estimates obtained from multimodal data analyzed by machine learning algorithm 2 explore how smc estimation varies with soil depth and 3 analyze how vegetation coverage and vegetation types affect the accuracy of smc estimates 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site is located in beijing city 115 7 117 4 e 39 4 41 6 n in north of china which

to eliminate the impact on smc estimation shen et al 2015 2 2 2 in situ soil moisture in this study the in situ soil moisture was measured and recorded by beijing soil moisture monitoring system bsmms which established by beijing water science and technology institute bwsti a total of 72 soil moisture monitoring stations of bsmms were set up in beijing the location of stations is shown in fig 1 each station was set up in the evenly distributed vegetation fig 2 the soil moisture monitoring instrument has five probes in different soil layer depth 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 80 cm and is powered by solar energy furthermore the monitored moisture data can be remotely transmitted to the bsmms and recorded the measured smc is volumetric moisture content vmc and in situ bulk density bd g cm3 and in situ field capacity in volumetric fc were used to convert vmc to gravimetric moisture content gmc and relative moisture content rmc respectively eqs 1 and 2 1 g m c v m c b d 2 r m c v m c f c 100 a total of 936 samples of in situ soil moisture measured by bsmms in the selected 13 days were collected for this study in which 494 samples were measured in cropland 247 samples were measured in forest land and 195 samples were measured in grassland 2 3 methods 2 3 1 regression model building random forest regression rfr algorithm which based on classification tree was employed for soil moisture estimation model building breiman 2001 currently rfr algorithm has been widely used for remote sensing model building and obtained excellent results rodriguez galiano et al 2012 samat et al 2015 the essence of rfr is to use a large set of regression trees to study the relationship between independent and dependent variables each tree represents a set of restrictions to decide the input to the output to model the relationship between remotely sensed indices and smc in this study given the set of training input output pairs i e remotely sensed indices smc the main flow of rfr algorithm is as follows belgiu and dragut 2016 1 randomly selecting subset with replacement from the original training set 2 using the subset to build the regression tree model 3 repeating the process 1 and 2 for m times the results of the m regression trees were averaged as the final result it should be noted that the number of regression trees m is an important parameter to influence the model performance here the optimal m was detected using the training set and determination coefficient r 2 that could best estimate the smc as shown in fig 3 the r 2 remained in a high level when the m reached 180 therefore m was set as 180 in this study moreover to ensure a fair and comprehensive evaluation of rfr methods with their given input variables we used 80 of the samples and in situ smc measurements selected at random for training the machine learning methods and the remaining 20 to determine the accuracy of the smc estimates produced by this method 2 3 2 input variables a total of 20 input variables were extracted from ls 8 data table 1 these variables can be divided into two categories multispectral ms indices extracted from visible and infrared bands and thermal tir indices extracted from thermal infrared bands fig 4 shows the overall workflow of the extraction of each index and model building with ls 8 data to compare the performance of the two sensors ms and tir and its combination the different indices were used for model input respectively i e only used ms or tir indices single used and used both the two sensors indices jointly used 2 3 3 anova test in order to compare the model performance under different conditions soil moisture types input variables soil depth and vegetation types a one way variance analysis anova p 0 05 was used to test the significant differences of the estimated smc under different conditions 2 4 validation a fivefold cross validation was used to verify the accuracy of the smc estimation algorithms additionally three evaluation metrics root mean square error rmse relative root mean square error rrmse and the adjusted coefficient of determination r 2 were computed to quantify the model performance these three evaluation metrics are calculated as follows jin et al 2020 3 r 2 1 1 i 1 n s m c m i s m c m 2 i 1 n s m c o b i s m c o b 2 n 1 n m 1 4 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s m c m i s m c o b i 2 5 r r m s e r m s e s m c o b 100 where smc m and smc obi are the estimated smc and in situ measured smc respectively n is the number of samples and m is the number of variables 2 5 tools used python version 3 7 google inc mountain view california usa and the scikit learn library version 0 23 0 google inc were used for smc estimation models building arcgis software version 10 4 esri inc redlands california usa and envi software version 5 3 esri inc were used to process raster data python and the spss software version 21 ibm inc armonk new york usa were used for numerical calculation and analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 modeling and validation of soil moisture content rfr algorithm was employed for regional smc estimation using ls 8 data the results are shown as table 2 in general the proposed method performed good results with r 2 varied from 0 67 to 0 81 and rrmse varied from 8 74 to 14 68 moreover the performance of different smc types vmc gmc and rmc and different input variables were analyzed in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 3 1 1 model performance in different soil moisture types fig 5 shows the performance of smc estimation using different moisture types vmc gmc and rmc from the comparison of r 2 the three types of smc showed the comparable value from 0 72 to 0 73 and the difference did not reach significant level p 0 05 fig 5a however the comparison of rrmse showed that using vmc for moisture estimation has the lowest rrmse value 10 41 and was significantly higher than the results using rmc p 0 05 fig 5b in the previous studies the performance of the estimation using different smc types has not been clearly discussed rmc as the ratio of vmc and field capacity fc is able to better represent the water supply condition of vegetation than vmc and gmc to some extent zhu et al 2013 however the estimation results using rmc had lower accuracy than vmc used fig 5b but no significant difference was found between vmc and gmc as described in the eqs 1 and 2 the differences between vmc and gmc and between vmc and rmc were attributed to bulk density bd and field capacity fc respectively for soil bulk density which was proved that can be well estimated using remote sensing data aitkenhead and coull 2020 used remote sensing data and a neural network model to map the distribution of soil bulk density over scotland and obtained a good result with r 2 of 0 79 therefore remote sensing technology have the potential to estimate gmc when it can well estimate vmc however for field capacity which is a complex soil index and may not be well estimated by using remote sensing data few studies reported related researches thus rmc is difficult to be directly monitored by remote sensing compared to vmc currently vmc generally is the optimal moisture types for rs based estimation 3 1 2 contributions of different input variables two types of variables multispectral ms indices extracted from visible and infrared bands and thermal tir indices extracted from thermal infrared bands were independently used and jointly used for smc estimation respectively to compare the difference of results as shown in fig 6 three types input variables two of indices single used and one of jointly used both showed the accuracy of smc estimation to some extent that the scatter points of modeled smc value vs in situ value approached to the 1 1 line for different soil layer depth the r 2 of ms and tir indices jointly used varied from 0 73 to 0 81 and rrmse varied from 8 74 to 11 35 regarding to the two sensors indices single used the r 2 varied from 0 69 to 0 73 and rrmse varied from 9 09 to 11 95 for ms indices used and the r 2 varied from 0 67 to 0 74 and rrmse varied from 9 39 to 12 34 for tir indices used in general ms and tir indices jointly used for smc estimation outperformed the two types indices single used and the difference reached significant level p 0 05 fig 7 as shown in previous studies temperature indices computed from thermal infrared data have become the most popular indices for estimating smc casamitjana et al 2020 ge et al 2019 lu et al 2020 multispectral data may prove to be complementary to thermal data for estimating smc for example temperature data from thermal imagery may be used to overcome the asymptotic saturation of multispectral data maimaitijiang et al 2017 2020 in case of single type of indices used the difference of smc estimation accuracy between ms indices and tir indices did not reached significant level p 0 05 fig 7 it is worth noting that tir indices performed better in shallow 10 20 cm smc estimation than that in deep smc estimation the r 2 of 10 cm deep smc was 0 74 and 20 cm deep smc was 0 75 and they were better than ms used in shallow layer as well in contrast ms performed better in deeper layer for example in 40 cm depth of soil layer the r 2 of ms used reached 0 73 which is higher than other depth of soil layers for tir indices which may estimate smc by measuring the surface temperature however they are not able to remotely sensed deeper layer i e under the canopy temperature gevaert et al 2018 miralles et al 2012 the vis derived from ms data can characterize the vegetation growth status to a certain extent so as to indirectly estimate smc for example the curl of maize leaf caused by drought can be detected by ms sensor so it can further estimate the degree of drought and smc chandel et al 2020 additionally vegetation growth is more related to the smc of vegetation root water uptake layer usually deeper akhtar et al 2019 dardanelli et al 2004 thus ms indices was more advantageous in estimating deep smc in general ms and tir jointly used had good results in both shallow and deep soil layer which showed r 2 more than 0 70 3 2 accuracy of estimates of soil moisture content as a function of soil depth in addition to investigating the smc estimation using different indices the performance of different depth soil layer moisture estimation was analyzed as well the correlation between the in situ smc of different depth soil layer was analyzed as shown in fig 8 in general the in situ smc correlation is poor between two soil layers far apart e g the r value correlation coefficient between the smc of 10 and 80 cm depth was only 0 33 which was not significant p 0 05 while the higher correlation of smc was found between the adjacent soil layers e g the r value between the smc of 10 and 20 cm depth reached 0 82 fig 8 and reached significant level p 0 05 which means the smc estimation accuracy was comparable in these two soil layer depth as shown in fig 6 as explained in section 3 1 2 the estimation of deeper soil layer smc e g 80 cm was indirectly characterized by vegetation growth status which is correlated to the root layer moisture akhtar et al 2019 fig 9 showed the smc accuracy varied with the soil layer depth in general the r 2 decreased with soil depth which means the accuracy was decreased the highest value was found in 20 cm depth soil layer smc estimation r 2 0 79 followed by 10 cm depth r 2 0 78 and the lowest value was found in 60 cm depth r 2 0 72 the lowest rrmse was found in 80 cm depth rrmse 9 09 and the highest value was found in 10 cm depth rrmse 12 55 be that as it may the proposed method still showed a good performance in deeper soil layer as reported in previous studies microwave remote sensing estimates smc through the observed backscattering coefficient which is different from the ms estimation due to the penetration of microwave soil moisture information at a certain depth can be observed dong et al 2020 however its penetration depth is relatively limited so the soil depth observed by microwave is also limited otosaka et al 2020 in general as suggested in this study estimating smc indirectly by using ms based method may had more potential in deeper soil layer moisture estimation 3 3 accuracy of estimates of soil moisture content in different vegetation types different vegetation types have various morphological characteristics vargas luna et al 2019 and various root layer depth cheng et al 2021 which may cause the accuracy difference in smc estimation however few studies have clearly discussed the difference of smc estimation in different vegetation types dong et al 2020 lu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 fig 10 showed the smc estimation accuracy difference among different vegetation types in the five soil layer depth in general the combination of rfr and ms tir data had the greatest results in grassland with the r 2 varied from 0 67 to 0 79 in different soil layer and rrmse varied from 6 97 to 8 92 from the comparison rrmse grassland showed the lowest value among the three vegetation types and reached significant level in all five soil layer depth p 0 05 cropland showed the highest rrmse and reached significant level p 0 05 in the soil layer depth from 10 cm to 60 cm compared to deep soil layer the smc estimation accuracy difference of various vegetation types in shallow soil layer is greater as shown in fig 10e g and i the difference of r2 among 40 60 and 80 cm depth were insignificant p 0 05 grassland generally has the relatively lower height than cropland and forest the soil surface temperature thus is close to grassland canopy temperature which may contributes to the better performance of smc estimation in grassland especially in shallow soil layer przeździecki and zawadzki 2020 zhang et al 2009 for deep soil layer the smc estimation mainly using vegetation growth status or the correlation among different soil layer to indirectly measure therefore the effect of vegetation height is relatively less rodriguez alvarez et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 from the fig 10a the r 2 of forest smc estimation was significantly lower than other vegetation types p 0 05 which may be caused by relatively high height of forest which affect the measuring of soil surface temperature by tir sensor while relatively poor performance higher rrmse value of smc estimation in cropland may be caused by the irrigation which increased the actual value of soil moisture moreover the non uniformity of irrigation amount in one pixel range will caused the error of in situ smc measuring yang et al 2020 3 4 comparison of smc estimation accuracy for different fraction of vegetation coverage as demonstrated in previous studies the fraction of vegetation coverage fvc has a strong correlation with soil moisture yang et al 2020 however the smc estimation accuracy in different fvc levels has not been compared and discussed as described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 rs based smc estimation method is indirectly characterized by using vegetation growth status which are affected by fvc generally the information of vis is limited when the fvc is low gao et al 2020 peng et al 2012 in this study the fvc of beijing was divided into four classifications as shown in table 3 song et al 2021 and further to analyze the smc estimation accuracy respectively in general the greatest performance of smc estimation was found in the fvc of range from 0 3 to 0 5 with average r 2 of 0 75 varied from 0 60 to 0 84 and rrmse of 11 38 varied from 8 91 to 15 78 followed by the fvc of range from 0 1 to 0 3 with average r 2 of 0 73 varied from 0 54 to 0 85 and rrmse of 12 46 varied from 9 86 to 16 98 it should be noted that tir performed better in low fvc range from 0 to 0 1 with r 2 more than 0 70 however the poor performance of tir was found in high fvc range from 0 1 to1 in contrast ms performed better in the high fvc in general ms data was proved to be complementary to tir data for estimating smc in high fvc area in the study of smc estimation jointly using ms and tir based indices the vegetation status including vis and canopy surface temperature were used to indirectly sense the information of smc it should be noted that under higher fvc most of the sensed information may come from canopy rather than soil moreover higher fvc may lead to optical sensor saturation hoffmann et al 2016 rischbeck et al 2016 and thereby produce smc estimates of relatively low accuracy note however that proposed method which is based rfr still produces high accuracy smc estimates even with excessive or insufficient fvc in conclusion rfr and rs based methods of smc estimation are reliable under various levels of fvc 4 conclusions in this study we investigate the combined use of ms and tir based remote sensing data as input for rfr algorithm to estimate regional smc in beijing the four main conclusions are as follows 1 the proposed method can accurately estimate regional smc in which volumetric moisture content is the most suitable smc types for rs based method estimation 2 the smc estimation performance of ms and tir based indices single used were comparable in which tir based indices performed better in shallow soil layer while ms based indices performed better in deep soil layer generally ms and tir based indices jointly used outperformed than the one sensor data single used with the r 2 varied from 0 73 to 0 81 and rrmse varied from 8 74 to 11 35 in various soil layer depth 3 the accuracy of the proposed method for estimating smc decreased with soil depth the highest value was found in 20 cm depth soil layer smc estimation r 2 0 79 followed by 10 cm depth r2 0 78 and the lowest value was found in 60 cm depth r 2 0 72 4 the proposed method performed greatest in grassland with relatively low height among the three vegetation types cropland forest and grassland especially for shallow soil layer moisture estimation moreover fvc has affected to the accuracy of the model to some extent in general the smc estimation in moderate vegetation coverage fvc ranged from 0 3 to 0 5 was best while tir data single used the accuracy in low vegetation coverage fvc less than 0 1 was best the results reported herein reflect the significant potential of rs based smc estimation when rfr are combined with multimodal data the smc estimation method

9797,greenhouse production of chilies requires constant irrigation and fertilization due to climate change water availability is decreasing and thus new techniques are being developed one of which is deficit irrigation also applied in controlled conditions such as greenhouse production this allows us to improve yield quality with minimal or no reduction in yield with optimal water use nitrogen is an important macronutrient whose uptake can be hindered under deficit irrigation because deficit is a form of drought stress in the pot experiment two chili cultivars were tested to see how they responded to water deficit irrigation treatments compared to the field capacity treatment with peat substrate nitrogen fertilization with the addition of the isotope 15n was applied to all treatments seeds and leaves contained the most total nitrogen in both cultivars followed by placenta n utilization from fertilization was 3 32 at field capacity and 2 33 under deficit irrigation in chili as rot naga morich utilized 4 58 of n from fertilizer under field capacity and 6 72 under deficit irrigation capsaicinoid content was strongly correlated with nitrogen content in both cultivars irrespective of irrigation regime this study fills an important gap in our understanding of n assimilation fertilization and irrigation in chili plants it shows that there is no universal rule for n absorption

stress translocation total nitrogen water management 1 introduction chilies are susceptible to environmental changes or stresses such as drought nutrient deficiency temperature or light stress gurung et al 2011 macias bobadilla et al 2020 pagamas and nawata 2008 for optimal growth they require higher temperatures 18 26 c which can only be achieved in the temperate zone in greenhouses abdel et al 2016 in greenhouse crop production there is a constant need for irrigation which leads to high water consumption 2 7 4 5 l per plant for chilies ahemd et al 2016 water shortage is becoming a serious problem in the last quarter of the century affecting many areas around the world kummu et al 2016 in line with the increasing water scarcity in certain areas many studies have been conducted to determine how to reduce and optimize water consumption kummu et al 2016 tundisi 2008 in agriculture one of the largest water consumers solutions could lie in deficit irrigation fereres and soriano 2006 studies have shown that deficit irrigation at the right intensity can improve the chemical quality of vegetables with minimal or no yield loss compared to optimally irrigated crops resulting in lower water consumption costa et al 2007 keabetswe et al 2019 deficit irrigation can be treated as low intensity drought stress kögler and söffker 2017 drought is the most important stressor in agriculture and can significantly reduce yield and quality macias bobadilla et al 2020 it also affects quality and studies have shown that low drought stress can improve fruit and vegetable quality

isotopes 15n we can track n transport and accumulation in plants from source to sink soong et al 2014 we can also determine n fertilizer utilization and other parameters such as the percentage of isotope 15n from fertilizer in the plant ndff n in the plant n yield how much n comes from the plant from fertilizer fertilizer n yield fao iaea 2001 in our study we tested two chili cultivars capsicum annuum l var chili as rot and capsicum chinense jacq var naga morich under two irrigation regimes the first was at field capacity of peat substrate and the second was deficit irrigation using the stable isotope 15n we were able to determine in detail how the n was distributed in the plant among roots leaves stems and fruits under normal irrigation and deficit irrigation we also investigated whether there is a relationship between the accumulation of n in the placenta seeds or pericarp of fruits and their capsaicinoid content since capsaicinoids contain n in their molecule this study answers several questions about the translocation of n and the use of n fertilizer in chilies under drought stress with the use of the isotope 15n which has rarely been detected in chili plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design in kamnik slovenia 46 13 33 88 n 14 36 39 e a randomized pot experiment was conducted with two chili cultivars the first cultivar was the less hot

conforti et al 2007 fruits of each cultivar were harvested when they reached cultivar specific color rot in both cases were firm to the touch and had a glossy appearance all fruits were divided into pericarp placenta and seeds for all analyses each plant was divided into leaves stems and roots from each plant 3 5 fruits were sampled each plant represented one repetition for fruit parts roots leaf

weighed into 5 8 mm tin capsules sercon the n isotope composition was determined using the europa 20 20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled to the anca sl preparation module for solid and liquid samples sercon ltd crewe u k and the results are reported as atom of 15n all samples were analyzed in triplicate and the results were accepted if their standard deviation 1σ was less than 0 05 at if

peat substrate and 197 44 mm water at deficit irrigation the average soil water content and soil water tension under field capacity irrigation were 23 5 and 23 9 kpa respectively and 12 3 and 51 2 kpa respectively under deficit irrigation the cultivar naga morich received less water through irrigation than the cultivar chili as rot with 332 3 mm under field capacity irrigation and 163 4 mm under

deficit irrigation had higher total n contents in placenta leaves and stems with an increase of 0 17 0 58 and 0 45 respectively consequently the whole plant of cultivar naga morich under deficit irrigation had 0 54 higher total n content 15n isotope content was higher in all three fruit parts stems and whole plant of chili as rot under field capacity the difference in the whole plant was 0 05 similar to chili as rot cultivar naga morich also showed higher isotopic contents under field capacity but only in roots and whole plant with increase of 0 144 and 0 066 respectively using fraction of fertilizer n in the plant ndff we calculated the percentage of isotope 15n from fertilizer in the plant in the cultivar chili as rot the percentage of fertilizer ranged from 8 41 in the pericarp and 20 36 in the leaves at field capacity irrigation to 6 72 in the pericarp and 20 42 in the leaves at deficit irrigation all the three fruit parts contained more isotope 15n from fertilizer in field capacity irrigation than deficit irrigation similar results also occurred in stems and whole plant the whole plant of cultivar chili as rot contained 2 73 less 15n from fertilizer under deficit irrigation than under field capacity in the cultivar naga morich the 15n fertilizer content in the roots ranged from 7 25 to 20 12 in the seeds under field capacity and in the leaves from 3 59 to 18 76 under deficit irrigation the seeds and roots absorbed more isotopes from the fertilizer under field capacity and the leaves absorbed more under deficit irrigation the whole plant of naga morich took up 1 36 more 15n from fertilizer under field capacity irrigation than the plants under deficit irrigation n yield mg plant tells us how much n was in the crop in the deficit irrigated cultivar chili as rot all three fruit parts and leaves contained more n than in the field capacity treatment however the stems contained 34 3 more n than the deficit irrigated treatment the whole plant of chili as rot contained 9 54 mg more n per plant mainly due to higher contents in the stems similar to chili as rot cultivar naga morich also had higher n contents in all three fruit parts and leaves compared to field capacity treatment the stems in field capacity had 3 1 times higher n yield than the deficit irrigated plants the whole plant of naga morich under deficit irrigation had 145 80 mg higher n yield per plant than field capacity irrigated plants the n yield from fertilizer was used to calculate how much of the n yield was from fertilizer the cultivar chili as rot under field capacity treatment received from 2 23 mg n plant in placenta to 49 30 mg n plant in stems from fertilizer the deficit irrigated plants received from fertilizer 2 17 mg n plant in placenta to 25 58 mg n plant in stems there were statistical differences among the different parts of the plant in seeds and stems of chili as rot compared to the deficit irrigated plants with an increase of 5 92 mg and 23 72 mg n per plant for seeds and stems respectively in cultivar chili as rot the field capacity irrigated plants received an average of 7 90 mg more n from fertilizer than the deficit irrigated plants in cultivar naga morich deficit irrigated plants received higher n yield from fertilizer in all three fruit parts and leaves in contrast field capacity irrigated plants had 1 9 times and 3 times n yield from the fertilizer in roots and stems respectively in the whole plant the deficit irrigated cultivar naga morich received 17 08 mg per plant more n yield from the fertilizer than the field capacity treatment the percentage of fertilizer used in the plant is shown in table 2 the stems and seeds of the cultivar chili as rot irrigated at field capacity consumed more n from fertilizer than those under deficit irrigation in contrast the roots of the deficit irrigated plants consumed 0 55 more n from the fertilizer than the field capacity plants as a whole plant the cultivar chili as rot used 0 99 more n from the fertilizer under field capacity irrigation on the other hand naga morich used 2 14 more n under deficit irrigation than under field capacity all three fruit parts and leaves used more n from fertilizer than under field capacity stems and roots under field capacity used more n compared to deficit irrigated with 3 67 and 1 94 respectively 3 3 capsaicinoid contents the individual and total capsaicinoid contents for both cultivars are shown in table 3 in both cultivars the placenta contained the most capsaicinoids followed by the pericarp and seeds with the lowest contents in the pericarp of chili as rot capsaicin nordihydrocapsaicin and homodihydrocapsaicin were 0 08 g kg dw 0 02 g kg dw and 0 03 g kg dw respectively higher in the field capacity treatment than in the deficit treatment consequently total capsaicinoids in the pericarp were also higher in the field capacity treatment at 0 21 g kg dw in the placenta of chili as rot capsaicin content was higher by 3 50 g kg dw in field capacity treatment and dihydrocapsaicin content was higher by 0 60 g kg dw compared to deficit irrigated plants total capsaicinoid content in placenta of chili as rot was higher by 4 09 g kg dw in field capacity compared to deficit treatment similar to pericarp and placenta seeds also contained more capsaicin under field capacity irrigation the homocapsaicin content in the seeds of chili as rot was higher by 0 07 g kg dw under field capacity the seeds contained 0 44 g kg dw more total capsaicinoids under field capacity than deficit irrigation the cultivar naga morich responded differently to deficit irrigation pericarp under field capacity and deficit irrigation showed no differences in capsaicinoid content placenta under deficit irrigation showed 6 59 g kg dw and 1 49 g kg dw higher capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin content compared to placenta under field capacity treatment total capsaicinoid content in placenta of deficit irrigated cultivar naga morich was higher by 6 64 g kg dw compared to field capacity irrigated plants seeds of cultivar naga morich similar to placenta also showed higher total capsaicinoid contents with an increase of 5 96 g kg dw under deficit irrigation of the five capsaicinoids identified only nordihydrocapsaicin showed no differences between the two treatments 3 4 correlation of capsaicinoid content and n content in fruits a correlation test was performed to see if there was a relationship between the total n content in the fruit of each cultivar and its capsaicinoid content table 4 there was a strong correlation between capsaicinoids and total n content in fruits of stressed and field capacity treated plants of chili as rot the stressed plants had a correlation of 99 2 p 0 001 and the field capacity irrigated plants 96 9 p 0 002 the cultivar naga morich had a strong correlation between total n content and total capsaicinoid content in fruits the correlation was 94 7 p 0 012 in deficit irrigated plants and 97 3 p 0 003 in field capacity treated plants 3 5 pca analysis pca analysis was conducted to see how different plant parts cultivars and irrigation treatments affected n accumulation and uptake we concentrated on the nitrogen uptake since it was highly related to capsaicin the detailed data for correlation factors and each principal component are presented in supp tables 1 and 2 in the first pca analysis fig 2a of the cultivar chili as rot a we observed that the treatments formed four groups the first group which contained both foliar and seed treatments had high values for total n although the utilization of n from fertilizer was less effective the second group contained both placental treatments which contained less total n than the first group n utilization in the second group was less effective than in all other groups the third group contained the least amount of total n n utilization n yield and fertilizer n yield were better in this group than the first and second groups the fourth group consisted of field ready stems of chili as rot with high fertilizer utilization and fertilizer n yield it is also observed that the field capacity stem had much better fertilizer n uptake than the stressed stem of chili as rot in the second pca analysis fig 2b of the cultivar naga morich we observed the formation of three groups the first group consisted of stressed leaves that had a large fertilizer utilization and n yield from fertilizer the second group contained both treatments placenta field fit leaves both pericarp and seed treatments this group contained all plant parts and treatments that had average or low n utilization they also had low n yield although they contained a decent amount of total n the third group contained both stem and root treatments they contained low levels of total n they had an average n yield 4 discussion in both cultivars leaves had the highest total n content followed by seeds or placenta depending on the cultivar seeds are an important n sink during the reproductive phase tegeder and masclaux daubresse 2018 which would explain higher n contents in seeds and placenta during growth on the other hand roots leaves and stems are strong n sinks and since our plants were harvested at the end of the growing season this would explain why n levels in vegetative parts were not as high as they could have been especially in roots and stems ross elliott et al 2017 n can be transported in plants in organic or inorganic forms chen et al 2020 organic n remobilization is stimulated by nutrient deficit n related macromolecules are broken down into amino acids peptides and ureides which are then translocated by various transporters to n demanding organs tegeder and masclaux daubresse 2018 through the xylem inorganic n such as nitrate is remobilized from roots to stems and further to leaves fruits etc transpiration the intensity of which is correlated with the size and number of leaves causes transport through the xylem n is directly incorporated into four amino acids glutamate glutamine aspartate and asparagine and then transported through the plant from source to sink buchanan et al 2015 younger leaves have lower transpiration and thus a lower rate of transport through the xylem to meet the demand of younger leaves two low affinity nitrate transporters nrt1 11 gene atnpf1 2 and nrt1 12 gene atnpf1 1 are activated to transport nitrate from the xylem to the phloem the münch hypothesis knoblauch and peters 2010 states that the transport of carbohydrates from the source to the sink tissues requires sieve cells soluble substances such as sugars increase or decrease as needed the osmotic potential at which water flows into or out of cells in the source tissues water flows into the cells and in the sink tissues water flows out of the cells due to osmosis as the osmotic potential is lowered water flows into the surrounding cells reducing the hydrostatic pressure in the sieve cells sevanto 2014 the rate of solute transport through the phloem depends on the strength of the sink and the source water can be drawn from the xylem to the phloem by osmosis so these two systems are closely linked sevanto 2014 drought or deficit irrigation increases water tension in the xylem which means that in order to build up a higher osmotic potential the plant needs to pull water from the xylem into the phloem the need for a higher osmotic potential requires a strong source under dry conditions hölttä et al 2009 in our case we observed two different occurrences of total n content in the two cultivars the first cultivar chili as rot contained more n on the whole plant under field capacity irrigation treatment and less under deficit on the other hand the cultivar naga morich contained more n in the whole plant under deficit irrigation compared to the field capacity irrigation from the results of total n content we can speculate that the sharper cultivar naga morich has a better mechanism to resist water deficit under deficit irrigation the water tension in the xylem increased so the plant required a higher osmotic potential in our case the plants under deficit irrigation had smaller leaves due to poorer n translocation resulting in even lower xylem and phloem flux and consequently even lower n contents in different parts of the plant as evidenced by the n content of leaves and roots of chili as rot under deficit irrigation saud et al 2017 the fluid in both transport tissues is also more viscous due to water loss which reduces the flow rate lewis 1984 in chili as rot we observed higher total n content in all three fruit parts in deficit irrigated plants since fruits are essential for plant survival the plant may translocate nutrients such as n to other plant parts important for survival such as seeds masclaux daubresse et al 2010 when the seeds start to mature the demand for n is high so the plants remobilize n from other plant parts to the seeds which explains why the seeds in chili as rot had one of the highest n contents among all fruit parts masclaux et al 2001 with lower transport through xylem and phloem fertilizer uptake is affected because plants have less water available and are more bound to the soil or in our case to the peat substrate zamljen et al 2020 this lack of water was evident in both calculations of the percentage of isotope 15n from fertilizer in the plant ndff both deficit treatments regardless of cultivar had lower isotope 15n levels obtained from fertilizer or in other words isotope uptake from fertilizer was better under the field capacity irrigation treatments n yield mg plant was higher in all three fruit parts and leaves under the chili as rot irrigation type on the other hand the stems contained more n under field capacity based on n yield translocation in plants under deficit irrigation can be observed both cultivars translocate n from the stems to the fruits and leaves which can be confirmed in the treatments with field capacity where the stems contained 1 5 3 times more n than those with deficit irrigation the fertilizer derived n in the plants was accumulated in higher amounts in the roots of chili as rot irrigated under deficit irrigation showing that the transport of n from fertilizer to other plant parts was less effective in the deficit irrigated plants of chili as rot on the other hand cultivar naga morich transported n from fertilizer better from roots and stems to fruits and leaves than field irrigated calculations of fertilizer n utilization showed that roots of chili as rot were more efficient than roots under field irrigation stems and seeds utilized higher percentage of n from fertilizer under field capacity irrigation in the case of naga morich n utilization of fertilizer under deficit irrigation was better when the whole plant was considered using pca analysis it was found that despite high total n contents in leaves and seeds of chili as rot under both irrigation treatments n fertilizer utilization was less effective in these two parts of the plant on the other hand stems of chili as rot contained high n contents from fertilizer a possible n source for this tissue could be the peat substrate containing inorganic n released during decomposition kalbitz and geyer 2002 similar in naga morich cultivar the deficit irrigated leafs contained high n content derived from the fertilizer plants in these treatments could concentrate the n from fertilizer to stems or leafs depending on the water availability and cultivar anjana and iqbal 2007 the n utilization from fertilizer did vary among plant parts but when calculating to the entire plant the utilization was low for all treatments with naga morich having the highest whole plant utilization of 6 72 similar results of low nitrogen utilization from fertilizer were also reported by zhou et al 2005 in c frutescens which indicates that pepper plants have a low nitrogen utilization from fertilizers zhou et al 2005 also reported that the most fertilizer around 35 was found in the first 30 cm of the soil which would explain why our n fertilizer utilization was poor in observing the two cultivars we have found great differences chili as red responded to deficit irrigation with lower n levels resulting in lower n parameters consequently capsaicinoid content was lower under deficit irrigation on the other hand the hotter cultivar naga morich responded inversely to deficit irrigation with better nitrogen utilization under stress there are several reasons why the differences occur between cultivars and species the biggest is genotype certain cultivars are better able to handle drought because they have genes that are activated to reduce the impact on the plant clark 1983 differences in root size also occurred between the two cultivars under both deficit irrigation and field irrigation with different root areas the uptake of nitrogen was different and thus the shoot to root ratio varied between cultivars franco et al 2011 in addition the cultivars had different leaf shapes and leaf sizes which could influence nutrient uptake from the substrate as previously reported by wendling et al 2016 using correlation analysis we confirmed that there is a strong correlation between the total n in the fruits of chilies and their capsaicinoid content with the stressed plants of chili as rot having a correlation of 99 2 p 0 001 and the field capacity irrigated plants 96 9 p 0 002 and the cultivar naga morich 94 7 p 0 012 in deficit irrigated plants and 97 3 p 0 003 in field capacity treated plants with this result we can conclude that n fertilization can increase capsaicinoid content in chili plants similar reports to ours are from johnson and decoteau 1996 and medina lara et al 2008 where n fertilization in sufficient dosage increased capsaicinoid content n is an important factor in the biosynthesis of capsaicinoids uarrota et al 2021 capsaicin as one of the most important capsaicinoids contains n in its molecule zamljen et al 2021 two main amino acids valine and phenylalanine are required for the synthesis of capsaicin aza gonzález et al 2011 the glutamate biosynthesis pathway gs gogat pathway is an important pathway for n assimilation the transfer of the amine from glutamate to 2 oxo precursors of serine aspartate alanine valine leucine isoleucine phenylalanine and tyrosine is catalyzed by transaminases walker and van der donk 2016 in other words the n from glutamate is a building block of valine and phenylalanine which are then incorporated into other metabolic pathways such as capsaicin synthesis we could say that n from glutamate is a part of capsaicin biosynthesis and the molecule itself higher n availability from fertilizer could increase glutamate transport from source to sink although water deficit could decrease glutamate content which was previously reported by guo et al 2018 and would explain why the cultivar chili as rot in deficit had lower n fertilizer and consequently lower capsaicinoid content in fruits naga morich might have better glutamate synthase gogat and glutamine synthase gs activity under drought stress which would explain better n fertilizer utilization and hence higher capsaicinoid contents buchanan et al 2015 5 conclusion using deficit irrigation and 15n isotope assays we observed n transport in two chili cultivars our study highlighted a novelty in n transport in chili as we examined roots stems leaves and three different fruit parts both cultivars responded differently to n fertilization with the cultivar chili as rot having lower n fertilizer utilization under deficit irrigation than under field capacity irrigation while naga morich had better n fertilizer utilization under deficit irrigation we could confirm that deficit irrigation has a significant effect on n utilization and that this effect is cultivar specific which means that deficit irrigation dose not affect each cultivar and species in the same way with the use of stable n isotope and water management studies with secondary metabolism studies showed a strong correlation between n available water and capsaicinoids our study allowed us to better understand how roots which act as a source and transport to sinks such as fruits take up n from fertilizers leaves etc under different water availability treatments and how the n is incorporated into the capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway the results of this study fill an important gap in our understanding of n assimilation fertilization and irrigation in chili plants which could generate further studies to improve plant n use and better irrigation regimes that would optimize water and fertilizer use by chili plants we have shown that cultivar and species strongly influence n uptake under stress conditions leading to the conclusion that there is no general rule for n uptake under different irrigation treatments in chilies and that the correct choice of cultivar and species is crucial for an optimal and high quality chili fruit product credit authorship contribution statement t z experimental process writing

9797,greenhouse production of chilies requires constant irrigation and fertilization due to climate change water availability is decreasing and thus new techniques are being developed one of which is deficit irrigation also applied in controlled conditions such as greenhouse production this allows us to improve yield quality with minimal or no reduction in yield with optimal water use nitrogen is an important macronutrient whose uptake can be hindered under deficit irrigation because deficit is a form of drought stress in the pot experiment two chili cultivars were tested to see how they responded to water deficit irrigation treatments compared to the field capacity treatment with peat substrate nitrogen fertilization with the addition of the isotope 15n was applied to all treatments seeds and leaves contained the most total nitrogen in both cultivars followed by placenta n utilization from fertilization was 3 32 at field capacity and 2 33 under deficit irrigation in chili as rot naga morich utilized 4 58 of n from fertilizer under field capacity and 6 72 under deficit irrigation capsaicinoid content was strongly correlated with nitrogen content in both cultivars irrespective of irrigation regime this study fills an important gap in our understanding of n assimilation fertilization and irrigation in chili plants it shows that there is no universal rule for n absorption

stress translocation total nitrogen water management 1 introduction chilies are susceptible to environmental changes or stresses such as drought nutrient deficiency temperature or light stress gurung et al 2011 macias bobadilla et al 2020 pagamas and nawata 2008 for optimal growth they require higher temperatures 18 26 c which can only be achieved in the temperate zone in greenhouses abdel et al 2016 in greenhouse crop production there is a constant need for irrigation which leads to high water consumption 2 7 4 5 l per plant for chilies ahemd et al 2016 water shortage is becoming a serious problem in the last quarter of the century affecting many areas around the world kummu et al 2016 in line with the increasing water scarcity in certain areas many studies have been conducted to determine how to reduce and optimize water consumption kummu et al 2016 tundisi 2008 in agriculture one of the largest water consumers solutions could lie in deficit irrigation fereres and soriano 2006 studies have shown that deficit irrigation at the right intensity can improve the chemical quality of vegetables with minimal or no yield loss compared to optimally irrigated crops resulting in lower water consumption costa et al 2007 keabetswe et al 2019 deficit irrigation can be treated as low intensity drought stress kögler and söffker 2017 drought is the most important stressor in agriculture and can significantly reduce yield and quality macias bobadilla et al 2020 it also affects quality and studies have shown that low drought stress can improve fruit and vegetable quality

major sinks in plants during vegetative growth are leaves and stems and during the reproductive phase seeds become an important sink tegeder and masclaux daubresse 2018 using non radioactive nitrogen isotopes 15n we can track n transport and accumulation in plants from source to sink soong et al 2014 we can also determine n fertilizer utilization and other parameters such as the percentage of isotope 15n from fertilizer in the plant ndff n in the plant n yield how much n comes from the plant from fertilizer fertilizer n yield fao iaea 2001 in our study we tested two chili cultivars capsicum annuum l var chili as rot and capsicum chinense jacq var naga morich under two irrigation regimes the first was at field capacity of peat substrate and the second was deficit irrigation using the stable isotope 15n we were able to determine in detail how the n was distributed in the plant among roots leaves stems and fruits under normal irrigation and deficit irrigation we also investigated whether there is a relationship between the accumulation of n in the placenta seeds or pericarp of fruits and their capsaicinoid content since capsaicinoids contain n in their molecule this study answers several questions about the translocation of n and the use of n fertilizer in chilies under drought stress with the use of the isotope 15n which has rarely been detected in chili plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design in kamnik slovenia 46 13 33 88 n 14 36 39 e a randomized pot experiment was conducted with two chili cultivars the first cultivar was the less hot

irrigation from 50 to 60 kpa each treatment was equipped with a jet fill tensiometer soilmoisture equipment santa barbara us and with a t5 pressure transducer tensiometer metergroup soil volumetric water content was measured using the theta probe delta t uk placed at the center of the root system soil tension was measured daily irrigation was initiated when soil water tension fell below the indicated values fertilization was applied with a water soluble fertilizer containing macro and microelements poly feed 16 8 32 fertilization began when the first fruits formed and was applied four times during the experiment each plant regardless of treatment received 200 mg l 200 ppm of nitrogen of the fertilizer with each fertilization 100 mg l p and 400 mg l k with the addition of the

conforti et al 2007 fruits of each cultivar were harvested when they reached cultivar specific color rot in both cases were firm to the touch and had a glossy appearance all fruits were divided into pericarp placenta and seeds for all analyses each plant was divided into leaves stems and roots from each plant 3 5 fruits were sampled each plant represented one repetition for fruit parts roots leaf

anova was performed using r program team 2008 between deficit irrigated and field capacity irrigated plants of chili as rot and naga morich where anova results showed statistical differences a multiple comparison test tukey s test was performed at a significance level of α 0 05 pearson s test for correlation α 0 05 between total n content and total capsaicinoid content in fruits was performed to show a relationship between these two factors and whether irrigation treatment affected the result in addition multivariate analysis pca was used to determine which treatment and fruit

variance detailed data about correlations from factors is presented in supp tables 1 and 2 whole plant data table 2 were calculated according to each fruit part pericarp placenta seeds and plant part roots leaf s stems share in the whole plant 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation data irrigation data are presented in table 1 the cultivar chili as rot received 396 3 mm water at field capacity of peat substrate and 197 44 mm water at deficit irrigation the average soil water content and soil water tension under field capacity irrigation were 23 5 and 23 9 kpa respectively and 12 3 and 51 2 kpa respectively under deficit irrigation the cultivar naga morich received less water through irrigation than the cultivar chili as rot with 332 3 mm under field capacity irrigation and 163 4 mm under deficit irrigation the average soil water content and soil water tension for cultivar naga morich irrigated with field capacity were 31 3 and 21 1 kpa respectively and 16 8 and 52 5 kpa respectively under deficit irrigation 3 2 n accumulation in chili plant n accumulation in both chili cultivars under deficit irrigation was studied using the isotope 15n data on total n content isotope 15n content ndff n yield mg plant fertilizer n yield mg plant and fertilizer n utilization are presented in table 2 for better illustration total n data for each plant part are shown in fig 1 total n content was higher in deficit irrigated fruit parts of cultivar chili as rot on the other hand field capacity irrigated plants of chili as rot had higher n contents in leaves and roots 0 22 and 0 19 respectively compared to deficit irrigated plants when calculated on the whole plant the cultivar chili as rot showed 0 06 higher total n content in field irrigated plants the cultivar naga morich subjected to deficit irrigation had higher total n contents in placenta leaves and stems with an increase of 0 17 0 58 and 0 45 respectively consequently the whole plant of cultivar naga morich under deficit irrigation had 0 54 higher total n content 15n isotope content was higher in all three fruit parts stems and whole plant of chili as rot under field capacity the difference in the whole plant was 0 05 similar to chili as rot cultivar naga morich also showed higher isotopic contents under field capacity but only in roots and whole plant with increase of 0 144 and 0 066 respectively using fraction of fertilizer n in the plant ndff we calculated the percentage of isotope 15n from fertilizer in the plant in the cultivar chili as rot the percentage of fertilizer ranged from 8 41 in the pericarp and 20 36 in the leaves at field capacity irrigation to 6 72 in the pericarp and 20 42 in the leaves at deficit irrigation all the three fruit parts contained more isotope 15n from fertilizer in field capacity irrigation than deficit irrigation similar results also occurred in stems and whole plant the whole plant of cultivar chili as rot contained 2 73 less 15n from fertilizer under deficit irrigation than under field capacity in the cultivar naga morich the 15n fertilizer content in the roots ranged from 7 25 to 20 12 in the seeds under field capacity and in the leaves from 3 59 to 18 76 under deficit irrigation the seeds and roots absorbed more isotopes from the fertilizer under field capacity and the leaves absorbed more under deficit irrigation the whole plant of naga morich took up 1 36 more 15n from fertilizer under field capacity irrigation than the plants under deficit irrigation n yield mg plant tells us how much n was in the crop in the deficit irrigated cultivar chili as rot all three fruit parts and leaves contained more n than in the field capacity treatment however the stems contained 34 3 more n than the deficit irrigated treatment the whole plant of chili as rot contained 9 54 mg more n per plant mainly due to higher contents in the stems similar to chili as rot cultivar naga morich also had higher n contents in all three fruit parts and leaves compared to field capacity treatment the stems in field capacity had 3 1 times higher n yield than the deficit irrigated plants the whole plant of naga morich under deficit irrigation had 145 80 mg higher n yield per plant than field capacity irrigated plants the n yield from fertilizer was used to calculate how much of the n yield was from fertilizer the cultivar chili as rot under field capacity treatment received from 2 23 mg n plant in placenta to 49 30 mg n plant in stems from fertilizer the deficit irrigated plants received from fertilizer 2 17 mg n plant in placenta to 25 58 mg n plant in stems there were statistical differences among the different parts of the plant in seeds and stems of chili as rot compared to the deficit irrigated plants with an increase of 5 92 mg and 23 72 mg n per plant for seeds and stems respectively in cultivar chili as rot the field capacity irrigated plants received an average of 7 90 mg more n from fertilizer than the deficit irrigated plants in cultivar naga morich deficit irrigated plants received higher n yield from fertilizer in all three fruit parts and leaves in contrast field capacity irrigated plants had 1 9 times and 3 times n yield from the fertilizer in roots and stems respectively in the whole plant the deficit irrigated cultivar naga morich received 17 08 mg per plant more n yield from the fertilizer than the field capacity treatment the percentage of fertilizer used in the plant is shown in table 2 the stems and seeds of the cultivar chili as rot irrigated at field capacity consumed more n from fertilizer than those under deficit irrigation in contrast the roots of the deficit irrigated plants consumed 0 55 more n from the fertilizer than the field capacity plants as a whole plant the cultivar chili as rot used 0 99 more n from the fertilizer under field capacity irrigation on the other hand naga morich used 2 14 more n under deficit irrigation than under field capacity all three fruit parts and leaves used more n from fertilizer than under field capacity stems and roots under field capacity used more n compared to deficit irrigated with 3 67 and 1 94 respectively 3 3 capsaicinoid contents the individual and total capsaicinoid contents for both cultivars are shown in table 3 in both cultivars the placenta contained the most capsaicinoids followed by the pericarp and seeds with the lowest contents in the pericarp of chili as rot capsaicin nordihydrocapsaicin and homodihydrocapsaicin were 0 08 g kg dw 0 02 g kg dw and 0 03 g kg dw respectively higher in the field capacity treatment than in the deficit treatment consequently total capsaicinoids in the pericarp were also higher in the field capacity treatment at 0 21 g kg dw in the placenta of chili as rot capsaicin content was higher by 3 50 g kg dw in field capacity treatment and dihydrocapsaicin content was higher by 0 60 g kg dw compared to deficit irrigated plants total capsaicinoid content in placenta of chili as rot was higher by 4 09 g kg dw in field capacity compared to deficit treatment similar to pericarp and placenta seeds also contained more capsaicin under field capacity irrigation the homocapsaicin content in the seeds of chili as rot was higher by 0 07 g kg dw under field capacity the seeds contained 0 44 g kg dw more total capsaicinoids under field capacity than deficit irrigation the cultivar naga morich responded differently to deficit irrigation pericarp under field capacity and deficit irrigation showed no differences in capsaicinoid content placenta under deficit irrigation showed 6 59 g kg dw and 1 49 g kg dw higher capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin content compared to placenta under field capacity treatment total capsaicinoid content in placenta of deficit irrigated cultivar naga morich was higher by 6 64 g kg dw compared to field capacity irrigated plants seeds of cultivar naga morich similar to placenta also showed higher total capsaicinoid contents with an increase of 5 96 g kg dw under deficit irrigation of the five capsaicinoids identified only nordihydrocapsaicin showed no differences between the two treatments 3 4 correlation of capsaicinoid content and n content in fruits a correlation test was performed to see if there was a relationship between the total n content in the fruit of each cultivar and its capsaicinoid content table 4 there was a strong correlation between capsaicinoids and total n content in fruits of stressed and field capacity treated plants of chili as rot the stressed plants had a correlation of 99 2 p 0 001 and the field capacity irrigated plants 96 9 p 0 002 the cultivar naga morich had a strong correlation between total n content and total capsaicinoid content in fruits the correlation was 94 7 p 0 012 in deficit irrigated plants and 97 3 p 0 003 in field capacity treated plants 3 5 pca analysis pca analysis was conducted to see how different plant parts cultivars and irrigation treatments affected n accumulation and uptake we concentrated on the nitrogen uptake since it was highly related to capsaicin the detailed data for correlation factors and each principal component are presented in supp tables 1 and 2 in the first pca analysis fig 2a of the cultivar chili as rot a we observed that the treatments formed four groups the first group which contained both foliar and seed treatments had high values for total n although the utilization of n from fertilizer was less effective the second group contained both placental treatments which contained less total n than the first group n utilization in the second group was less effective than in all other groups the third group contained the least amount of total n n utilization n yield and fertilizer n yield were better in this group than the first and second groups the fourth group consisted of field ready stems of chili as rot with high fertilizer utilization and fertilizer n yield it is also observed that the field capacity stem had much better fertilizer n uptake than the stressed stem of chili as rot in the second pca analysis fig 2b of the cultivar naga morich we observed the formation of three groups the first group consisted of stressed leaves that had a large fertilizer utilization and n yield from fertilizer the second group contained both treatments placenta field fit leaves both pericarp and seed treatments this group contained all plant parts and treatments that had average or low n utilization they also had low n yield although they contained a decent amount of total n the third group contained both stem and root treatments they contained low levels of total n they had an average n yield 4 discussion in both cultivars leaves had the highest total n content followed by seeds or placenta depending on the cultivar seeds are an important n sink during the reproductive phase tegeder and masclaux daubresse 2018 which would explain higher n contents in seeds and placenta during growth on the other hand roots leaves and stems are strong n sinks and since our plants were harvested at the end of the growing season this would explain why n levels in vegetative parts were not as high as they could have been especially in roots and stems ross elliott et al 2017 n can be transported in plants in organic or inorganic forms chen et al 2020 organic n remobilization is stimulated by nutrient deficit n related macromolecules are broken down into amino acids peptides and ureides which are then translocated by various transporters to n demanding organs tegeder and masclaux daubresse 2018 through the xylem inorganic n such as nitrate is remobilized from roots to stems and further to leaves fruits etc transpiration the intensity of which is correlated with the size and number of leaves causes transport through the xylem n is directly incorporated into four amino acids glutamate glutamine aspartate and asparagine and then transported through the plant from source to sink buchanan et al 2015 younger leaves have lower transpiration and thus a lower rate of transport through the xylem to meet the demand of younger leaves two low affinity nitrate transporters nrt1 11 gene atnpf1 2 and nrt1 12 gene atnpf1 1 are activated to transport nitrate from the xylem to the phloem the münch hypothesis knoblauch and peters 2010 states that the transport of carbohydrates from the source to the sink tissues requires sieve cells soluble substances such as sugars increase or decrease as needed the osmotic potential at which water flows into or out of cells in the source tissues water flows into the cells and in the sink tissues water flows out of the cells due to osmosis as the osmotic potential is lowered water flows into the surrounding cells reducing the hydrostatic pressure in the sieve cells sevanto 2014 the rate of solute transport through the phloem depends on the strength of the sink and the source water can be drawn from the xylem to the phloem by osmosis so these two systems are closely linked sevanto 2014 drought or deficit irrigation increases water tension in the xylem which means that in order to build up a higher osmotic potential the plant needs to pull water from the xylem into the phloem the need for a higher osmotic potential requires a strong source under dry conditions hölttä et al 2009 in our case we observed two different occurrences of total n content in the two cultivars the first cultivar chili as rot contained more n on the whole plant under field capacity irrigation treatment and less under deficit on the other hand the cultivar naga morich contained more n in the whole plant under deficit irrigation compared to the field capacity irrigation from the results of total n content we can speculate that the sharper cultivar naga morich has a better mechanism to resist water deficit under deficit irrigation the water tension in the xylem increased so the plant required a higher osmotic potential in our case the plants under deficit irrigation had smaller leaves due to poorer n translocation resulting in even lower xylem and phloem flux and consequently even lower n contents in different parts of the plant as evidenced by the n content of leaves and roots of chili as rot under deficit irrigation saud et al 2017 the fluid in both transport tissues is also more viscous due to water loss which reduces the flow rate lewis 1984 in chili as rot we observed higher total n content in all three fruit parts in deficit irrigated plants since fruits are essential for plant survival the plant may translocate nutrients such as n to other plant parts important for survival such as seeds masclaux daubresse et al 2010 when the seeds start to mature the demand for n is high so the plants remobilize n from other plant parts to the seeds which explains why the seeds in chili as rot had one of the highest n contents among all fruit parts masclaux et al 2001 with lower transport through xylem and phloem fertilizer uptake is affected because plants have less water available and are more bound to the soil or in our case to the peat substrate zamljen et al 2020 this lack of water was evident in both calculations of the percentage of isotope 15n from fertilizer in the plant ndff both deficit treatments regardless of cultivar had lower isotope 15n levels obtained from fertilizer or in other words isotope uptake from fertilizer was better under the field capacity irrigation treatments n yield mg plant was higher in all three fruit parts and leaves under the chili as rot irrigation type on the other hand the stems contained more n under field capacity based on n yield translocation in plants under deficit irrigation can be observed both cultivars translocate n from the stems to the fruits and leaves which can be confirmed in the treatments with field capacity where the stems contained 1 5 3 times more n than those with deficit irrigation the fertilizer derived n in the plants was accumulated in higher amounts in the roots of chili as rot irrigated under deficit irrigation showing that the transport of n from fertilizer to other plant parts was less effective in the deficit irrigated plants of chili as rot on the other hand cultivar naga morich transported n from fertilizer better from roots and stems to fruits and leaves than field irrigated calculations of fertilizer n utilization showed that roots of chili as rot were more efficient than roots under field irrigation stems and seeds utilized higher percentage of n from fertilizer under field capacity irrigation in the case of naga morich n utilization of fertilizer under deficit irrigation was better when the whole plant was considered using pca analysis it was found that despite high total n contents in leaves and seeds of chili as rot under both irrigation treatments n fertilizer utilization was less effective in these two parts of the plant on the other hand stems of chili as rot contained high n contents from fertilizer a possible n source for this tissue could be the peat substrate containing inorganic n released during decomposition kalbitz and geyer 2002 similar in naga morich cultivar the deficit irrigated leafs contained high n content derived from the fertilizer plants in these treatments could concentrate the n from fertilizer to stems or leafs depending on the water availability and cultivar anjana and iqbal 2007 the n utilization from fertilizer did vary among plant parts but when calculating to the entire plant the utilization was low for all treatments with naga morich having the highest whole plant utilization of 6 72 similar results of low nitrogen utilization from fertilizer were also reported by zhou et al 2005 in c frutescens which indicates that pepper plants have a low nitrogen utilization from fertilizers zhou et al 2005 also reported that the most fertilizer around 35 was found in the first 30 cm of the soil which would explain why our n fertilizer utilization was poor in observing the two cultivars we have found great differences chili as red responded to deficit irrigation with lower n levels resulting in lower n parameters consequently capsaicinoid content was lower under deficit irrigation on the other hand the hotter cultivar naga morich responded inversely to deficit irrigation with better nitrogen utilization under stress there are several reasons why the differences occur between cultivars and species the biggest is genotype certain cultivars are better able to handle drought because they have genes that are activated to reduce the impact on the plant clark 1983 differences in root size also occurred between the two cultivars under both deficit irrigation and field irrigation with different root areas the uptake of nitrogen was different and thus the shoot to root ratio varied between cultivars franco et al 2011 in addition the cultivars had different leaf shapes and leaf sizes which could influence nutrient uptake from the substrate as previously reported by wendling et al 2016 using correlation analysis we confirmed that there is a strong correlation between the total n in the fruits of chilies and their capsaicinoid content with the stressed plants of chili as rot having a correlation of 99 2 p 0 001 and the field capacity irrigated plants 96 9 p 0 002 and the cultivar naga morich 94 7 p 0 012 in deficit irrigated plants and 97 3 p 0 003 in field capacity treated plants with this result we can conclude that n fertilization can increase capsaicinoid content in chili plants similar reports to ours are from johnson and decoteau 1996 and medina lara et al 2008 where n fertilization in sufficient dosage increased capsaicinoid content n is an important factor in the biosynthesis of capsaicinoids uarrota et al 2021 capsaicin as one of the most important capsaicinoids contains n in its molecule zamljen et al 2021 two main amino acids valine and phenylalanine are required for the synthesis of capsaicin aza gonzález et al 2011 the glutamate biosynthesis pathway gs gogat pathway is an important pathway for n assimilation the transfer of the amine from glutamate to 2 oxo precursors of serine aspartate alanine valine leucine isoleucine phenylalanine and tyrosine is catalyzed by transaminases walker and van der donk 2016 in other words the n from glutamate is a building block of valine and phenylalanine which are then incorporated into other metabolic pathways such as capsaicin synthesis we could say that n from glutamate is a part of capsaicin biosynthesis and the molecule itself higher n availability from fertilizer could increase glutamate transport from source to sink although water deficit could decrease glutamate content which was previously reported by guo et al 2018 and would explain why the cultivar chili as rot in deficit had lower n fertilizer and consequently lower capsaicinoid content in fruits naga morich might have better glutamate synthase gogat and glutamine synthase gs activity under drought stress which would explain better n fertilizer utilization and hence higher capsaicinoid contents buchanan et al 2015 5 conclusion using deficit irrigation and 15n isotope assays we observed n transport in two chili cultivars our study highlighted a novelty in n transport in chili as we examined roots stems leaves and three different fruit parts both cultivars responded differently to n fertilization with the cultivar chili as rot having lower n fertilizer utilization under deficit irrigation than under field capacity irrigation while naga morich had better n fertilizer utilization under deficit irrigation we could confirm that deficit irrigation has a significant effect on n utilization and that this effect is cultivar specific which means that deficit irrigation dose not affect each cultivar and species in the same way with the use of stable n isotope and water management studies with secondary metabolism studies showed a strong correlation between n available water and capsaicinoids our study allowed us to better understand how roots which act as a source and transport to sinks such as fruits take up n from fertilizers leaves etc under different water availability treatments and how the n is incorporated into the capsaicinoid biosynthetic pathway the results of this study fill an important gap in our understanding of n assimilation fertilization and irrigation in chili plants which could generate further studies to improve plant n use and better irrigation regimes that would optimize water and fertilizer use by chili plants we have shown that cultivar and species strongly influence n uptake under stress conditions leading to the conclusion that there is no general rule for n uptake under different irrigation treatments in chilies and that the correct choice of cultivar and species is crucial for an optimal and high quality chili fruit product credit authorship contribution statement t z experimental process writing

9798,subsurface drainage systems have been widely used to help manage soil salinization worldwide however designing a subsurface drainage system requires predictions of regional groundwater and salt dynamics while these dynamics can be obtained using modflow s drain package drn this package requires that the drain conductance be specified which is difficult to determine for subsurface drainage systems with different layout parameters including the pipe spacing depth and radius in this study a new subsurface drainage sdr package based on the hooghoudt equation was developed within the modflow lgr mt3d framework to simulate the effects of subsurface drainage pipes on groundwater flow and salt dynamics the accuracy and applicability of sdr were tested by a synthetic case a published indoor experiment and two field experiments comparison with indoor experimental data shows that the rrmse of cumulative drainage volume was 5 08 and the rrmse of groundwater table depth was 3 69 the simulation results of outdoor experiment show that the rrmse of drainage volumes of a single pipe ranged from 3 14 to 4 69 and the relative errors of cumulative drainage volumes were below 6 and the relative errors of drainage discharge were 3 1 16 3 the results demonstrate that sdr can accurately simulate leaching water and solute transport under transient flow conditions the model was then applied to the yonglian irrigation area of inner mongolia china for subsurface drainage system design and 3 different layout schemes of subsurface drainage systems were presented the total salt discharge increased by 38 54 after the application of the subsurface drainage system 36 45 of which was discharged by subsurface drainage pipes this study provides a pilot example for regional subsurface drainage system design keywords subsurface drainage package hooghoudt equation soil salinity groundwater and salt modelling modflow lgr mt3d 1 introduction soil salinization is a major cause of soil degradation and seriously affects agricultural productivity throughout the world shokri kuehni et al 2020 singh 2010 subsurface drainage is an effective tool in many agricultural areas to help manage soil salinization by lowering the groundwater table to drain excess soil salt dissolved in leaching water chávez et al 2015 when designing a subsurface drainage system its layout parameters e g pipe spacing depth and radius are of vital importance for achieving effective drainage nangia et al 2010 rodgers et al 2003 which are directly impacted by regional hydrological conditions consequently the long term distribution of the regional groundwater and salt concentration under the usage of subsurface drainage should be precisely predicted ritzema et al 2008 numerical modelling is typically used to tackle the above problem early numerical models employed for the design of subsurface drainage systems were limited to one dimensional simulations e g swatren macro drainmod wave swap preflo feddes et al 1978 jarvis 1994 skaggs 1978 vanclooster et al 1994 van dam et al 1997 workman and skaggs 1990 in contrast over the last decade two and three dimensional models have been used to simulate groundwater flow and salt transport within subsurface drainage networks with spatially variable climate geological and soil conditions some examples include hydrus šimůnek et al 2018 and drainflow shokri and bardsley 2016 which are based on the multi dimensional richards equation of variably saturated flow and can be used only for field scale simulations because their implementations are complex at regional scales additionally some watershed models e g mhydas drain tiemeyer et al 2007 hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 and swat arnold et al 1998 have been improved or modified to describe hydrological processes under subsurface drainage conditions furthermore the semi conceptual catchment scale model mhydas was integrated with the hooghoudt equation to account for matrix drainage discharge in lowland areas tiemeyer et al 2007 rozemeijer et al 2010 used hydrogeosphere to simulate subsurface drainage conditions and represented the subsurface drains in the model as equivalent medium high conductivity layers du et al 2005 modified the original swat model by integrating an empirical equation to represent the drainage flux once they are well calibrated the abovementioned models can be used to estimate the performance of existing subsurface drainage systems but the use of these models is limitedly when designing the drainage pipe layout parameters because the calibrated parameters would change as the layout parameters changed alternatively modflow harbaugh 2005 is a three dimensional groundwater model commonly used in regional scale simulations that contains many subroutine packages to deal with the different features of hydrologic systems and solve various surface water groundwater problems previous studies usually simulated the spatial interactions between aquifers and drains with the drn package ghorbani et al 2016 hollanders et al 2005 mirlas 2012 rossi et al 2014 simpson et al 2011 the drainage flux is calculated by multiplying the drain conductance by the difference between the aquifer head and drain elevation harbaugh 2005 however the drain conductance depends not only on the layout of drainage pipes and hydrogeological characteristics conditions but also on the characteristics of the groundwater flow converging into the drainage pipes and no specific formula has been developed to calculate this lumped parameter a common practice is to estimate the drain conductance by model calibration based on field measured drainage discharge or related state variables pohll and guitjens 1994 the calibrated drain conductance values of subsurface drainage pipes were calculated as 55 234 m2 d by goswami and kalita 2009 and 1 2 m2 d by mirlas 2009 indicating that the drain conductance can vary by several orders of magnitude fio and deverel 1991 further evaluated the sensitivity of groundwater flow to different values of drain conductance as the drain conductance value increased from 0 14 m2 d to 0 44 m2 d the drainage capacity increased by nearly three times indicating that the drain conductance has substantial impacts on the simulation results the calibrated drain conductance should be adjusted according to changes in the layout parameters for predictions under different subsurface drainage pipe design schemes however the current drn module cannot implement this approach rodriguez et al 2008 then it cannot be used for subsurface drainage pipe layout parameters design therefore a new package that can quantitatively simulate the drainage water and salt discharge under the impact of different subsurface drainage layout parameters is needed the objective of this study is to develop a new package namely the subsurface drainage sdr package within the modflow framework to replace drn for subsurface drainage simulation sdr uses the hooghoudt equation hooghoudt 1940 to simulate the subsurface drainage system and does not require using the parameter of the drain conductance to improve the computational efficiency the sdr package is further developed to be coupled with modflow lgr mehl and hill 2013 for regional scale modelling the size of a modflow block typically varies from tens to hundreds of meters maheswaran et al 2016 welsh and doherty 2005 but a significantly finer spatial discretization is needed to accurately simulate the influences of drainage pipes goswami and kalita 2009 in this context modflow lgr allows users to create a modflow grid with a fine discretization near drainage pipes but a coarse discretization elsewhere to achieve a balance between the computational efficiency and accuracy in regional scale modelling then the flow simulation results of modflow sdr lgr can be used directly by mt3d to simulate salt transport ultimately leading to new software modflow sdr lgr mt3d 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the modflow groundwater flow model 2 1 1 governing equation modflow numerically solves the three dimensional groundwater flow

conceptual model of the hooghoudt equation used in this study to develop the new sdr package the hooghoudt equation is based on the assumption that the recharge to groundwater is uniform and steady and equals the discharge through the drainage system this assumption is relaxed to assume steady state groundwater flow for each time step but transient flow from one time step to the subsequent time

enters drainage pipes with the groundwater flow as a sink term in mt3d the structure of the sdr package is given in the supplementary material 2 3 model evaluation and application cases three test cases were conducted to evaluate the accuracy and limitations of the sdr package case 1 was a synthetic case with two purposes one purpose was to test the accuracy of the sdr package by comparing the simulation results with those obtained by drainmod the model most widely used to simulate subsurface drainage problems the second purpose was to illustrate the advantages and limitations of the sdr package compared to the traditional drn package in addition an indoor subsurface drainage experiment case 2 and two field subsurface drainage experiments case 3 were implemented to evaluate the performance of sdr in calculating the drainage discharge under real drainage conditions by comparing the simulation results with published experimental data furthermore a real world application was described case 4 to design the subsurface drainage system in a regional agricultural area with no drainage pipes and to estimate the effects of subsurface drainage systems on the groundwater and salt dynamics the results and discussion are presented in section 4 the mean absolute error mae and relative root mean square error rrmse were used to evaluate the model performance 18 m a e 1 m i 1 m y s

and the longitudinal dispersivity was 0 01 m two parallel drainage pipes were buried in the soil profile and the layout parameters are listed in table 1 the initial head was at the same elevation as the drainage pipes the initial groundwater salt concentration was 1 kg m3 the recharge rate was 1 016 10 3 m d and the salt concentration in the recharge water was 0 the drainage eventually reached a steady state in the case of uniform recharge and the discharge through the drainage system was equal to the rate of recharge the groundwater table under steady state conditions between the two drainage pipes is computed as follows based on the hooghoudt equation 20 y 1 k q d l x q d x 2 d e 2 d d e 8 d e h m 4 h m 2 l 2 l x x 2 d e 2 d d e where x is the distance from the pipe l and y is the height of the groundwater table at x l the developed model modflow sdr mt3d was used to simulate the groundwater table depth drainage discharge and salt discharge rate the simulation results under transient conditions were compared with those from drainmod and the groundwater table under steady state conditions was also compared with the result calculated by eq 20 as the analytical solution additionally the modflow model with the drn package was similarly used to simulate the groundwater table depth drainage discharge and salt discharge rate under various c d levels to compare the results with those of the sdr package the simulation period was 500 d 2 5 case 2 indoor subsurface drainage experiment case 2 was implemented to test the performance of the sdr package under transient drainage conditions the experiment was carried out in a tank with a volume of 0 7125 m3 1 5 m 0 5 m 0 95 m chen et al 2020 the layout parameters of the subsurface drainage pipe and soil properties are shown in table 1 the leaching test began at 8 00 a m on november 4 2018 and the total amount of leaching water was 19 2 cm the drainage began at 11 57 a m and lasted 76 h with a total drainage water volume of 68 m3 the initial groundwater table depth was 0 7 m evaporation was ignored because the experiment was carried out indoors and the duration was short the observed cumulative drainage volume and groundwater table depth were used for comparison with the simulation results in this case there were 7500 discretized grids used by the developed model 2 6 case 3 field subsurface drainage experiment two published field experiments were used to test the sdr package under field observed drainage conditions denoted a and b field experiment a was conducted by chen 2020 in xinjiang china on november 23 2018 the geographic location and photos of field experiment a are shown in fig 2 a and b there were three experimental plots with a uniform drainage pipe spacing of 6 m and different drainage pipe depths in the range of 0 8 1 4 m as shown in fig 2 c the layout parameters of the subsurface drainage system and soil properties are listed in table 1 the leaching lasted 5 d with a total of 47 5 cm of leaching water the drainage began on november 25 and lasted 16 18 d the effective amount of leaching water was 26 9 cm in plot a1 29 5 cm in plot a2 and 19 4 cm in plot a3 due to the different initial soil water contents the initial groundwater table depth was 1 91 m the average evaporation rate was 1 52 10 3 m d the observed cumulative drainage volume of a single pipe was used for comparison with the simulation results there were 1350 discretized grids used by the developed model for the simulation field experiment b was conducted by zhang et al 2012 in tianjin china on june 1 2010 there were three experimental plots with a uniform drainage pipe depth of 1 2 m and different drainage pipe spacings between 3 m and 9 m as shown in fig 2 c the layout parameters of the subsurface drainage system and soil properties are listed in table 1 leaching lasted 9 d 15 d and 21 d in plots b1 b2 and b3 respectively and the total amount of leaching water in each plot was 30 2 cm the drainage discharge at the stabilization stage was observed and used for comparison with the simulation results the initial groundwater table depth in this case was 1 8 m and the spatial discretization grids were 1440 2 7 case 4 real world application for designing regional subsurface drainage systems the new package was applied to investigate the effects of designing subsurface drainage systems on the regional groundwater and salt dynamics in a practical agricultural district fig 3 a shows the location of the study site the yonglian irrigation area 40 45 57 41 17 58 n 107 37 19 108 51 04 e in inner mongolia china the whole domain area is 29 75 km2 with a north south length of 13 60 km and an east west width of 3 93 km the ground surface elevation decreases from 1028 11 m in the southwest to 1025 67 m in the northeast the average annual evaporation is 2200 mm but the average precipitation is only 170 mm wang et al 2019 and the average groundwater table depth is 1 47 m the strong evaporation and the shallow groundwater table result in serious salt accumulation within the soil the agricultural drainage network in this area relies on ditches however the lack of terminal ditches leads to a poor drainage capacity in the field therefore subsurface drainage could be used as an alternative scheme to alleviate the problems of poor drainage and soil salinization in this area the aquifer of the study area can be divided into two layers the top layer is composed of mixed sand and clay and is less permeable with an average thickness of 14 66 m while the bottom layer is sandy and more permeable with an average thickness of 40 m the daily precipitation and evaporation during 2004 2009 were obtained from the wuyuan weather station evaporation was measured using a 20 cm evaporation pan e pan the monthly precipitation e pan and total volume of water diverted for the yonglian irrigation area during 2004 2009 are shown in fig 3 b the groundwater table depths were observed from 12 observation wells in the yonglian irrigation area every 5 d from 2004 to 2009 and the groundwater salt concentration was observed every 10 d from may to november during the period of 2007 2009 the groundwater flow and salt transport parameters were calibrated and validated with the current observation data the salt concentration in the root zone is the most important factor impacting the agricultural sustainability mao et al 2017 therefore the design criterion of the subsurface drainage system is to decrease the accumulation of salt in the vadose zone in the study area the annual salt mass balance in the year with a normal precipitation level without subsurface drainage is shown in fig 4 the salt masses in the aquifers and the vadose zone were 516 104 kg and 53 104 kg respectively three subsurface drainage system layout schemes with 40 drainage pipes were established n2 n4 and n8 in fig 5 to determine the impact of the subsurface drainage system s location on the regional groundwater and salt dynamics the pipe spacing and depth were 100 m and 2 m respectively referring to previous subsurface drainage experiments in this area wang et al 1993 the subsurface drainage systems were deployed in areas with relatively shallow groundwater table depths and high groundwater salt concentrations to observe better effects of salt discharge the scenario without a subsurface drainage system was marked as n0 for comparison the layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipes and the soil properties information of the three scenarios n2 n4 and n8 are listed in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison with the analytical method and drainmod the modflow sdr mt3d simulation results of case 1 were compared with those of the analytical method and drainmod the steady state drainage discharge simulated by modflow sdr mt3d and drainmod are both the same as the recharge rate at 1 016 10 3 m d the steady state groundwater table depth calculated by eq 20 and simulated by modflow sdr mt3d are plotted in fig 6 a with an rrmse of 0 3 fig 6 b and c show the changes in the groundwater table depth at the midpoint between the two pipes and the drainage discharge simulated by modflow sdr mt3d and drainmod the drainage process is consistent with the change in the groundwater table depth and reaches a steady state after approximately 200 d in contrast the transient drainage discharge simulated by drainmod is smaller than that simulated by modflow sdr mt3d this is because the two models require different soil property parameters for the calculation e g soil water characteristics for drainmod and the specific yield and specific storage for modflow sdr mt3d which are difficult to totally unify even for the same soil these differences in the simulation behaviours of the two models before reaching the plateau can influence the estimation of the drainage flux and groundwater dynamics around the subsurface drainage pipes consequently the drainage process and groundwater table reach a steady state earlier when simulated with modflow sdr mt3d than when simulated with drainmod the steady state groundwater table depths at the midpoint between the two pipes simulated by modflow sdr mt3d and drainmod are 13 451 m and 13 448 m respectively and the relative errors of both are no more than 0 03 of the analytical result in addition the salt concentration in the leaching water exhibits a decreasing trend due to continuous drainage as shown in fig 6 d and the simulation results of the two models are close however the drainmod simulated salt concentration fluctuation slightly in the initial stage of drainage because drainmod solves the 1 d advection dispersion equation by adopting a mass balance approach which is significantly impacted by the depth for the average salinity in contrast mt3d solves the 3 d advection dispersion equation based on a finite difference approximation the difference in the salt concentration causes the deviation of the salt discharge rate simulated by the two models as shown in fig 6 e the variation trend of the salt discharge rate simulated by drainmod is similar to that of the drainage discharge the salt discharge rate decreases after the drainage process reaches a steady state because of the decrease in the salt concentration in the leaching water the total salt discharge simulated by the two models is shown in fig 6 f with an rrmse of 14 6 the computational times are 0 2 s for drainmod and 356 s for modflow sdr mt3d the computational time of the latter is much longer than that of the former because drainmod is a quasi 2 d model based on the water mass balance method whereas modflow sdr mt3d is a 3 d physically based numerical model nevertheless although drainmod is computationally efficient it cannot simulate the regional groundwater and salt dynamic characteristics because it can calculate the groundwater table only at the midpoint between two drainage pipes in conclusion the performance of modflow sdr mt3d is satisfactory 3 2 comparison with experimental data the simulation results of the cumulative drainage volume and groundwater table depth during the indoor experiment in case 2 are shown in fig 7 a and fig 7 b respectively the mae of the cumulative drainage volume is 1 77 m3 and the rrmse is 5 08 the simulated total volume of drainage water is 66 6 m3 which is 1 4 m3 less than that observed in the indoor experiment the groundwater table rises rapidly at the beginning of drainage and then drops slowly which is consistent with the experimental results the mae of the groundwater table depth is 0 009 m and the rrmse is 3 69 fig 7 c e compare the observed and simulated drainage volumes of a single pipe in the three plots of field experiment a in case 3 the mae is 0 72 0 97 m3 and the rrmse ranges from 3 14 to 4 69 the simulated cumulative drainage volumes of the single pipes in the three plots are 37 54 m3 40 77 m3 and 29 63 m3 and the relative errors are 1 08 4 08 and 5 29 respectively fig 7 f shows the simulation results of the drainage discharge in field experiment b in case 3 the drainage discharge first increases becomes stable and then decreases rapidly after the leaching stops zhang et al 2012 measured the average drainage discharge of the three plots at the stable stage of drainage the measured average drainage discharge were 19 89 m3 d in plot b1 24 55 m3 d in plot b2 and 42 96 m3 d in plot b3 as shown in fig 7 f the simulated drainage discharge at the stable stage are 20 50 m3 d 28 55 m3 d and 48 14 m3 d and the relative errors of 3 1 16 3 and 12 1 respectively compared with the measured values the comparison between the simulation results and experimental data shows that the sdr package performs well under transient drainage conditions 3 3 advantages and limitations of the sdr package to illustrate the applicability of the new package in subsurface drainage simulations with modflow the simulation results obtained in case 1 with sdr were compared with those simulated by drn with different values of c d the steady state groundwater table depths simulated by sdr and drn with different values of c d as well as the analytical results are shown in fig 8 a the sdr simulated groundwater table depth is relatively close to the analytical result with an increase in c d from 0 2 to 10 m2 d the drn simulated groundwater table depth decreases and approaches the analytical result fig 8 b and fig 8 c show the changes in the groundwater table depth at the midpoint between the two pipes and the drainage discharge indicating that the drainage process reaches a steady state earlier as c d increases furthermore fig 8 d shows that the difference in the salt concentration of the leaching water simulated by sdr and drn with different values of c d can be considered negligible therefore the differences in the salt discharge rate and total salt discharge from the two packages are quite small as shown in fig 8 e and fig 8 f fig 8 illustrates that a larger c d gives results closer to those of sdr moreover the c d value has a considerable impact on the simulation when using the drn package for subsurface drainage modelling however the value of c d is difficult to determine since there is no specific formula to calculate it in contrast the sdr package can simulate subsurface drainage systems with variable layout parameters once the hydraulic conductivity is calibrated although the sdr package exhibits sufficient computational accuracy as shown above its limitations should also be considered at each time step the sdr package is run to calculate the drainage flux with the current hydraulic head and iterations are required between the sdr package and the modflow model in the calculation thus the time step has an impact on the simulation results especially when the groundwater table depth changes sharply fig 9 shows the simulated groundwater table depths during the indoor subsurface drainage experiment in case 2 the rrmse ranges between 3 56 and 3 74 when the time step is smaller than 2 h nevertheless the simulation results worsen with an increase in the time step and the simulated rise in the groundwater table depth displays a lag hence users must choose an appropriate time step according to the actual situation 3 4 calibration and validation results of a real world application 3 4 1 groundwater flow modelling results the simulated and observed spatially averaged groundwater table depths during the calibration 2004 2007 and validation 2008 2009 periods are shown in fig 10 the variation trend of the simulated groundwater table depths is consistent with the trend of the observed values the simulated depths in different observation wells varied substantially with the mae ranging between 0 258 m and 0 658 m and the rrmse fluctuating between 23 93 and 58 76 the mae values of the groundwater table depth averaged over the whole domain were 0 296 m and 0 462 m during the calibration and validation periods respectively and the corresponding rrmse values were 24 36 and 40 93 the annual average volume of recharge from irrigation and precipitation to the aquifer was 380 32 104 m3 in the calibration period and 397 64 104 m3 in the validation period the annual average lateral leakage from the zaohuo trunk canal to groundwater ranged from 96 104 m3 to 98 104 m3 which accounted for nearly 20 of the total inflow the annual average amount of phreatic evaporation from the groundwater was 404 23 104 m3 in the calibration period and 434 06 104 m3 in the validation period making phreatic evaporation the largest outflow of the aquifer the annual average discharge to drainage ditches was 71 52 104 m3 and 74 30 104 m3 in the calibration and validation periods respectively the corresponding changes in storage were 0 73 104 m3 and 12 31 104 m3 and the relative water mass balance errors were 0 02 and 0 04 in the calibration and validation periods respectively next the flow model parameters were calibrated including the hydrogeological parameters recharge coefficient and drain conductance of the drainage ditches the calibrated specific yields were 0 029 in the top two loam layers and 0 04 in the third silt loam layer according to the soil type and previous studies yu 2017 zhao 2011 the specific storage was set uniformly as 9 10 5 m 1 the calibrated recharge coefficients are shown in table 3 the recharge coefficient of precipitation was 0 15 in contrast the recharge coefficients of irrigation water changed monthly considering the various growing stages of crops and the amount of irrigation in the early growing period from mid may to late june the recharge coefficient was larger due to the reduced water consumption of plants whereas in the late growing period early july to mid september the crops grew vigorously and consumed a large amount of water which resulted in less recharge to groundwater large amount of autumn irrigation led to a lager recharge coefficient in october and november yang 2016 the annual average discharge to drainage ditches was 71 52 104 m3 and 74 30 104 m3 in the calibration and validation periods respectively which are close to the measured drainage volume of 72 65 104 m3 in 2007 these results indicate that the parameters are reasonable and can be used to simulate the performance of the drainage ditches the calibrated parameters of drainage ditches are shown in table 4 3 4 2 salt transport modelling results the simulated and measured spatially averaged groundwater salt concentrations in the calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 11 a the groundwater salt concentration was relatively stable in the calibration period the mae was 0 103 kg m3 and the rrmse was 6 17 in contrast the measured salt concentration in the validation period fluctuated slightly with an increasing trend throughout the year this is because the salt in the soil leaches into groundwater after autumn irrigation in october which is consistent with the simulation results shown in fig 11 a the mae was 0 514 kg m3 in the validation period and the rrmse was 43 11 fig 11 b shows the spatial distribution of the annual average groundwater salt concentration from 2007 to 2009 the simulated spatial distributions of the groundwater salt concentration are consistent with the measured results the groundwater salt concentration in the northeastern part of the study area was relatively high because the soil was bare where there was no irrigation and salt accumulated easily considering the difficulty of three dimensionally simulating the regional groundwater salt concentration this result is considered acceptable the calibrated solute transport model parameters include the longitudinal dispersivity and the leaching efficiency the longitudinal dispersivity was calibrated as 7 m in the first and second layers and 12 m in the third layer which conform to the scale of the study area and are close to the values reported in previous studies of the yonglian irrigation area 7 15 m zhao 2011 zhu 2013 the value of the leaching efficiency depends on the size distribution of water filled soil pores and the extent of soil cracking and it varies between approximately 0 2 for heavy soils to approximately 0 6 for light soils gates et al 2002 while the value is 0 35 0 4 for sandy loam soils kaur et al 2007 the value of the leaching efficiency was determined to be 0 5 in a previous study of this area sun 2020 the leaching efficiency calibrated in this research was 0 42 according to the soil type and the results of previous research 3 5 model prediction for designing subsurface drainage system the spatial distributions of the annual average groundwater table depth before and after the application of subsurface drainage systems are demonstrated in fig 12 a the groundwater table depth increased in regions with subsurface drainage systems and thus the flow field changed the annual average groundwater table depth of the whole irrigation area ranged from 1 98 m to 2 03 m under the three scenarios after the application of subsurface drainage 0 14 0 19 m deeper than before the annual average groundwater table depth within the subsurface drainage region ranged between 2 10 m and 2 18 m fig 12 b shows the spatial distribution of the groundwater table depth during the drainage period of the no 1 subsurface drainage system shown in fig 5 a under scenario n2 and the spatial distribution of the groundwater table depth in this area without subsurface drainage scenario n0 during the drainage period in this area the groundwater table depth increased from 1 74 m to 1 97 m after the application of subsurface drainage and the local groundwater flow field was totally changed by the drainage pipes a deeper groundwater table depth can be found around the drainage pipes the spatial distribution of the groundwater salt concentration was almost the same before and after the implementation of subsurface drainage and there was little difference among the three schemes as shown in fig 12 c which indicates that the spatial distribution of the groundwater salt concentration is not sensitive to the layout of subsurface drainage systems the annual salt mass balances of the three schemes are listed in table 5 the total salt discharge ranged from 181 104 kg to 202 104 kg under the three subsurface drainage system scenarios and was only 131 104 kg without the application of subsurface drainage systems the total salt discharge increased by 38 54 compared to before approximately 36 45 of salt was discharged by the subsurface drainage systems and the drainage capacity of the ditches was reduced because of the increase in the groundwater table depth with increasing groundwater table depth the amount of salt transported into the vadose zone through phreatic evaporation decreased by between 49 104 kg y and 57 104 kg y as shown in table 5 and the amount of salt accumulation in the vadose zone was reduced by more than 90 desalination occurred in the vadose zone after the application of subsurface drainage in scenario n8 in summary these results confirm the feasibility of the proposed model for predicting regional groundwater and salt dynamics under subsurface drainage conditions and thus can be helpful for designing subsurface drainage systems at a regional scale in complex agricultural areas 4 conclusions this study developed a new subsurface drainage sdr package for modflow lgr mt3d to simulate subsurface drainage systems based on the hooghoudt equation the model accuracy was tested by a synthetic case a published indoor experiment and two field experiments then the regional groundwater and salt dynamics were predicted under different subsurface drainage schemes in a real case the major conclusions are as follows 1 the modified modflow lgr mt3d framework combined with the sdr package performs well in simulating the regional groundwater and salt dynamics under the conditions of subsurface drainage systems 2 the developed sdr package owns accurate simulation results under transient conditions with the rrmse of drainage volumes of a single pipe ranged from 3 14 to 4 69 the relative errors of cumulative drainage volumes below 6 for the outdoor experiments 3 the sdr package has advantages over the drn package in that it can be easily used for designing subsurface drainage systems by calibrating only the hydraulic conductivity while the drn package depends greatly on the drain conductance 4 the total salt discharge increases by 38 54 after the application of subsurface drainage systems 36 45 of which is discharged by subsurface drainage pipes declaration of competing

9798,subsurface drainage systems have been widely used to help manage soil salinization worldwide however designing a subsurface drainage system requires predictions of regional groundwater and salt dynamics while these dynamics can be obtained using modflow s drain package drn this package requires that the drain conductance be specified which is difficult to determine for subsurface drainage systems with different layout parameters including the pipe spacing depth and radius in this study a new subsurface drainage sdr package based on the hooghoudt equation was developed within the modflow lgr mt3d framework to simulate the effects of subsurface drainage pipes on groundwater flow and salt dynamics the accuracy and applicability of sdr were tested by a synthetic case a published indoor experiment and two field experiments comparison with indoor experimental data shows that the rrmse of cumulative drainage volume was 5 08 and the rrmse of groundwater table depth was 3 69 the simulation results of outdoor experiment show that the rrmse of drainage volumes of a single pipe ranged from 3 14 to 4 69 and the relative errors of cumulative drainage volumes were below 6 and the relative errors of drainage discharge were 3 1 16 3 the results demonstrate that sdr can accurately simulate leaching water and solute transport under transient flow conditions the model was then applied to the yonglian irrigation area of inner mongolia china for subsurface drainage system design and 3 different layout schemes of subsurface drainage systems were presented the total salt discharge increased by 38 54 after the application of the subsurface drainage system 36 45 of which was discharged by subsurface drainage pipes this study provides a pilot example for regional subsurface drainage system design keywords subsurface drainage package hooghoudt equation soil salinity groundwater and salt modelling modflow lgr mt3d 1 introduction soil salinization is a major cause of soil degradation and seriously affects agricultural productivity throughout the world shokri kuehni et al 2020 singh 2010 subsurface drainage is an effective tool in many agricultural areas to help manage soil salinization by lowering the groundwater table to drain excess soil salt dissolved in leaching water chávez et al 2015 when designing a subsurface drainage system its layout parameters e g pipe spacing depth and radius are of vital importance for achieving effective drainage nangia et al 2010 rodgers et al 2003 which are directly impacted by regional hydrological conditions consequently the long term distribution of the regional groundwater and salt concentration under the usage of subsurface drainage should be precisely predicted ritzema et al 2008 numerical modelling is typically used to tackle the above problem early numerical models employed for the design of subsurface drainage systems were limited to one dimensional simulations e g swatren macro drainmod wave swap preflo feddes et al 1978 jarvis 1994 skaggs 1978 vanclooster et al 1994 van dam et al 1997 workman and skaggs 1990 in contrast over the last decade two and three dimensional models have been used to simulate groundwater flow and salt transport within subsurface drainage networks with spatially variable climate geological and soil conditions some examples include hydrus šimůnek et al 2018 and drainflow shokri and bardsley 2016 which are based on the multi dimensional richards equation of variably saturated flow and can be used only for field scale simulations because their implementations are complex at regional scales additionally some watershed models e g mhydas drain tiemeyer et al 2007 hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 and swat arnold et al 1998 have been improved or modified to describe hydrological processes under subsurface drainage conditions furthermore the semi conceptual catchment scale model mhydas was integrated with the hooghoudt equation to account for matrix drainage discharge in lowland areas tiemeyer et al 2007 rozemeijer et al 2010 used hydrogeosphere to simulate subsurface drainage conditions and represented the subsurface drains in the model as equivalent medium high conductivity layers du et al 2005 modified the original swat model by integrating an empirical equation to represent the drainage flux once they are well calibrated the abovementioned models can be used to estimate the performance of existing subsurface drainage systems but the use of these models is limitedly when designing the drainage pipe layout parameters because the calibrated parameters would change as the layout parameters changed alternatively modflow harbaugh 2005 is a three dimensional groundwater model commonly used in regional scale simulations that contains many subroutine packages to deal with the different features of hydrologic systems and solve various surface water groundwater problems previous studies usually simulated the spatial interactions between aquifers and drains with the drn package ghorbani et al 2016 hollanders et al 2005 mirlas 2012 rossi et al 2014 simpson et al 2011 the drainage flux is calculated by multiplying the drain conductance by the difference between the aquifer head and drain elevation harbaugh 2005 however the drain conductance depends not only on the layout of drainage pipes and hydrogeological characteristics conditions but also on the characteristics of the groundwater flow converging into the drainage pipes and no specific formula has been developed to calculate this lumped parameter a common practice is to estimate the drain conductance by model calibration based on field measured drainage discharge or related state variables pohll and guitjens 1994 the calibrated drain conductance values of subsurface drainage pipes were calculated as 55 234 m2 d by goswami and kalita 2009 and 1 2 m2 d by mirlas 2009 indicating that the drain conductance can vary by several orders of magnitude fio and deverel 1991 further evaluated the sensitivity of groundwater flow to different values of drain conductance as the drain conductance value increased from 0 14 m2 d to 0 44 m2 d the drainage capacity increased by nearly three times indicating that the drain conductance has substantial impacts on the simulation results the calibrated drain conductance should be adjusted according to changes in the layout parameters for predictions under different subsurface drainage pipe design schemes however the current drn module cannot implement this approach rodriguez et al 2008 then it cannot be used for subsurface drainage pipe layout parameters design therefore a new package that can quantitatively simulate the drainage water and salt discharge under the impact of different subsurface drainage layout parameters is needed the objective of this study is to develop a new package namely the subsurface drainage sdr package within the modflow framework to replace drn for subsurface drainage simulation sdr uses the hooghoudt equation hooghoudt 1940 to simulate the subsurface drainage system and does not require using the parameter of the drain conductance to improve the computational efficiency the sdr package is further developed to be coupled with modflow lgr mehl and hill 2013 for regional scale modelling the size of a modflow block typically varies from tens to hundreds of meters maheswaran et al 2016 welsh and doherty 2005 but a significantly finer spatial discretization is needed to accurately simulate the influences of drainage pipes goswami and kalita 2009 in this context modflow lgr allows users to create a modflow grid with a fine discretization near drainage pipes but a coarse discretization elsewhere to achieve a balance between the computational efficiency and accuracy in regional scale modelling then the flow simulation results of modflow sdr lgr can be used directly by mt3d to simulate salt transport ultimately leading to new software modflow sdr lgr mt3d 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the modflow groundwater flow model 2 1 1 governing equation modflow numerically solves the three dimensional groundwater flow

conceptual model of the hooghoudt equation used in this study to develop the new sdr package the hooghoudt equation is based on the assumption that the recharge to groundwater is uniform and steady and equals the discharge through the drainage system this assumption is relaxed to assume steady state groundwater flow for each time step but transient flow from one time step to the subsequent time step the hooghoudt equation used in this study calculates the drainage flux during each time step via 9 q d 8 k d e h m 4 k h m 2 l 2 where q d is the drainage flux l t 1 k is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil l t 1 h m is the height of the groundwater table above the drain elevation midway between two pipes l l is the drainage pipe spacing l and d e is the equivalent depth l the equivalent depth is introduced to replace the actual depth d to consider the influence of radial flow in the vicinity of the pipes and can be calculated as follows skaggs 1978 10 d e d 1 d l 8 π ln d

parallel drainage pipes l a group of subsurface drainage pipes with the same length spacing and depth is defined as a subsurface drainage system a model can have multiple subsurface drainage systems with different layouts or block discretizations as shown in fig 1 b which depicts two subsurface drainage systems e g subsurface drainage systems 1 and 2 the controlling area of a subsurface drainage system is defined by eq 13 13 a a l f where a is the controlling area of the subsurface drainage system l2 a is the total number of drainage pipes in the subsurface drainage system and f is the length of each drainage pipe l the controlling area of each block containing a drainage pipe is shown in fig 1 b and is calculated as follows 14 a a n where a is the controlling area of each block containing a drainage pipe l2 and n is the total number of blocks containing subsurface drainage pipes in the subsurface drainage system eq 9 calculates the drainage discharge per unit area then the water discharged from each block containing a drainage pipe needed by modflow can be calculated by multiplying the value of q d by the controlling area of each block containing a drainage pipe 15 q 8 k d e

conductance but instead requires the hydraulic conductivity and layout parameters e g pipe spacing depth and radius the mass of salt discharged from each block containing a drainage pipe is calculated as follows 17 s q c where s is the salt mass discharged from a block containing a drainage pipe m t 1 and c is the groundwater salt concentration of the block containing a drainage pipe m l 3 salt enters drainage pipes with the groundwater flow as a sink term in mt3d the structure of the sdr package is given in the supplementary material 2 3 model evaluation and application cases three test cases were conducted to evaluate the accuracy and limitations of the sdr package case 1 was a synthetic case with two purposes one purpose was to test the accuracy of the sdr package by comparing the simulation results with those obtained by drainmod the model most widely used to simulate subsurface drainage problems the second purpose was to illustrate the advantages and limitations of the sdr package compared to the traditional drn package in addition an indoor subsurface drainage experiment case 2 and two field subsurface drainage experiments case 3 were implemented to evaluate the performance of sdr in calculating the drainage discharge under real drainage conditions by comparing the simulation results with published experimental data furthermore a real world application was described case 4 to design the subsurface drainage system in a regional agricultural area with no drainage pipes and to estimate the effects of subsurface drainage systems on the groundwater and salt dynamics the results and discussion are presented in section 4 the mean absolute error mae and relative root mean square error rrmse were used to evaluate the model performance 18 m a e 1 m i 1 m y s

case a schematic representation of case 1 is shown in fig 1 a the domain area was with a length of 200 m and a width of 100 m and was discretized into 20 000 uniform 1 m 1 m blocks in the horizontal plane the aquifer was 15 m thick and was divided into 3 layers of equal thickness the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was 0 5 m d the specific yield was 0 11 the specific storage was 5 10 5 m 1 and the longitudinal dispersivity was 0 01 m two parallel drainage pipes were buried in the soil profile and the layout parameters are listed in table 1 the initial head was at the same elevation as the drainage pipes the initial groundwater salt concentration was 1 kg m3 the recharge rate was 1 016 10 3 m d and the salt concentration in the recharge water was 0 the drainage eventually reached a steady state in the case of uniform recharge and the discharge through the drainage system was equal to the rate of recharge the groundwater table under steady state conditions between the two drainage pipes is computed as follows based on the hooghoudt equation 20 y 1 k q d l x q d x 2 d e 2 d d e 8 d e h m 4 h m 2 l 2 l x x 2 d e 2 d d e where x is the distance from the pipe l and y is the height of the groundwater table at x l the developed model modflow sdr mt3d was used to simulate the groundwater table depth drainage discharge and salt discharge rate the simulation results under transient conditions were compared with those from drainmod and the groundwater table under steady state conditions was also compared with the result calculated by eq 20 as the analytical solution additionally the modflow model with the drn package was similarly used to simulate the groundwater table depth drainage discharge and salt discharge rate under various c d levels to compare the results with those of the sdr package the simulation period was 500 d 2 5 case 2 indoor subsurface drainage experiment case 2 was implemented to test the performance of the sdr package under transient drainage conditions the experiment was carried out in a tank with a volume of 0 7125 m3 1 5 m 0 5 m 0 95 m chen et al 2020 the layout parameters of the subsurface drainage pipe and soil properties are shown in table 1 the leaching test began at 8 00 a m on november 4 2018 and the total amount of leaching water was 19 2 cm the drainage began at 11 57 a m and lasted 76 h with a total drainage water volume of 68 m3 the initial groundwater table depth was 0 7 m evaporation was ignored because the experiment was carried out indoors and the duration was short the observed cumulative drainage volume and groundwater table depth were used for comparison with the simulation results in this case there were 7500 discretized grids used by the developed model 2 6 case 3 field subsurface drainage experiment two published field experiments were used to test the sdr package under field observed drainage conditions denoted a and b field experiment a was conducted by chen 2020 in xinjiang china on november 23 2018 the geographic location and photos of field experiment a are shown in fig 2 a and b there were three experimental plots with a uniform drainage pipe spacing of 6 m and different drainage pipe depths in the range of 0 8 1 4 m as shown in fig 2 c the layout parameters of the subsurface drainage system and soil properties are listed in table 1 the leaching lasted 5 d with a total of 47 5 cm of leaching water the drainage began on november 25 and lasted 16 18 d the effective amount of leaching water was 26 9 cm in plot a1 29 5 cm in plot a2 and 19 4 cm in plot a3 due to the different initial soil water contents the initial groundwater table depth was 1 91 m the average evaporation rate was 1 52 10 3 m d the observed cumulative drainage volume of a single pipe was used for comparison with the simulation results there were 1350 discretized grids used by the developed model for the simulation field experiment b was conducted by zhang et al 2012 in tianjin china on june 1 2010 there were three experimental plots with a uniform drainage pipe depth of 1 2 m and different drainage pipe spacings between 3 m and 9 m as shown in fig 2 c the layout parameters of the subsurface drainage system and soil properties are listed in table 1 leaching lasted 9 d 15 d and 21 d in plots b1 b2 and b3 respectively and the total amount of leaching water in each plot was 30 2 cm the drainage discharge at the stabilization stage was observed and used for comparison with the simulation results the initial groundwater table depth in this case was 1 8 m and the spatial discretization grids were 1440 2 7 case 4 real world application for designing regional subsurface drainage systems the new package was applied to investigate the effects of designing subsurface drainage systems on the regional groundwater and salt dynamics in a practical agricultural district fig 3 a shows the location of the study site the yonglian irrigation area 40 45 57 41 17 58 n 107 37 19 108 51 04 e in inner mongolia china the whole domain area is 29 75 km2 with a north south length of 13 60 km and an east west width of 3 93 km the ground surface elevation decreases from 1028 11 m in the southwest to 1025 67 m in the northeast the average annual evaporation is 2200 mm but the average precipitation is only 170 mm wang et al 2019 and the average groundwater table depth is 1 47 m the strong evaporation and the shallow groundwater table result in serious salt accumulation within the soil the agricultural drainage network in this area relies on ditches however the lack of terminal ditches leads to a poor drainage capacity in the field therefore subsurface drainage could be used as an alternative scheme to alleviate the problems of poor drainage and soil salinization in this area the aquifer of the study area can be divided into two layers the top layer is composed of mixed sand and clay and is less permeable with an average thickness of 14 66 m while the bottom layer is sandy and more permeable with an average thickness of 40 m the daily precipitation and evaporation during 2004 2009 were obtained from the wuyuan weather station evaporation was measured using a 20 cm evaporation pan e pan the monthly precipitation e pan and total volume of water diverted for the yonglian irrigation area during 2004 2009 are shown in fig 3 b the groundwater table depths were observed from 12 observation wells in the yonglian irrigation area every 5 d from 2004 to 2009 and the groundwater salt concentration was observed every 10 d from may to november during the period of 2007 2009 the groundwater flow and salt transport parameters were calibrated and validated with the current observation data the salt concentration in the root zone is the most important factor impacting the agricultural sustainability mao et al 2017 therefore the design criterion of the subsurface drainage system is to decrease the accumulation of salt in the vadose zone in the study area the annual salt mass balance in the year with a normal precipitation level without subsurface drainage is shown in fig 4 the salt masses in the aquifers and the vadose zone were 516 104 kg and 53 104 kg respectively three subsurface drainage system layout schemes with 40 drainage pipes were established n2 n4 and n8 in fig 5 to determine the impact of the subsurface drainage system s location on the regional groundwater and salt dynamics the pipe spacing and depth were 100 m and 2 m respectively referring to previous subsurface drainage experiments in this area wang et al 1993 the subsurface drainage systems were deployed in areas with relatively shallow groundwater table depths and high groundwater salt concentrations to observe better effects of salt discharge the scenario without a subsurface drainage system was marked as n0 for comparison the layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipes and the soil properties information of the three scenarios n2 n4 and n8 are listed in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison with the analytical method and drainmod the modflow sdr mt3d simulation results of case 1 were compared with those of the analytical method and drainmod the steady state drainage discharge simulated by modflow sdr mt3d and drainmod are both the same as the recharge rate at 1 016 10 3 m d the steady state groundwater table depth calculated by eq 20 and simulated by modflow sdr mt3d are plotted in fig 6 a with an rrmse of 0 3 fig 6 b and c show the changes in the groundwater table depth at the midpoint between the two pipes and the drainage discharge simulated by modflow sdr mt3d and drainmod the drainage process is consistent with the change in the groundwater table depth and reaches a steady state after approximately 200 d in contrast the transient drainage discharge simulated by drainmod is smaller than that simulated by modflow sdr mt3d this is because the two models require different soil property parameters for the calculation e g soil water characteristics for drainmod and the specific yield and specific storage for modflow sdr mt3d which are difficult to totally unify even for the same soil these differences in the simulation behaviours of the two models before reaching the plateau can influence the estimation of the drainage flux and groundwater dynamics around the subsurface drainage pipes consequently the drainage process and groundwater table reach a steady state earlier when simulated with modflow sdr mt3d than when simulated with drainmod the steady state groundwater table depths at the midpoint between the two pipes simulated by modflow sdr mt3d and drainmod are 13 451 m and 13 448 m respectively and the relative errors of both are no more than 0 03 of the analytical result in addition the salt concentration in the leaching water exhibits a decreasing trend due to continuous drainage as shown in fig 6 d and the simulation results of the two models are close however the drainmod simulated salt concentration fluctuation slightly in the initial stage of drainage because drainmod solves the 1 d advection dispersion equation by adopting a mass balance approach which is significantly impacted by the depth for the average salinity in contrast mt3d solves the 3 d advection dispersion equation based on a finite difference approximation the difference in the salt concentration causes the deviation of the salt discharge rate simulated by the two models as shown in fig 6 e the variation trend of the salt discharge rate simulated by drainmod is similar to that of the drainage discharge the salt discharge rate decreases after the drainage process reaches a steady state because of the decrease in the salt concentration in the leaching water the total salt discharge simulated by the two models is shown in fig 6 f with an rrmse of 14 6 the computational times are 0 2 s for drainmod and 356 s for modflow sdr mt3d the computational time of the latter is much longer than that of the former because drainmod is a quasi 2 d model based on the water mass balance method whereas modflow sdr mt3d is a 3 d physically based numerical model nevertheless although drainmod is computationally efficient it cannot simulate the regional groundwater and salt dynamic characteristics because it can calculate the groundwater table only at the midpoint between two drainage pipes in conclusion the performance of modflow sdr mt3d is satisfactory 3 2 comparison with experimental data the simulation results of the cumulative drainage volume and groundwater table depth during the indoor experiment in case 2 are shown in fig 7 a and fig 7 b respectively the mae of the cumulative drainage volume is 1 77 m3 and the rrmse is 5 08 the simulated total volume of drainage water is 66 6 m3 which is 1 4 m3 less than that observed in the indoor experiment the groundwater table rises rapidly at the beginning of drainage and then drops slowly which is consistent with the experimental results the mae of the groundwater table depth is 0 009 m and the rrmse is 3 69 fig 7 c e compare the observed and simulated drainage volumes of a single pipe in the three plots of field experiment a in case 3 the mae is 0 72 0 97 m3 and the rrmse ranges from 3 14 to 4 69 the simulated cumulative drainage volumes of the single pipes in the three plots are 37 54 m3 40 77 m3 and 29 63 m3 and the relative errors are 1 08 4 08 and 5 29 respectively fig 7 f shows the simulation results of the drainage discharge in field experiment b in case 3 the drainage discharge first increases becomes stable and then decreases rapidly after the leaching stops zhang et al 2012 measured the average drainage discharge of the three plots at the stable stage of drainage the measured average drainage discharge were 19 89 m3 d in plot b1 24 55 m3 d in plot b2 and 42 96 m3 d in plot b3 as shown in fig 7 f the simulated drainage discharge at the stable stage are 20 50 m3 d 28 55 m3 d and 48 14 m3 d and the relative errors of 3 1 16 3 and 12 1 respectively compared with the measured values the comparison between the simulation results and experimental data shows that the sdr package performs well under transient drainage conditions 3 3 advantages and limitations of the sdr package to illustrate the applicability of the new package in subsurface drainage simulations with modflow the simulation results obtained in case 1 with sdr were compared with those simulated by drn with different values of c d the steady state groundwater table depths simulated by sdr and drn with different values of c d as well as the analytical results are shown in fig 8 a the sdr simulated groundwater table depth is relatively close to the analytical result with an increase in c d from 0 2 to 10 m2 d the drn simulated groundwater table depth decreases and approaches the analytical result fig 8 b and fig 8 c show the changes in the groundwater table depth at the midpoint between the two pipes and the drainage discharge indicating that the drainage process reaches a steady state earlier as c d increases furthermore fig 8 d shows that the difference in the salt concentration of the leaching water simulated by sdr and drn with different values of c d can be considered negligible therefore the differences in the salt discharge rate and total salt discharge from the two packages are quite small as shown in fig 8 e and fig 8 f fig 8 illustrates that a larger c d gives results closer to those of sdr moreover the c d value has a considerable impact on the simulation when using the drn package for subsurface drainage modelling however the value of c d is difficult to determine since there is no specific formula to calculate it in contrast the sdr package can simulate subsurface drainage systems with variable layout parameters once the hydraulic conductivity is calibrated although the sdr package exhibits sufficient computational accuracy as shown above its limitations should also be considered at each time step the sdr package is run to calculate the drainage flux with the current hydraulic head and iterations are required between the sdr package and the modflow model in the calculation thus the time step has an impact on the simulation results especially when the groundwater table depth changes sharply fig 9 shows the simulated groundwater table depths during the indoor subsurface drainage experiment in case 2 the rrmse ranges between 3 56 and 3 74 when the time step is smaller than 2 h nevertheless the simulation results worsen with an increase in the time step and the simulated rise in the groundwater table depth displays a lag hence users must choose an appropriate time step according to the actual situation 3 4 calibration and validation results of a real world application 3 4 1 groundwater flow modelling results the simulated and observed spatially averaged groundwater table depths during the calibration 2004 2007 and validation 2008 2009 periods are shown in fig 10 the variation trend of the simulated groundwater table depths is consistent with the trend of the observed values the simulated depths in different observation wells varied substantially with the mae ranging between 0 258 m and 0 658 m and the rrmse fluctuating between 23 93 and 58 76 the mae values of the groundwater table depth averaged over the whole domain were 0 296 m and 0 462 m during the calibration and validation periods respectively and the corresponding rrmse values were 24 36 and 40 93 the annual average volume of recharge from irrigation and precipitation to the aquifer was 380 32 104 m3 in the calibration period and 397 64 104 m3 in the validation period the annual average lateral leakage from the zaohuo trunk canal to groundwater ranged from 96 104 m3 to 98 104 m3 which accounted for nearly 20 of the total inflow the annual average amount of phreatic evaporation from the groundwater was 404 23 104 m3 in the calibration period and 434 06 104 m3 in the validation period making phreatic evaporation the largest outflow of the aquifer the annual average discharge to drainage ditches was 71 52 104 m3 and 74 30 104 m3 in the calibration and validation periods respectively the corresponding changes in storage were 0 73 104 m3 and 12 31 104 m3 and the relative water mass balance errors were 0 02 and 0 04 in the calibration and validation periods respectively next the flow model parameters were calibrated including the hydrogeological parameters recharge coefficient and drain conductance of the drainage ditches the calibrated specific yields were 0 029 in the top two loam layers and 0 04 in the third silt loam layer according to the soil type and previous studies yu 2017 zhao 2011 the specific storage was set uniformly as 9 10 5 m 1 the calibrated recharge coefficients are shown in table 3 the recharge coefficient of precipitation was 0 15 in contrast the recharge coefficients of irrigation water changed monthly considering the various growing stages of crops and the amount of irrigation in the early growing period from mid may to late june the recharge coefficient was larger due to the reduced water consumption of plants whereas in the late growing period early july to mid september the crops grew vigorously and consumed a large amount of water which resulted in less recharge to groundwater large amount of autumn irrigation led to a lager recharge coefficient in october and november yang 2016 the annual average discharge to drainage ditches was 71 52 104 m3 and 74 30 104 m3 in the calibration and validation periods respectively which are close to the measured drainage volume of 72 65 104 m3 in 2007 these results indicate that the parameters are reasonable and can be used to simulate the performance of the drainage ditches the calibrated parameters of drainage ditches are shown in table 4 3 4 2 salt transport modelling results the simulated and measured spatially averaged groundwater salt concentrations in the calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 11 a the groundwater salt concentration was relatively stable in the calibration period the mae was 0 103 kg m3 and the rrmse was 6 17 in contrast the measured salt concentration in the validation period fluctuated slightly with an increasing trend throughout the year this is because the salt in the soil leaches into groundwater after autumn irrigation in october which is consistent with the simulation results shown in fig 11 a the mae was 0 514 kg m3 in the validation period and the rrmse was 43 11 fig 11 b shows the spatial distribution of the annual average groundwater salt concentration from 2007 to 2009 the simulated spatial distributions of the groundwater salt concentration are consistent with the measured results the groundwater salt concentration in the northeastern part of the study area was relatively high because the soil was bare where there was no irrigation and salt accumulated easily considering the difficulty of three dimensionally simulating the regional groundwater salt concentration this result is considered acceptable the calibrated solute transport model parameters include the longitudinal dispersivity and the leaching efficiency the longitudinal dispersivity was calibrated as 7 m in the first and second layers and 12 m in the third layer which conform to the scale of the study area and are close to the values reported in previous studies of the yonglian irrigation area 7 15 m zhao 2011 zhu 2013 the value of the leaching efficiency depends on the size distribution of water filled soil pores and the extent of soil cracking and it varies between approximately 0 2 for heavy soils to approximately 0 6 for light soils gates et al 2002 while the value is 0 35 0 4 for sandy loam soils kaur et al 2007 the value of the leaching efficiency was determined to be 0 5 in a previous study of this area sun 2020 the leaching efficiency calibrated in this research was 0 42 according to the soil type and the results of previous research 3 5 model prediction for designing subsurface drainage system the spatial distributions of the annual average groundwater table depth before and after the application of subsurface drainage systems are demonstrated in fig 12 a the groundwater table depth increased in regions with subsurface drainage systems and thus the flow field changed the annual average groundwater table depth of the whole irrigation area ranged from 1 98 m to 2 03 m under the three scenarios after the application of subsurface drainage 0 14 0 19 m deeper than before the annual average groundwater table depth within the subsurface drainage region ranged between 2 10 m and 2 18 m fig 12 b shows the spatial distribution of the groundwater table depth during the drainage period of the no 1 subsurface drainage system shown in fig 5 a under scenario n2 and the spatial distribution of the groundwater table depth in this area without subsurface drainage scenario n0 during the drainage period in this area the groundwater table depth increased from 1 74 m to 1 97 m after the application of subsurface drainage and the local groundwater flow field was totally changed by the drainage pipes a deeper groundwater table depth can be found around the drainage pipes the spatial distribution of the groundwater salt concentration was almost the same before and after the implementation of subsurface drainage and there was little difference among the three schemes as shown in fig 12 c which indicates that the spatial distribution of the groundwater salt concentration is not sensitive to the layout of subsurface drainage systems the annual salt mass balances of the three schemes are listed in table 5 the total salt discharge ranged from 181 104 kg to 202 104 kg under the three subsurface drainage system scenarios and was only 131 104 kg without the application of subsurface drainage systems the total salt discharge increased by 38 54 compared to before approximately 36 45 of salt was discharged by the subsurface drainage systems and the drainage capacity of the ditches was reduced because of the increase in the groundwater table depth with increasing groundwater table depth the amount of salt transported into the vadose zone through phreatic evaporation decreased by between 49 104 kg y and 57 104 kg y as shown in table 5 and the amount of salt accumulation in the vadose zone was reduced by more than 90 desalination occurred in the vadose zone after the application of subsurface drainage in scenario n8 in summary these results confirm the feasibility of the proposed model for predicting regional groundwater and salt dynamics under subsurface drainage conditions and thus can be helpful for designing subsurface drainage systems at a regional scale in complex agricultural areas 4 conclusions this study developed a new subsurface drainage sdr package for modflow lgr mt3d to simulate subsurface drainage systems based on the hooghoudt equation the model accuracy was tested by a synthetic case a published indoor experiment and two field experiments then the regional groundwater and salt dynamics were predicted under different subsurface drainage schemes in a real case the major conclusions are as follows 1 the modified modflow lgr mt3d framework combined with the sdr package performs well in simulating the regional groundwater and salt dynamics under the conditions of subsurface drainage systems 2 the developed sdr package owns accurate simulation results under transient conditions with the rrmse of drainage volumes of a single pipe ranged from 3 14 to 4 69 the relative errors of cumulative drainage volumes below 6 for the outdoor experiments 3 the sdr package has advantages over the drn package in that it can be easily used for designing subsurface drainage systems by calibrating only the hydraulic conductivity while the drn package depends greatly on the drain conductance 4 the total salt discharge increases by 38 54 after the application of subsurface drainage systems 36 45 of which is discharged by subsurface drainage pipes declaration of competing

9799,soil aquifer treatment sat is a practice used to enhance groundwater storage through intermittent percolation of treated wastewater effluent in designated infiltration basins due to proximity to urban regions land availability for sat infiltration basins is a limiting factor furthermore with the growing population sat systems are faced with an increase in effluent volumes meant for recharge

flooding experiments lasting 24 and 48 h were conducted volumetric water content vwc and oxidation reduction conditions were continuously monitored concurrently water samples were collected and analyzed for total organic carbon and nitrogen species along with leaf health measurements results were compared to an adjacent control plot where no flooding with effluent was applied contaminant removal rates under the ridge setup resembled active sat basins moreover chemical analysis of the water samples and vwc readings demonstrated that higher water quality and faster root zone aeration following flooding were obtained under the ridge which appears to be the better ag sat setup according to a principal component analysis pca the dissolved oxygen explains 75 of the variability of effluent chemistry under the ridge illustrating that oxic conditions prevailed in this setup this study demonstrates that while many other concerns still need to be addressed using agricultural plots

huertas et al 2008 the sat approach integrates groundwater recharge and sustainability along with tww reclamation and reuse thus promoting eco friendly awareness while serving as a low cost system suitable for arid and semi arid regions worldwide bouwer 2002 sharma et al 2012 a major limitation in implementing sat is land availability cikurel et al 2010 tsangaratos et al 2017 sat requires vast land surface area for installing infiltration basins this is especially pertinent in urban areas where there is direct competition over real estate since land is limited and expensive niswonger et al 2017 moreover to establish a sat site specific conditions must be present including 1 a thick vadose zone 2 an unconfined underlying aquifer 3 a vadose zone with high soil permeability 4 proximity to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and 5 proximity to locations of potential demand for the recharged effluent dillon et al 2006 these requirements make selecting a sat site challenging furthermore current sat systems often experience an increase in effluent volumes per unit of area originating from wwtps meant for recharge via percolation in infiltration basins i e hydraulic loading rates for different reasons e g the influx of stormwater into the water system de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005 joannis et al 2002 a direct result of intensive hydraulic loading rates is the shortening of drying cycles i e the time between tww flooding events in the sat basin which reduces the quality of the treatment primarily due to a lack of soil aeration ben moshe et al 2020 negev et al 2020 this may be especially relevant during the winter when lower temperatures impede the infiltration rates one reason for this is reduced microbial activity which is temperature dependent and thus lower during the winter months 14 c and 28 c on average during january and july respectively israel meteorological service 2020 as a result organic matter decomposition is diminished causing its accumulation in the topsoil and impeding infiltration another effect of lower temperatures is the increase in water viscosity which has an inverse relation to hydraulic conductivity this results in decreased flux rates of effluent infiltrating through the basin casanova et al 2016 hillel 1980 lin et al 2003 nadav et al 2012 on the other hand volumes headed for sat infiltration may be larger due to undesired intrusion of stormwater into the sewer system since land area for sat is limited an alternative solution may be to use farmlands as temporary sat infiltration basins thus alleviating stress from active sat basins this method is hereafter called agricultural soil aquifer treatment ag sat grinshpan et al 2021 this procedure can be executed on vast agricultural landscapes when many crop species are in a dormant period e g orchards during the winter chill or when no crops are being grown farmlands that meet sat s geo physical requirements may serve as temporary sat basins to enable crop production in an ag sat setting crops must be tolerant to both waterlogged conditions and variable tww quality observations from previous studies concerning irrigation with tww demonstrate different and diverse impacts on the crop s health and yield paudel et al 2016 vergine et al 2017 zolti et al 2019 within the scope of ag sat tww irrigation might reduce fertilizer needs jaramillo and

of hydrophobicity arye et al 2011 nadav et al 2012 although flooding agricultural plots for the purpose of groundwater recharge has been tested a practice known as agricultural managed aquifer recharge ag mar bachand et al 2014 dahlke et al 2018 waterhouse et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge no study has explored the outcome of flooding farmlands using tww as a means of both irrigation and aquifer recharge the potential advantages and disadvantages of ag sat as well as matters of concern are summarized in grinshpan et al 2021 the goal of this study was to test the feasibility of the ag sat concept in terms of water quality and plant response in our study we tested the use of a citrus orchard as a supplementary infiltration basin for tww transferred from a nearby sat infiltration basin plots were planted with citrus orange trees in the vicinity of a sat basin that is part of israel s dan region reclamation project also known as the shafdan two conventional agricultural settings were tested trees planted on leveled soil hereafter named flat and trees planted on a raised soil bed hereafter named ridge the use of ridges has numerous potential benefits improved crop yield soil structure and most importantly minimization of waterlogging in the root zone i e improved aeration bakker et al 2005 hamilton et al 2000 manik et al 2019 the feasibility of ag sat was investigated in terms of soil water chemistry i e treatment quality soil and plant response technical operation and future implementations 2 methods 2 1 experiment site the shafdan is israel s largest wastewater treatment facility currently serving over 2 million inhabitants and treating around 130 140 mm3 of raw wastewater annually aharoni et al 2019 messing and sela 2016 the tww secondary effluent is intermittently discharged into infiltration basins located close to the shafdan plant on sand dunes above israel s coastal aquifer goren et al 2011 herein the effluent percolates through the vadose zone approximately 20 40 m deep goren et al 2014 between the years 2015 and 2017 the effluent volumes generated at the shafdan wwtp increased from 130 to 140 mm3 year aharoni et al 2019 while sat basin recharge capabilities decreased from 125 to 115 mm3 year negev et al 2020 highlighting the need for additional land for sat basins and sparking the concept of ag sat the decline in infiltration rates is mainly attributed to shorter drying cycles and a decrease in tww quality negev et al 2020 the shafdan s sat facilities amount to a total of six infiltration basins divided into the yavne 1 4 and soreq 1 2 facilities fig 1b each basin s surface area totals about 200 000 m2 and is divided into sub basins also known as ponds that are intermittently flooded with tww goren et al 2014 the soil in the shafdan area is typically characterized as sandy in texture lin et al 2004 the study site is located in the soreq 2 facility fig 1b c in the southeast section of soreq 2 two adjacent plots were prepared for citrus tree planting in july 2019 each covering approximately 150 m2 fig 1c d one plot was deliberately flooded with shafdan secondary effluent blue rectangle fig 1c hereafter termed flooded plot while the other served as a control green rectangle fig 1c hereafter termed control plot the flooded plot s aerial distance from the nearest southeast sat infiltration pond was approximately 30 m fig 1d this proximity allowed for technical ease in flooding events where tww was pumped to the flooded plot in both the flooded and the control plot nine trees were planted all trees were shamuti oranges citrus sinesis grafted on a volkamer citrus volkameriana rootstock and were one and a half years old before planting trees were planted in november 2019 and were already bearing fruit each of the plots was divided into two subplots with different agricultural setups four trees were planted on flat soil hereafter termed flat plot with an area of 45 m2 and five trees were planted on a ridge hereafter termed ridge plot with an area of 60 m2 the ridges were formed to be roughly 100 cm wide and 50 cm high the distance between two planted trees was 3 m all trees were regularly irrigated with potable water from the municipal water supply system using a single 20 mm irrigation pipe with two 4 l h drippers per tree irrigation totaled 18 24 l d per tree during the warmer seasons and around 12 l d per tree during the cooler seasons during rain events or at low temperatures irrigation was halted for the chemical properties of the drip irrigation water the reader is referred to the supporting information si table s1 note that irrigation to the flooded plot ceased during the flooding experiment before planting both plots were leveled additionally soil mounds rising approximately 75 cm in height were installed around the plot s perimeter to maintain effluent under ponded conditions inside the plot in the flooded plot a 1 m deep trench was excavated at the plot s edge and a plastic sheet was placed over it subsequently soil was loaded over the plastic sheet this method was implemented to prevent lateral leaks of tww from the orchard s flooded plots and to focus percolation vertically white plastic sheet surrounding the plot fig 1d 2 2 sampling and field measurements two winter flooding experiments were conducted in the first experiment the plots were flooded for 24 h between november 24 and 25 2020 hereafter termed exp 1 in the second experiment the plots were flooded for 48 h between january 4 and 6 2021 hereafter termed exp 2 the duration of these experiments simulated the shafdan sat basin s operational procedure which typically comprises 1 2 days of flooding followed by 2 4 days of drying aharoni et al 2011 icekson tal et al 2003 the analysis presented below focuses mainly on the results of exp 2 the differences between the two experiments results are discussed in section 3 1 note that the results of exp 1 are summarized in the supporting information si fig s4 as well as the climate measurements taken in the study site s area during the flooding experiments si fig s1 the sampling campaigns were conducted in the flooded plot of the orchard study site located in the soreq 2 infiltration basin fig 1c d tww was pumped from the adjacent sat infiltration pond fig 1d using submerged pumps pedrollo vxm 10 50 m verona italy to the flooded plots both flat and ridge it is important to note that an independent supply system was deployed for each flooded plot i e the flat and ridge flooded plots received effluent directly from the sat basin no routing of water between the plots occurred the submerged pumps were activated automatically using water level pressure sensors mpx2010dp freescale semiconductor inc arizona usa when the water levels in the flat and ridge plots were under 25 cm the pumps turned on and later turned off once the water levels reached 30 cm this allowed a stable water level of 25 30 cm in the flooded plot throughout the flooding experiments si fig s2 vadose zone water samples were collected from the flat and ridge plots vadose zone using ceramic suction cups 12 cm long external and internal diameters of 2 cm and 1 7 cm respectively amitens israel the ceramic suction cups were installed beneath the trees in hand drilled holes at depths of 30 and 60 cm fig

temperature in the sampled solution were conducted in situ using a xylem analytics multi 3620 ids wtw meter weilheim germany in addition oxidation reduction potential orp was measured using an elh 016 probe van london texas usa volumetric water content vwc acclima acc sen sdi tdt sensor idaho usa and oxidation reduction potential orp elh 016 probe van london texas usa soil probes were installed under both the flat and ridge plots at vadose zone depths of 20 30 and 50 cm fig 2 the probes were installed horizontally in hand dug holes and later carefully covered with the same soil the probes were connected to a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific utah usa and sampled year round both the suction cups and the probes depth reference levels were determined as the tree s point of contact with the soil a schematic of the sampling instruments locations and depths within the flooded plot is displayed in fig 2 sensors were installed in december 2019 2 3 leaf measurements tree wellbeing was monitored by measuring leaf parameters these included 1 leaf chlorophyll content using a single photon avalanche diode spad with a konica minolta spad 502 tokyo japan and 2 chlorophyll fluorescence using a mini pam ii heinz walz gmbh effeltrich germany which measures leaf photosynthetic efficiency these two parameters represent tree health status which tends to decrease under flood stress and have previously been used to demonstrate tree response to flooded conditions caudle and maricle 2016 nickum et al 2010 these measurements were carried out prior to and following the flooding experiments in every subplot i e flat and ridge in both flooded and control plots 4 5 trees were sampled to avoid statistical limitation only trees that were genetically identical were planted this is a common practice in citrus research in which plant material is propagated by grafting buds from one clone the scion onto nucellar embryo seedlings from another clone the rootstock mudge et al 2009 from each tree 8 10 leaves were sampled for the physiological measurements 2 4 laboratory methods the water samples were stored in 15 ml plastic vials and kept in a thermally isolated case at 40 c subsequently the samples were analyzed for total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn using a multi n c 2100 s analytik jena ag germany nitrate no3 was measured by ion chromatography thermo scientific dionex ics 5000 massachusetts usa ammonium nh4 was measured by spectrophotometry tecan infinite 200 männedorf switzerland with the nessler reagent method at an absorbance reading of 420 nm major cations ca 2 k mg 2 na fe were analyzed by icp oes spectro arcos fhx22 kleve germany prior to the nh4 no3 and major ion analyses the water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter furthermore the water samples labeled for major ion analyses were acidified with nitric acid to achieve ph 2 2 5 statistical analysis to simplify and visualize high dimensional data sets a principal component analysis pca was performed pca transforms the data matrix containing numerous analyses and measurements collected spatially temporally and over several sampling campaigns into fewer dimensions which constitute a summary of the properties lever et al 2017 it reduces the data geometrically into a new set of variables known as principal components pcs pcs are linear combinations of the original variables and are orthogonal meaning they are uncorrelated typically the first pc pc1 represents the most possible variation of the original data sets the second pc pc2 is the next most possible and so on each observation receives a score value i e the distance from the origin to the projected point for displaying the maximum variance in 2d the scores of pc1 and pc2 are plotted pca finds patterns in the data without prior knowledge of the samples source e g in this case flat or ridge plot depth time of sampling samples with similar features i e chemical composition cluster together according to their score value loadings act as the weights for each variable in the original data set e g toc the direction of the loading vector in relation to the pc s cluster describes which variables dominate the cluster dunn 2020 pca was achieved using matlab version 9 6 0 r2019a natick massachusetts the mathworks inc a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was performed to classify clusters produced by the pca and distinguish them from each other at a confidence level of p 0 05 the permanova was calculated with the vegan package in r software oksanen et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 source and porewater chemistry the study focuses on the topsoil 60 cm since most of the sat processes organic matter and n degradation occur at shallow depths of the vadose zone due to enhanced aeration abel 2014 aharoni et al 2011 amy and drewes 2007 ben moshe et al 2020 essandoh et al 2013 fox et al 2005 goren et al 2014 lin et al 2008 quanrud et al 2003 1996 wilson et al 1995 the observed time series of toc nh4 and no3 concentrations obtained at different depths and locations from exp 2 are summarized in boxplots fig 3 for the complete time series of toc nh4 and no3 the reader is referred to the supporting information si fig s4 and s5 the boxplots illustrate a gradual decrease in toc concentrations among the different setups in general the concentrations decrease with depth fig 3a furthermore nh4 is the dominant species in the source water and at 30 cm in the flat plot on the other hand no3 becomes dominant at 30 cm in the ridge plot and at greater depths under both setups fig 3b from previous field and column studies it was concluded that the main process in organic matter removal during sat is biological degradation essandoh et al 2013 quanrud et al 2005 2003 1996 xue et al 2009 during exp 2 the toc of the secondary effluent source water was removed by approximately 15 and 35 at 30 cm depth in the flat and the ridge plots respectively fig 3a at 60 cm depth the toc was removed by an additional 12 5 in the flat plot while in the ridge plot no additional toc removal was observed fig 3a in contrast to the results obtained during exp 2 exp 1 si fig s4 showed negligible toc degradation with depth in both the flat and the ridge plots during exp 1 both the flat and ridge plots showed about 10 removal of toc at 60 cm depth they were not significantly different from each other according to a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test massey 1951 at a significance level of α 0 05 si table s2 1 it is believed that the differences between the results of exp 1 and exp 2 may be related to microbial maturation of the vadose zone chan et al 2018 maturation of the agricultural field s soil i e the development of a microbial community capable of efficient biodegradation requires a nutrient supply along with proper climate conditions as a rule of thumb sat soil reaches microbial maturity after 3 4 months of tww application soil maturation prior to executing ag sat may be a factor in modifying agricultural plots to function as sat basins brooks et al 2020 pronk et al 2017 quanrud et al 2003 tyagi et al 2009 nh4 concentration levels in the flat plot decreased with depth fig 3b an approximately 20 reduction at 30 cm depth and an additional 40 reduction at 60 cm depth were observed most of the nh4 concentrations decreased by over 97 at 30 cm depth in the ridge plot however an increase in the oxidized form no3 was exhibited at 60 cm depth under both subplots fig 3b the inverse relation i e the decrease in nh4 and rise in no3 suggests that nitrification transpired christensen et al 2000 which is a primary treatment mechanism in sat operations for removal of nh4 goren et al 2014 sopilniak et al 2017 however the transformation of nh4 to no3 cannot explain the entirety of the nitrogen cycle as indicated by the sum of nh4 and no3 in fig 3c the high reduction in the nh4 concentration coupled with the minor no3 concentration increase suggests other nitrogen soil processes such as adsorption assimilation denitrification and loss to greater vadose zone depths chen 1997 miller et al 2006 nieder et al 2011 note that the ph of all water samples ranged between 6 9 and 7 7 which indicates that the volatilization of nh4 is negligible lance 1972 mienis and arye 2018 who examined nitrogen behavior in the shafdan sat basin s vadose zone concluded that total nitrogen removal in the topsoil ranged from 47 to 63 via denitrification and adsorption during exp 2 the sum of nh4 and no3 illustrates similar removal rates of 48 and 75 at 60 cm depth under the flat and the ridge plots respectively an important concern surrounding ag sat is chemical leaching originating mostly from the nitrogen present in the tww and from nitrogen based fertilizers this is a major concern in ag mar murphy et al 2021 and logically it would also be an issue in ag sat the coarse texture of ag sat soil combined with the saturated conditions heightens the risk of no3 leaching burguete et al 2009 mailhol et al 2001 zotarelli et al 2007 unlike sat basins which are well defined in area and operation i e continuously monitored using observation wells ag sat may possibly lack monitoring capabilities since it would be practiced as a supplementary basin for stressed sat facilities thus it would not possess the same infrastructure as sat basins no3 leaching following flooding is likely inevitable in an ag sat setting murphy et al 2021 demonstrated that short lived ag mar flooding events result in no3 leaching in sandy soils their study demonstrated that longer pauses of a few weeks between flooding events increase no3 mobility thus causing higher quantities of no3 to leach this may be a cause for concern since the ag sat plan of action comprises several sporadic flooding events during the winter ultimately the results obtained from the presented study indicate nitrogen species levels in the ag sat site s upper vadose zone especially in the ridge that are similar to those of recharged effluent extracted underneath active sat basins aharoni et al 2019 this study s results demonstrate no major difference in leaching when comparing conventional sat with ag sat that is the water quality generated by ag sat is similar to that of conventional sat toc and nh4 measurements in the study site s vadose zone during exp 2 were significantly different than the tww source water according to a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test α 0 05 si table s2 2 this indicates that the effluent underwent a treatment process while percolating in both subplots moreover a comparison between the flat and the ridge plots regarding toc and nh4 removal illustrates that higher removal rates materialized in the ridge plot moreover the nh4 transformation and removal rates in the ridge plot fig 3b c were similar in value to the removal nh4 underwent in the shafdan sat basins aharoni et al 2019 sopilniak et al 2017 a pca analysis was conducted and is presented in section 3 2 to illustrate the dominant factors that prevailed in the removal processes in the flat and ridge plots 3 2 characterizing ag sat processes a pca was performed to classify samples with similar features into independent clusters and determine each cluster s chemical properties a pca analysis of exp 2 for both the flat and the ridge plots at 30 and 60 cm depths is displayed in fig 4 note that a similar analysis was conducted for the results of exp 1 but it yielded insignificant outcomes data not shown although the pca produces multiple principal components pcs it is common to focus on the foremost components that explain the majority of the variance dunn 2020 in the pca results from exp 2 the first and second pcs explain over 75 of the multi data variability the permanova test showed three clusters that are significantly different from each other according to the pca the water samples obtained in the flat plot are clustered into two groups the first cluster comprises samples from the flat plot at 30 cm depth orange fig 4 while the second cluster contains water samples from the flat plot at 60 cm depth red fig 4 measurements from the ridge plot at both 30 and 60 cm depths showed similar trends and concentrations therefore they are grouped in the same pca cluster green fig 4 the cluster representing the flat plot at 30 cm depth is dominated by toc and nh4 both holding similar weights i e toc and nh4 are equally dominant in this cluster this cluster is characterized by low toc degradation and low nitrification rates the second sample group representing the flat plot at 60 cm depth is characterized by elevated no3 concentrations illustrating that nitrification only partially occurred not all nh4 was consumed silver et al 2018 thus nitrification is the primary process in separating the clusters of the flat plot the third sample group representing the ridge plot at both depths 30 and 60 cm was characterized primarily by do along both pc axes and no3 along the pc2 axis fig 4 these results classify this group as being subjected to better aeration as explained by over 75 of the variability elevated no3 concentrations with a higher presence of oxygen are an indicator for aerobic conditions and subsequent microbial oxidation processes transforming the nh4 in the secondary effluent to no3 essandoh et al 2013 goren et al 2014 miller et al 2006 the removal rates of toc and nh4 under the ridge at 60 cm depth compared to the flat plot at the same depth were more efficient by 15 and 90 respectively additionally toc and nh4 measurements at both the flat and ridge plots at 60 cm depth were significantly different according to a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test α 0 05 si table s2 3 implying that the treatment process differed in both subplots therefore the contaminant removal was more prominent in the ridge plot probably due to improved oxic conditions in the shallower depths where oxygen was available for biological action results from the pca conducted for exp 2 illustrate the prominent characteristics of each clustered group and simplify the differences between them the pca indicates that the flat plot was governed by elevated levels of toc and nh4 while in the ridge do prevailed 3 3 optimal flooding length under flooded conditions physical restriction of atmospheric gas diffusion in the soil leads to a depletion of soil oxygen jackson and drew 1984 pedersen et al 2017 the oxygen limited in the soil pores is depleted by microorganisms and roots which subsequently reduces the soil oxidation reduction potential orp mv conditions fiedler et al 2007 ponnamperuma 1972 following waterlogged conditions a decrease in orp is expected to increase toc concentrations husson 2013 aerated soil orp is generally greater than 350 mv i e oxygen is not a limiting factor while below this value low oxygen conditions prevail pezeshki and delaune 2012 fig 5 illustrates the time lapse of orp and toc removal measurements throughout exp 2 note that the orp readings in the ridge plot at 30 cm depth showed high positive values 350 400 mv throughout 48 h of flooding indicating oxic conditions si fig s6 this is due to the setup differences fig 2 si fig s8 where most of the process at 30 cm in the ridge plot occurs close to the atmosphere which supports a continuous oxygen supply thus the results obtained from 30 cm depth in the flat plot are compared to observations from 50 to 60 cm in the ridge plot si fig s8 once flooding started the orp in the flat plot at 30 cm depth showed a gradual decline fig 5 orange line this trend lasted for approximately 24 h following this period a slight decrease in orp values was observed in the flat plot at 30 cm depth until the 40 hour mark fig 5 in the ridge plot at 50 cm depth the orp conditions initially dropped sharply fig 5 red line following this drop in values a minor decrease was measured for the next 20 h following this period no further decrease in orp values was observed note that the orp measurements displayed a steady value of 135 mv in both plots 40 h after the flooding began throughout the flooding the orp did not go below 135 mv in either setup at any stage moreover a ferrozine analysis conducted gibbs 1976 stookey 1970 showed no evidence of a significant reducing environment during the flooding experiment this method assists in verifying whether reducing conditions prevailed through determining the ferro charge in the effluent the ferrozine results support the sensor s orp measurements pre flooding orp conditions i e 300 mv were regained between two flat and 10 days ridge after flooding ceased the toc removal percentage in the flat and ridge plots at 30 and 60 cm depths demonstrated initial values of about 14 and 10 respectively suggesting that part of the degradation process already occurred before the effluent shafdan secondary effluent reached these depths and locations fig 5 this is consistent with goren et al 2014 and suggests some degradation of organic matter in the pond before infiltration the first 12 h in the flat plot at 30 cm depth displayed a slight increasing trend of toc removal from approximately 14 23 the following eight hours in the flat plot at 30 cm depth illustrated a steady state toc removal value of about 23 fig 5 the toc concentration in the ridge plot at 60 cm depth showed a more substantial trend of toc removal during the first 12 h compared to the flat plot at 30 cm suggesting that during this stage the degradation process was enhanced at 60 cm depth in the ridge plot probably due to better soil aeration fig 5 the following eight hours in the ridge plot at 60 cm depth illustrated a steady state toc removal value of about 40 fig 5 it is important to note that based on saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements table 1 si s1 the travel times of the source water to the flat and ridge plots at 30 and 60 cm depths are roughly 4 8 and 7 h respectively about 20 h after the flooding began the toc removal rates in both the flat and the ridge plots showed a trend of decrease fig 5 at the end of the experiment the toc concentrations in the flat plot at 30 cm depth were very similar to the source water concentrations which suggests that no toc removal occurred at the end of the flooding experiment fig 5 the toc removal percentage in the ridge plot showed a trend of slight decrease following 20 h of flooding however during this stage the toc removal was still around 30 toc concentrations were still 30 lower than the source water and flat plot fig 5 for the timeseries containing the concentration values of the source water and the flat and ridge plots at 30 and 60 cm respectively the reader is referred to the supporting information si fig s7 based on the observations we suggest that sufficient oxygen was available for toc biodegradation during the initial 20 h following the start of ag sat flooding after this period oxygen availability was insufficient for optimal microbial degradation expressed in the negligible toc removal especially in the flat plot the source of dissolved oxygen in the subsurface is primarily a combination of dissolved oxygen transported with the infiltrating waters and oxygen gas available initially in the soil prior to the flooding event as in the shafdan sat basin operation cikurel et al 2012 limiting the ag sat flooding to 20 h may be preferred to allow replenishment of air into the ag sat system and ensure toc removal thus obtaining a higher quality recharged effluent 3 4 aeration conditions the technical and physical properties of the experimental ag sat plots are presented in table 1 the ks values measured in the ag sat study site are comparable to sandy soil lal 2016 which is suitable for sat infiltration basins crites et al 2006 pescod 1992 for explanations of the ks calculations the reader is referred to the supporting information si s1 drying time hours refers to the time between the cessation of water supply to the plots i e end of flooding experiment and the beginning of the decline in vwc observations si fig s9 although lower ks rates were measured under the ridge in both experiments the soil aeration conditions were established faster when compared to the flat plot the faster aeration rate of the ridge s rootzone is related to the water distribution on the soil surface fig 2 si fig s8 in the flat plot the water was mounded on top of the entire plot surface throughout the experiment however in the ridge plot the water was mostly dispersed in the trench surrounding the ridge the raised soil bed with the ridge being continuously aerated to some degree hamilton et al 2000 manik et al 2019 whealy 1992 note that the trees rootzone is mainly located in the ridge due to better aeration and water source during the dry season drip irrigation fageria 2012 therefore the vwc in the ridge s rootzone is directly affected by the water level on the sides of the ridge the decline in surface water level is reflected by the decrease in vwc si fig s9 thus the drying phase in the flat plot occurs only when there is no water at the soil surface while the drying phase in the ridge co occurs with the decline in surface water level as seen in si fig s8 from a hydrological perspective the faster rootzone aeration rate of the ridge plot demonstrates the advantage of this setup in obtaining drying conditions rapid rootzone aeration rates are beneficial in both a sat and an agricultural aspect better aeration results in the accelerated re introduction of oxygen improving the effluent s treatment ben moshe et al 2020 while also shortening waterlogged conditions causing less water stress in the trees rootzone drew 1997 3 5 the effect of flooding on plant properties the citrus trees in both the flat and ridge plots showed no damage following the flooding events spad and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of the flooded plot trees before and after flooding were compared to the control plot trees using the kolmogorov smirnov test α 0 05 si table s2 4 fig 6 insignificant differences were observed between all plots regardless of the treatment this is probably due to the fact that waterlogging is less harmful during the winter than in the warmer growing season due to the roots and micro organisms minimal demand for oxygen in winter glenz et al 2006 kozlowski and pallardy 1997 moreover this result suggests that the improved rootzone aeration measured for the ridge plot was insufficient to create any measurable difference in the plant parameters these results demonstrate that utilizing farmlands as supplementary sat basins a few times during the winter with a lengthy pause between flooding cycles would likely have a negligible if any negative effect on the trees health 3 6 ag sat potential israel s case a fundamental analysis of the potential for ag sat in israel is presented here the recharge of israel s coastal aquifer consists primarily of rainfall infiltration of floodwater and deliberate tww infiltration via sat basins weinberger et al 2012 using geographic information system gis software arcmap the area containing orchards above the coastal aquifer was calculated si fig s10 the recharge area of the israeli coastal aquifer extends over 1670 km2 iwa 2021 where 14 of this area contains orchards 230 km2 moag 2021 using the shafdan operating area above the israeli coastal aquifer 200 km2 as an example there are 25 km2 of potential orchard farmlands where ag sat may be practiced i e provided that the orchards geo physical properties meet the requirements to serve as temporary sat basins dillon et al 2006 currently the shafdan s six active sat sites encompass a combined area of about 1 2 km2 dedicated to tww infiltration fig 1a these sat basins annually infiltrate approximately 125 mm3 negev et al 2020 the utilization of 25 km2 in a single 24 hour ag sat flooding event would allow for a maximum additional recharge volume of 20 mm3 based on calculations from exp 2 considering a modest scenario of three flooding events per winter season ag sat can increase the shafdan s sat recharge capacity by roughly 50 clearly a more accurate calculation that includes the economic value of the water on one hand and of the infrastructure on the other hand should be carried out but clearly ag sat s potential is evident 4 summary and conclusions the use of an orange orchard as an alternative sat basin was tested during 24 and 48 h winter flooding experiments tww was diverted from an active sat infiltration basin and spread over two agricultural plots containing young citrus trees with different setups flat soil and a ridge the orp conditions and the vwc state were continuously monitored under the plots water samples were collected during flooding experiments at various depths water quality results indicated that in both the flat and the ridge plots tww underwent non negligible biodegradation processes the ridge plot demonstrated prominent contaminant removal similar to the efficiency recorded under sat basins in the shafdan toc degradation was observed during the first 20 h of the experiment in both the flat and ridge plots indicating that sufficient oxygen was available for biodegradation following this period a decrease in toc degradation was noted implying that anoxic conditions prevailed especially in the flat plot the observed vwc illustrated faster rootzone aeration rates following cessation of water application in the ridge plot than in the flat plot the pca indicated that the ridge plot enabled a better supply of dissolved oxygen throughout the flooding phase where do explained over 75 of the variability it is important to note that no damage was inflicted on the trees following prolonged waterlogged conditions this preliminary research suggests that ag sat functions well in terms of both organic matter and n degradation and is comparable at least for the cold season conditions to conventional sat in its biochemical degradation efficiency furthermore ag sat is more beneficial when executed on a ridge setup and for no longer than approximately 20 h of continuous tww flooding for the given soil water properties moreover proper toc biodegradation in the study site may be hindered by a lack of microbial soil maturation therefore if farmlands are to be used as ag sat basins pre maturation of the soil should be considered additionally executing ag sat during the warmer seasons is also an option that should be further investigated although no tree damage was observed during winter ag sat ag sat executed during the warmer seasons when trees are in an active state may have an adverse impact on the crop s health and yield additional plant soil and groundwater processes related to ag sat e g crop yield pathogen contamination pharmaceutical and heavy metal root uptake need further exploration to ensure ag sat s success if ag sat becomes a viable option for stressed sat basins a techno economic evaluation should be performed and suitable regulations should be formulated sat basins are currently constructed for spreading tww with either a flat soil surface or with shallow ridges which eventually flatten following the tww spreading and mechanical tillage modifying the sat basin s flat surface to robust ridges where the top of the ridge is permanently exposed to the atmosphere will likely improve aeration and subsequently improve the recharged effluent quality

9799,soil aquifer treatment sat is a practice used to enhance groundwater storage through intermittent percolation of treated wastewater effluent in designated infiltration basins due to proximity to urban regions land availability for sat infiltration basins is a limiting factor furthermore with the growing population sat systems are faced with an increase in effluent volumes meant for recharge the present study experimentally explores for the first time the feasibility of the short term flooding of a citrus orchard with secondary effluent as an alternative for an additional dedicated infiltration area for sat namely agricultural soil aquifer treatment ag sat orange trees were planted in two different agricultural setups on flat soil and atop a ridge sporadic intermittent winter flooding experiments lasting 24 and 48 h were conducted volumetric water content vwc and oxidation reduction conditions were continuously monitored concurrently water samples were collected and analyzed for total organic carbon and nitrogen species along with leaf health measurements results were compared to an adjacent control plot where no flooding with effluent was applied contaminant removal rates under the ridge setup resembled active sat basins moreover chemical analysis of the water samples and vwc readings demonstrated that higher water quality and faster root zone aeration following flooding were obtained under the ridge which appears to be the better ag sat setup according to a principal component analysis pca the dissolved oxygen explains 75 of the variability of effluent chemistry under the ridge illustrating that oxic conditions prevailed in this setup this study demonstrates that while many other concerns still need to be addressed using agricultural plots as recharge basins for sat during the winter appears to be a promising way to supplement recharge basins while having no impact on tree health keywords agricultural managed aquifer recharge ag mar

suitable for arid and semi arid regions worldwide bouwer 2002 sharma et al 2012 a major limitation in implementing sat is land availability cikurel et al 2010 tsangaratos et al 2017 sat requires vast land surface area for installing infiltration basins this is especially pertinent in urban areas where there is direct competition over real estate since land is limited and expensive niswonger et al 2017 moreover to establish a sat site specific conditions must be present including 1 a thick vadose zone 2 an unconfined underlying aquifer 3 a vadose zone with high soil permeability 4 proximity to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and 5 proximity to locations of potential demand for the recharged effluent dillon et al 2006 these requirements make selecting a sat site challenging furthermore current sat systems often experience an increase in effluent volumes per unit of area originating from wwtps meant for recharge via percolation in infiltration basins i e hydraulic loading rates for different reasons e g the influx of stormwater into the water system de bénédittis and bertrand krajewski 2005 joannis et al 2002 a direct result of intensive hydraulic loading rates is the shortening of drying cycles i e the time between tww flooding events in the sat basin which reduces the quality of the treatment primarily due to a lack of soil aeration ben moshe et al 2020 negev et al 2020 this may be especially relevant during the winter when lower temperatures impede the infiltration rates one reason for this is reduced microbial activity which is temperature dependent and thus lower during the winter months 14 c and 28 c on average during january and july respectively israel meteorological service 2020 as a result organic matter decomposition is diminished causing its accumulation in the topsoil and impeding infiltration another effect of lower temperatures is the increase in water viscosity which has an inverse relation to hydraulic conductivity this results in decreased flux rates of effluent infiltrating through the basin casanova et al 2016 hillel 1980 lin et al 2003 nadav et al 2012 on the other hand volumes headed for sat infiltration may be larger due to undesired intrusion of stormwater into the sewer system since land area for sat is limited an alternative solution may be to use farmlands as temporary sat infiltration basins thus alleviating stress from active sat basins this method is hereafter called agricultural soil aquifer treatment ag sat grinshpan et al 2021 this procedure can be executed on vast agricultural landscapes when many crop species are in a dormant period e g orchards during the winter chill or when no crops are being grown farmlands that meet sat s geo physical requirements may serve as temporary sat basins to

and aquifer recharge the potential advantages and disadvantages of ag sat as well as matters of concern are summarized in grinshpan et al 2021 the goal of this study was to test the feasibility of the ag sat concept in terms of water quality and plant response in our study we tested the use of a citrus orchard as a supplementary infiltration basin for tww transferred from a nearby sat infiltration basin plots were planted with citrus orange trees in the vicinity of a sat basin that is part of israel s dan region reclamation project also known as the shafdan two conventional agricultural settings were tested trees planted on leveled soil hereafter named flat and trees planted on a raised soil bed hereafter named ridge the use of ridges has numerous potential benefits improved crop

wastewater treatment facility currently serving over 2 million inhabitants and treating around 130 140 mm3 of raw wastewater annually aharoni et al 2019 messing and sela 2016 the tww secondary effluent is intermittently discharged into infiltration basins located close to the shafdan plant on sand dunes above israel s coastal aquifer goren et al 2011 herein the effluent percolates through the vadose zone approximately 20 40 m deep goren et al 2014 between the years 2015 and 2017 the effluent volumes generated at the shafdan wwtp increased from 130 to 140 mm3 year aharoni et al 2019 while sat basin recharge capabilities decreased from 125 to 115 mm3 year negev et al 2020 highlighting the need for additional land for sat basins and sparking the concept of ag sat the decline in infiltration rates is mainly attributed to shorter drying cycles and a decrease in tww quality negev et al 2020 the shafdan s sat facilities amount to a total of six infiltration basins divided into the yavne 1 4 and soreq 1 2 facilities fig 1b each basin s surface area totals about 200 000 m2 and is divided into sub basins also known as ponds that are intermittently flooded with tww goren et al 2014 the soil in the shafdan area is typically characterized as sandy in texture lin et al 2004 the study site is located in the soreq 2 facility fig 1b c in the southeast section of soreq 2 two adjacent plots were prepared for citrus tree planting in july 2019 each covering approximately 150 m2 fig 1c d one plot was deliberately flooded with shafdan secondary effluent blue rectangle fig 1c hereafter termed flooded plot while the other served as a control green rectangle fig 1c hereafter termed control plot the flooded plot s aerial distance from the nearest southeast sat infiltration pond was approximately 30 m fig 1d this proximity allowed for technical ease in flooding events where tww was pumped to the flooded plot in both the flooded and the control plot nine trees were planted all trees were shamuti oranges citrus sinesis grafted on a volkamer citrus volkameriana rootstock and were one and a half years old before planting trees were planted in november 2019 and were already bearing fruit each of the plots was divided into two subplots with different agricultural setups four trees were planted on flat soil hereafter termed flat plot with an area of 45 m2 and five trees were planted on a ridge hereafter termed ridge plot with an area of 60 m2 the ridges were formed to be roughly 100 cm wide and 50 cm high the distance between two planted trees was 3 m all trees were regularly irrigated with potable water from the municipal water supply system using a single 20 mm irrigation pipe with two 4 l h drippers per tree irrigation totaled 18 24 l d per tree during the warmer seasons and around 12 l d per tree during the cooler seasons during rain events or at low temperatures irrigation was halted for the chemical properties of the drip irrigation water the reader is referred to the supporting information si table s1 note that irrigation to the flooded plot ceased during the flooding experiment before planting both plots were leveled additionally soil mounds rising approximately 75 cm in height were installed around the plot s perimeter to maintain effluent under ponded conditions inside the plot in the flooded plot a 1 m deep trench was excavated at the plot s edge and a plastic sheet was placed over it subsequently soil was loaded over the plastic sheet this method was implemented to prevent lateral leaks of tww from the orchard s flooded plots and to focus percolation vertically white plastic sheet surrounding the plot fig 1d 2 2 sampling and field measurements two winter flooding experiments were conducted in the first experiment the plots were flooded for 24 h between november 24 and 25 2020 hereafter termed exp 1 in the second experiment the plots were flooded for 48 h between january 4 and 6 2021 hereafter termed exp 2 the duration of these experiments simulated the shafdan sat basin s operational procedure which typically comprises 1 2 days of flooding followed by 2 4 days of drying aharoni et al 2011 icekson tal et al 2003 the analysis presented below focuses mainly on the results of exp 2 the differences between the two experiments results are discussed in section 3 1 note that the results of exp 1 are summarized in the supporting information si fig s4 as well as the climate measurements taken in the study site s area during the flooding experiments si fig s1 the sampling campaigns were conducted in the flooded plot of the orchard study site located in the soreq 2 infiltration basin fig 1c d tww was pumped from the adjacent sat infiltration pond fig 1d using submerged pumps pedrollo vxm 10 50 m verona italy to the flooded plots both flat and ridge it is important to note that an independent supply system was deployed for each flooded plot i e the flat and ridge flooded plots received effluent directly from the sat basin no routing of water between the plots occurred the submerged pumps were activated automatically using water level pressure sensors mpx2010dp freescale semiconductor inc arizona usa when the water levels in the flat and ridge plots were under 25 cm the pumps turned on and later turned off once the water levels reached 30 cm this allowed a stable water level of 25 30 cm in the flooded plot throughout the flooding experiments si fig s2 vadose zone water samples were collected from the flat and ridge plots vadose zone using ceramic suction cups 12 cm long external and internal diameters of 2 cm and 1 7 cm respectively amitens israel the ceramic suction cups were installed beneath the trees in hand drilled holes at depths of 30 and 60 cm fig

probe van london texas usa volumetric water content vwc acclima acc sen sdi tdt sensor idaho usa and oxidation reduction potential orp elh 016 probe van london texas usa soil probes were installed under both the flat and ridge plots at vadose zone depths of 20 30 and 50 cm fig 2 the probes were installed horizontally in hand dug holes and later carefully covered with the same soil the probes were connected to a cr1000 data logger campbell scientific utah usa and sampled year round both the suction cups and the probes depth reference levels were determined as the tree s point of contact with the soil a schematic of the sampling instruments locations and depths within the flooded plot is displayed in fig 2 sensors were installed in december 2019 2 3 leaf measurements tree wellbeing was monitored by measuring leaf parameters these included 1 leaf chlorophyll content using a single photon avalanche diode spad with a konica minolta spad 502 tokyo japan and 2 chlorophyll fluorescence using a mini pam ii heinz walz gmbh effeltrich germany which measures leaf photosynthetic efficiency these two parameters represent tree health status which tends to decrease under flood stress and have previously been used to demonstrate tree response to flooded conditions caudle and maricle 2016 nickum et al 2010 these measurements were carried out prior to and following the flooding experiments in every subplot i e flat and ridge in both flooded and control plots 4 5 trees were sampled to avoid statistical limitation only trees that were genetically identical were planted this is a common practice in citrus research in which plant material is propagated by grafting buds from one clone the scion onto nucellar embryo seedlings from another clone the rootstock mudge et al 2009 from each tree 8 10 leaves were sampled for the physiological measurements 2 4 laboratory methods the water samples were stored in 15 ml plastic vials and kept in a thermally isolated case at 40 c subsequently the samples were analyzed for total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn using a multi n c 2100 s analytik jena ag germany nitrate no3 was measured by ion chromatography thermo scientific dionex ics 5000 massachusetts usa ammonium nh4 was measured by spectrophotometry tecan infinite 200 männedorf switzerland with the nessler reagent method at an absorbance reading of 420 nm major cations ca 2 k mg 2 na fe were analyzed by icp oes spectro arcos fhx22 kleve germany prior to the nh4 no3 and major ion analyses the water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter furthermore the water samples labeled for major ion analyses were acidified with nitric acid to achieve ph 2 2 5 statistical analysis to simplify and visualize high dimensional data sets a principal component analysis pca was performed pca transforms the data matrix containing numerous analyses and measurements collected spatially temporally and over several sampling campaigns into fewer dimensions which constitute a summary of the properties lever et al 2017 it reduces the data geometrically into a new set of variables known as principal components pcs pcs are linear combinations of the original variables and are orthogonal meaning they are uncorrelated typically the first pc pc1 represents the most possible variation of the original data sets the second pc pc2 is the next most possible and so on each observation receives a score value i e the distance from the origin to the projected point for displaying the maximum variance in 2d the scores of pc1 and pc2 are plotted pca finds patterns in the data without prior knowledge of the samples source e g in this case flat or ridge plot depth time of sampling samples with similar features i e chemical composition cluster together according to their score value loadings act as the weights for each variable in the original data set e g toc the direction of the loading vector in relation to the pc s cluster describes which variables dominate the cluster dunn 2020 pca was achieved using matlab version 9 6 0 r2019a natick massachusetts the mathworks inc a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was performed to classify clusters produced by the pca and distinguish them from each other at a confidence level of p 0 05 the permanova was calculated with the vegan package in r software oksanen et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 source and porewater chemistry the study focuses on the topsoil 60 cm since most of the sat processes organic matter and n degradation occur at shallow depths of the vadose zone due to enhanced aeration abel 2014 aharoni et al 2011 amy and drewes 2007 ben moshe et al 2020 essandoh et al 2013 fox et al 2005 goren et al 2014 lin et al 2008 quanrud et al 2003 1996 wilson et al 1995 the observed time series of toc nh4 and no3 concentrations obtained at different depths and locations from exp 2 are summarized in boxplots fig 3 for the complete time series of toc nh4 and no3 the reader is referred to the supporting information si fig s4 and s5 the boxplots illustrate a gradual decrease in toc concentrations among the different setups in general the concentrations decrease with depth fig 3a furthermore nh4 is the dominant species in the source water and at 30 cm in the flat plot on the other hand no3 becomes dominant at 30 cm in the ridge plot and at greater depths under both setups fig 3b from previous field and column studies it was concluded that the main process in organic matter removal during sat is biological degradation essandoh et al 2013 quanrud et al 2005 2003 1996 xue et al 2009 during exp 2 the toc of the secondary effluent source water was removed by approximately 15 and 35 at 30 cm depth in the flat and the ridge plots respectively fig 3a at 60 cm depth the toc was removed by an additional 12 5 in the flat plot while in the ridge plot no additional toc removal was observed fig 3a in contrast to the results obtained during exp 2 exp 1 si fig s4 showed negligible toc degradation with depth in both the flat and the ridge plots during exp 1 both the flat and ridge plots showed about 10 removal of toc at 60 cm depth they were not significantly different from each other according to a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test massey 1951 at a significance level of α 0 05 si table s2 1 it is believed that the differences between the results of exp 1 and exp 2 may be related to microbial maturation of the vadose zone chan et al 2018 maturation of the agricultural field s soil i e the development of a microbial community capable of efficient biodegradation requires a nutrient supply along with proper climate conditions as a rule of thumb sat soil reaches microbial maturity after 3 4 months of tww application soil maturation prior to executing ag sat may be a factor in modifying agricultural plots to function as sat basins brooks et al 2020 pronk et al 2017 quanrud et al 2003 tyagi et al 2009 nh4 concentration levels in the flat plot decreased with depth fig 3b an approximately 20 reduction at 30 cm depth and an additional 40 reduction at 60 cm depth were observed most of the nh4 concentrations decreased by over 97 at 30 cm depth in the ridge plot however an increase in the oxidized form no3 was exhibited at 60 cm depth under both subplots fig 3b the inverse relation i e the decrease in nh4 and rise in no3 suggests that nitrification transpired christensen et al 2000 which is a primary treatment mechanism in sat operations for removal of nh4 goren et al 2014 sopilniak et al 2017 however the transformation of nh4 to no3 cannot explain the entirety of the nitrogen cycle as indicated by the sum of nh4 and no3 in fig 3c the high reduction in the nh4 concentration coupled with the minor no3 concentration increase suggests other nitrogen soil processes such as adsorption assimilation denitrification and loss to greater vadose zone depths chen 1997 miller et al 2006 nieder et al 2011 note that the ph of all water samples ranged between 6 9 and 7 7 which indicates that the volatilization of nh4 is negligible lance 1972 mienis and arye 2018 who examined nitrogen behavior in the shafdan sat basin s vadose zone concluded that total nitrogen removal in the topsoil ranged from 47 to 63 via denitrification and adsorption during exp 2 the sum of nh4 and no3 illustrates similar removal rates of 48 and 75 at 60 cm depth under the flat and the ridge plots respectively an important concern surrounding ag sat is chemical leaching originating mostly from the nitrogen present in the tww and from nitrogen based fertilizers this is a major concern in ag mar murphy et al 2021 and logically it would also be an issue in ag sat the coarse texture of ag sat soil combined with the saturated conditions heightens the risk of no3 leaching burguete et al 2009 mailhol et al 2001 zotarelli et al 2007 unlike sat basins which are well defined in area and operation i e continuously monitored using observation wells ag sat may possibly lack monitoring capabilities since it would be practiced as a supplementary basin for stressed sat facilities thus it would not possess the same infrastructure as sat basins no3 leaching following flooding is likely inevitable in an ag sat setting murphy et al 2021 demonstrated that short lived ag mar flooding events result in no3 leaching in sandy soils their study demonstrated that longer pauses of a few weeks between flooding events increase no3 mobility thus causing higher quantities of no3 to leach this may be a cause for concern since the ag sat plan of action comprises several sporadic flooding events during the winter ultimately the results obtained from the presented study indicate nitrogen species levels in the ag sat site s upper vadose zone especially in the ridge that are similar to those of recharged effluent extracted underneath active sat basins aharoni et al 2019 this study s results demonstrate no major difference in leaching when comparing conventional sat with ag sat that is the water quality generated by ag sat is similar to that of conventional sat toc and nh4 measurements in the study site s vadose zone during exp 2 were significantly different than the tww source water according to a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test α 0 05 si table s2 2 this indicates that the effluent underwent a treatment process while percolating in both subplots moreover a comparison between the flat and the ridge plots regarding toc and nh4 removal illustrates that higher removal rates materialized in the ridge plot moreover the nh4 transformation and removal rates in the ridge plot fig 3b c were similar in value to the removal nh4 underwent in the shafdan sat basins aharoni et al 2019 sopilniak et al 2017 a pca analysis was conducted and is presented in section 3 2 to illustrate the dominant factors that prevailed in the removal processes in the flat and ridge plots 3 2 characterizing ag sat processes a pca was performed to classify samples with similar features into independent clusters and determine each cluster s chemical properties a pca analysis of exp 2 for both the flat and the ridge plots at 30 and 60 cm depths is displayed in fig 4 note that a similar analysis was conducted for the results of exp 1 but it yielded insignificant outcomes data not shown although the pca produces multiple principal components pcs it is common to focus on the foremost components that explain the majority of the variance dunn 2020 in the pca results from exp 2 the first and second pcs explain over 75 of the multi data variability the permanova test showed three clusters that are significantly different from each other according to the pca the water samples obtained in the flat plot are clustered into two groups the first cluster comprises samples from the flat plot at 30 cm depth orange fig 4 while the second cluster contains water samples from the flat plot at 60 cm depth red fig 4 measurements from the ridge plot at both 30 and 60 cm depths showed similar trends and concentrations therefore they are grouped in the same pca cluster green fig 4 the cluster representing the flat plot at 30 cm depth is dominated by toc and nh4 both holding similar weights i e toc and nh4 are equally dominant in this cluster this cluster is characterized by low toc degradation and low nitrification rates the second sample group representing the flat plot at 60 cm depth is characterized by elevated no3 concentrations illustrating that nitrification only partially occurred not all nh4 was consumed silver et al 2018 thus nitrification is the primary process in separating the clusters of the flat plot the third sample group representing the ridge plot at both depths 30 and 60 cm was characterized primarily by do along both pc axes and no3 along the pc2 axis fig 4 these results classify this group as being subjected to better aeration as explained by over 75 of the variability elevated no3 concentrations with a higher presence of oxygen are an indicator for aerobic conditions and subsequent microbial oxidation processes transforming the nh4 in the secondary effluent to no3 essandoh et al 2013 goren et al 2014 miller et al 2006 the removal rates of toc and nh4 under the ridge at 60 cm depth compared to the flat plot at the same depth were more efficient by 15 and 90 respectively additionally toc and nh4 measurements at both the flat and ridge plots at 60 cm depth were significantly different according to a two sample kolmogorov smirnov test α 0 05 si table s2 3 implying that the treatment process differed in both subplots therefore the contaminant removal was more prominent in the ridge plot probably due to improved oxic conditions in the shallower depths where oxygen was available for biological action results from the pca conducted for exp 2 illustrate the prominent characteristics of each clustered group and simplify the differences between them the pca indicates that the flat plot was governed by elevated levels of toc and nh4 while in the ridge do prevailed 3 3 optimal flooding length under flooded conditions physical restriction of atmospheric gas diffusion in the soil leads to a depletion of soil oxygen jackson and drew 1984 pedersen et al 2017 the oxygen limited in the soil pores is depleted by microorganisms and roots which subsequently reduces the soil oxidation reduction potential orp mv conditions fiedler et al 2007 ponnamperuma 1972 following waterlogged conditions a decrease in orp is expected to increase toc concentrations husson 2013 aerated soil orp is generally greater than 350 mv i e oxygen is not a limiting factor while below this value low oxygen conditions prevail pezeshki and delaune 2012 fig 5 illustrates the time lapse of orp and toc removal measurements throughout exp 2 note that the orp readings in the ridge plot at 30 cm depth showed high positive values 350 400 mv throughout 48 h of flooding indicating oxic conditions si fig s6 this is due to the setup differences fig 2 si fig s8 where most of the process at 30 cm in the ridge plot occurs close to the atmosphere which supports a continuous oxygen supply thus the results obtained from 30 cm depth in the flat plot are compared to observations from 50 to 60 cm in the ridge plot si fig s8 once flooding started the orp in the flat plot at 30 cm depth showed a gradual decline fig 5 orange line this trend lasted for approximately 24 h following this period a slight decrease in orp values was observed in the flat plot at 30 cm depth until the 40 hour mark fig 5 in the ridge plot at 50 cm depth the orp conditions initially dropped sharply fig 5 red line following this drop in values a minor decrease was measured for the next 20 h following this period no further decrease in orp values was observed note that the orp measurements displayed a steady value of 135 mv in both plots 40 h after the flooding began throughout the flooding the orp did not go below 135 mv in either setup at any stage moreover a ferrozine analysis conducted gibbs 1976 stookey 1970 showed no evidence of a significant reducing environment during the flooding experiment this method assists in verifying whether reducing conditions prevailed through determining the ferro charge in the effluent the ferrozine results support the sensor s orp measurements pre flooding orp conditions i e 300 mv were regained between two flat and 10 days ridge after flooding ceased the toc removal percentage in the flat and ridge plots at 30 and 60 cm depths demonstrated initial values of about 14 and 10 respectively suggesting that part of the degradation process already occurred before the effluent shafdan secondary effluent reached these depths and locations fig 5 this is consistent with goren et al 2014 and suggests some degradation of organic matter in the pond before infiltration the first 12 h in the flat plot at 30 cm depth displayed a slight increasing trend of toc removal from approximately 14 23 the following eight hours in the flat plot at 30 cm depth illustrated a steady state toc removal value of about 23 fig 5 the toc concentration in the ridge plot at 60 cm depth showed a more substantial trend of toc removal during the first 12 h compared to the flat plot at 30 cm suggesting that during this stage the degradation process was enhanced at 60 cm depth in the ridge plot probably due to better soil aeration fig 5 the following eight hours in the ridge plot at 60 cm depth illustrated a steady state toc removal value of about 40 fig 5 it is important to note that based on saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements table 1 si s1 the travel times of the source water to the flat and ridge plots at 30 and 60 cm depths are roughly 4 8 and 7 h respectively about 20 h after the flooding began the toc removal rates in both the flat and the ridge plots showed a trend of decrease fig 5 at the end of the experiment the toc concentrations in the flat plot at 30 cm depth were very similar to the source water concentrations which suggests that no toc removal occurred at the end of the flooding experiment fig 5 the toc removal percentage in the ridge plot showed a trend of slight decrease following 20 h of flooding however during this stage the toc removal was still around 30 toc concentrations were still 30 lower than the source water and flat plot fig 5 for the timeseries containing the concentration values of the source water and the flat and ridge plots at 30 and 60 cm respectively the reader is referred to the supporting information si fig s7 based on the observations we suggest that sufficient oxygen was available for toc biodegradation during the initial 20 h following the start of ag sat flooding after this period oxygen availability was insufficient for optimal microbial degradation expressed in the negligible toc removal especially in the flat plot the source of dissolved oxygen in the subsurface is primarily a combination of dissolved oxygen transported with the infiltrating waters and oxygen gas available initially in the soil prior to the flooding event as in the shafdan sat basin operation cikurel et al 2012 limiting the ag sat flooding to 20 h may be preferred to allow replenishment of air into the ag sat system and ensure toc removal thus obtaining a higher quality recharged effluent 3 4 aeration conditions the technical and physical properties of the experimental ag sat plots are presented in table 1 the ks values measured in the ag sat study site are comparable to sandy soil lal 2016 which is suitable for sat infiltration basins crites et al 2006 pescod 1992 for explanations of the ks calculations the reader is referred to the supporting information si s1 drying time hours refers to the time between the cessation of water supply to the plots i e end of flooding experiment and the beginning of the decline in vwc observations si fig s9 although lower ks rates were measured under the ridge in both experiments the soil aeration conditions were established faster when compared to the flat plot the faster aeration rate of the ridge s rootzone is related to the water distribution on the soil surface fig 2 si fig s8 in the flat plot the water was mounded on top of the entire plot surface throughout the experiment however in the ridge plot the water was mostly dispersed in the trench surrounding the ridge the raised soil bed with the ridge being continuously aerated to some degree hamilton et al 2000 manik et al 2019 whealy 1992 note that the trees rootzone is mainly located in the ridge due to better aeration and water source during the dry season drip irrigation fageria 2012 therefore the vwc in the ridge s rootzone is directly affected by the water level on the sides of the ridge the decline in surface water level is reflected by the decrease in vwc si fig s9 thus the drying phase in the flat plot occurs only when there is no water at the soil surface while the drying phase in the ridge co occurs with the decline in surface water level as seen in si fig s8 from a hydrological perspective the faster rootzone aeration rate of the ridge plot demonstrates the advantage of this setup in obtaining drying conditions rapid rootzone aeration rates are beneficial in both a sat and an agricultural aspect better aeration results in the accelerated re introduction of oxygen improving the effluent s treatment ben moshe et al 2020 while also shortening waterlogged conditions causing less water stress in the trees rootzone drew 1997 3 5 the effect of flooding on plant properties the citrus trees in both the flat and ridge plots showed no damage following the flooding events spad and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of the flooded plot trees before and after flooding were compared to the control plot trees using the kolmogorov smirnov test α 0 05 si table s2 4 fig 6 insignificant differences were observed between all plots regardless of the treatment this is probably due to the fact that waterlogging is less harmful during the winter than in the warmer growing season due to the roots and micro organisms minimal demand for oxygen in winter glenz et al 2006 kozlowski and pallardy 1997 moreover this result suggests that the improved rootzone aeration measured for the ridge plot was insufficient to create any measurable difference in the plant parameters these results demonstrate that utilizing farmlands as supplementary sat basins a few times during the winter with a lengthy pause between flooding cycles would likely have a negligible if any negative effect on the trees health 3 6 ag sat potential israel s case a fundamental analysis of the potential for ag sat in israel is presented here the recharge of israel s coastal aquifer consists primarily of rainfall infiltration of floodwater and deliberate tww infiltration via sat basins weinberger et al 2012 using geographic information system gis software arcmap the area containing orchards above the coastal aquifer was calculated si fig s10 the recharge area of the israeli coastal aquifer extends over 1670 km2 iwa 2021 where 14 of this area contains orchards 230 km2 moag 2021 using the shafdan operating area above the israeli coastal aquifer 200 km2 as an example there are 25 km2 of potential orchard farmlands where ag sat may be practiced i e provided that the orchards geo physical properties meet the requirements to serve as temporary sat basins dillon et al 2006 currently the shafdan s six active sat sites encompass a combined area of about 1 2 km2 dedicated to tww infiltration fig 1a these sat basins annually infiltrate approximately 125 mm3 negev et al 2020 the utilization of 25 km2 in a single 24 hour ag sat flooding event would allow for a maximum additional recharge volume of 20 mm3 based on calculations from exp 2 considering a modest scenario of three flooding events per winter season ag sat can increase the shafdan s sat recharge capacity by roughly 50 clearly a more accurate calculation that includes the economic value of the water on one hand and of the infrastructure on the other hand should be carried out but clearly ag sat s potential is evident 4 summary and conclusions the use of an orange orchard as an alternative sat basin was tested during 24 and 48 h winter flooding experiments tww was diverted from an active sat infiltration basin and spread over two agricultural plots containing young citrus trees with different setups flat soil and a ridge the orp conditions and the vwc state were continuously monitored under the plots water samples were collected during flooding experiments at various depths water quality results indicated that in both the flat and the ridge plots tww underwent non negligible biodegradation processes the ridge plot demonstrated prominent contaminant removal similar to the efficiency recorded under sat basins in the shafdan toc degradation was observed during the first 20 h of the experiment in both the flat and ridge plots indicating that sufficient oxygen was available for biodegradation following this period a decrease in toc degradation was noted implying that anoxic conditions prevailed especially in the flat plot the observed vwc illustrated faster rootzone aeration rates following cessation of water application in the ridge plot than in the flat plot the pca indicated that the ridge plot enabled a better supply of dissolved oxygen throughout the flooding phase where do explained over 75 of the variability it is important to note that no damage was inflicted on the trees following prolonged waterlogged conditions this preliminary research suggests that ag sat functions well in terms of both organic matter and n degradation and is comparable at least for the cold season conditions to conventional sat in its biochemical degradation efficiency furthermore ag sat is more beneficial when executed on a ridge setup and for no longer than approximately 20 h of continuous tww flooding for the given soil water properties moreover proper toc biodegradation in the study site may be hindered by a lack of microbial soil maturation therefore if farmlands are to be used as ag sat basins pre maturation of the soil should be considered additionally executing ag sat during the warmer seasons is also an option that should be further investigated although no tree damage was observed during winter ag sat ag sat executed during the warmer seasons when trees are in an active state may have an adverse impact on the crop s health and yield additional plant soil and groundwater processes related to ag sat e g crop yield pathogen contamination pharmaceutical and heavy metal root uptake need further exploration to ensure ag sat s success if ag sat becomes a viable option for stressed sat basins a techno economic evaluation should be performed and suitable regulations should be formulated sat basins are currently constructed for spreading tww with either a flat soil surface or with shallow ridges which eventually flatten following the tww spreading and mechanical tillage modifying the sat basin s flat surface to robust ridges where the top of the ridge is permanently exposed to the atmosphere will likely improve aeration and subsequently improve the recharged effluent quality
