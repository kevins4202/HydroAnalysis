19660,waterborne human enteric viruses such as noroviruses and adenoviruses are excreted in the feces of infected individuals and transmitted via the fecal oral route including contaminated food and water since viruses are normally present at low concentrations in aquatic environments they should be concentrated into smaller volumes prior to downstream molecular biological applications such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr this review describes recent progress made in the development of concentration and detection methods of human enteric viruses in water and discusses their applications for providing a better understanding of the prevalence of the viruses in various types of water worldwide maximum concentrations of human enteric viruses in water that have been reported in previous studies are summarized to assess viral abundances in aquatic environments some descriptions are also available on recent applications of sequencing analyses used to determine the genetic diversity of viral genomes in water samples including those of novel viruses furthermore the importance and significance of utilizing appropriate process controls during viral analyses are discussed and three types of process controls are considered whole process controls molecular process controls and reverse transcription rt qpcr controls although no standards have been established for acceptable values of virus recovery and or extraction rt qpcr efficiency use of at least one of these appropriate control types is highly recommended for more accurate interpretation of observed data

concentrations in the feces of infected individuals up to 1011 viruses g feces with or without symptoms and are transmitted via the fecal oral route including contaminated food and water bosch 1998 wyn jones and sellwood 2001 prüss et al 2002 currently treated or untreated sewage and combined sewer overflows from urban areas are the major sources of environmental pollution from human enteric viruses in surface waters fong and lipp 2005 rodríguez et al 2012 since human enteric viruses are not able to grow outside their host cells efficient removal and or inactivation of these viruses at wastewater treatment plants wwtps can contribute greatly to reducing the amount of viruses discharged into an environment installation of appropriate wastewater treatment systems can result in controlling the risk of viral infection via various routes such as contact with recreational waters ingestion of potable water or consumption of virus contaminated shellfish however it is very difficult to achieve the complete removal of viruses with conventional wastewater treatment processes sano et al 2016 many studies have focused so far on the detection of human enteric viruses in various types of aquatic environments such as raw and treated wastewater surface water groundwater seawater and even treated drinking water fong and lipp 2005 gerba et al 2013 since human enteric viruses are present generally at relatively low concentrations in environmental water samples it is essential to begin these types of studies by concentrating the viruses into smaller sample volumes to enhance the usefulness of detection assays the development and application of methods for concentrating viruses have contributed significantly to the detection of diverse viruses using culture or molecular based assays ikner et al 2012 cashdollar and wymer 2013 the rapid advancement of molecular biological techniques such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr has enabled us to obtain quantitative information about the viral genomes present in water although qpcr itself provides quantitative data with high accuracy concentrations obtained via this method should be interpreted very carefully because of potential losses in efficiency during the detection process including virus concentration steps dna rna extractions reverse transcription rt and qpcr use of process controls or internal external controls is now becoming common practice in evaluating the efficiency of virus recovery and level of inhibition during the detection process during the virus detection process there are a few points at which a process control can be added to a sample since different types of process controls are recommended depending on the point of inoculation use of process controls should be considered prior to starting a field survey to determine the prevalence of viruses in that particular water sample despite great efforts viruses sometimes are not detected in tested water samples these data called non detects should be considered for more appropriate data treatments however previous studies rarely have considered this issue important this review paper describes the latest knowledge regarding detection methods of human enteric viruses in aquatic environments including molecular biological techniques such as rt qpcr cloning sequencing and viral metagenomic analysis as well as their applications for detecting and evaluating various types of indigenous viruses in water worldwide in addition we describe the importance of using appropriate process controls in these types of studies to the best of our knowledge this is the first paper summarizing in detail the current knowledge about the application of process controls to virus detection in water 2 methods for concentrating and detecting human enteric viruses in water 2 1 methods for concentrating viruses quantities of human enteric viruses can vary greatly depending on the types of water in which they are found high concentrations of target viruses may be detected easily from relatively small volumes of wastewater or sludge samples 100 ml whereas for surface recreational and drinking waters larger volumes 10 1000 l or more are often required for detection due to significantly lower viral concentrations for this reason most studies employ one or more in series methods for concentrating viruses in water samples when considering concentration methods several factors such as water quality or sample volume are important because they easily affect the efficiencies of virus concentration and downstream detection techniques this has become especially important given the frequent use of pcr based techniques for detection as organic matters present in environmental samples e g humic acids or chemicals added during concentration elution e g beef extract or sodium polyphosphate napp can inhibit dna rna extractions and subsequent rt and pcr qpcr detection steps ikner et al 2011 2012 cashdollar and wymer 2013 in addition one single method may result in variable efficiencies for different viruses a single method is generally not capable of concentrating all viruses equally in a given water sample thus selection of appropriate concentration methods with respect to sample types can improve virus detectability previous studies have employed numerous primary and secondary virus concentration methods for environmental samples including virus adsorption and elution viradel size exclusion and coagulation flocculation early efforts to concentrate viruses from water have been summarized in other reviews ikner et al 2012 cashdollar and wymer 2013 these include two phase separation techniques polyethylene glycol hydroextraction dialysis soluble membranes ultracentrifugation precipitation by salt addition etc methods using celite and non flocculating beef extract are also used mainly for secondary concentration mcminn et al 2012 brinkman et al 2013 mcminn and korajkic 2015 rhodes et al 2016 since many of these methods were developed to concentrate viruses in relatively small volumes of water 1 l applications to field studies targeting larger water volumes are sometimes difficult however these methods are still used in many studies today as primary or secondary concentration methods the viradel technique using electronegative membranes is used widely for a variety of water sample types prior to concentrating viruses the addition of salt e g mgcl2 is required to facilitate the binding of the negatively charged viruses to the membrane wallis and melnick 1967 except for in seawater where the bridging cations are already present katayama et al 2002 demonstrated that rinsing filters with an acid h2so4 to remove cationic salts prior to the final elution of viruses with naoh improved virus recovery in addition this simple elution matrix reduced the potential inhibition of dna rna extractions or rt qpcr that is frequently associated with organic eluents such as beef extract this method has also been used for concentrating viruses from various types of water samples including seawater tap water surface water and wastewater although recovery can vary greatly depending on the types of water and viruses examined katayama et al 2002 haramoto et al 2009 victoria et al 2009 fong et al 2010 this elution method has been modified further to facilitate the filtration of larger samples 40 l for river water and 1000 l for tap water using a cartridge type mixed cellulose ester filter opticap xl pore size 0 5 μm merck millipore billerica usa hata et al 2015 and has also been used for concentrating viruses from drinking water treatment facilities asami et al 2016 the addition of cationic salts represents the primary difficulty in making this a field ready method nevertheless several studies have adapted this method for use in the field with an in line addition of a concentrated cation solution to the sample just before filtration hata et al 2015 asami et al 2016 other studies have overcome this difficulty by adding the cationic salt to the membrane prior to filtering water samples haramoto et al 2004 2005 2010 electropositive media and filters have been used for concentrating viruses in several formats including 1mds filters 3m maplewood usa ikner et al 2012 cashdollar and wymer 2013 nanoceram filters argonide sanford usa have been recently evaluated and recommended as a more cost effective successor of the 1mds filter the nanoceram filter is composed of nano alumina fibers dispersed in a non woven microglass fiber matrix and was evaluated first for viradel primary concentration karim et al 2009 initial comparisons with the 1mds showed greater recovery of evs in tap water and river water from 10 l samples and a comparable recovery from 100 l samples karim et al 2009 bennett et al 2010 also investigated the use of the nanoceram material in a disposable capsule format and found greater recovery of ms2 coliphage from deionized water when compared to 1mds and from artificial seawater when compared to opticap xl without the need for cationic salt addition ikner et al 2011 found that nanoceram filters have high virus retention 99 8 and thus investigated elution methods to improve the efficiency of virus recovery resulting in the highest known recovery 86 for ms2 coliphage with a 1 napp 0 05 m glycine solution concentrating viruses with the nanoceram filter media has been demonstrated now in drinking water ye et al 2012 cashdollar et al 2013 surface water prevost et al 2015b and wastewater soto beltran et al 2013 chaudhry et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 several studies have reported lower recoveries of advs using nanoceram than of other viruses 14 from tap water ikner et al 2011 1 4 5 from seawater gibbons et al 2010 and 0 02 from lake water francy et al 2013 whereas mcminn 2013 succeeded in improving recoveries of advs using small disk filters skimmed milk flocculation recently has been demonstrated as a low cost one step virus concentration method this process involves flocculation of viruses in pre acidified water samples ph 3 5 to skimmed milk proteins followed by stirring for 8 h and gravity sedimentation of the floc for an additional 8 h after removal of the supernatant the sedimented floc is centrifuged to obtain the pellet which is subsequently resuspended in phosphate buffer applicability of this method has been demonstrated for seawater calgua et al 2008 and river water calgua et al 2013 yielding recovery values of approximately 50 for adv nov of genogroup ii nov gii jc polyomavirus jcpyv and rotavirus rv from 5 to 10 l samples while this method has demonstrated high recovery rates with low variability efficiencies for volumes 10 l have not been demonstrated this could be due to the impracticality of sedimenting and removing supernatant from larger sample volumes which limits the usefulness of this technique for field studies as is clear from these studies no single method seems to be entirely effective for concentrating all enteric viruses of interest from various types of water this concept is especially important given the rise of several new target viruses of interest e g pyvs and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov therefore concentration methods may need to be reevaluated with the recovery efficiencies of these new viruses in mind prior to field applications for example pmmov has been presented as a promising indicator of virus removal in drinking water treatment plants asami et al 2016 however the recovery of this virus by existing concentration methods could prove challenging due to differences in shape surface charge and other characteristics from enteric viruses as a result experimentation on recovery efficiencies will be required for successful field studies many recent studies did not determine recovery efficiencies for their concentration techniques used assuming that previously established methods would behave similarly van den berg et al 2005 simmons and xagoraraki 2011 pérez sautu et al 2012 kitajima et al 2014c kuroda et al 2015 given the variability of viral recoveries from different water matrices as well as the unknown recoveries of emerging viruses regularly including viral concentration efficiency controls will be highly valuable for this type of research 2 2 methods for simultaneously concentrating multiple microbes the idea of using a single concentration method for evaluating multiple classes of microbes e g viruses bacteria and protozoa in water samples is of great interest to researchers and water utility practitioners several studies have evaluated such methods for the simultaneous concentration of multiple classes of microbes ultrafiltration is theoretically a reasonable choice for this type of procedure using only a single filter because all microbes larger than the molecular weight cutoff for that filter can be concentrated from a water sample hill et al 2005 kahler et al 2015 used a tangential flow ultrafiltration method to concentrate escherichia coli clostridium perfringens cryptosporidium parvum echovirus type 1 ms2 and φx174 coliphages spiked in groundwater and surface water samples results indicated that 66 95 recoveries were observed for all microbes tested dead end ultrafiltration has also been demonstrated for simultaneous recovery of ms2 coliphage c parvum enterococci e coli and c perfringens with similarly high recoveries smith and hill 2009 mull and hill 2012 francy et al 2013 compared several filtration methods including glass wool nanoceram continuous flow centrifugation with a virocap capsule filter scientific methods granger usa tangential flow and dead end ultrafiltrations for their abilities to simultaneously concentrate multiple microbes both ultrafiltration methods and continuous flow centrifugation with virocap were found to be reasonable options for concentrating several indicator bacteria e coli and enterococci ms2 coliphage and protozoa cryptosporidium and giardia recovery of enteric viruses was generally lower for all tested methods haramoto et al 2011 2012a successfully used electronegative mixed cellulose ester membranes pore size 0 45 μm for the simultaneous concentration of viruses and protozoa from wastewater river water and groundwater samples for this method electronegative membranes that were previously known for viradel based virus concentration katayama et al 2002 were further used for recovery of protozoan oo cysts haramoto et al 2012b kitajima et al 2014a viruses were captured by electrostatic interactions while cryptosporidium and giardia oo cysts were recovered by size exclusion since this approach can be easily combined with previously established virus concentration methods using disk filters with no decrease in virus recovery it could serve as a suitable method for presenting the occurrences of not only viruses but also protozoa in a single water sample 2 3 virus detection methods historically cell culture methods have been the gold standard for the detection of infectious viruses however pcr and qpcr methods have rapidly become a mainstay of enteric virus detection in water samples this is largely due to shorter detection times within hours high sensitivity and specificity as well as the ability to detect viruses that are not easily culturable and tend to evade detection by culture based methods the flexibility of primer probe design means that assays can be tailored to the desired specificity toward broad detection of an entire virus clade e g enteroviruses or toward more specific virus strains depending on the chosen target dna rna sequences simultaneous detection of multiple targets in a sample is possible with multiplex qpcr assays that use different fluorophores for different targets although this method is limited by the wavelengths that current qpcr instruments can detect typically 2 to 5 wavelength ranges kang et al 2013 to overcome this limitation high throughput qpcr using microfluidic technology has been demonstrated as a direct multi pathogen detection method for environmental water samples this method uses microfluidic chips that enable simultaneous high throughput quantification of large sample sizes for numerous enteric viruses and other pathogens for example a 96 96 dynamic array chip fluidigm south san francisco usa can be used for 9216 qpcr reactions in any combination such as 96 target assays for 96 samples ishii et al 2014 demonstrated this technology for quantifying 11 different target enteric viruses where novs gi gii and rv were detected in a wastewater impacted river water pcr based methods have the disadvantage of being susceptible to inhibitory substances that are often co concentrated with viruses such as humic acids which are frequently present in environmental water samples magnetic bead based extraction methods are sometimes used being expected that they work more effectively to remove rt qpcr inhibitors than spin column based methods la rosa et al 2010a hata et al 2011 selected use of dna polymerases including their mutants that have high resistance against inhibitors is an important option for reducing inhibitory effects kermekchiev et al 2009 matheson et al 2010 digital pcr dpcr has recently gained attention as a means of direct absolute quantification of viral gene copies in a sample without the necessity of calibration by standards of known concentrations monteiro and santos 2017 these methods involve partitioning target dna rna molecules and rt pcr master mix into several thousand 10 50k small volume typically nanoliters pcr reactions after which the numbers of positive reactions are determined and absolute quantities are calculated based on the poisson statistics one major advantage of dpcr is the method s tolerance to inhibitory substances due to the fact that unlike qpcr qualitative amplification of target genomes is less affected by pcr inhibitors several different dpcr platforms have been developed such as droplet dpcr where water in oil emulsion droplets are used on a microfluidic chip hoshino and inagaki 2012 found that copy numbers were determined more accurately in humic acid enriched and environmental samples using microfluidic dpcr than qpcr kishida et al 2014 demonstrated the use of microfluidic dpcr for the detection of advs in river water rački et al 2014 developed a one step rt droplet based dpcr method for the detection of a waterborne rna virus spiked rv and similarly an rt microfluidic dpcr assay by coudray meunier et al 2015 demonstrated the detection of spiked novs gi and gii both studies were found to be similarly tolerant to inhibitory substances pcr based methods however are less suitable for differentiating infective viruses from non infective viruses as is typically applied several detection methods for viruses in water bosch et al 2011 as well as methods to determine viral infectivity hamza et al 2011 have been reviewed previously in greater detail a combination of cell culture methods and molecular methods has been realized with integrated cell culture icc pcr which incorporates the benefits of both methods to overcome the shortfalls of each by propagating target viruses and making their rt pcr detection easier difficulties with culture based methods for quantification of indigenous viruses in environmental water samples are less of an issue the application of icc pcr to the detection of enteric viruses in water was initially proposed by reynolds et al 1996 and then applied to the monitoring of infectious viruses in environmental waters chapron et al 2000 wong et al 2009 li et al 2010 2011b ming et al 2011 and evaluations of disinfection efficacy ko et al 2005 gerrity et al 2008 li et al 2009 lambertini et al 2010 proposed growth kinetics approaches for obtaining quantitative results buffalo green monkey kidney vero and ma 104 cells have frequently been used for icc pcr but cell tropism limits the range of viral species and types that can be detected by icc pcr incubation times can take up to 10 days reynolds et al 1996 but a 24 h incubation period is often sufficient when the concentration of infectious viruses becomes sufficiently high mayer et al 2010 several studies have proposed the specific detection of the replication intermediate products of viral genomes mrna for dna viruses or negative strand rna for positive single stranded rna viruses by rt pcr to obtain evidence for viral replication and to assess viral infectivity more accurately ko et al 2003 lambertini et al 2010 viral infectivity has also been examined by culture independent methods such as multiple target region pcr pecson et al 2011 long target region pcr shin and sobsey 2003 simonet and gantzer 2006 affinity separation of viral antigens associated with a viral genome prior to pcr li et al 2011a hwang et al 2007 enzymatic treatment of viral particles prior to rt pcr nuanualsuwan and cliver 2002 pecson et al 2009 intercalating dye pre treatments of viral particles prior to rt pcr parshionikar et al 2010 kim et al 2011 and separation of biotinylated viral particles prior to rt pcr sano et al 2010 2015 tojo et al 2013 since each approach has both pros and cons hamza et al 2011 it is important to clarify applicable situations for the approaches so that public health workers and water engineers can select best fit techniques for their circumstances sano et al 2015 applications of culture independent methods are often limited to disinfection studies so examples of their use in evaluating viral persistence in environmental water samples are rare in the literature prevost et al 2016 in addition although it has not been investigated at this point given the complexity of environmental samples it is expected that these methods could be impacted by inhibitory substances in water matrices and this requires further investigation the culture based methods and icc pcr are not applicable to non cultivable enteric viruses historically human novs hunovs have been non cultivable in laboratory adapted animal cell lines but recently hunov replication in b cells jones et al 2014 and stem cell derived human enteroids ettayebi et al 2016 has been reported this may make it possible to analyze the infectious titer of hunovs in environmental samples in the near future however the fact that a number of researchers have studied enteric viruses using a variety of cell lines leads us to speculate that enteric viruses discovered in the future despite the approached used including metagenomics aw et al 2014 will be non cultivable at least immediately after discovery sano et al 2015 indeed it becomes increasingly unrealistic to expect the development of cell culture methods at its current rate to maintain pace with new discoveries of unknown viral strains and the emergence of new enteric viruses of interest 3 process controls for assessing the efficiency of virus detection 3 1 necessity of process controls in general the qpcr based detection of viruses in water consists of three steps 1 concentrate viruses into appropriate volume 2 extract dna rna and 3 perform rt qpcr to obtain accurate results all steps should be conducted with acceptable levels of efficiency various methods have been applied for each of these steps to allow the most efficient virus detection from water samples however most of the methods showed inconsistencies at times particularly when the sample contained specific inhibitory substances a variety of methods to remove or inactivate such substances have been reported schrader et al 2012 however none of the methods are effective all the time schrader et al 2012 possible decreases in the quantification efficiency should be considered to assess the efficiency of the processes so called process controls or internal external controls should be used such controls can be roughly classified into three types in accordance with the materials used as well as the points at which the controls are spiked into the sample 1 whole process controls wpcs which are added into the sample before viruses are concentrated 2 molecular process controls mpcs which are added before nucleic acid extractions and 3 rt qpcr controls which are added before the rt qpcr processes observed recovery yields of the controls are affected by the efficiencies of the downstream processes fig 1 illustrates the framework for different types of process controls that are recommended for inclusion during virus detection procedures as summarized in table 1 various types of process controls have been employed in previous studies at least one of the process controls listed here should be added to all the water samples analyzed for viruses with a clear understanding of the importance of utilizing appropriate process controls recovery yields of the process controls reflect the effects of inhibitors which is useful for better understanding the study s findings many previous studies have attempted to set a threshold value for the expected recovery of process controls to validate the reliability of virus detection however as shown below there is currently no consensus on that threshold recovery value 3 2 whole process controls wpcs to determine the efficiency of the process by which virus particles are concentrated known amounts of viral particles are spiked into samples and then recovered after the concentration step fig 1 and table 1 some studies have prepared a sample set that is used only for recovery of the control borchardt et al 2003 rezaeinejad et al 2014 prevost et al 2015b these trials have advantages in that a target virus itself can also be selected as the control consequently the obtained recovery efficiency is likely to be reliable for instance some of the studies targeting indigenous evs adopted a vaccine strain of poliovirus pv as the control borchardt et al 2003 hata et al 2014 wurtzer et al 2014 when pcr based quantification was applied to detect the control the recovery was affected not only by virus concentration efficiency but also by the efficiencies of the nucleic acid extraction and rt qpcr thus these kinds of controls are called wpcs culture based assays are often employed to specifically evaluate virus concentration efficiency easily cultivable controls such as coliphages pv and murine norovirus mnv are frequently used as wpcs but in some cases pcr based quantification has been used to estimate the recovery borchardt et al 2003 jiang et al 2007 rajal et al 2007 minamoto et al 2009 fumian et al 2010 honjo et al 2010 mormann et al 2010 poma et al 2012 ye et al 2012 de keuckelaere et al 2013 kundu et al 2013 mäde et al 2013 muscillo et al 2013 hata et al 2014 wurtzer et al 2014 as shown in table 1 several viruses have been used to determine the efficiency of concentrating viral particles however the representativeness of the spiked control is questionable a study by petterson et al 2015 revealed that the recovery efficiency of spiked mengovirus mgv was not correlated to those of indigenous advs and novs the study also showed that the virus recovery efficiency can vary by over six orders of magnitude petterson et al 2015 similarly hennechart collette et al 2015 suggested that a control which is a good representative of the target in a sample matrix does not always work as expected in other sample matrix types thus use of spiked controls to estimate the efficiency of a virus concentration process needs to be further investigated also there is an issue with the use of pv vaccine strains as wpc the progress made by the world health organization who program for eradicating wild type pv may make it difficult to keep and prepare pv vaccine strains in laboratories the who global action plan stipulated a non retention policy for oral pv type 2 sabin2 materials for all pv non essential laboratory facilities when pv type 2 was eradicated who 2014 pv vaccines strains will no longer be available for use as a control it is desirable to examine the recovery of a wpc for all water samples tested but it may not be practical to perform controls at every sampling time especially for wpcs quantified by culture based assays even in such situations it is highly recommended to add a wpc to water samples and store the viral concentrates in a freezer for possible future analysis by pcr based assays on the other hand in cases when large volumes of water are being processed or virus concentration procedures must be conducted in the field the inclusion of a wpc is likely to be difficult or impossible due to compliance with biohazard policies however even in those cases wpcs are recommended perhaps on a smaller scale in the laboratory to routinely test recovery efficiencies during a study period 3 3 molecular process controls mpcs to assess the efficiency of nucleic acid extractions viral particles are widely used as process controls fig 1 and table 1 for instance mgv belonging to the family picornaviridae is used for studies targeting hepatitis a virus hav novs gi and gii in water and other food samples da silva et al 2007 2008 le guyader et al 2009 2010 pintó et al 2009 zakhour et al 2010 sano et al 2011 sima et al 2011 lowther et al 2012 flannery et al 2013 de man et al 2014 chaudhry et al 2015 coudray meunier et al 2015 hennechart collette et al 2015 similarly mnv diez valcarce et al 2011 hata et al 2011 2013 2014 béji hamza et al 2014 ishii et al 2014 hennechart collette et al 2015 and armored rna hepatitis g virus hgv rna coated by ms2 capsid lambertini et al 2008 gibson and schwab 2011 are often used some other studies have used unique process controls for extractions such as advs types 2 and 5 hata et al 2011 2014 chaudhry et al 2015 ms2 coliphage navidad et al 2013 wurtzer et al 2014 prevost et al 2015b pp7 bacteriophage rajal et al 2007 and feline calicivirus jones et al 2009 la rosa et al 2010c it is noteworthy that if a process control is inoculated into a sample just before the extraction process its recovery can be affected by downstream molecular assays i e extraction and rt qpcr processes even if extraction efficiencies for the target virus and process control or mpc are similar their rt qpcr efficiencies can be different for specific estimations of extraction efficiencies some studies have attempted to minimize the effects of rt pcr inhibition by diluting the nucleic acid extract hata et al 2011 sima et al 2011 de man et al 2014 it is believed that genetically similar viruses are extracted with similar efficiencies by nucleic acid extraction methods costafreda et al 2006 for this reason mgv has been used commonly as the control for indicating the extraction efficiency of hav rna costafreda et al 2006 pintó et al 2009 uhrbrand et al 2010 however standardization procedures international organization for standardization 2017 indicate the use of mgv as the appropriate process control to be applied for the detection of novs from the family caliciviridae and some other viruses da silva et al 2007 2008 le guyader et al 2009 2010 zakhour et al 2010 sima et al 2011 sano et al 2011 lowther et al 2012 flannery et al 2013 de man et al 2014 these previous studies imply that molecular controls can indicate the occurrence of inhibitory effects but cannot reveal the extraction rt qpcr efficiency for each virus individually considering the genetic similarity mnv and tulane virus would seem to be more appropriate mpcs for novs a recent study investigated the reliability of mgv and mnv as mpcs for hav and novs in several food and water samples hennechart collette et al 2015 the study revealed that not only nucleic acid extraction efficiencies can vary depending on virus type and sample type but also that genetically similar viruses are not extracted consistently with similar efficiencies hennechart collette et al 2015 a study by masclaux et al 2013 used rice yellow mottle virus a plant virus as an mpc for the detection of hepatitis e virus hev because of its physical stability and its genetic similarity to the target to the best of our knowledge no consensus mpcs have been proposed for enveloped viruses or double stranded rna viruses further studies are needed to select an appropriate mpc for these types of viruses to spike an mpc into a sample is relatively easy and it is effective for both the extraction and rt pcr processes thus mpcs should be included in and recovered from all samples 3 4 rt qpcr control dna rna dna or rna is inoculated into nucleic acid extracts and recovered by rt qpcr to evaluate the effect of rt qpcr inhibition fig 1 various types of dna or rna are selected as rt qpcr controls table 1 among them a dna or rna sequence that is identical to that of the target virus is used frequently some studies have used artificial or natural target viral rna as the control borchardt et al 2004 costafreda et al 2006 surbeck et al 2006 da silva et al 2007 2008 le guyader et al 2009 2010 hamza et al 2009 2011 pintó et al 2009 friedman et al 2011 haramoto et al 2012b lowther et al 2012 ye et al 2012 flannery et al 2013 such controls can be detected by the same primer set and fluorescent probe used for the target if we assume there are inhibitory substances present from environmental samples we can also assume that the controls may have been affected by the inhibitory substances in the same manner as the target however the controls cannot be distinguished from the target in one reaction tube they must be spiked in sufficiently large numbers to be detected in separate reactions some previous studies have used competitive controls or primer sharing controls pscs that are amplified by the same primer set but contain unique sequences borchardt et al 2003 gregory et al 2006 lodder et al 2010 hata et al 2011 2014 wyn jones et al 2011 wurtzer et al 2014 pscs are designed to be differentiated from the targets by amplicon sizes or fluorescent probe labels therefore they can be co amplified in the same tube as the targets it is also possible to determine only the efficiency of rt reaction by utilizing both dna and rna controls simultaneously however this approach is not necessary because both processes can be checked by a single rt qpcr control 3 5 interpretation and utilization of process control data it is desirable to obtain good recoveries for the controls in order to demonstrate that the virus detection processes are reliable in many cases however the recoveries are low and the interpretation of process control data then becomes necessary some previous studies have back calculated viral concentrations determined by rt qpcr based on the recoveries of the controls costafreda et al 2006 pintó et al 2009 le guyader et al 2009 2010 zakhour et al 2010 sano et al 2011 kundu et al 2013 this seems to provide a better estimate of virus concentrations than that without the back calculation but it should be done with great care hata et al 2011 showed that non competitive dna rna controls cannot precisely predict the effects of rt qpcr inhibitors hennechart collette et al 2015 showed that the control virus which is genetically similar to the target virus cannot predict the rna extraction efficiency in some settings correlations between recoveries of spiked controls and a target were found to be different depending on sample matrix types for example mnv was a good predictor of the recovery of nov gi on lettuce but not in bottled water or on semi dried tomato hennechart collette et al 2015 similarly the efficiency of a virus concentration process is dependent on the virus type and is quite variable petterson et al 2015 moreover in a greatly inhibited sample the reliability of a spiked control may decrease because the difference in recovery efficiencies becomes substantial between the target and control if unreliable corrected values are applied to quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra they may result in incorrect conclusions therefore it is not advisable to present a back calculated viral concentration alone as if it is an observed value recovery of the spiked control should be shown with observed concentrations of target viruses even if they are back calculated or not to clarify the reliability of the data dilution of the sample or re extraction of viral nucleic acid is often conducted when the controls indicate underestimations costafreda et al 2006 da silva et al 2007 2008 lambertini et al 2008 pintó et al 2009 gibson and schwab 2011 sima et al 2011 lowther et al 2012 de man et al 2014 grøndahl rosado et al 2014 since an underestimation of qpcr based quantification mainly occurs due to the presence of specific substances like humic acids diluting the sample is reasonable as long as the sample contains sufficient amounts of target viral genes some other studies have rejected the quantification results when mpcs showed an unacceptably low detection efficiency flannery et al 2013 béji hamza et al 2014 it is also important to set an acceptable level for the detection efficiency of the controls previous studies have classified rna extraction efficiency into three categories poor 1 acceptable 1 10 and good 10 da silva et al 2007 benabbes et al 2013 in these studies samples that resulted in poor rna extraction efficiencies were subjected to re extraction of rna and acceptable data were subjected to an adjustment based on recoveries of the controls gibson et al 2012 diluted samples when a threshold cycle ct value for an rt qpcr control was 1 higher than expected which is nearly equal to 50 detection efficiency another study also adopted a similar acceptable level mormann et al 2010 these previous studies suggest that if back calculations are applicable the 1 recovery efficiency can be acceptable also acceptance of 50 recovery of an rt qpcr control suggests that 50 recovery in each step can be acceptable considering that the back calculation is not recommended it seems reasonable to set 1 as an acceptable level of viral recovery for the whole process if a sample type is highly complex it may be difficult to achieve 1 recovery in the whole process however even in these situations it is desirable to keep 1 recovery in each process evaluated for samples that yield poor recovery the observed data on detection of indigenous viruses may need to be discarded and or reanalyzed at the point where the loss in the recovery is suspected to have occurred i e rna dna extraction or rt in addition to the recovery of process controls from individual samples mean recovery is also an important factor for assessing the overall performance of the detection procedure as recoveries can vary greatly even in samples collected from same locations but at different times table 1 since widely applied concentration methods are expected to be able to recover 10 of viruses in water samples cashdollar and wymer 2013 mean recovery of 10 may indicate high levels of inhibition in samples or losses of viruses during one or more of the detection steps including concentration rna dna extraction rt and qpcr in such cases the whole process of detection should be reconsidered carefully to improve viral recovery e g by adopting an additional treatment to remove inhibitory substances in viral concentrates hata et al 2011 4 prevalence of human enteric viruses in water 4 1 quantitative occurrences of viruses in water recent studies revealed that various types of viruses are present in the environment worldwide the advent of pcr particularly has allowed the detection of human enteric viruses in environmental water including those that cannot be detected by routine cell culture e g novs and sapoviruses savs girones et al 2010 initial attempts made to determine the concentration of viral genomes in water samples were by semi quantitative pcr which is based on regular pcr with end point dilution lodder and de roda husman 2005 van den berg et al 2005 ottoson et al 2006 since more than a decade ago qpcr has been applied to the detection of viral genomes in environmental water which allowed rapid i e within a day determination of the occurrence and quantity of viruses in environmental samples at any microbiology laboratory equipped with a qpcr instrument aw and rose 2012 consequently data on viral concentrations in environmental waters have accumulated rapidly in association with dissemination of qpcr protocols for environmental virology fig 2 table s1 fig 2 summarizes the maximum concentration of each virus type from multiple reports maximum concentration is an important numerical index that describes the worst case scenario in terms of viral contamination levels and associated human health risks one of the major findings of recent investigations based on qpcr is seasonal profiles of viral concentration in water environments for instance it was found that human caliciviruses i e novs and savs typically exhibit a relatively clear seasonal trend specifically their concentrations tend to be higher in colder months which is an epidemic period for those viruses in many countries located in temperate regions van den berg et al 2005 haramoto et al 2006 da silva et al 2007 katayama et al 2008 iwai et al 2009 nevertheless an interesting exception has also been reported that is an environmental study carried out in sweden reporting a conflicting observation that novs gi genome concentrations in sewage increased in the summer season due to unknown reasons nordgren et al 2009 as opposed to human caliciviruses other human enteric viruses such as advs evs and aichi virus 1 aiv 1 have been reported to exhibit relatively constant concentration in sewage over a year without showing a clear seasonal trend katayama et al 2008 kitajima et al 2014c novs are a major cause of waterborne gastroenteritis outbreaks and are abundant in environmental settings such as river water seawater and shellfish waters even areas with proper coverage of wwtps have abundant novs in the environment campos and lees 2014 studies conducted at full scale wwtps in japan france and sweden demonstrated that novs gi were generally more persistent against wastewater treatment than novs gii haramoto et al 2006 2015 da silva et al 2007 nordgren et al 2009 it has also been reported that novs gi are more frequently detected in environmental waters than novs gii haramoto et al 2005 2012b borchardt et al 2012 suggesting that novs gi are more resistant to environmental stresses such as solar inactivation temperature and predation although there have been a large number of studies that identified novs gi and gii in environmental samples only a few studies have been conducted to determine the occurrence of novs giv in the environment kitajima et al 2009 2010b 2014c 2016 savs are also a cause of acute gastroenteritis in humans and cases are becoming more prevalent worldwide oka et al 2015 caliciviruses i e novs and savs are included in the latest u s environmental protection agency s contaminant candidate list 4 a list of contaminants that are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems and may require future regulation under the safe drinking water act united states environmental protection agency 2016 however knowledge of the occurrence and fate of savs during water treatment and in aquatic environments is quite limited compared with that of novs yet recent studies have revealed that savs could be as prevalent as novs in the environment haramoto et al 2008 kitajima et al 2010a 2011a 2014c sano et al 2011 fioretti et al 2016 aiv 1 has been proposed as a causative agent of gastroenteritis in humans potentially transmitted by fecal oral routes through contaminated food or water kitajima and gerba 2015 recent clinical and environmental studies carried out in various geographical regions have collectively demonstrated that aiv 1 is globally distributed and present in various types of environmental samples such as sewage sdiri loulizi et al 2010 kitajima et al 2011b lodder et al 2013 haramoto and kitajima 2017 river water alcalá et al 2010 kitajima et al 2011b lodder et al 2013 hata et al 2014 haramoto and kitajima 2017 groundwater betancourt et al 2014 haramoto and kitajima 2017 and shellfish hansman et al 2008 le guyader et al 2008 sdiri loulizi et al 2010 according to some recent environmental studies this virus can be detected in higher frequency and is present in greater abundance than other human enteric viruses in environmental waters kitajima et al 2014c schmitz et al 2016 these findings regarding environmental occurrence of aiv 1 suggest that this virus could potentially be an appropriate viral indicator in the environment because of their high abundance as well as structural and genetic similarities with some of the other important human enteric viruses kitajima and gerba 2015 in addition to these well known human enteric viruses several types of recently recognized human viruses bocaviruses cardioviruses circoviruses cosaviruses picobirnaviruses and salivirus also have been identified from environmental water samples blinkova et al 2009 hamza et al 2011 haramoto and otagiri 2014 kitajima et al 2014b 2015 this suggests that these emerging viruses which are suspected to be associated with human diseases could potentially be transmitted through water gerba et al 2013 4 2 understanding the epidemiology of viruses through environmental surveillance circulation of viruses between contaminated environmental water and human populations is a key issue on one hand water can be contaminated by humans and on the other hand water can be a route of infection to humans wastewater contains viruses shed from all populations regardless of their health status therefore monitoring viruses in wastewater and environmental water bodies that receive effluents from wwtps could be an appropriate approach for determining the actual prevalence and molecular epidemiology of gastroenteritis viruses in a given geographical region rather than clinical studies sinclair et al 2008 prevost et al 2015a kazama et al 2016 2017 the occurrence and concentration of viruses in sewage can be affected by many factors such as water usage season and incidence of infection in the service population some viral infections are known to have seasonality and concentrations of such viruses in water also show similar seasonal trends eftim et al 2017 procedures for concentrating and detecting viruses as well as the host cell lines used in infectivity assays also affect observed viral concentrations some social factors such as population size population structure and geographical location all have the potential to affect viral concentrations in sewage hewitt et al 2011 the other issue regarding viral quantification in sewage is how to treat datasets particularly those including nondetects which are called left censored datasets even though enteric viruses appear in sewage more frequently than in other environmental water samples their concentrations in sewage are often below the limit of quantification since viral quantities in sewage are used in qmra as a parameter in the exposure scenario it is necessary to be able to determine the parametric distribution for simulating viral concentrations in a batch of sewage samples it is also critical to employ a proper stochastic model for adequately describing enteric virus concentrations in sewage based on left censored data ito et al 2017 the main discussion point for modeling a left censored dataset is how to deal with nondetects as stated above substitution of the nondetect with a specific value such as the limit of quantification or zero is a conventional but primitive approach for dealing with this type of data however it has been proposed that this approach ruins the results of the distribution estimation helsel 2006 alternatively the bayesian approach adapted for left censored data has been applied to the modeling of viral concentrations in water in which transformations of the dataset resulting in the log normal distribution are employed to describe viral concentrations kato et al 2013 since a significant number of detects are required to precisely predict the viral concentration distribution the use of an approximate positive ratio detected sample number total sample number of enteric viruses of interest in water samples is recommended in preliminary experiments the number of sampling events required for the precise prediction of the viral contamination distribution can be determined based on the positive ratio and the number of detected samples ito et al 2015 it will be important to reevaluate the data about viral concentrations in water reported in previous studies for more accurate understanding of the distribution of viruses in water 5 genetic diversity of viral genomes in water 5 1 conventional cloning sequencing analysis recent molecular epidemiological investigations on viruses in environmental samples have revealed that enteric viruses present in the environments are more genetically diverse than previously thought table 2 summarizes the reported genetic diversity of novs and savs i e numbers of nov and sav genotypes in the environment most of the previous studies cloned pcr products and then determined nucleotide sequences of the selected clones typically 3 10 clones the number of clones analyzed in these previous studies eight clones per sample kitajima et al 2010a b 2011a b c should be reasonable to identify the major genotypes of enteric viruses in environmental water samples genetically diverse novs have been identified in environmental samples it has been reported that nov strains identified in environmental samples are more diverse than those detected in feces from gastroenteritis patients sano et al 2006 kitajima et al 2010b prevost et al 2015a kazama et al 2016 2017 for example gii strains as well as gi strains were frequently detected in environmental samples kitajima et al 2010b gi 1 and gi 4 particularly were identified much less frequently from outbreak cases during the study period in the same region interestingly a clinical environmental combination study conducted in japan reported that recombinant nov strains were identified from the feces of gastroenteritis patients as well as sewage samples nakamura et al 2009a the genetic analysis of savs from environmental samples such as wastewater river water and shellfish was reported oka et al 2015 and savs in these water environments were also genetically diverse for example up to six different sav genotypes were detected in a single wastewater sample with an equivalent volume of 0 83 ml of original water kitajima et al 2011a aiv 1 strains in the environment were also shown to be genetically diverse kitajima et al 2011b 2013 2018 and lodder et al 2013 reported the detection of both genotypes a and b in environmental samples in japan the netherlands and the united states whereas the other environmental studies detected either genotype a or b le guyader et al 2008 alcalá et al 2010 sdiri loulizi et al 2010 kitajima et al 2011b 2013 di martino et al 2013 haramoto and kitajima 2017 genotype c has not yet been detected from environmental samples 5 2 viral metagenomic analysis recent advancements in next generation sequencing ngs technology and metagenomics have opened the door for the discovery of new viruses in stool specimens as well as in environmental samples such as sewage the existing methodologies for determining the genetic diversity of enteric viruses in the environment such as cloning sequencing are expected to be replaced by ngs in near future aw and rose 2012 in fact a recent study investigated the genetic diversity of advs in water samples using a next generation amplicon sequencing approach ogorzaly et al 2015 some viral metagenomic analyses using ngs have been performed on raw sewage and reclaimed water demonstrating high diversity of viral types in both raw and treated wastewater rosario et al 2009a cantalupo et al 2011 since metagenomic approaches using the second generation sequencing technologies obtain nucleotide sequences from all nucleic acid fragments in the samples it is important to remove non viral genomes before extracting dna or rna using techniques such as sequential filtration e g tangential flow filter units rosario et al 2009a rodriguez brito et al 2010 ng et al 2012 tamaki et al 2012 tseng et al 2013 aw et al 2014 membranes with a pore size of 0 2 0 22 μm are first used for the removal of bacterial and eukaryotic cells followed by the concentration of viral particles and then the removal of free nucleotides using ultrafiltration 30 100 kda molecular weight cut off additionally density gradient ultracentrifugation using cesium chloride rosario et al 2009a rodriguez brito et al 2010 tamaki et al 2012 tseng et al 2013 or sucrose ng et al 2012 is used often for further purification and concentration of the viral particles prior to viral nucleic acid extractions dnase and or rnase treatments are applied to digest naked nucleic acids sometimes rnase treatments are avoided if rna viruses are being analyzed because of concerns that they may destroy rna genomes even within viral capsids griffin et al 2000 cole et al 2003 after nucleotide extractions and cdna synthesis the viral dna or cdna is amplified using primers with artificial sequences either by commercial kits or using in house protocols to obtain enough dna fragments for sequencing a number of human viruses have been identified from the viral metagenomes of wastewater cantalupo et al 2011 aw et al 2014 ng et al 2012 families adenoviridae papillomaviridae parvoviridae and polyomaviridae have been detected among the dna viruses while families astroviridae caliciviridae hepeviridae picobirnaviridae picornaviridae and reoviridae have been found among the rna viruses however these works have reported that the majority of the sequence reads or contigs did not match with any sequences in the international nucleotide sequence database also known as the ddbj ena genbank database implying that the majority of viruses in wastewater have not been identified considering the concentrations of known human viruses fig 2 compared to those of viral particles in wastewater 108 1010 particles ml otawa et al 2007 rosario et al 2009a wu and liu 2009 it is reasonable to conclude that the abundance of known human viruses in viral metagenomes is very low ng et al 2012 went further to construct complete genome sequences of novel viruses from fragments of sequence reads they suggested several novel viruses including picalivirus a new member of the picorna like virus superfamily in addition to families picornaviridae and caliciviridae however although they presented candidate genome sequences of novel viruses those sequences were constructed by clustering short sequence reads probably from a number of viral genomes and the existence of those viruses with the suggested genome sequences has not been confirmed to date this limitation may be overcome by using the third generation sequencing technologies that can analyze thousands of nucleotides in a genome fragment e g pacbio pacific biosciences menlo park usa by combining the second accurate but short and third long but less accurate generation sequencing technologies it would be possible to identify novel viruses in wastewater and other environmental samples which needs to be studied in future work besides the detection of human viruses metagenomic analyses revealed abundance of plant viruses especially pmmov in human feces a metagenomic analysis of rna viruses in human fecal samples found that 85 21 838 25 779 of identified viral sequences belonged to pmmov zhang et al 2006 they also tested additional fecal samples for pmmov using rt pcr finding that 67 12 18 of the samples were positive for the virus another work by nakamura et al 2009b also detected pmmov in 40 2 5 of viral metagenomes from the feces of nov infected patients these were confirmed by rt pcr the presence of pmmov in human feces was further analyzed with rt qpcr colson et al 2010 hamza et al 2011 although the positive ratios varied substantially from 7 2 colson et al 2010 to 95 hamza et al 2011 both reported the presence of pmmov in human feces these findings suggest the possibility that pmmov could infect humans indeed human immune systems respond to pmmov the presence of the anti pmmov igm antibodies in serum was significantly higher in pmmov positive patients 13 13 100 than in pmmov negative patients 10 16 63 colson et al 2010 pmmov positive ratios in feces were found to be significantly higher among patients with fever abdominal pain and pruritus however as warned by the authors of this study the symptoms may have been caused by other co factors such as eating spicy foods as clearly shown in fig 2 recent environmental surveys have demonstrated that pmmov is present in various types of water samples such as raw wastewater rosario et al 2009b hamza et al 2011 kitajima et al 2014c treated wastewater rosario et al 2009b hamza et al 2011 betancourt et al 2014 kitajima et al 2014c surface water hamza et al 2011 haramoto et al 2013 betancourt et al 2014 seawater rosario et al 2009b and groundwater betancourt et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 with much higher concentrations than other viruses pmmov has been detected from the feces of chicken seagulls geese and cows but have thus far been absent in horses sheep coyotes raccoons pigs and dogs rosario et al 2009b hamza et al 2011 considering the relatively lower positive ratios and concentrations of pmmov in animal feces there is a possibility that pmmov can be used as an indicator of human fecal contamination however it is unclear if pmmov can be detected in polluted water without fecal contamination including wastewater from food processing facilities and runoff water from pepper farms further investigations are necessary to evaluate more accurately the feasibility of pmmov as a human fecal indicator the second generation sequencing technology also has been applied to investigate the molecular heterogeneity of certain enteric viruses in water ogorzaly et al 2015 developed an amplicon ngs assay for advs in wastewater and river water a hypervariable region of the hexon gene was amplified and genotyped by sequencing the amplicons with sanger and ngs methods they found that the detected genotypes using the sanger sequencing method adv types 31 and 41 were also the dominant detected types using the ngs method in addition the amplicon ngs method was able to detect an additional 5 types of advs in the samples kazama et al 2016 developed an amplicon ngs method to identify genotypes of novs in raw sewage the method successfully detected 14 genotypes of novs gi and gii with up to eight genotypes in one sample whereas only four genotypes were detected from the feces of patients collected concurrently in the region the spread of gii 4 sydney 2012 variant in 2012 2013 winter season kazama et al 2016 and the emergence of gii 17 subclusters kawasaki323 2014 2014 2015 winter season and kawasaki308 2015 2015 2016 winter season kazama et al 2017 were observed by using this method these works demonstrated that the amplicon ngs assay can determine a more detailed distribution of viral genotypes of interest than conventional approaches which supports the concept of analyzing the global circulation of enteric viruses in water environments 6 conclusions 1 numerous methods for concentrating viruses have been developed yet no single method seems to be entirely effective in concentrating all human enteric viruses of interest from various types of water samples therefore it is important to monitor the recovery efficiencies of target viruses especially for emerging viruses because recoveries can vary greatly across samples simultaneous concentration of viruses protozoa and bacteria in a single water sample is also of great interest for better understanding the prevalence of waterborne pathogens 2 qpcr based methods have become the standard for detection of viral genomes in concentrated water samples however some efforts are needed still to reduce the levels of pcr inhibition to allow the simultaneous detection of as many virus types as possible and to selectively detect viral genomes derived from viable viruses only 3 process controls to assess virus recovery during detection procedures can be divided into three types wpcs mpcs and rt qpcr controls various types of process controls have been employed at each point of inoculation but no gold standard has been established to date for applying controls while still maintaining appropriate recovery values however it is still highly recommended to include at least one of the three process control types for more accurate interpretation of the data not only the recovery from individual samples but also a mean recovery need to be considered to assess the overall performance of the detection procedure 4 recent investigations based on qpcr detections have revealed some virus type specific profiles for viral concentrations in water environments worldwide for example the concentrations of novs and savs generally increase in winter their epidemic period whereas those of other commonly found enteric viruses such as advs and evs are relatively constant throughout the year 5 there are increasing numbers of environmental studies that have surveyed the genetic diversity of viral genomes including the genomes of novel viruses in water samples in addition to conventional cloning sequencing techniques recently developed ngs methods have been used successfully for selected viruses such as advs and novs suggesting a continued role in future research since it is expected that the genotype distribution of viruses in raw sewage reflects the actual incidence of local viral infectious cases further environmental

19660,waterborne human enteric viruses such as noroviruses and adenoviruses are excreted in the feces of infected individuals and transmitted via the fecal oral route including contaminated food and water since viruses are normally present at low concentrations in aquatic environments they should be concentrated into smaller volumes prior to downstream molecular biological applications such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr this review describes recent progress made in the development of concentration and detection methods of human enteric viruses in water and discusses their applications for providing a better understanding of the prevalence of the viruses in various types of water worldwide maximum concentrations of human enteric viruses in water that have been reported in previous studies are summarized to assess viral abundances in aquatic environments some descriptions are also available on recent applications of sequencing analyses used to determine the genetic diversity of viral genomes in water samples including those of novel viruses furthermore the importance and significance of utilizing appropriate process controls during viral analyses are discussed and three types of process controls are considered whole process controls molecular process controls and reverse transcription rt qpcr controls although no standards have been established for

concentrations in the feces of infected individuals up to 1011 viruses g feces with or without symptoms and are transmitted via the fecal oral route including contaminated food and water bosch 1998 wyn jones and sellwood 2001 prüss et al 2002 currently treated or untreated sewage and combined sewer overflows from urban areas are the major sources of environmental pollution from human enteric viruses in surface waters fong and lipp 2005 rodríguez et al 2012 since human enteric viruses are not able to grow outside their host cells efficient removal and or inactivation of these viruses at wastewater treatment plants wwtps can contribute greatly to reducing the amount of viruses discharged into an environment installation of appropriate wastewater treatment systems can result in controlling the risk of viral infection via various routes such as contact with recreational waters ingestion of potable water or consumption of virus contaminated shellfish however it is very difficult to achieve the complete removal of viruses with conventional wastewater treatment processes sano et al 2016 many studies have focused so far on the detection of human enteric viruses in various types of aquatic environments such as raw and treated wastewater surface water groundwater seawater and even treated drinking water fong and lipp 2005 gerba et al 2013 since human enteric viruses are present generally at relatively low concentrations in environmental water samples it is essential to begin these types of studies by concentrating the viruses into smaller sample volumes to enhance the usefulness of detection assays the development and application of methods for concentrating viruses have contributed significantly to the detection of diverse viruses using culture or molecular based assays ikner et al 2012 cashdollar and wymer 2013 the rapid advancement of molecular biological techniques such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr has enabled us to obtain quantitative information about the viral genomes present in water although qpcr itself provides quantitative data with high accuracy concentrations obtained via this method should be interpreted very carefully because of potential losses in efficiency during the detection process including virus concentration steps dna rna extractions reverse transcription rt and qpcr use of process controls or internal external controls is now becoming common practice in evaluating the efficiency of virus recovery and level of inhibition during the detection process during the virus detection process there are a few points at which a process control can be added to a sample since different types of process controls are recommended depending on the point of inoculation use of process controls should be considered prior to starting a field survey to determine the prevalence of viruses in that particular water sample despite great efforts viruses sometimes are not detected in tested water samples these data called non detects should be considered for more appropriate data treatments however previous studies rarely have considered this issue important this review paper describes the latest knowledge regarding detection methods of human enteric viruses in aquatic environments including molecular biological techniques such as rt qpcr cloning sequencing and viral metagenomic analysis as well as their applications for detecting and evaluating various types of indigenous viruses in water worldwide in addition we describe the importance of using appropriate process controls in these types of studies to the best of our knowledge this is the first paper summarizing in detail the current knowledge about the application of process controls to virus detection in water 2 methods for concentrating and detecting human enteric viruses in water 2 1 methods for concentrating viruses quantities of human enteric viruses can vary greatly depending on the types of water in which they are found high concentrations of target viruses may be detected easily from relatively small volumes of wastewater or sludge samples 100 ml whereas for surface recreational and drinking waters larger volumes 10 1000 l or more are often required for detection due to significantly lower viral concentrations for this reason most studies employ one or more in series methods for concentrating viruses in water samples when considering concentration methods several factors such as water quality or sample volume are important because they easily affect the efficiencies of virus concentration and downstream detection techniques this has become especially important given the frequent use of pcr based techniques for detection as organic matters present in environmental samples e g humic acids or chemicals added during concentration elution e g beef extract or sodium polyphosphate napp can inhibit dna rna extractions and subsequent rt and pcr qpcr detection steps ikner et al 2011 2012 cashdollar and wymer 2013 in addition one single method may result in variable efficiencies for different viruses a single method is generally not capable of concentrating all viruses equally in a given water sample thus selection of appropriate concentration methods with respect to sample types can improve virus detectability previous studies have employed numerous primary and secondary virus concentration methods for environmental samples including virus adsorption and elution viradel size exclusion and coagulation flocculation early efforts to concentrate viruses from water have been summarized in other reviews ikner et al 2012 cashdollar and wymer 2013 these include two phase separation techniques polyethylene glycol hydroextraction dialysis soluble membranes ultracentrifugation precipitation by salt addition etc methods using celite and non flocculating beef extract are also used mainly for secondary concentration mcminn et al 2012 brinkman et al 2013 mcminn and korajkic 2015 rhodes et al 2016 since many of these methods were developed to concentrate viruses in relatively small volumes of water 1 l applications to field studies targeting larger water volumes are sometimes difficult however these methods are still used in many studies today as primary or secondary concentration methods the viradel technique using electronegative membranes is used widely for a variety of water sample types prior to concentrating viruses the addition of salt e g mgcl2 is required to facilitate the binding of the negatively charged viruses to the membrane wallis and melnick 1967 except for in seawater where the bridging cations are already present katayama et al 2002 demonstrated that rinsing filters with an acid h2so4 to remove cationic salts prior to the final elution of viruses with naoh improved virus recovery in addition this simple elution matrix reduced the potential inhibition of dna rna extractions or rt qpcr that is frequently associated with organic eluents such as beef extract this method has also been used for concentrating viruses from various types of water samples including seawater tap water surface water and wastewater although recovery can vary greatly depending on the types of water and viruses examined katayama et al 2002 haramoto et al 2009 victoria et al 2009 fong et al 2010 this elution method has been modified further to facilitate the filtration of larger samples 40 l for river water and 1000 l for tap water using a cartridge type mixed cellulose ester filter opticap xl pore size 0 5 μm merck millipore billerica usa hata et al 2015 and has also been used for concentrating viruses from drinking water treatment facilities asami et al 2016 the addition of cationic salts represents the primary difficulty in making this a field ready method nevertheless several studies have adapted this method for use in the field with an in line addition of a concentrated cation solution to the sample just before filtration hata et al 2015 asami et al 2016 other studies have overcome this difficulty by adding the cationic salt to the membrane prior to filtering water samples haramoto et al 2004 2005 2010 electropositive media and filters have been used for concentrating viruses in several formats including 1mds filters 3m maplewood usa ikner et al 2012 cashdollar and wymer 2013 nanoceram filters argonide sanford usa have been recently evaluated and recommended as a more cost effective successor of the 1mds filter the nanoceram filter is composed of nano alumina fibers dispersed in a non woven microglass fiber matrix and was evaluated first for viradel primary concentration karim et al 2009 initial comparisons with the 1mds showed greater recovery of evs in tap water and river water from 10 l samples and a comparable recovery from 100 l samples karim et al 2009 bennett et al 2010 also investigated the use of the nanoceram material in a disposable capsule format and found greater recovery of ms2 coliphage from deionized water when compared to 1mds and from artificial seawater when compared to opticap xl without the need for cationic salt addition ikner et al 2011 found that nanoceram filters have high virus retention 99 8 and thus investigated elution methods to improve the efficiency of virus recovery resulting in the highest known recovery 86 for ms2 coliphage with a 1 napp 0 05 m glycine solution concentrating viruses with the nanoceram filter media has been demonstrated now in drinking water ye et al 2012 cashdollar et al 2013 surface water prevost et al 2015b and wastewater soto beltran et al 2013 chaudhry et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 several studies have reported lower recoveries of advs using nanoceram than of other viruses 14 from tap water ikner et al 2011 1 4 5 from seawater gibbons et al 2010 and 0 02 from lake water francy et al 2013 whereas mcminn 2013 succeeded in improving recoveries of advs using small disk filters skimmed milk flocculation recently has been demonstrated as a low cost one step virus concentration method this process involves flocculation of viruses in pre acidified water samples ph 3 5 to skimmed milk proteins followed by stirring for 8 h and gravity sedimentation of the floc for an additional 8 h after removal of the supernatant the sedimented floc is centrifuged to obtain the pellet which is subsequently resuspended in phosphate buffer applicability of this method has been demonstrated for seawater calgua et al 2008 and river water calgua et al 2013 yielding recovery values of approximately 50 for adv nov of genogroup ii nov gii jc polyomavirus jcpyv and rotavirus rv from 5 to 10 l samples while this method has demonstrated high recovery rates with low variability efficiencies for volumes 10 l have not been demonstrated this could be due to the impracticality of sedimenting and removing supernatant from larger sample volumes which limits the usefulness of this technique for field studies as is clear from these studies no single method seems to be entirely effective for concentrating all enteric viruses of interest from various types of water this concept is especially important given the rise of several new target viruses of interest e g pyvs and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov therefore concentration methods may need to be reevaluated with the recovery efficiencies of these new viruses in mind prior to field applications for example pmmov has been presented as a promising indicator of virus removal in drinking water treatment plants asami et al 2016 however the recovery of this virus by existing concentration methods could prove challenging due to differences in shape surface charge and other characteristics from enteric viruses as a result experimentation on recovery efficiencies will be required for successful field studies many recent studies did not determine recovery efficiencies for their concentration techniques used assuming that previously established methods would behave similarly van den berg et al 2005 simmons and xagoraraki 2011 pérez sautu et al 2012 kitajima et al 2014c kuroda et al 2015 given the variability of viral recoveries from different water matrices as well as the unknown recoveries of emerging viruses regularly including viral concentration efficiency controls will be highly valuable for this type of research 2 2 methods for simultaneously concentrating multiple microbes the idea of using a single concentration method for evaluating multiple classes of microbes e g viruses bacteria and protozoa in water samples is of great interest to researchers and water utility practitioners several studies have evaluated such methods for the simultaneous concentration of multiple classes of microbes ultrafiltration is theoretically a reasonable choice for this type of procedure using only a single filter because all microbes larger than the molecular weight cutoff for that filter can be concentrated from a water sample hill et al 2005 kahler et al 2015 used a tangential flow ultrafiltration method to concentrate escherichia coli clostridium perfringens cryptosporidium parvum echovirus type 1 ms2 and φx174 coliphages spiked in groundwater and surface water samples results indicated that 66 95 recoveries were observed for all microbes tested dead end ultrafiltration has also been demonstrated for simultaneous recovery of ms2 coliphage c parvum enterococci e coli and c perfringens with similarly high recoveries smith and hill 2009 mull and hill 2012 francy et al 2013 compared several filtration methods including glass wool nanoceram continuous flow centrifugation with a virocap capsule filter scientific methods granger usa tangential flow and dead end ultrafiltrations for their abilities to simultaneously concentrate multiple microbes both ultrafiltration methods and continuous flow centrifugation with virocap were found to be reasonable options for concentrating several indicator bacteria e coli and enterococci ms2 coliphage and protozoa cryptosporidium and giardia recovery of enteric viruses was generally lower for all tested methods haramoto et al 2011 2012a successfully used electronegative mixed cellulose ester membranes pore size 0 45 μm for the simultaneous concentration of viruses and protozoa from wastewater river water and groundwater samples for this method electronegative membranes that were previously known for viradel based virus concentration katayama et al 2002 were further used for recovery of protozoan oo cysts haramoto et al 2012b kitajima et al 2014a viruses were captured by electrostatic interactions while cryptosporidium and giardia oo cysts were recovered by size exclusion since this approach can be easily combined with previously established virus concentration methods using disk filters with no decrease in virus recovery it could serve as a suitable method for presenting the occurrences of not only viruses but also protozoa in a single water sample 2 3 virus detection methods historically cell culture methods have been the gold standard for the detection of infectious viruses however pcr and qpcr methods have rapidly become a mainstay of enteric virus detection in water samples this is largely due to shorter detection times within hours high sensitivity and specificity as well as the ability to detect viruses that are not easily culturable and tend to evade detection by culture based methods the flexibility of primer probe design means that assays can be tailored to the desired specificity toward broad detection of an entire virus clade e g enteroviruses or toward more specific virus strains depending on the chosen target dna rna sequences simultaneous detection of multiple targets in a sample is possible with multiplex qpcr assays that use different fluorophores for different targets although this method is limited by the wavelengths that current qpcr instruments can detect typically 2 to 5 wavelength ranges kang et al 2013 to overcome this limitation high throughput qpcr using microfluidic technology has been demonstrated as a direct multi pathogen detection method for environmental water samples this method uses microfluidic chips that enable simultaneous high throughput quantification of large sample sizes for numerous enteric viruses and other pathogens for example a 96 96 dynamic array chip fluidigm south san francisco usa can be used for 9216 qpcr reactions in any combination such as 96 target assays for 96 samples ishii et al 2014 demonstrated this technology for quantifying 11 different target enteric viruses where novs gi gii and rv were detected in a wastewater impacted river water pcr based methods have the disadvantage of being susceptible to inhibitory substances that are often co concentrated with viruses such as humic acids which are frequently present in environmental water samples magnetic bead based extraction methods are sometimes used being expected that they work more effectively to remove rt qpcr inhibitors than spin column based methods la rosa et al 2010a hata et al 2011 selected use of dna polymerases including their mutants that have high resistance against inhibitors is an important option for reducing inhibitory effects kermekchiev et al 2009 matheson et al 2010 digital pcr dpcr has recently gained attention as a means of direct absolute quantification of viral gene copies in a sample without the necessity of calibration by standards of known concentrations monteiro and santos 2017 these methods involve partitioning target dna rna molecules and rt pcr master mix into several thousand 10 50k small volume typically nanoliters pcr reactions after which the numbers of positive reactions are determined and absolute quantities are calculated based on the poisson statistics one major advantage of dpcr is the method s tolerance to inhibitory substances due to the fact that unlike qpcr qualitative amplification of target genomes is less affected by pcr inhibitors several different dpcr platforms have been developed such as droplet dpcr where water in oil emulsion droplets are used on a microfluidic chip hoshino and inagaki 2012 found that copy numbers were determined more accurately in humic acid enriched and environmental samples using microfluidic dpcr than qpcr kishida et al 2014 demonstrated the use of microfluidic dpcr for the detection of advs in river water rački et al 2014 developed a one step rt droplet based dpcr method for the detection of a waterborne rna virus spiked rv and similarly an rt microfluidic dpcr assay by coudray meunier et al 2015 demonstrated the detection of spiked novs gi and gii both studies were found to be similarly tolerant to inhibitory substances pcr based methods however are less suitable for differentiating infective viruses from non infective viruses as is typically applied several detection methods for viruses in water bosch et al 2011 as well as methods to determine viral infectivity hamza et al 2011 have been reviewed previously in greater detail a combination of cell culture methods and molecular methods has been realized with integrated cell culture icc pcr which incorporates the benefits of both methods to overcome the shortfalls of each by propagating target viruses and making their rt pcr detection easier difficulties with culture based methods for quantification of indigenous viruses in environmental water samples are less of an issue the application of icc pcr to the detection of enteric viruses in water was initially proposed by reynolds et al 1996 and then applied to the monitoring of infectious viruses in environmental waters chapron et al 2000 wong et al 2009 li et al 2010 2011b ming et al 2011 and evaluations of disinfection efficacy ko et al 2005 gerrity et al 2008 li et al 2009 lambertini et al 2010 proposed growth kinetics approaches for obtaining quantitative results buffalo green monkey kidney vero and ma 104 cells have frequently been used for icc pcr but cell tropism limits the range of viral species and types that can be detected by icc pcr incubation times can take up to 10 days reynolds et al 1996 but a 24 h incubation period is often sufficient when the concentration of infectious viruses becomes sufficiently high mayer et al 2010 several studies have proposed the specific detection of the replication intermediate products of viral genomes mrna for dna viruses or negative strand rna for positive single stranded rna viruses by rt pcr to obtain evidence for viral replication and to assess viral infectivity more accurately ko et al 2003 lambertini et al 2010 viral infectivity has also been examined by culture independent methods such as multiple target region pcr pecson et al 2011 long target region pcr shin and sobsey 2003 simonet and gantzer 2006 affinity separation of viral antigens associated with a viral genome prior to pcr li et al 2011a hwang et al 2007 enzymatic treatment of viral particles prior to rt pcr nuanualsuwan and cliver 2002 pecson et al 2009 intercalating dye pre treatments of viral particles prior to rt pcr parshionikar et al 2010 kim et al 2011 and separation of biotinylated viral particles prior to rt pcr sano et al 2010 2015 tojo et al 2013 since each approach has both pros and cons hamza et al 2011 it is important to clarify applicable situations for the approaches so that public health workers and water engineers can select best fit techniques for their circumstances sano et al 2015 applications of culture independent methods are often limited to disinfection studies so examples of their use in evaluating viral persistence in environmental water samples are rare in the literature prevost et al 2016 in addition although it has not been investigated at this point given the complexity of environmental samples it is expected that these methods could be impacted by inhibitory substances in water matrices and this requires further investigation the culture based methods and icc pcr are not applicable to non cultivable enteric viruses historically human novs hunovs have been non cultivable in laboratory adapted animal cell lines but recently hunov replication in b cells jones et al 2014 and stem cell derived human enteroids ettayebi et al 2016 has been reported this may make it possible to analyze the infectious titer of hunovs in environmental samples in the near future however the fact that a number of researchers have studied enteric viruses using a variety of cell lines leads us to speculate that enteric viruses discovered in the future despite the approached used including metagenomics aw et al 2014 will be non cultivable at least immediately after discovery sano et al 2015 indeed it becomes increasingly unrealistic to expect the development of cell culture methods at its current rate to maintain pace with new discoveries of unknown viral strains and the emergence of new enteric viruses of interest 3 process controls for assessing the efficiency of virus detection 3 1 necessity of process controls in general the qpcr based detection of viruses in water consists of three steps 1 concentrate viruses into appropriate volume 2 extract dna rna and 3 perform rt qpcr to obtain accurate results all steps should be conducted with acceptable levels of efficiency various methods have been applied for each of these steps to allow the most efficient virus detection from water samples however most of the methods showed inconsistencies at times particularly when the sample contained specific inhibitory substances a variety of methods to remove or inactivate such substances have been reported schrader et al 2012 however none of the methods are effective all the time schrader et al 2012 possible decreases in the quantification efficiency should be considered to assess the efficiency of the processes so called process controls or internal external controls should be used such controls can be roughly classified into three types in accordance with the materials used as well as the points at which the controls are spiked into the sample 1 whole process controls wpcs which are added into the sample before viruses are concentrated 2 molecular process controls mpcs which are added before nucleic acid extractions and 3 rt qpcr controls which are added before the rt qpcr processes observed recovery yields of the controls are affected by the efficiencies of the downstream processes fig 1 illustrates the framework for different types of process controls that are recommended for inclusion during virus detection procedures as summarized in table 1 various types of process controls have been employed in previous studies at least one of the process controls listed here should be added to all the water samples analyzed for viruses with a clear understanding of the importance of utilizing appropriate process controls recovery yields of the process controls reflect the effects of inhibitors which is useful for better understanding the study s findings many previous studies have attempted to set a threshold value for the expected recovery of process controls to validate the reliability of virus detection however as shown below there is currently no consensus on that threshold recovery value 3 2 whole process controls wpcs to determine the efficiency of the process by which virus particles are concentrated known amounts of viral particles are spiked into samples and then recovered after the concentration step fig 1 and table 1 some studies have prepared a sample set that is used only for recovery of the control borchardt et al 2003 rezaeinejad et al 2014 prevost et al 2015b these trials have advantages in that a target virus itself can also be selected as the control consequently the obtained recovery efficiency is likely to be reliable for instance some of the studies targeting indigenous evs adopted a vaccine strain of poliovirus pv as the control borchardt et al 2003 hata et al 2014 wurtzer et al 2014 when pcr based quantification was applied to detect the control the recovery was affected not only by virus concentration efficiency but also by the efficiencies of the nucleic acid extraction and rt qpcr thus these kinds of controls are called wpcs culture based assays are often employed to specifically evaluate virus concentration efficiency easily cultivable controls such as coliphages pv and murine norovirus mnv are frequently used as wpcs but in some cases pcr based quantification has been used to estimate the recovery borchardt et al 2003 jiang et al 2007 rajal et al 2007 minamoto et al 2009 fumian et al 2010 honjo et al 2010 mormann et al 2010 poma et al 2012 ye et al 2012 de keuckelaere et al 2013 kundu et al 2013 mäde et al 2013 muscillo et al 2013 hata et al 2014 wurtzer et al 2014 as shown in table 1 several viruses have been used to determine the efficiency of concentrating viral particles however the representativeness of the spiked control is questionable a study by petterson et al 2015 revealed that the recovery efficiency of spiked mengovirus mgv was not correlated to those of indigenous advs and novs the study also showed that the virus recovery efficiency can vary by over six orders of magnitude petterson et al 2015 similarly hennechart collette et al 2015 suggested that a control which is a good representative of the target in a sample matrix does not always work as expected in other sample matrix types thus use of spiked controls to estimate the efficiency of a virus concentration process needs to be further investigated also there is an issue with the use of pv vaccine strains as wpc the progress made by the world health organization who program for eradicating wild type pv may make it difficult to keep and prepare pv vaccine strains in laboratories the who global action plan stipulated a non retention policy for oral pv type 2 sabin2 materials for all pv non essential laboratory facilities when pv type 2 was eradicated who 2014 pv vaccines strains will no longer be available for use as a control it is desirable to examine the recovery of a wpc for all water samples tested but it may not be practical to perform controls at every sampling time especially for wpcs quantified by culture based assays even in such situations it is highly recommended to add a wpc to water samples and store the viral concentrates in a freezer for possible future analysis by pcr based assays on the other hand in cases when large volumes of water are being processed or virus concentration procedures must be conducted in the field the inclusion of a wpc is likely to be difficult or impossible due to compliance with biohazard policies however even in those cases wpcs are recommended perhaps on a smaller scale in the laboratory to routinely test recovery efficiencies during a study period 3 3 molecular process controls mpcs to assess the efficiency of nucleic acid extractions viral particles are widely used as process controls fig 1 and table 1 for instance mgv belonging to the family picornaviridae is used for studies targeting hepatitis a virus hav novs gi and gii in water and other food samples da silva et al 2007 2008 le guyader et al 2009 2010 pintó et al 2009 zakhour et al 2010 sano et al 2011 sima et al 2011 lowther et al 2012 flannery et al 2013 de man et al 2014 chaudhry et al 2015 coudray meunier et al 2015 hennechart collette et al 2015 similarly mnv diez valcarce et al 2011 hata et al 2011 2013 2014 béji hamza et al 2014 ishii et al 2014 hennechart collette et al 2015 and armored rna hepatitis g virus hgv rna coated by ms2 capsid lambertini et al 2008 gibson and schwab 2011 are often used some other studies have used unique process controls for extractions such as advs types 2 and 5 hata et al 2011 2014 chaudhry et al 2015 ms2 coliphage navidad et al 2013 wurtzer et al 2014 prevost et al 2015b pp7 bacteriophage rajal et al 2007 and feline calicivirus jones et al 2009 la rosa et al 2010c it is noteworthy that if a process control is inoculated into a sample just before the extraction process its recovery can be affected by downstream molecular assays i e extraction and rt qpcr processes even if extraction efficiencies for the target virus and process control or mpc are similar their rt qpcr efficiencies can be different for specific estimations of extraction efficiencies some studies have attempted to minimize the effects of rt pcr inhibition by diluting the nucleic acid extract hata et al 2011 sima et al 2011 de man et al 2014 it is believed that genetically similar viruses are extracted with similar efficiencies by nucleic acid extraction methods costafreda et al 2006 for this reason mgv has been used commonly as the control for indicating the extraction efficiency of hav rna costafreda et al 2006 pintó et al 2009 uhrbrand et al 2010 however standardization procedures international organization for standardization 2017 indicate the use of mgv as the appropriate process control to be applied for the detection of novs from the family caliciviridae and some other viruses da silva et al 2007 2008 le guyader et al 2009 2010 zakhour et al 2010 sima et al 2011 sano et al 2011 lowther et al 2012 flannery et al 2013 de man et al 2014 these previous studies imply that molecular controls can indicate the occurrence of inhibitory effects but cannot reveal the extraction rt qpcr efficiency for each virus individually considering the genetic similarity mnv and tulane virus would seem to be more appropriate mpcs for novs a recent study investigated the reliability of mgv and mnv as mpcs for hav and novs in several food and water samples hennechart collette et al 2015 the study revealed that not only nucleic acid extraction efficiencies can vary depending on virus type and sample type but also that genetically similar viruses are not extracted consistently with similar efficiencies hennechart collette et al 2015 a study by masclaux et al 2013 used rice yellow mottle virus a plant virus as an mpc for the detection of hepatitis e virus hev because of its physical stability and its genetic similarity to the target to the best of our knowledge no consensus mpcs have been proposed for enveloped viruses or double stranded rna viruses further studies are needed to select an appropriate mpc for these types of viruses to spike an mpc into a sample is relatively easy and it is effective for both the extraction and rt pcr processes thus mpcs should be included in and recovered from all samples 3 4 rt qpcr control dna rna dna or rna is inoculated into nucleic acid extracts and recovered by rt qpcr to evaluate the effect of rt qpcr inhibition fig 1 various types of dna or rna are selected as rt qpcr controls table 1 among them a dna or rna sequence that is identical to that of the target virus is used frequently some studies have used artificial or natural target viral rna as the control borchardt et al 2004 costafreda et al 2006 surbeck et al 2006 da silva et al 2007 2008 le guyader et al 2009 2010 hamza et al 2009 2011 pintó et al 2009 friedman et al 2011 haramoto et al 2012b lowther et al 2012 ye et al 2012 flannery et al 2013 such controls can be detected by the same primer set and fluorescent probe used for the target if we assume there are inhibitory substances present from environmental samples we can also assume that the controls may have been affected by the inhibitory substances in the same manner as the target however the controls cannot be distinguished from the target in one reaction tube they must be spiked in sufficiently large numbers to be detected in separate reactions some previous studies have used competitive controls or primer sharing controls pscs that are amplified by the same primer set but contain unique sequences borchardt et al 2003 gregory et al 2006 lodder et al 2010 hata et al 2011 2014 wyn jones et al 2011 wurtzer et al 2014 pscs are designed to be differentiated from the targets by amplicon sizes or fluorescent probe labels therefore they can be co amplified in the same tube as the targets it is also possible to determine only the efficiency of rt reaction by utilizing both dna and rna controls simultaneously however this approach is not necessary because both processes can be checked by a single rt qpcr control 3 5 interpretation and utilization of process control data it is desirable to obtain good recoveries for the controls in order to demonstrate that the virus detection processes are reliable in many cases however the recoveries are low and the interpretation of process control data then becomes necessary some previous studies have back calculated viral concentrations determined by rt qpcr based on the recoveries of the controls costafreda et al 2006 pintó et al 2009 le guyader et al 2009 2010 zakhour et al 2010 sano et al 2011 kundu et al 2013 this seems to provide a better estimate of virus concentrations than that without the back calculation but it should be done with great care hata et al 2011 showed that non competitive dna rna controls cannot precisely predict the effects of rt qpcr inhibitors hennechart collette et al 2015 showed that the control virus which is genetically similar to the target virus cannot predict the rna extraction efficiency in some settings correlations between recoveries of spiked controls and a target were found to be different depending on sample matrix types for example mnv was a good predictor of the recovery of nov gi on lettuce but not in bottled water or on semi dried tomato hennechart collette et al 2015 similarly the efficiency of a virus concentration process is dependent on the virus type and is quite variable petterson et al 2015 moreover in a greatly inhibited sample the reliability of a spiked control may decrease because the difference in recovery efficiencies becomes substantial between the target and control if unreliable corrected values are applied to quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra they may result in incorrect conclusions therefore it is not advisable to present a back calculated viral concentration alone as if it is an observed value recovery of the spiked control should be shown with observed concentrations of target viruses even if they are back calculated or not to clarify the reliability of the data dilution of the sample or re extraction of viral nucleic acid is often conducted when the controls indicate underestimations costafreda et al 2006 da silva et al 2007 2008 lambertini et al 2008 pintó et al 2009 gibson and schwab 2011 sima et al 2011 lowther et al 2012 de man et al 2014 grøndahl rosado et al 2014 since an underestimation of qpcr based quantification mainly occurs due to the presence of specific substances like humic acids diluting the sample is reasonable as long as the sample contains sufficient amounts of target viral genes some other studies have rejected the quantification results when mpcs showed an unacceptably low detection efficiency flannery et al 2013 béji hamza et al 2014 it is also important to set an acceptable level for the detection efficiency of the controls previous studies have classified rna extraction efficiency into three categories poor 1 acceptable 1 10 and good 10 da silva et al 2007 benabbes et al 2013 in these studies samples that resulted in poor rna extraction efficiencies were subjected to re extraction of rna and acceptable data were subjected to an adjustment based on recoveries of the controls gibson et al 2012 diluted samples when a threshold cycle ct value for an rt qpcr control was 1 higher than expected which is nearly equal to 50 detection efficiency another study also adopted a similar acceptable level mormann et al 2010 these previous studies suggest that if back calculations are applicable the 1 recovery efficiency can be acceptable also acceptance of 50 recovery of an rt qpcr control suggests that 50 recovery in each step can be acceptable considering that the back calculation is not recommended it seems reasonable to set 1 as an acceptable level of viral recovery for the whole process if a sample type is highly complex it may be difficult to achieve 1 recovery in the whole process however even in these situations it is desirable to keep 1 recovery in each process evaluated for samples that yield poor recovery the observed data on detection of indigenous viruses may need to be discarded and or reanalyzed at the point where the loss in the recovery is suspected to have occurred i e rna dna extraction or rt in addition to the recovery of process controls from individual samples mean recovery is also an important factor for assessing the overall performance of the detection procedure as recoveries can vary greatly even in samples collected from same locations but at different times table 1 since widely applied concentration methods are expected to be able to recover 10 of viruses in water samples cashdollar and wymer 2013 mean recovery of 10 may indicate high levels of inhibition in samples or losses of viruses during one or more of the detection steps including concentration rna dna extraction rt and qpcr in such cases the whole process of detection should be reconsidered carefully to improve viral recovery e g by adopting an additional treatment to remove inhibitory substances in viral concentrates hata et al 2011 4 prevalence of human enteric viruses in water 4 1 quantitative occurrences of viruses in water recent studies revealed that various types of viruses are present in the environment worldwide the advent of pcr particularly has allowed the detection of human enteric viruses in environmental water including those that cannot be detected by routine cell culture e g novs and sapoviruses savs girones et al 2010 initial attempts made to determine the concentration of viral genomes in water samples were by semi quantitative pcr which is based on regular pcr with end point dilution lodder and de roda husman 2005 van den berg et al 2005 ottoson et al 2006 since more than a decade ago qpcr has been applied to the detection of viral genomes in environmental water which allowed rapid i e within a day determination of the occurrence and quantity of viruses in environmental samples at any microbiology laboratory equipped with a qpcr instrument aw and rose 2012 consequently data on viral concentrations in environmental waters have accumulated rapidly in association with dissemination of qpcr protocols for environmental virology fig 2 table s1 fig 2 summarizes the maximum concentration of each virus type from multiple reports maximum concentration is an important numerical index that describes the worst case scenario in terms of viral contamination levels and associated human health risks one of the major findings of recent investigations based on qpcr is seasonal profiles of viral concentration in water environments for instance it was found that human caliciviruses i e novs and savs typically exhibit a relatively clear seasonal trend specifically their concentrations tend to be higher in colder months which is an epidemic period for those viruses in many countries located in temperate regions van den berg et al 2005 haramoto et al 2006 da silva et al 2007 katayama et al 2008 iwai et al 2009 nevertheless an interesting exception has also been reported that is an environmental study carried out in sweden reporting a conflicting observation that novs gi genome concentrations in sewage increased in the summer season due to unknown reasons nordgren et al 2009 as opposed to human caliciviruses other human enteric viruses such as advs evs and aichi virus 1 aiv 1 have been reported to exhibit relatively constant concentration in sewage over a year without showing a clear seasonal trend katayama et al 2008 kitajima et al 2014c novs are a major cause of waterborne gastroenteritis outbreaks and are abundant in environmental settings such as river water seawater and shellfish waters even areas with proper coverage of wwtps have abundant novs in the environment campos and lees 2014 studies conducted at full scale wwtps in japan france and sweden demonstrated that novs gi were generally more persistent against wastewater treatment than novs gii haramoto et al 2006 2015 da silva et al 2007 nordgren et al 2009 it has also been reported that novs gi are more frequently detected in environmental waters than novs gii haramoto et al 2005 2012b borchardt et al 2012 suggesting that novs gi are more resistant to environmental stresses such as solar inactivation temperature and predation although there have been a large number of studies that identified novs gi and gii in environmental samples only a few studies have been conducted to determine the occurrence of novs giv in the environment kitajima et al 2009 2010b 2014c 2016 savs are also a cause of acute gastroenteritis in humans and cases are becoming more prevalent worldwide oka et al 2015 caliciviruses i e novs and savs are included in the latest u s environmental protection agency s contaminant candidate list 4 a list of contaminants that are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems and may require future regulation under the safe drinking water act united states environmental protection agency 2016 however knowledge of the occurrence and fate of savs during water treatment and in aquatic environments is quite limited compared with that of novs yet recent studies have revealed that savs could be as prevalent as novs in the environment haramoto et al 2008 kitajima et al 2010a 2011a 2014c sano et al 2011 fioretti et al 2016 aiv 1 has been proposed as a causative agent of gastroenteritis in humans potentially transmitted by fecal oral routes through contaminated food or water kitajima and gerba 2015 recent clinical and environmental studies carried out in various geographical regions have collectively demonstrated that aiv 1 is globally distributed and present in various types of environmental samples such as sewage sdiri loulizi et al 2010 kitajima et al 2011b lodder et al 2013 haramoto and kitajima 2017 river water alcalá et al 2010 kitajima et al 2011b lodder et al 2013 hata et al 2014 haramoto and kitajima 2017 groundwater betancourt et al 2014 haramoto and kitajima 2017 and shellfish hansman et al 2008 le guyader et al 2008 sdiri loulizi et al 2010 according to some recent environmental studies this virus can be detected in higher frequency and is present in greater abundance than other human enteric viruses in environmental waters kitajima et al 2014c schmitz et al 2016 these findings regarding environmental occurrence of aiv 1 suggest that this virus could potentially be an appropriate viral indicator in the environment because of their high abundance as well as structural and genetic similarities with some of the other important human enteric viruses kitajima and gerba 2015 in addition to these well known human enteric viruses several types of recently recognized human viruses bocaviruses cardioviruses circoviruses cosaviruses picobirnaviruses and salivirus also have been identified from environmental water samples blinkova et al 2009 hamza et al 2011 haramoto and otagiri 2014 kitajima et al 2014b 2015 this suggests that these emerging viruses which are suspected to be associated with human diseases could potentially be transmitted through water gerba et al 2013 4 2 understanding the epidemiology of viruses through environmental surveillance circulation of viruses between contaminated environmental water and human populations is a key issue on one hand water can be contaminated by humans and on the other hand water can be a route of infection to humans wastewater contains viruses shed from all populations regardless of their health status therefore monitoring viruses in wastewater and environmental water bodies that receive effluents from wwtps could be an appropriate approach for determining the actual prevalence and molecular epidemiology of gastroenteritis viruses in a given geographical region rather than clinical studies sinclair et al 2008 prevost et al 2015a kazama et al 2016 2017 the occurrence and concentration of viruses in sewage can be affected by many factors such as water usage season and incidence of infection in the service population some viral infections are known to have seasonality and concentrations of such viruses in water also show similar seasonal trends eftim et al 2017 procedures for concentrating and detecting viruses as well as the host cell lines used in infectivity assays also affect observed viral concentrations some social factors such as population size population structure and geographical location all have the potential to affect viral concentrations in sewage hewitt et al 2011 the other issue regarding viral quantification in sewage is how to treat datasets particularly those including nondetects which are called left censored datasets even though enteric viruses appear in sewage more frequently than in other environmental water samples their concentrations in sewage are often below the limit of quantification since viral quantities in sewage are used in qmra as a parameter in the exposure scenario it is necessary to be able to determine the parametric distribution for simulating viral concentrations in a batch of sewage samples it is also critical to employ a proper stochastic model for adequately describing enteric virus concentrations in sewage based on left censored data ito et al 2017 the main discussion point for modeling a left censored dataset is how to deal with nondetects as stated above substitution of the nondetect with a specific value such as the limit of quantification or zero is a conventional but primitive approach for dealing with this type of data however it has been proposed that this approach ruins the results of the distribution estimation helsel 2006 alternatively the bayesian approach adapted for left censored data has been applied to the modeling of viral concentrations in water in which transformations of the dataset resulting in the log normal distribution are employed to describe viral concentrations kato et al 2013 since a significant number of detects are required to precisely predict the viral concentration distribution the use of an approximate positive ratio detected sample number total sample number of enteric viruses of interest in water samples is recommended in preliminary experiments the number of sampling events required for the precise prediction of the viral contamination distribution can be determined based on the positive ratio and the number of detected samples ito et al 2015 it will be important to reevaluate the data about viral concentrations in water reported in previous studies for more accurate understanding of the distribution of viruses in water 5 genetic diversity of viral genomes in water 5 1 conventional cloning sequencing analysis recent molecular epidemiological investigations on viruses in environmental samples have revealed that enteric viruses present in the environments are more genetically diverse than previously thought table 2 summarizes the reported genetic diversity of novs and savs i e numbers of nov and sav genotypes in the environment most of the previous studies cloned pcr products and then determined nucleotide sequences of the selected clones typically 3 10 clones the number of clones analyzed in these previous studies eight clones per sample kitajima et al 2010a b 2011a b c should be reasonable to identify the major genotypes of enteric viruses in environmental water samples genetically diverse novs have been identified in environmental samples it has been reported that nov strains identified in environmental samples are more diverse than those detected in feces from gastroenteritis patients sano et al 2006 kitajima et al 2010b prevost et al 2015a kazama et al 2016 2017 for example gii strains as well as gi strains were frequently detected in environmental samples kitajima et al 2010b gi 1 and gi 4 particularly were identified much less frequently from outbreak cases during the study period in the same region interestingly a clinical environmental combination study conducted in japan reported that recombinant nov strains were identified from the feces of gastroenteritis patients as well as sewage samples nakamura et al 2009a the genetic analysis of savs from environmental samples such as wastewater river water and shellfish was reported oka et al 2015 and savs in these water environments were also genetically diverse for example up to six different sav genotypes were detected in a single wastewater sample with an equivalent volume of 0 83 ml of original water kitajima et al 2011a aiv 1 strains in the environment were also shown to be genetically diverse kitajima et al 2011b 2013 2018 and lodder et al 2013 reported the detection of both genotypes a and b in environmental samples in japan the netherlands and the united states whereas the other environmental studies detected either genotype a or b le guyader et al 2008 alcalá et al 2010 sdiri loulizi et al 2010 kitajima et al 2011b 2013 di martino et al 2013 haramoto and kitajima 2017 genotype c has not yet been detected from environmental samples 5 2 viral metagenomic analysis recent advancements in next generation sequencing ngs technology and metagenomics have opened the door for the discovery of new viruses in stool specimens as well as in environmental samples such as sewage the existing methodologies for determining the genetic diversity of enteric viruses in the environment such as cloning sequencing are expected to be replaced by ngs in near future aw and rose 2012 in fact a recent study investigated the genetic diversity of advs in water samples using a next generation amplicon sequencing approach ogorzaly et al 2015 some viral metagenomic analyses using ngs have been performed on raw sewage and reclaimed water demonstrating high diversity of viral types in both raw and treated wastewater rosario et al 2009a cantalupo et al 2011 since metagenomic approaches using the second generation sequencing technologies obtain nucleotide sequences from all nucleic acid fragments in the samples it is important to remove non viral genomes before extracting dna or rna using techniques such as sequential filtration e g tangential flow filter units rosario et al 2009a rodriguez brito et al 2010 ng et al 2012 tamaki et al 2012 tseng et al 2013 aw et al 2014 membranes with a pore size of 0 2 0 22 μm are first used for the removal of bacterial and eukaryotic cells followed by the concentration of viral particles and then the removal of free nucleotides using ultrafiltration 30 100 kda molecular weight cut off additionally density gradient ultracentrifugation using cesium chloride rosario et al 2009a rodriguez brito et al 2010 tamaki et al 2012 tseng et al 2013 or sucrose ng et al 2012 is used often for further purification and concentration of the viral particles prior to viral nucleic acid extractions dnase and or rnase treatments are applied to digest naked nucleic acids sometimes rnase treatments are avoided if rna viruses are being analyzed because of concerns that they may destroy rna genomes even within viral capsids griffin et al 2000 cole et al 2003 after nucleotide extractions and cdna synthesis the viral dna or cdna is amplified using primers with artificial sequences either by commercial kits or using in house protocols to obtain enough dna fragments for sequencing a number of human viruses have been identified from the viral metagenomes of wastewater cantalupo et al 2011 aw et al 2014 ng et al 2012 families adenoviridae papillomaviridae parvoviridae and polyomaviridae have been detected among the dna viruses while families astroviridae caliciviridae hepeviridae picobirnaviridae picornaviridae and reoviridae have been found among the rna viruses however these works have reported that the majority of the sequence reads or contigs did not match with any sequences in the international nucleotide sequence database also known as the ddbj ena genbank database implying that the majority of viruses in wastewater have not been identified considering the concentrations of known human viruses fig 2 compared to those of viral particles in wastewater 108 1010 particles ml otawa et al 2007 rosario et al 2009a wu and liu 2009 it is reasonable to conclude that the abundance of known human viruses in viral metagenomes is very low ng et al 2012 went further to construct complete genome sequences of novel viruses from fragments of sequence reads they suggested several novel viruses including picalivirus a new member of the picorna like virus superfamily in addition to families picornaviridae and caliciviridae however although they presented candidate genome sequences of novel viruses those sequences were constructed by clustering short sequence reads probably from a number of viral genomes and the existence of those viruses with the suggested genome sequences has not been confirmed to date this limitation may be overcome by using the third generation sequencing technologies that can analyze thousands of nucleotides in a genome fragment e g pacbio pacific biosciences menlo park usa by combining the second accurate but short and third long but less accurate generation sequencing technologies it would be possible to identify novel viruses in wastewater and other environmental samples which needs to be studied in future work besides the detection of human viruses metagenomic analyses revealed abundance of plant viruses especially pmmov in human feces a metagenomic analysis of rna viruses in human fecal samples found that 85 21 838 25 779 of identified viral sequences belonged to pmmov zhang et al 2006 they also tested additional fecal samples for pmmov using rt pcr finding that 67 12 18 of the samples were positive for the virus another work by nakamura et al 2009b also detected pmmov in 40 2 5 of viral metagenomes from the feces of nov infected patients these were confirmed by rt pcr the presence of pmmov in human feces was further analyzed with rt qpcr colson et al 2010 hamza et al 2011 although the positive ratios varied substantially from 7 2 colson et al 2010 to 95 hamza et al 2011 both reported the presence of pmmov in human feces these findings suggest the possibility that pmmov could infect humans indeed human immune systems respond to pmmov the presence of the anti pmmov igm antibodies in serum was significantly higher in pmmov positive patients 13 13 100 than in pmmov negative patients 10 16 63 colson et al 2010 pmmov positive ratios in feces were found to be significantly higher among patients with fever abdominal pain and pruritus however as warned by the authors of this study the symptoms may have been caused by other co factors such as eating spicy foods as clearly shown in fig 2 recent environmental surveys have demonstrated that pmmov is present in various types of water samples such as raw wastewater rosario et al 2009b hamza et al 2011 kitajima et al 2014c treated wastewater rosario et al 2009b hamza et al 2011 betancourt et al 2014 kitajima et al 2014c surface water hamza et al 2011 haramoto et al 2013 betancourt et al 2014 seawater rosario et al 2009b and groundwater betancourt et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 with much higher concentrations than other viruses pmmov has been detected from the feces of chicken seagulls geese and cows but have thus far been absent in horses sheep coyotes raccoons pigs and dogs rosario et al 2009b hamza et al 2011 considering the relatively lower positive ratios and concentrations of pmmov in animal feces there is a possibility that pmmov can be used as an indicator of human fecal contamination however it is unclear if pmmov can be detected in polluted water without fecal contamination including wastewater from food processing facilities and runoff water from pepper farms further investigations are necessary to evaluate more accurately the feasibility of pmmov as a human fecal indicator the second generation sequencing technology also has been applied to investigate the molecular heterogeneity of certain enteric viruses in water ogorzaly et al 2015 developed an amplicon ngs assay for advs in wastewater and river water a hypervariable region of the hexon gene was amplified and genotyped by sequencing the amplicons with sanger and ngs methods they found that the detected genotypes using the sanger sequencing method adv types 31 and 41 were also the dominant detected types using the ngs method in addition the amplicon ngs method was able to detect an additional 5 types of advs in the samples kazama et al 2016 developed an amplicon ngs method to identify genotypes of novs in raw sewage the method successfully detected 14 genotypes of novs gi and gii with up to eight genotypes in one sample whereas only four genotypes were detected from the feces of patients collected concurrently in the region the spread of gii 4 sydney 2012 variant in 2012 2013 winter season kazama et al 2016 and the emergence of gii 17 subclusters kawasaki323 2014 2014 2015 winter season and kawasaki308 2015 2015 2016 winter season kazama et al 2017 were observed by using this method these works demonstrated that the amplicon ngs assay can determine a more detailed distribution of viral genotypes of interest than conventional approaches which supports the concept of analyzing the global circulation of enteric viruses in water environments 6 conclusions 1 numerous methods for concentrating viruses have been developed yet no single method seems to be entirely effective in concentrating all human enteric viruses of interest from various types of water samples therefore it is important to monitor the recovery efficiencies of target viruses especially for emerging viruses because recoveries can vary greatly across samples simultaneous concentration of viruses protozoa and bacteria in a single water sample is also of great interest for better understanding the prevalence of waterborne pathogens 2 qpcr based methods have become the standard for detection of viral genomes in concentrated water samples however some efforts are needed still to reduce the levels of pcr inhibition to allow the simultaneous detection of as many virus types as possible and to selectively detect viral genomes derived from viable viruses only 3 process controls to assess virus recovery during detection procedures can be divided into three types wpcs mpcs and rt qpcr controls various types of process controls have been employed at each point of inoculation but no gold standard has been established to date for applying controls while still maintaining appropriate recovery values however it is still highly recommended to include at least one of the three process control types for more accurate interpretation of the data not only the recovery from individual samples but also a mean recovery need to be considered to assess the overall performance of the detection procedure 4 recent investigations based on qpcr detections have revealed some virus type specific profiles for viral concentrations in water environments worldwide for example the concentrations of novs and savs generally increase in winter their epidemic period whereas those of other commonly found enteric viruses such as advs and evs are relatively constant throughout the year 5 there are increasing numbers of environmental studies that have surveyed the genetic diversity of viral genomes including the genomes of novel viruses in water samples in addition to conventional cloning sequencing techniques recently developed ngs methods have been used successfully for selected viruses such as advs and novs suggesting a continued role in future research since it is expected that the genotype distribution of viruses in raw sewage reflects the actual incidence of local viral infectious cases further environmental surveillance needs to be conducted in more regions worldwide acknowledgements this study was supported by the japan science and technology agency jst through core research for evolutionary science and

19661,being cost effective synthetic materials were initially used abundantly for the removal of oil gradually however awareness of the use of dispersants like corexit which makes water resources more toxic than oil has changed the scenario for the treatment of spilled oil the removal of spilled oil from water resources is still a very topical issue an eco friendly and sustainable approach towards the environment has introduced many low cost non toxic and biodegradable materials along with different biomasses to make micro to nano sized materials membranes sponges aerogel etc for the removal and recovery of oil from water resources additionally the reusability of these materials after the recovery of oils has added one more step towards sustainability this review comprises the work conducted by various researchers in the field of the removal and recovery of spilled oils using various biomasses and polymers either in the form of sorbents or separators graphical abstract image keywords oil spill sorbent particle surfactant aerogel gelator separator 1 introduction currently the challenge is to clean water resources which are being polluted by oil either in the form of routine shipping run offs from industry dumping or oil spills noaa 2017a an oil spill is the accidental or intentional discharge of petroleum hydrocarbons into the environment especially the marine ecosystem an oil spill on water can be transported by wind and current and the distributed oil either evaporates or forms a surface slick disperses in water or submerges and accumulates in the sediments reddy et al 2002 liu et al 2012 additionally temperature salinity and waves also increase oil transportation and weathering rates moreover oil spill from tankers such as exxon valdex in 1987 11 million gallons carson et al 2003 and deep horizon in 2010 4 9 million barrels brody et al 2010 were marked as the greatest disasters for the marine environment since most oils float on the water surface seabirds and marine animals are mainly affected barron 2012 and other creatures and terrestrial animals are harmed if the oil comes ashore brody et al 2010 such spilled oils also affect humans through inhalation skin and eye irritation many researchers have reviewed the aspects and impacts of these spills on the ecosystem over time jernelöv 2010 henkel et al 2012 chang et al 2014 and developed various methods and chemicals for oil spill response michel et al 1992 itopf 2014a however the spill intensity and location determine the clean up technology that needs to be applied oil spill treatment methods can be classified as physical mechanical chemical or biological epa 2017 physical mechanical methods include booms that are stationary floating devices to prevent the movement of the oil slick using high temperature booms enables the burning of the oil in situ evans et al 2001 fingas 2011 iogp 2016 skimmers are stationary or mobile devices that were used to remove floating and or emulsified oil from the water surface michel et al 1992 hydrophobic meshes that repel water but allow oil to pass through can be utilized in skimmers for enhanced oil recovery chemical methods include dispersants ipieca 2001 itopf 2014b graham et al 2016 sprayed on the oil spill to break it up into small droplets noaa 2017b in addition sorbent materials may be used in small scale oil spills biological methods include the addition of microbes and or nutrients and or oxygen to stimulate bacterial growth and the resultant biodegradation of the spilled oil azubuike et al 2016 however physiochemical methods have limitations in terms of crude oil clean up so recently biological methods have held sway das and preethy 2011 dave and ghaly 2011 however the selection of sorbent materials is dependent on the nature of the spilled oil teas et al 2001 the rate at which oil can be treated in open waters depends on the treatment method dispersants applied from aircrafts are the fastest followed by skimming and in situ burning graham et al 2016 in addition environmental conditions affect the performance of the treatment methods such as wind currents waves oil viscosity and sensitivity to debris the costs of different oil spill treatment methods from the least to most expensive are as follows in situ burning dispersants mechanical recovery and manual cleanup despite cost efficiency in situ burning generates many particulates and carbon dioxide in the environment mullin and champ 2003 choosing the oil spill treatment method becomes an optimization task by minimizing both the environmental impact and cost of operation local jurisdiction also affects costs due to possible fines based on the amount of spilled oil which limits the oil spill however some treatment methods leave the oil in the environment so it may still cause damage to the ecosystem it was therefore suggested to impose fines based only on the amount of oil left in the environment in other words recovering the spilled oil would decrease the amount of the fine this kind of jurisdiction could make recovery methods more economically viable depending on the scale of the fine and the oil spill scenario prendergast and gschwend 2014 most of the materials reviewed in this paper aim to either recover spilled oil or enhance the biodegradation of the oil the best solution in the case of an oil spill depends on numerous factors and the optimal solution from environmental and economic points of view might be a combination of several different methods therefore instead of classifying oil spill treatment methods based on technical aspects solution based classification of oil recovery or oil biodegradation is proposed in the case of an oil spill either the oil must be left in the environment for biodegradation or it can be recovered from the environment and to achieve this there are different technical methods and materials scheme 1 shows this classification existing dispersants chemical herders are chemically stable but non biodegradable so remain longer in the marine environment there is therefore a growing demand for green facile and eco friendly low cost sorbents from biopolymers for the treatment of oil spills and chemical leaks in past few years advanced materials such as aerogels foam membranes inorganic meshes and surface modified fabrics have been used extensively for the separation of oil water mixtures meanwhile the increasing population rate has increased the rate of food consumption resulting in massive amounts of bio waste globally for this reason the wise way is to use such easily biodegradable bio waste or biomass to produce low cost sorbents with higher oil sorption capacity that are simple to scale up for the cleanup of an oil spill rather than hazardous chemicals this review addresses the potential and environmentally friendly bio based materials in the form of sorbents particles gelators surfactants and separators for oil spill treatment these kinds of bio based materials have recently been the subject of increasing interest in oil spill treatment applications and reviews have been published on specific materials or methods sabir 2015 ifelebuegu and johnson 2017 the different materials and methods for oil spill treatment are suitable for different kind of conditions for sustainable and effective oil spill treatment bio based materials must be studied extensively since one material is unlikely to be suitable in all possible oil spill scenarios additionally local legislation has also affected the economic view of the materials and method design must be considered legislation is subject to changes due to increased environmental awareness which has a direct impact on oil spill treatment methods so the utilization of bio based materials in different kind of oil spill treatment methods and materials must be extensively studied and researched in response to different kinds of oil spill scenarios and possible future legislation this review highlights a wide range of different bio based oil spill treatment materials and methods along with their strengths and weaknesses 2 statistical trend of sorbents used in oil spill response the statistical trends based on the scopus database of various sorbents studied extensively in the past ten years are given below fig 1 this implies that more research is being conducted using these materials as oil sorbents statistical data shows a continual increment in the use of nanoparticles and aerogel for oil spill treatment in the past few years 3 materials for oil removal dispersion and biodegradation 3 1 biomass sorbents in adsorption sorbate molecules accumulate on the surface of the sorbent in the case of oil adsorption the oil molecules need to diffuse onto the sorbent surface the oil molecules then entrapped in the sorbent due to capillary effects and finally the oil droplets agglomerate in the pores of the sorbent oil consists mainly of non polar hydrocarbons and their adsorption is attributed to physical non covalent interactions such as van der waals forces wahi et al 2013 however for fibrous sorbent only adsorption and capillary action processes take place in this paper the term oil sorption is used instead of oil adsorption absorption separation or removal since all these terms are used in literature when discussing oil sorption on various materials the differences have not usually been discussed in literature and one of the terms is used without further rationalization therefore to avoid confusion in this paper oil sorption refers to oil removal using sorbents surface chemistry and morphology determine the wettability of the surface which closely relates to the adsorption of oils water contact angle is used to measure wettability if the contact angle of a water droplet on a flat surface is less than 90 it is characterized as hydrophilic if the contact angle is between 90 and 150 it is characterized as hydrophobic and if the contact angle is over 150 it is characterized as superhydrophobic fig 2 similar measurements can be done for different kinds of oils and the solid material can be characterized as oleophilic oleophobic or superoleophobic respectively the hydrophobicity of the sorbent prevents water sorption and therefore enhances the oil sorption capacity due to the lack of competition between water and oil molecules natural materials such as lotus leaves are superhydrophobic but superhydrophobicity can be also introduced into an otherwise non superhydrophobic material by increasing the roughness of the surface and decreasing the surface energy an ideal sorbent for oil sorption has high porosity and surface area and is selective to oil for oil spill treatment applications the sorbent should also be mechanically and chemically stable recyclable environmentally friendly and have low density and good buoyancy properties gupta and tai 2016 natural products such as cotton kapok rice straw etc are abundant low cost biodegradable and non toxic materials and therefore ideal for oil sorption in oil spill treatment refer table 1 the downsides of such materials are poor hydrophobicity buoyancy and sorption capacity maleki 2016 there were a variety of different kind of modifications to natural sorbent materials reported in literature which enhanced the properties of the materials such as hydrophobicity and sorption capacity ideally the modification should be minimal and should keep the good properties of the native material while enhancing weaker properties i e enhancing oil sorption and buoyancy while not altering the biocompatibility of the materials moreover the sorption capacity of the oleophilic sorbents prepared via bulk polymerization mainly depends on the size and molecular weight of the polymer used increasing size from monomer to macromonomer increases the cross linked structure but in turn decreases the swelling capacity by blocking the penetration of organic solvents into polymer network on the other hand the increasing molecular weight of the dendric structure macromonomer also increase the hydrophobicity of the sorbent kizil and sonmez 2017 cheaper and readily biodegradable plant biomass such as kapok fiber cattail fiber salvinia sp wood chip rice husk coconut husk and bagasse are used as inserts to remove oil from the storm water runoff of gas station effluent with 70 greater oil removal capacity compared to synthetic polymer fiber sorbent due to the presence of ample void spaces in their loose fiber structure and hydrophobicity khan et al 2004 the bio waste of rice rice husk contains a large amount of silica the pyrolysis of rice husk causes the decomposition of organic material and the breaking of bonds between the silicon and organic material present in it this enhances the hydrophobicity of rice husk which leads to the purification of crude oil vlaev et al 2011 the adsorption of the oils shows a direct dependency on granulometric composition i e weight ratio of c sio2 along with the bulk density surface morphology and oleophilicity of the sorbent however an inverse dependency of sorbent bulk density on the height of penetration of the oil in it exists angelova et al 2011 moreover alkaline treatment of rice husk produces lignocellulosic sorbent material by removing its silica which enhances the adsorption capacity of the diesel such adsorbed oil along with the sorbent can be used as a solid fuel bazargan et al 2014 another low cost sorbent obtained from silkworm cocoon waste removes 30 more motor oil and vegetable oil from marine water than natural wool fibers moriwaki et al 2009 various fruit peels such as banana and orange being rich in cellulosic content can remove heavy oil more effectively than lighter oils abdullah et al 2016 alaa el din et al article in press similarly tontiwachwuthikul et al show the effectiveness of potato peel in the remediation of water from a waste lubricating oil spill tontiwachwuthikul et al 2016 cellulosic materials being fluffy and possessing low bulk density show higher uptake of marine fuel with less treatment macroporous agricultural waste called luffa with low bulk density removed more than 50 of crude oil from water with good reusability abdelwahab 2014 3 2 particles particle behavior in the presence of oil and water mainly depends on its functional characteristics together with size and porosity which either undergoes emulsion and or adsorption in an emulsion system small volume fraction is classified as dispersed phase oil and larger as continuous phase aqueous water strongly hydrophilic particles get wetted only by water and remain dispersed in the aqueous phase of the emulsion whereas strongly hydrophobic particles remain in the oil due to being wetted only by the oil phase the particle needs to be amphiphilic in order to adsorb at the interface oil in water o w emulsion is favorable when the three phased contact angle ca between the oil solid and water is 90 whereas water in oil w o emulsion when ca is 90 aveyard et al 2003 moreover adsorption free energy is at maximum when the ca is 90 i e the particle is equally wetted by both the aqueous and oil phases in this case other factors such as the wettability of the particles inter particle interactions etc must be considered knowing the type of emulsion emulsions are therefore stable if particle adsorption and droplet stabilization by those particles resist destabilization phenomena such as coagulation and coalescence chevalier and bolzinger 2013 however lam et al in their work emphasized that stable emulsion has also been observed with contact angles 20 120 lam et al 2014 however the oil water emulsion system separates if the interfacial tension ift between these two phases increases moreover interfacial area had direct influence on resulting droplet size depending on particle dosage i e a lower number of particles creates a small interfacial area and larger droplets whereas a higher number of particles forms fine emulsion with smaller droplets fig 3 shows the pictorial form of particles used in the destabilization of oils generally raw natural sorbents have excellent adsorption capacity biodegradability and non toxicity in comparison with synthetic sorbents but their low hydrophobicity increases water uptake and lowers oil sorption capacity many researchers are therefore working on the enhancement of oil sorption affinity through various modifications or the addition of hydrophobic moieties to these natural sorbents as the functional group properties play a significant role in the adsorption of oils refer table 2 the addition of a hydrophobic chain on the biopolymer enhances the tensile properties and thermal stability of the polymers amri et al 2011 and forms more stable emulsion due to its amphiphilicity doshi et al 2018 however by increasing the hydrophobicity the particles get wetter in oil than in water and form w o instead of o w emulsion andresen and stenius 2007 on the contrary the formation of stable emulsions is feasible by switching the ph rather than hydrophobic modification liu et al 2012 pickering emulsions are emulsions stabilized by solid particles with similar properties to classical emulsions stabilized by surfactant which can be either o w w o or multiple emulsions chevalier and bolzinger 2013 cellulose nanocrystals cnc obtained using a deep eutectic solvent des of choline chloride with oxalic acid dihydrate form emulsified creaming with marine diesel through pickering emulsions which in the case of oil spill can be easily skimmed laitinen et al 2017a such particles forming pickering emulsions are irreversibly adsorbed at the oil water interface and require high energy for desorption compared to conventional surfactants so particles that carry thermo responsive polymers copolymers are used as stabilizers for o w pickering emulsion and the emulsions are destabilized by simple heating zoppe et al 2012 cellulose consists of long chains of poly β 1 4 d glucosyl residues and these chains unite to form long thread like fibers known as microfibrils due to the hydrophilic nature of fibrillated and micro fibrillated cellulose mfc wettability in water is more than that in oil to form o w emulsion bifunctionalized cellulose rod like nanocrystals 120 nm in length obtained by oxidation of cellulose with sodium periodate and chlorite followed by amination with n butylamine were effectively used to stabilized oil in water o w emulsion of up to 3 5 sea water salinity ojala et al 2016 hydrophilic carboxymethyl chitosan cmc obtained from crab shells destabilized marine diesel diesel and marine 2t oil into small droplets of 100 μm at sea water alkalinity and salinity doshi et al 2017 in a similar way our previous work kalliola et al 2016 reflects the applicability of ca 2 cross linked cmc nanoparticles to stabilize dodecane in o w emulsions however chitosan flakes have superior adsorption properties to chitosan powder for oil barros et al 2014 chitosan microspheres produced by ionic gelation of chitosan with sodium tripolyphosphate stp separated 90 of the oil from oil industry effluents using packed columns grem et al 2013 on the other hand polymeric microspheres derived from eugenol suspension polymerization and self crosslinking showed higher adsorption of chloroform and toluene than gasoline diesel and kerosene as these lighter oils consists of longer molecular chains which adsorb on the surfaces of microspheres and block further adsorption of small molecules deng et al 2015 aerogel microspheres obtained from polyvinyl alcohol pva and cellulose nanofibril cnf exhibit outstanding oil solvent absorption capacities for floating oil cleanup zhai et al 2016 recently nano particles and polymer based blends have appeared with better surface functionality and biodegradability in comparison to other sorbents used for oil removal along with simple recovery and reusability fouad et al 2016 similarly another technique to produce continuous fibers ranging from nanometers to micrometers in diameter is electrospinning wang et al recently reviewed nanofibrous materials obtained by electrospinning for oil water separation wang et al 2016 nanofibers obtained from polyvinyl chloride pvc and polystyrene through blending electrospinning process showed 5 9 times higher sorption capacity than commercial polypropylene for motor oil peanut oil and diesel respectively because of high porosity zhu et al 2011 for oil sorption an appropriate size void is mandatory and can be determined by the viscosity and gravity of the oil fiber roughness and diameter together with the interfacial force between oil and water nowadays the removal of oil by magnetism is attracting attention as oil or emulsified oil can be easily separated from water by an external magnetic field in short the adsorbed oil and particles are easily removed by the external magnetic field once the magnetic particles are completely wetted by the oil magnetic hybrid nanoparticles in the absence and presence of chitosan fe3o4 sio2 sichitosan were applied on the water surface containing non polar solvents and chitosan grafted nanoparticles were more effective due to the high surface to volume ratio and reduced particle dimensions soares et al 2017 quaternized chitosan qc coated with magnetic nanoparticles mnp was also reported zhang et al 2017 with excellent oil water separation at different phs without showing significant difference in separation up to 8 cycles compared to that of mnp coated with silica and 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes this observed behavior was due to the positive surface charge of qc coated mnp at various ph levels enabling adsorption onto the negatively charged oil droplets via electrostatic attraction gomes de souza et al demonstrated the high chemical affinity of magnetic material with a polymer matrix for the removal of oil from the water surface gomes de souza et al 2010 polymer coated nanoparticles showed effective separation of oil from oil water mixture mirshahghassemi and lead 2015 but the presence of natural organic macromolecules reduced the nanoparticles oil interactions governed by the hydrophobic effect of the polymer coating which led to a decrease in oil removal mirshahghassemi et al 2016 moreover scale up of these magnetic particles is easy and cheap with high sorption capacity mirshahghassemi et al 2017 generally if the particle is small enough 5 nm 52 μm lam et al 2014 and can be wetted by both aqueous and oil phase it can adsorb at the oil water interface and stabilize emulsions also called pickering emulsions for particulate adsorbents neither of these criteria is usually fulfilled since oil adsorbents are normally prepared as hydrophobic and cannot be wetted by the aqueous phase moreover the particle size is usually larger since separation of the adsorbent from the aqueous phase is not convenient for particles of near nano size unless the particles have suitable magnetic properties and can be separated using magnets additionally adsorbent particles usually exhibit surface roughness and porosity to increase the surface area of the adsorbent surface roughness is found to decrease the stability of pickering emulsions lam et al 2014 dickinson 2017 so is not a desirable property the particles used in oil spill response can act either as a surfactant dispersing agent emulsifying agent herding agent or coating materials 3 3 surfactants surfactants surface active molecules are amphiphilic compounds which reduce oil water interfacial tension by orienting the interaction of hydrophilic groups with the water phase and the hydrophobic groups with oil and depressing coalescence by forming stable micro emulsions such microemulsions occur spontaneously and mainly depend on surfactant type and structure for example if the surfactant is ionic along with a single hydrocarbon chain microemulsion formation takes place in the presence of co surfactant and or electrolyte whereas for non ionic and double chain ionics surfactants co surfactant is not required eastoe 2003 winsor proposed four types of microemulsions winsor 1947 as mentioned in fig 4 watcharasing et al demonstrated the removal of motor oil from winsor type iii microemulsions using the froth floatation process a surfactant based separation process watcharasing et al 2009 surfactants are mainly present in the dispersants that break the oil slick into smaller droplets and can move easily into the water column dispersion effectiveness is the percentage of an oil slick treated with a given dispersant under a stated set of mixing conditions dispersants corexit 9527 and corexit 9500a comprising anionic surfactant dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate doss were widely used for the deepwater horizon oil spill response belore et al 2009 herding agents are surface active molecules which when added along the periphery of an oil spill slick contract and thicken the slicks or push them together for easy burning or collection marex 2016 however existing chemical dispersants herders are chemically stable but are non biodegradable and stay longer in the marine environment gray et al 2014 place et al 2016 so current research focuses more on developing eco friendly biodegradable green dispersing herding agents for the cleanup of oil spills from water as summarized in table 3 muhammad et al showed the eggshell modified by surfactant for the effective removal of crude oil from water muhammad et al 2015 bio based surfactants obtained from biological sources are favored due to their biodegradability and lesser environmental risks hydroxylated soya bean lecithin reduces the rigidity of the fatty acid chains with dense surfactant packing at the oil water interface which shows that hydrophilicity improves the interfacial coverage by resisting the coalescence of the droplets nyankson et al 2016 blends obtained from the food grade amphiphilies such as lecithin and tween 80 60 40 in the presence of ethanol as a solvent turn out to be an effective emulsifier for oil spills athas et al 2014 similarly replacing some ethanol with co solvents such as octane or octanol enhances dispersion effectiveness suggesting that hydrophobic solvents strengthen dispersant oil miscibility riehm et al 2015 moreover oil into water emulsification reveals rapid leaching of surfactants from oil into water which lowers dispersant effectiveness such as tween 80 rich dispersants whereas water into oil emulsification indicates stabilization of surfactants in the oil by increasing the dispersant effectiveness such as lecithin rich dispersants hence tween 80 rich dispersants exhibit lower dispersion effectiveness than lecithin rich dispersants riehm et al 2017 in a future perspective such mixtures can be used in corexit compounds rather than doss recently wang et al showed that the presence of xantham gum additive in chemical dispersant 9500a through a synergistic mechanism enhances dispersion effectiveness droplet stability and the biodegradation of crude oil wang et al 2017 plant based herding agents phytol tend to hydrolyze quickly after herding compared to commercial silicone based herders gupta et al 2015 even though silicone based herders are effective in spilled oil thickening but they exist in the marine environment due to slow biodegradability edwards et al showed the reduced toxicity of bio surfactants over synthetic surfactants used in oil spill treatment edwards et al 2003 bio surfactants the surface active amphiphilies produced from the micro organisms require a culture medium with a hydrophobic and hydrophilic carbon source and have enhance bioavailability of inaccessible substrates with survival under low moisture conditions in such bio surfactants the hydrophobic moiety can be either protein peptide or fatty acids with 10 18 carbon atoms chain whereas hydrophilic moiety comprises hydroxyl carboxylate ester or phosphate groups silva et al reviewed the potentiality of bio surfactants in the oil industry and the bioremediation of oil spills silva et al 2014 however biosurfactant production from agro industrial wastes must be studied more due to its lower production costs for oil spill remediation emulsifying agents which disperse oil slicks into smaller droplets and boost oil biodegradation by microbes are widely used another way towards sustainability is microbes which degrade oil and ingest oil droplets as a part of their natural diet this reveals that such microbes produce their own surfactants known as biological compounds which consist of sugars amino acids and lipids these compounds are classified into two groups biosurfactants which have low molecular weight compounds rhamnolipids and surfactin produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus subtilis and bioemulsifiers comprising high molecular weight compounds emulsan and alasan produced by acinetobacter radioresistens and acinetobacter venetianus recombination activating gene hence the alternative green way to clean marine oil spill is bioremediation through such biological compounds refer fig 5 r mohanram et al found that some biosurfactant and bioemulsifiers produce bacteria from the oil polluted water of the mumbai harbor mohanram et al 2016 some examples include iturins esperine mycosubtilin and surfactin which are cyclic lipopeptides produced by the bacillus species rongsayamanonta et al synthesized a solvent free dispersant for crude oil spills using lipopeptides from bacillus sp gy19 based on hydrophilic lipophilic deviation concept rongsayamanonta et al 2017 4 materials for oil recovery 4 1 conventional sorbents the use of sorbents in oil spill treatment allows the recovery of the oil and reuse of sorbent material which is considered environmentally friendly and economical al majed et al 2012 there are different kinds of oil recovery methods reported in literature see table 4 such as vacuum filtration wang et al 2013 distillation yang et al 2014 and extraction feng et al 2017 mechanical and chemical stability are important for the reuse of the materials mechanical pressure during the mechanical recovery of oil may cause deformations in the pore structure of the material and result in decreased oil sorption capacity in addition the material should be stable against elevated temperature and solvents during oil recovery by distillation and or extraction superhydrophobic dissocyanate modified lignin xerogel was prepared by the formation of organogel in thf followed by ambient pressure drying with 75 1 porosity and a borderline water contact angle of 146 4 the sorption capacity of various oils was 2 5 g g when absorbing gasoline the material was recyclable by distillation at 70 c for five cycles with no decrease in performance yang et al 2014 wang et al studied hydrophobically modified kapok fibers with polymerized butylmetacrylate pbma and silica nanoparticles as an oil sorbent the pbma and silica nanoparticle coating on the fiber enhanced the oil sorption due to increased nano and micro scale roughness on the surface and the low surface energy of pbma the prepared material had high and selective oil sorption from a mixture of various oils approximately 65 90 g g and could be reused at least six times by vacuum filtration after six cycles the sorption capacity reduced by approximately 6 10 wang et al 2013 in another study wang et al prepared superhydrophobic and oleophilic kapok fibers by coating them with silica nanoparticles and silanization the materials showed high sorption of various oils 40 85 g g was reusable for at least eight cycles and oil was recovered by vacuum filtration the sorption capacity decreased slightly depending on the oil type wang et al 2012 cotton with superhydrophobic and superoleophilic properties was prepared by the attachment of silica nanoparticles on the surface of cotton and subsequent octadecyltrichlorosilane modification to introduce hydrophobicity into the material with a water contact angle of 156 the materials showed high and selective oil sorption 26 50 g g of various oils with ten times the reusability and almost constant sorption capacity calcagnile et al 2017 4 2 separators conventional techniques such as gravitational separation skimming and flotation are more feasible for oil water mixtures but steeped down for oil water emulsions due to micro and nanosized droplets to overcome such limitation superhydrophobic and superoleophilic separators like mesh and or membranes have been developed refer table 5 with a smaller pore size than emulsions fig 6 shows the selective separation of oil and water depending on the wettability of the mesh and the density of the oil mesh membranes with selective surface wettability can attract either of the phases from the oil water mixture through effective gravity filtration yu et al 2016 moreover the surface chemical composition also determines the intermolecular forces at their interfaces which is enhanced through surface roughness a mixture of waste potato residue and polyurethane coated stainless steel mesh shows dual characteristics i e superhydrophilic and superoleophilic and separates oil and water mixtures through prewetting depending on their respective densities li et al 2016 however fibrous tunicate cellulose nanocrystal tcnc based superhydrophilic and underwater oleophilic membrane separate surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsions depending on their porosity cheng et al 2017 chitosan based film is stable in alkaline medium but the protonation of the amino groups makes them sensitive in acidic conditions and to overcome this amino groups were blocked through cross linking agent however the completely cross linked film tends to be brittle so the mixing of chitosan with polyvinyl alcohol pva prior to cross linking makes the film tougher cs pva coated mesh through glutaraldehyde crosslinking also improves the stability of separation under acidic conditions zhang et al 2013 the superhydrophilicity of the chitosan composite coated metallic mesh shows the effective separation of various oils from oil water mixture by blocking the oil on the surface of the mesh with high stability in harsh environments liu et al 2016 similarly hierarchical rough structures can be obtained by introducing sio2 nanoparticles to chitosan cts and sodium perfluororooctanoate pfo nanocomposite prior to coating which leads the reorganization of fluorinated moieties to make a hydrophilic subsurface for the water to penetrate through it yang et al 2014 however hydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic materials mesh proved superior to hydrophobic and oleophilic materials due to a reduction in external fouling and water barrier capacity antifouling cellulose membrane obtained through reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer technique raft possesses a fibrillary structure which captures the oil easily without any structural disruption during filtration and myrcene blocks the foul odor of thiol molecules from water kollarigowda et al 2017 one of the eco friendly ways to separate oil from water is to generate bio based membrane through replacement of the metallic mesh substrate a bio based foam membrane obtained by blending agarose and gelatin along with genipin cross linker results in a lamellar structure where superhydrophilic agarose micropore is surrounded by gelation walls through hydrogen bonding this allows the aggregated water to pass through the pores by breaking the water molecular film from the oily wastewater and leaving behind oil and the oil fouled membrane is completely biodegraded in soil over a period of one month chaudhary et al 2014 the porosity of such aerogel membrane is enhanced by replacing gelatin with chitosan where thin layered agarose is surrounded by chitosan walls with inter walled cross linked genipin which enhances the recovery of high quality water from oil spills chaudhary et al 2016 similarly transforming surface to hydrophobic enhances the selectivity of oil over water in order to achieve a superhydrophobic and superoleophilic surface the polyimide cellulose acetate fibrous membrane was coated with fluorinated polybenzoxazine along with silica nanoparticles showing water repellence by the air pockets of the membrane ma et al 2017 a porous unmanned ship pus with a low water adhesion force on the mesh surface infiltrates the oil through the porous mesh without any artificial operation which can protect humans from toxic oil spills however water wettability can change the superhydrophobic behavior of pus to hydrophobic the recycling of the pus after the removal of oil is simple with easy scale up wang et al 2015 4 3 aerogels aerogel is a gel in which the continuous liquid phase has been replaced by air resulting in a solid porous material the typical characteristics of an aerogel are high porosity 99 high surface area 100 m2 g and low density 10 mg ml these characteristics are ideal for oil sorption applications allowing for rapid sorption and flotation on water aerogels for oil sorption have been the subject of intensive research in recent years aerogels can be prepared using inorganic materials synthetic organic materials and natural biomaterials al majed et al 2012 such as silica wang et al 2012 graphene hu et al 2014 kabiri et al 2014 li et al 2014 and nanocellulose laitinen et al 2017b respectively however in this review we shall concentrate on aerogels derived from bio based sources a good number of the reported aerogels are prepared from nanocellulose which liu et al have recently reviewed liu et al 2017 the reported oil absorbency values in literature are based on large variety of different oils so the absorbency in table 6 is reported on a scale between the minimum and maximum values it has however been noted by multiple authors that the density of the oil affects the mass absorbency value giving higher values for higher density oils the use of volume based absorbency has been proposed but not yet been widely applied the main benefit of aerogels sorbents for oil spill treatment is the recovery of the oil and the recyclability of the sorbent material several different kinds of recovery methods have been reported such as extraction meng et al 2015 distillation cheng et al 2017 and mechanical squeezing jin et al 2015 combustion has also been reported as a way to recover the absorbent but not the oil bi et al 2013 squeezing might be the most environmentally friendly way to recover the oil followed by distillation and extraction extraction might be the least environmentally friendly of the three techniques due to the addition of organic solvents to produce a mixture of oil and the solvent that is then removed the mixture usually needs to be distilled to separate the oil and solvent so that the solvent may be recycled the sorbent also needs to be dried fig 7 shows the functioning of aerogel for the removal and recovery of oil from the spilled area the preparation of an aerogel usually involves freeze drying a gel containing the bio based material dispersed in water cheng et al 2017 tripathi et al 2017 many natural raw materials such as cellulose are amphiphilic so the prepared sorbents absorb both water and oil unless the sorbent is modified to be hydrophobic hydrophobicity was achieved by introducing hydrophobic moieties on the surface of the sorbent according to literature this has been achieved by chemical modifications jiang and hsieh 2014 laitinen et al 2017b or pyrolysis bi et al 2013 han et al 2016 in non pyrolyzed aerogels mechanical and distillation methods to recover the oil tend to decrease absorbency during multiple recycles of the material this is attributed to mechanical degradation of the materials due to mechanical stress caused by squeezing and capillary forces from the evaporating liquid at an increased temperature cheng et al 2017 freeze drying combined with pyrolysis is an environmentally friendly way to prepare hydrophobic aerogels due to the lack of added chemicals or reagents in addition pyrolysis usually increases the mechanical chemical and temperature durability of the materials compared to non pyrolyzed aerogels indicated by the more consistent performance in multiple use of the material table 6 and induces hydrophobicity due to the formation of saturated carbon moieties the downside of pyrolysis is the high temperature up to at least 1450 c reported in literature wu et al 2014 so high energy is required for the process freeze drying is also an energy intensive process due to low temperatures and high vacuum moreover the sublimation of water is slow and the scale up of the freeze drying process to industrial scale is not a trivial task cervin et al produced aerogels by air and oven drying foams were stabilized by surface modified nanofibrillated cellulose the aerogel produced had high porosity 98 and low density 30 mg ml and mechanical properties comparable to aerogels prepared by freeze drying cervin et al 2013 this kind of strategy to produce aerogels for oil spill treatment could be an interesting alternative to freeze drying nonetheless the production of a sufficient amount of aerogel sorbents may prove to be difficult for use in the treatment of large oil spills in general aerogels have higher production costs maleki 2016 than other sorbents in addition the aerogels are usually brittle maleki 2016 which is a drawback since the mechanical properties are important for the reuse of the materials and oil recovery lack of mechanical strength may degrade the materials and decrease sorption capacity ma et al prepared chitosan silica composite aerogel whose mechanical strength was enhanced through an increasing concentration of chitosan ma et al 2015 wu et al prepared a carbon nanofiber aerogel and applied it to oil recovery from oil water mixture carbonaceous nanofibers synthesized through the hydrothermal carbonization method from glucose followed by freeze drying and pyrolysis at 1450 c possessed low density 10 mg ml high porosity 99 good mechanical strength and large specific surface area 547 m2 g this material was also hydrophobic water contact angle 135 8 and superoleophilic oil contact angle 0 resulting in high selectivity to oils and it showed high absorbency 50 140 g g of variety of oils the material was also recyclable with stable performance over ten cycles as demonstrated by the recovery of n hexane by distillation at 69 c wu et al 2014 yuan et al prepared carbon aerogel from bamboo pulp fibers using the freeze drying and pyrolysis up to 800 c method this material showed low density 5 65 mg ml hydrophobicity water contact angle 135 9 large specific surface area 379 39 m2 g high sorption capacity 50 150 g g of a variety of oils and was reusable over five cycles with constant performance two different recovery methods were employed evaporation at an elevated temperature and extraction with cyclohexane followed by evaporation at an elevated temperature to remove residual organics yuan et al 2017 bi et al pyrolyzed 800 c raw cotton to prepare a carbon aerogel the prepared material had low density 12 mg ml hydrophobicity due to pyrolysis and loss of functional groups and high sorption capacity 50 190 g g for a variety of oils oil could be recycled by distillation combustion or the squeezing for five cycles distillation and combustion did not decrease the absorbance of the material in the subsequent cycles but squeezing reduced the absorbance after the first cycle after which the absorbance remained constant bi et al 2013 cellulose diacetate cross linked with 1 2 4 5 benzenetetracarboxylic acid pmda in acetone to form a gel followed by solvent exchange to water and freeze drying the resulted aerogels were subjected to chemical vapor deposition cvd with trichloro octylsilane tcos to introduce hydrophobicity and oleophilicity the prepared material showed low density 4 3 mg ml and highly porosity 99 7 the highest kerosene oil uptake was 111 8 g g aerogel the aerogel could be recycled and the oil recovered ten times by mechanical compression with a 40 reduction in the original value tripathi et al 2017 cellulose nanofibril aerogel was prepared from recycled waste fibers using deep eutectic solvents choline chloride urea for pre treatment and freeze drying silylation was used to introduce hydrophobicity into the materials the materials have low density 2 9 mg ml high porosity 99 81 and hydrophobicity and high sorption capacity for a variety of oils 70 200 g g oil was recovered by mechanical squeezing and the absorbency decreased linearly to approximately 70 80 of the original value during 30 cycles laitinen et al 2017b cellulose nanofibers forming an aerogel were modified by silanization followed by freeze drying the materials have low density 6 8 mg ml high specific surface area 169 1 m2 g high porosity 99 6 and high absorbency of a variety of oils 80 190 g g together with hydrophobicity and oleophilicity recovery of the oil was achieved by a combination of compression 90 of the oil was recovered extraction with tert butanol to remove residue oil and swell the aerogel and freeze drying to recover the aerogel the recovered aerogel was reusable ten times with constant absorbency of diesel approximately 120 g g sai et al 2015 hydrophobic nanocellulose aerogel with oleophilic coating absorb a variety of organic solvents and oil but tio2 deposition through atomic layer deposition techniques is very expensive korhonen et al 2011 so funchin et al introduced a cost effective technique through magnetic cellulose aerogel coated with tio2 which sorbs oil up to 28 times its own weight and can be easily regenerated by immersing in ethanol funchin et al 2014 4 4 gelators low molecular weight phase selective organogelators have been proposed for oil spill treatment applications the gelator is a supramolecular instead of polymeric and is insoluble in water leaving the water phase unchanged the gel formed via non covalent interactions between the gelator molecules allows them to self assemble reversibly into polymeric solid like networks this fiber like network is capable of immobilizing a large volume of liquid usually 99 in ideal conditions due to capillary forces there are several phase selective gelation processes reported in literature where the gelator can be dissolved into the oil by heating and then cooling to form the gel or the gelator can be dissolved in an oil soluble or water soluble solvent or the oil that is being gelated can be applied to the oil to form the gel or dried gel xerogel can be directly applied to the oil the gels are responsive to a number of external stimuli such as ph temperature and light due to the non covalent interactions which when applied reverse the gelation in their review okesola smith compiled the ideal properties of organogelators for oil spill treatment feasible and scalable synthesis rapid gelation without solvents or temperature change recoverable oil reusable gelator environmentally friendly gelator derived from bio resources stable gels at natural temperatures high mechanical strength of the gel okseloa and smith 2016 recently many gelators have been prepared from sugars and sugar derivatives such as galactose mukherjee and mukhopadhyay 2013 mannitol prathap and sureshan 2012 xylitol raju et al 2017 and n acetyl glucosamine narayana et al 2017 through organic synthesis methods usually involving organic solvents and petroleum derived chemicals to introduce suitable functional groups and allow oil gelation the initial gelation is usually quick and happens in few seconds but the strengthening of the gel takes several minutes to over 1 h table 7 the mechanical properties of the gel are important for their removal from the water surface and further handling for the recovery of the oil and gelator the oil can be recovered by distillation and in some cases the gelator can be reused multiple times mukherjee and mukhopadhyay 2013 narayana et al 2017 the reusability of the gelator depends on the temperature stability of the gelator as well as the type of oil some oil types require high temperatures to evaporate which might be challenging if the gelator is temperature sensitive many of the reported gelators require a co solvent such as thf mukherjee and mukhopadhyay 2013 toluene raju et al 2017 or ethanol jadhav et al 2010 in which the gelator is dissolved 10 w v prior to application often the gelator solution needs to be heated for sufficient dissolution of the gelator fig 8 shows the behavior of gelators for oil spill response for example a gelator was synthesized from xylitol and benzaldehyde derivatives using 1 phenylethanone and 1 phenyl 1 propanone instead of benzaldehyde were also synthesized but these derivatives performed worse than benzaldehyde derivative due to the increased hydrophobicity the gelator was dissolved 10 in toluene by gentle heating and the gelator solution was added to crude oil on top of sea water and phase selective gelation was observed within 2 min the gelated crude oil was recovered with 53 efficiency up to a boiling point of 350 c raju et al 2017 the use of a co solvent is obviously a drawback considering a real life application due to the high amount of potentially hazardous co solvent discharged into the environment and the lack of control over the temperature in the environment therefore gelators applied in powder form would be a superior option the lack of co solvent makes the diffusion of the gelator in the oil phase slower resulting in slower and uneven distribution of the gelator and leading to insufficient mechanical properties of the gel vibhute et al synthesized an organogelator from d glucose that could be applied as a fine powder on benzene diesel and crude oil to form a gel in the presence of sea water they studied alkyl 4 6 o benzylidene glycopyranoside which is known as gelate non polar solvents but it is not phase selective presumably due to partial water solubility the gelation properties are attributed to benzylidene group and diol motifs among five different alkyl 4 6 o benzylidene glycopyranoside derivatives the authors found that the derivative with an additional phenyl group showed promising performance which was attributed to increased π π interactions this derivative was studied for oil gelation on sea water the amount of applied gelator was 1 w v and was enough to form a rigid gel in 1 h which could be skimmed off the water surface the oil could be separated by distillation and the gelator could be reused multiple times vibhute et al 2016 the problem with the co solvent was also addressed using a two component deep eutectic solvent des system where the solid gelator and solid co solvent produce a mixture with a significantly lower melting point than the pure components alone cui et al 2017 lauric acid and n methylacetaminde were mixed to prepare a des and it was applied to oil gelation lauric acid forms a gel with the oil phase while the n methylacetamide dissolves in water the components are biodegradable and the preparation of the des only requires mixing of the components the solvent in this case is less toxic than many other co solvents reported in literature also less co solvent is required since the concentration of the gelator in the co solvent is approximately 50 wt 5 outlook and challenges the greatest challenge with the sorbents are their effectiveness with respect to increase in oil and emulsion density changes in emulsion viscosity due to evaporation and emulsification over a period of time traditional sorbents derived from bio based waste materials are generally cost effective and environmentally friendly due to their abundance and biological origin also the possibility to recover the oil and reuse the sorbent is definitely a desirable attribute of the sorbents from environmental and economical points of view the downsides of these materials are low hydrophobicity that results in low oil sorption capacity and buoyancy properties these properties can be enhanced by modification of these materials which may result in decreased biocompatibility of the material simple effective and environmentally friendly modifications to bio based sorbent materials could increase their potential in oil spill treatment hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles can make stable emulsions when the wettability of particles organic as well as inorganic is partial with ca 20 120 the surface area and porosity of microspheres rules over nanosized particles in the sorption of oil however the dispersion rate of nano particles is higher to form stable emulsions pickering emulsions stabilized by particles are more stable against coalescence rather than the surfactant stabilized emulsions highly dispersed oil in a water column with hydrocarbon habituated microbes can enhance the biodegradation of the oil even though the bio surfactants are biodegradable and less toxic than chemical surfactants the scale up production cost is higher one way to minimize the cost is selectivity of the low cost substrate and another is to produce such surfactants from vegetable oils dairy and distillery waste aerogels are ideal sorbent materials due to high surface area and low density resulting in high sorption capacity and good buoyancy properties however aerogels share some of the same disadvantages as traditional sorbents as they are derived from biomaterials that are usually amphiphilic and require some form of additional modification to introduce hydrophobicity otherwise synthesis of aerogels can be very environmental friendly where biomaterial is dispersed in water freeze dried and pyrolyzed without any added reagents to form a hydrophobic aerogel sorbent on the other hand aerogel preparation may be difficult on account of high cost and the scale up of the aerogel production therefore aerogels may not be a feasible alternative for the treatment of large oil spills the development of more convenient preparation methods could make aerogels a more practical option for oil spill treatment a less studied method to prepare aerogels is air drying of foams stabilized by nanoscale biomaterials which is an interesting alternative to freeze drying sugar based gelators are effective at immobilizing the oil at the water surface for mechanical removal and the oil can be recovered and the gelator can be reused however the gelators were derived from sugars and the synthesis usually involves organic solvents and petroleum derived chemicals also most of the gelators reported in literature require a co solvent to dissolve them prior to addition into the oil recently fine powder gelators have been reported which can eliminate the need for co solvent the use of des in dissolving the gelators an interesting alternative to co solvents can reduce the amount of required solvent and utilize more environmentally friendly solvents green synthesis of efficient gelators as powders proves to be effective at controlling oil spills and oil removal oil and water separation from their mixtures through separators is solely a gravity driven process and mainly depends on their density difference together with the porosity and wettability of the separator generally coated or sprayed surface materials show lack of long term stability and reusability of the membrane in comparison to covalently grafted hydrophobic polymer however the spray coating process increases the surface roughness by favoring the amplification of surface wettability the wetting properties of the separators are switchable between hydrophilic and hydrophobic states by surface modification with hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials moreover hydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic material separators are superior to hydrophobic and oleophilic materials due to the reduction in external fouling and water barrier capacity bio based foam membranes are biodegradable but the production and scale up cost is more than that of mesh due to the lyophilization 6 conclusions in general when the booms and skimmers are ineffective in rough seas dispersants composed of surfactants could be the best option for oil spill response however for an arctic oil spill in situ burning is preferable in a cold ecosystem prevention of an oil spill is environmentally and economically preferable to costly land remediation the two major things of any sorbent affecting the sorption of oils are its physical characteristics and hydrophobic properties in terms of oil selectivity from an environmental point of view the removal of the oil from the environment is always the best solution but economical aspects may restrict the methods available for oil spill treatment both sorbents and gelators can be used to immobilize the oil by different mechanisms for easier removal from the water surface the oil can be recovered and the sorbent gelator can be reused although the collection of the immobilized oil is slow and labor intensive resulting in high costs the recovery of the oil and the reusability of the materials increase the environmental friendliness and could decrease the cost of the methods in comparison to other sorbents the scale up cost of magnetic particles along with the recovery of oil could be cheaper the different bio based sorbents discussed in this review paper have threefold benefits in treating oily wastewater a steep reduction in oil content from water reutilization of waste and recovery of oil effective materials from bio based resources can be prepared but this often requires significant and costly modification of the native materials the future challenge and prospective is to produce effective materials with minimal feasible and environmentally friendly modifications while still retaining the desirable properties of the native bio based materials such as biodegradability and non toxicity acknowledgement this work was funded by the academy of finland decision number 283200 and eu structural funds 
19661,being cost effective synthetic materials were initially used abundantly for the removal of oil gradually however awareness of the use of dispersants like corexit which makes water resources more toxic than oil has changed the scenario for the treatment of spilled oil the removal of spilled oil from water resources is still a very topical issue an eco friendly and sustainable approach towards the environment has introduced many low cost non toxic and biodegradable materials along with different biomasses to make micro to nano sized materials membranes sponges aerogel etc for the removal and recovery of oil from water resources additionally the reusability of these materials after the recovery of oils has added one more step towards sustainability this review comprises the work conducted by various researchers in the field of the removal and recovery of spilled oils using various biomasses and polymers either in the form of sorbents or separators graphical abstract image keywords oil spill sorbent particle surfactant aerogel gelator separator 1 introduction currently the challenge is to clean water resources which are being polluted by oil either in the form of routine shipping run offs from industry dumping or oil spills noaa 2017a an oil spill is the accidental or intentional discharge of petroleum hydrocarbons into the environment especially the marine ecosystem an oil spill on water can be transported by wind and current and the distributed oil either evaporates or forms a surface slick disperses in water or submerges and accumulates in the sediments reddy et al 2002 liu et al 2012 additionally temperature salinity and waves also increase oil transportation and weathering rates moreover oil spill from tankers such as exxon valdex in 1987 11 million gallons carson et al 2003 and deep horizon in 2010 4 9 million barrels brody et al 2010 were marked as the greatest disasters for the marine environment since most oils float on the water surface seabirds and marine animals are mainly affected barron 2012 and other creatures and terrestrial animals are harmed if the oil comes ashore brody et al 2010 such spilled oils also affect humans through inhalation skin and eye irritation many researchers have reviewed the aspects and impacts of these spills on the ecosystem over time jernelöv 2010 henkel et al 2012 chang et al 2014 and developed various methods and chemicals for oil spill response michel et al 1992 itopf 2014a however the spill intensity and location determine the clean up technology that needs to be applied oil spill treatment methods can be classified as physical mechanical chemical or biological epa 2017 physical mechanical methods include booms that are stationary floating devices to prevent the movement of the oil slick using high temperature booms enables the burning of the oil in situ evans et al 2001 fingas 2011 iogp 2016 skimmers are stationary or mobile devices that were used to remove floating and or emulsified oil from the water surface michel et al 1992 hydrophobic meshes that repel water but allow oil to pass through can be utilized in skimmers for enhanced oil recovery chemical methods include dispersants ipieca 2001 itopf 2014b graham et al 2016 sprayed on the oil spill to break it up into small droplets noaa 2017b in addition sorbent materials may be used in small scale oil spills biological methods include the addition of microbes and or nutrients and or oxygen to stimulate bacterial growth and the resultant biodegradation of the spilled oil azubuike et al 2016 however physiochemical methods have limitations in terms of crude oil clean up so recently biological methods have held sway das and preethy 2011 dave and ghaly 2011 however the selection of sorbent materials is dependent on the nature of the spilled oil teas et al 2001 the rate at which oil can be treated in open waters depends on the treatment method dispersants applied from aircrafts are the fastest followed by skimming and in situ burning graham et al 2016 in addition environmental conditions affect the performance of the treatment methods such as wind currents waves oil viscosity and sensitivity to debris the costs of different oil spill treatment methods from the least to most expensive are as follows in situ burning dispersants mechanical recovery and manual cleanup despite cost efficiency in situ burning generates many particulates and carbon dioxide in the environment mullin and champ 2003 choosing the oil spill treatment method becomes an optimization task by minimizing both the environmental impact and cost of operation local jurisdiction also affects costs due to possible fines based on the amount of spilled oil which limits the oil spill however some treatment methods leave the oil in the environment so it may still cause damage to the ecosystem it was therefore suggested to impose fines based only on the amount of oil left in the environment in other words recovering the spilled oil would decrease the amount of the fine this kind of jurisdiction could make recovery methods more economically viable depending on the scale of the fine and the oil spill scenario prendergast and gschwend 2014 most of the materials reviewed in this paper aim to either recover spilled oil or enhance the biodegradation of the oil the best solution in the case of an oil spill depends on numerous factors and the optimal solution from environmental and economic points of view might be a combination of several different methods therefore instead of classifying oil spill treatment methods based on technical aspects solution based classification of oil recovery or oil biodegradation is proposed in the case of an oil spill either the oil must be left in the environment for biodegradation or it can be recovered from the environment and to achieve this there are different technical methods and materials scheme 1 shows this classification existing dispersants chemical herders are chemically stable but non biodegradable so remain longer in the marine environment there is therefore a growing demand for green facile and eco friendly low cost sorbents from biopolymers for the treatment of oil spills and chemical leaks in past few years advanced materials such as aerogels foam membranes inorganic meshes and surface modified fabrics have been used extensively for the separation of oil water mixtures meanwhile the increasing population rate has increased the rate of food consumption resulting in massive amounts of bio waste globally for this reason the wise way is to use such easily biodegradable bio waste or biomass to produce low cost sorbents with higher oil sorption capacity that are simple to scale up for the cleanup of an oil spill rather than hazardous chemicals this review addresses the potential and environmentally friendly bio based materials in the form of sorbents particles gelators surfactants and separators for oil spill treatment these kinds of bio based materials have recently been the subject of increasing interest in oil spill treatment applications and reviews have been published on specific materials or methods sabir 2015 ifelebuegu and johnson 2017 the different materials and methods for oil spill treatment are suitable for different kind of conditions for sustainable and effective oil spill treatment bio based materials must be studied extensively since one material is unlikely to be suitable in all possible oil spill scenarios additionally local legislation has also affected the economic view of the materials and method design must be considered legislation is subject to changes due to increased environmental awareness which has a direct impact on oil spill treatment methods so the utilization of bio based materials in different kind of oil spill treatment methods and materials must be extensively studied and researched in response to different kinds of oil spill scenarios and possible future legislation this review highlights a wide range of different bio based oil spill treatment materials and methods along with their strengths and weaknesses 2 statistical trend of sorbents used in oil spill response the statistical trends based on the scopus database of various sorbents studied extensively in the past ten years are given below fig 1 this implies that more research is being conducted using these materials as oil sorbents statistical data shows a continual increment in the use of nanoparticles and aerogel for oil spill treatment in the past few years 3 materials for oil removal dispersion and biodegradation 3 1 biomass sorbents in adsorption sorbate molecules accumulate on the surface of the sorbent in the case of oil adsorption the oil molecules need to diffuse onto the sorbent surface the oil molecules then entrapped in the sorbent due to capillary effects and finally the oil droplets agglomerate in the pores of the sorbent oil consists mainly of non polar hydrocarbons and their adsorption is attributed to physical non covalent interactions such as van der waals forces wahi et al 2013 however for fibrous sorbent only adsorption and capillary action processes take place in this paper the term oil sorption is used instead of oil adsorption absorption separation or removal since all these terms are used in literature when discussing oil sorption on various materials the differences have not usually been discussed in literature and one of the terms is used without further rationalization therefore to avoid confusion in this paper oil sorption refers to oil removal using sorbents surface chemistry and morphology determine the wettability of the surface which closely relates to the adsorption of oils water contact angle is used to measure wettability if the contact angle of a water droplet on a flat surface is less than 90 it is characterized as hydrophilic if the contact angle is between 90 and 150 it is characterized as hydrophobic and if the contact angle is over 150 it is characterized as superhydrophobic fig 2 similar measurements can be done for different kinds of oils and the solid material can be characterized as oleophilic oleophobic or superoleophobic respectively the hydrophobicity of the sorbent prevents water sorption and therefore enhances the oil sorption capacity due to the lack of competition between water and oil molecules natural materials such as lotus leaves are superhydrophobic but superhydrophobicity can be also introduced into an otherwise non superhydrophobic material by increasing the roughness of the surface and decreasing the surface energy an ideal sorbent for oil sorption has high porosity and surface area and is selective to oil for oil spill treatment applications the sorbent should also be mechanically and chemically stable recyclable environmentally friendly and have low density and good buoyancy properties gupta and tai 2016 natural products such as cotton kapok rice straw etc are abundant low cost biodegradable and non toxic materials and therefore ideal for oil sorption in oil spill treatment refer table 1 the downsides of such materials are poor hydrophobicity buoyancy and sorption capacity maleki 2016 there were a variety of different kind of modifications to natural sorbent materials reported in literature which enhanced the properties of the materials such as hydrophobicity and sorption capacity ideally the modification should be minimal and should keep the good properties of the native material while enhancing weaker properties i e enhancing oil sorption and buoyancy while not altering the biocompatibility of the materials moreover the sorption capacity of the oleophilic sorbents prepared via bulk polymerization mainly depends on the size and molecular weight of the polymer used increasing size from monomer to macromonomer increases the cross linked structure but in turn decreases the swelling capacity by blocking the penetration of organic solvents into polymer network on the other hand the increasing molecular weight of the dendric structure macromonomer also increase the hydrophobicity of the sorbent kizil and sonmez 2017 cheaper and readily biodegradable plant biomass such as kapok fiber cattail fiber salvinia sp wood chip rice husk coconut husk and bagasse are used as inserts to remove oil from the storm water runoff of gas station effluent with 70 greater oil removal capacity compared to synthetic polymer fiber sorbent due to the presence of ample void spaces in their loose fiber structure and hydrophobicity khan et al 2004 the bio waste of rice rice husk contains a large amount of silica the pyrolysis of rice husk causes the decomposition of organic material and the breaking of bonds between the silicon and organic material present in it this enhances the hydrophobicity of rice husk which leads to the purification of crude oil vlaev et al 2011 the adsorption of the oils shows a direct dependency on granulometric composition i e weight ratio of c sio2 along with the bulk density surface morphology and oleophilicity of the sorbent however an inverse dependency of sorbent bulk density on the height of penetration of the oil in it exists angelova et al 2011 moreover alkaline treatment of rice husk produces lignocellulosic sorbent material by removing its silica which enhances the adsorption capacity of the diesel such adsorbed oil along with the sorbent can be used as a solid fuel bazargan et al 2014 another low cost sorbent obtained from silkworm cocoon waste removes 30 more motor oil and vegetable oil from marine water than natural wool fibers moriwaki et al 2009 various fruit peels such as banana and orange being rich in cellulosic content can remove heavy oil more effectively than lighter oils abdullah et al 2016 alaa el din et al article in press similarly tontiwachwuthikul et al show the effectiveness of potato peel in the remediation of water from a waste lubricating oil spill tontiwachwuthikul et al 2016 cellulosic materials being fluffy and possessing low bulk density show higher uptake of marine fuel with less treatment macroporous agricultural waste called luffa with low bulk density removed more than 50 of crude oil from water with good reusability abdelwahab 2014 3 2 particles particle behavior in the presence of oil and water mainly depends on its functional characteristics together with size and porosity which either undergoes emulsion and or adsorption in an emulsion system small volume fraction is classified as dispersed phase oil and larger as continuous phase aqueous water strongly hydrophilic particles get wetted only by water and remain dispersed in the aqueous phase of the emulsion whereas strongly hydrophobic particles remain in the oil due to being wetted only by the oil phase the particle needs to be amphiphilic in order to adsorb at the interface oil in water o w emulsion is favorable when the three phased contact angle ca between the oil solid and water is 90 whereas water in oil w o emulsion when ca is 90 aveyard et al 2003 moreover adsorption free energy is at maximum when the ca is 90 i e the particle is equally wetted by both the aqueous and oil phases in this case other factors such as the wettability of the particles inter particle interactions etc must be considered knowing the type of emulsion emulsions are therefore stable if particle adsorption and droplet stabilization by those particles resist destabilization phenomena such as coagulation and coalescence chevalier and bolzinger 2013 however lam et al in their work emphasized that stable emulsion has also been observed with contact angles 20 120 lam et al 2014 however the oil water emulsion system separates if the interfacial tension ift between these two phases increases moreover interfacial area had direct influence on resulting droplet size depending on particle dosage i e a lower number of particles creates a small interfacial area and larger droplets whereas a higher number of particles forms fine emulsion with smaller droplets fig 3 shows the pictorial form of particles used in the destabilization of oils generally raw natural sorbents have excellent adsorption capacity biodegradability and non toxicity in comparison with synthetic sorbents but their low hydrophobicity increases water uptake and lowers oil sorption capacity many researchers are therefore working on the enhancement of oil sorption affinity through various modifications or the addition of hydrophobic moieties to these natural sorbents as the functional group properties play a significant role in the adsorption of oils refer table 2 the addition of a hydrophobic chain on the biopolymer enhances the tensile properties and thermal stability of the polymers amri et al 2011 and forms more stable emulsion due to its amphiphilicity doshi et al 2018 however by increasing the hydrophobicity the particles get wetter in oil than in water and form w o instead of o w emulsion andresen and stenius 2007 on the contrary the formation of stable emulsions is feasible by switching the ph rather than hydrophobic modification liu et al 2012 pickering emulsions are emulsions stabilized by solid particles with similar properties to classical emulsions stabilized by surfactant which can be either o w w o or multiple emulsions chevalier and bolzinger 2013 cellulose nanocrystals cnc obtained using a deep eutectic solvent des of choline chloride with oxalic acid dihydrate form emulsified creaming with marine diesel through pickering emulsions which in the case of oil spill can be easily skimmed laitinen et al 2017a such particles forming pickering emulsions are irreversibly adsorbed at the oil water interface and require high energy for desorption compared to conventional surfactants so particles that carry thermo responsive polymers copolymers are used as stabilizers for o w pickering emulsion and the emulsions are destabilized by simple heating zoppe et al 2012 cellulose consists of long chains of poly β 1 4 d glucosyl residues and these chains unite to form long thread like fibers known as microfibrils due to the hydrophilic nature of fibrillated and micro fibrillated cellulose mfc wettability in water is more than that in oil to form o w emulsion bifunctionalized cellulose rod like nanocrystals 120 nm in length obtained by oxidation of cellulose with sodium periodate and chlorite followed by amination with n butylamine were effectively used to stabilized oil in water o w emulsion of up to 3 5 sea water salinity ojala et al 2016 hydrophilic carboxymethyl chitosan cmc obtained from crab shells destabilized marine diesel diesel and marine 2t oil into small droplets of 100 μm at sea water alkalinity and salinity doshi et al 2017 in a similar way our previous work kalliola et al 2016 reflects the applicability of ca 2 cross linked cmc nanoparticles to stabilize dodecane in o w emulsions however chitosan flakes have superior adsorption properties to chitosan powder for oil barros et al 2014 chitosan microspheres produced by ionic gelation of chitosan with sodium tripolyphosphate stp separated 90 of the oil from oil industry effluents using packed columns grem et al 2013 on the other hand polymeric microspheres derived from eugenol suspension polymerization and self crosslinking showed higher adsorption of chloroform and toluene than gasoline diesel and kerosene as these lighter oils consists of longer molecular chains which adsorb on the surfaces of microspheres and block further adsorption of small molecules deng et al 2015 aerogel microspheres obtained from polyvinyl alcohol pva and cellulose nanofibril cnf exhibit outstanding oil solvent absorption capacities for floating oil cleanup zhai et al 2016 recently nano particles and polymer based blends have appeared with better surface functionality and biodegradability in comparison to other sorbents used for oil removal along with simple recovery and reusability fouad et al 2016 similarly another technique to produce continuous fibers ranging from nanometers to micrometers in diameter is electrospinning wang et al recently reviewed nanofibrous materials obtained by electrospinning for oil water separation wang et al 2016 nanofibers obtained from polyvinyl chloride pvc and polystyrene through blending electrospinning process showed 5 9 times higher sorption capacity than commercial polypropylene for motor oil peanut oil and diesel respectively because of high porosity zhu et al 2011 for oil sorption an appropriate size void is mandatory and can be determined by the viscosity and gravity of the oil fiber roughness and diameter together with the interfacial force between oil and water nowadays the removal of oil by magnetism is attracting attention as oil or emulsified oil can be easily separated from water by an external magnetic field in short the adsorbed oil and particles are easily removed by the external magnetic field once the magnetic particles are completely wetted by the oil magnetic hybrid nanoparticles in the absence and presence of chitosan fe3o4 sio2 sichitosan were applied on the water surface containing non polar solvents and chitosan grafted nanoparticles were more effective due to the high surface to volume ratio and reduced particle dimensions soares et al 2017 quaternized chitosan qc coated with magnetic nanoparticles mnp was also reported zhang et al 2017 with excellent oil water separation at different phs without showing significant difference in separation up to 8 cycles compared to that of mnp coated with silica and 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes this observed behavior was due to the positive surface charge of qc coated mnp at various ph levels enabling adsorption onto the negatively charged oil droplets via electrostatic attraction gomes de souza et al demonstrated the high chemical affinity of magnetic material with a polymer matrix for the removal of oil from the water surface gomes de souza et al 2010 polymer coated nanoparticles showed effective separation of oil from oil water mixture mirshahghassemi and lead 2015 but the presence of natural organic macromolecules reduced the nanoparticles oil interactions governed by the hydrophobic effect of the polymer coating which led to a decrease in oil removal mirshahghassemi et al 2016 moreover scale up of these magnetic particles is easy and cheap with high sorption capacity mirshahghassemi et al 2017 generally if the particle is small enough 5 nm 52 μm lam et al 2014 and can be wetted by both aqueous and oil phase it can adsorb at the oil water interface and stabilize emulsions also called pickering emulsions for particulate adsorbents neither of these criteria is usually fulfilled since oil adsorbents are normally prepared as hydrophobic and cannot be wetted by the aqueous phase moreover the particle size is usually larger since separation of the adsorbent from the aqueous phase is not convenient for particles of near nano size unless the particles have suitable magnetic properties and can be separated using magnets additionally adsorbent particles usually exhibit surface roughness and porosity to increase the surface area of the adsorbent surface roughness is found to decrease the stability of pickering emulsions lam et al 2014 dickinson 2017 so is not a desirable property the particles used in oil spill response can act either as a surfactant dispersing agent emulsifying agent herding agent or coating materials 3 3 surfactants surfactants surface active molecules are amphiphilic compounds which reduce oil water interfacial tension by orienting the interaction of hydrophilic groups with the water phase and the hydrophobic groups with oil and depressing coalescence by forming stable micro emulsions such microemulsions occur spontaneously and mainly depend on surfactant type and structure for example if the surfactant is ionic along with a single hydrocarbon chain microemulsion formation takes place in the presence of co surfactant and or electrolyte whereas for non ionic and double chain ionics surfactants co surfactant is not required eastoe 2003 winsor proposed four types of microemulsions winsor 1947 as mentioned in fig 4 watcharasing et al demonstrated the removal of motor oil from winsor type iii microemulsions using the froth floatation process a surfactant based separation process watcharasing et al 2009 surfactants are mainly present in the dispersants that break the oil slick into smaller droplets and can move easily into the water column dispersion effectiveness is the percentage of an oil slick treated with a given dispersant under a stated set of mixing conditions dispersants corexit 9527 and corexit 9500a comprising anionic surfactant dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate doss were widely used for the deepwater horizon oil spill response belore et al 2009 herding agents are surface active molecules which when added along the periphery of an oil spill slick contract and thicken the slicks or push them together for easy burning or collection marex 2016 however existing chemical dispersants herders are chemically stable but are non biodegradable and stay longer in the marine environment gray et al 2014 place et al 2016 so current research focuses more on developing eco friendly biodegradable green dispersing herding agents for the cleanup of oil spills from water as summarized in table 3 muhammad et al showed the eggshell modified by surfactant for the effective removal of crude oil from water muhammad et al 2015 bio based surfactants obtained from biological sources are favored due to their biodegradability and lesser environmental risks hydroxylated soya bean lecithin reduces the rigidity of the fatty acid chains with dense surfactant packing at the oil water interface which shows that hydrophilicity improves the interfacial coverage by resisting the coalescence of the droplets nyankson et al 2016 blends obtained from the food grade amphiphilies such as lecithin and tween 80 60 40 in the presence of ethanol as a solvent turn out to be an effective emulsifier for oil spills athas et al 2014 similarly replacing some ethanol with co solvents such as octane or octanol enhances dispersion effectiveness suggesting that hydrophobic solvents strengthen dispersant oil miscibility riehm et al 2015 moreover oil into water emulsification reveals rapid leaching of surfactants from oil into water which lowers dispersant effectiveness such as tween 80 rich dispersants whereas water into oil emulsification indicates stabilization of surfactants in the oil by increasing the dispersant effectiveness such as lecithin rich dispersants hence tween 80 rich dispersants exhibit lower dispersion effectiveness than lecithin rich dispersants riehm et al 2017 in a future perspective such mixtures can be used in corexit compounds rather than doss recently wang et al showed that the presence of xantham gum additive in chemical dispersant 9500a through a synergistic mechanism enhances dispersion effectiveness droplet stability and the biodegradation of crude oil wang et al 2017 plant based herding agents phytol tend to hydrolyze quickly after herding compared to commercial silicone based herders gupta et al 2015 even though silicone based herders are effective in spilled oil thickening but they exist in the marine environment due to slow biodegradability edwards et al showed the reduced toxicity of bio surfactants over synthetic surfactants used in oil spill treatment edwards et al 2003 bio surfactants the surface active amphiphilies produced from the micro organisms require a culture medium with a hydrophobic and hydrophilic carbon source and have enhance bioavailability of inaccessible substrates with survival under low moisture conditions in such bio surfactants the hydrophobic moiety can be either protein peptide or fatty acids with 10 18 carbon atoms chain whereas hydrophilic moiety comprises hydroxyl carboxylate ester or phosphate groups silva et al reviewed the potentiality of bio surfactants in the oil industry and the bioremediation of oil spills silva et al 2014 however biosurfactant production from agro industrial wastes must be studied more due to its lower production costs for oil spill remediation emulsifying agents which disperse oil slicks into smaller droplets and boost oil biodegradation by microbes are widely used another way towards sustainability is microbes which degrade oil and ingest oil droplets as a part of their natural diet this reveals that such microbes produce their own surfactants known as biological compounds which consist of sugars amino acids and lipids these compounds are classified into two groups biosurfactants which have low molecular weight compounds rhamnolipids and surfactin produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus subtilis and bioemulsifiers comprising high molecular weight compounds emulsan and alasan produced by acinetobacter radioresistens and acinetobacter venetianus recombination activating gene hence the alternative green way to clean marine oil spill is bioremediation through such biological compounds refer fig 5 r mohanram et al found that some biosurfactant and bioemulsifiers produce bacteria from the oil polluted water of the mumbai harbor mohanram et al 2016 some examples include iturins esperine mycosubtilin and surfactin which are cyclic lipopeptides produced by the bacillus species rongsayamanonta et al synthesized a solvent free dispersant for crude oil spills using lipopeptides from bacillus sp gy19 based on hydrophilic lipophilic deviation concept rongsayamanonta et al 2017 4 materials for oil recovery 4 1 conventional sorbents the use of sorbents in oil spill treatment allows the recovery of the oil and reuse of sorbent material which is considered environmentally friendly and economical al majed et al 2012 there are different kinds of oil recovery methods reported in literature see table 4 such as vacuum filtration wang et al 2013 distillation yang et al 2014 and extraction feng et al 2017 mechanical and chemical stability are important for the reuse of the materials mechanical pressure during the mechanical recovery of oil may cause deformations in the pore structure of the material and result in decreased oil sorption capacity in addition the material should be stable against elevated temperature and solvents during oil recovery by distillation and or extraction superhydrophobic dissocyanate modified lignin xerogel was prepared by the formation of organogel in thf followed by ambient pressure drying with 75 1 porosity and a borderline water contact angle of 146 4 the sorption capacity of various oils was 2 5 g g when absorbing gasoline the material was recyclable by distillation at 70 c for five cycles with no decrease in performance yang et al 2014 wang et al studied hydrophobically modified kapok fibers with polymerized butylmetacrylate pbma and silica nanoparticles as an oil sorbent the pbma and silica nanoparticle coating on the fiber enhanced the oil sorption due to increased nano and micro scale roughness on the surface and the low surface energy of pbma the prepared material had high and selective oil sorption from a mixture of various oils approximately 65 90 g g and could be reused at least six times by vacuum filtration after six cycles the sorption capacity reduced by approximately 6 10 wang et al 2013 in another study wang et al prepared superhydrophobic and oleophilic kapok fibers by coating them with silica nanoparticles and silanization the materials showed high sorption of various oils 40 85 g g was reusable for at least eight cycles and oil was recovered by vacuum filtration the sorption capacity decreased slightly depending on the oil type wang et al 2012 cotton with superhydrophobic and superoleophilic properties was prepared by the attachment of silica nanoparticles on the surface of cotton and subsequent octadecyltrichlorosilane modification to introduce hydrophobicity into the material with a water contact angle of 156 the materials showed high and selective oil sorption 26 50 g g of various oils with ten times the reusability and almost constant sorption capacity calcagnile et al 2017 4 2 separators conventional techniques such as gravitational separation skimming and flotation are more feasible for oil water mixtures but steeped down for oil water emulsions due to micro and nanosized droplets to overcome such limitation superhydrophobic and superoleophilic separators like mesh and or membranes have been developed refer table 5 with a smaller pore size than emulsions fig 6 shows the selective separation of oil and water depending on the wettability of the mesh and the density of the oil mesh membranes with selective surface wettability can attract either of the phases from the oil water mixture through effective gravity filtration yu et al 2016 moreover the surface chemical composition also determines the intermolecular forces at their interfaces which is enhanced through surface roughness a mixture of waste potato residue and polyurethane coated stainless steel mesh shows dual characteristics i e superhydrophilic and superoleophilic and separates oil and water mixtures through prewetting depending on their respective densities li et al 2016 however fibrous tunicate cellulose nanocrystal tcnc based superhydrophilic and underwater oleophilic membrane separate surfactant stabilized oil in water emulsions depending on their porosity cheng et al 2017 chitosan based film is stable in alkaline medium but the protonation of the amino groups makes them sensitive in acidic conditions and to overcome this amino groups were blocked through cross linking agent however the completely cross linked film tends to be brittle so the mixing of chitosan with polyvinyl alcohol pva prior to cross linking makes the film tougher cs pva coated mesh through glutaraldehyde crosslinking also improves the stability of separation under acidic conditions zhang et al 2013 the superhydrophilicity of the chitosan composite coated metallic mesh shows the effective separation of various oils from oil water mixture by blocking the oil on the surface of the mesh with high stability in harsh environments liu et al 2016 similarly hierarchical rough structures can be obtained by introducing sio2 nanoparticles to chitosan cts and sodium perfluororooctanoate pfo nanocomposite prior to coating which leads the reorganization of fluorinated moieties to make a hydrophilic subsurface for the water to penetrate through it yang et al 2014 however hydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic materials mesh proved superior to hydrophobic and oleophilic materials due to a reduction in external fouling and water barrier capacity antifouling cellulose membrane obtained through reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer technique raft possesses a fibrillary structure which captures the oil easily without any structural disruption during filtration and myrcene blocks the foul odor of thiol molecules from water kollarigowda et al 2017 one of the eco friendly ways to separate oil from water is to generate bio based membrane through replacement of the metallic mesh substrate a bio based foam membrane obtained by blending agarose and gelatin along with genipin cross linker results in a lamellar structure where superhydrophilic agarose micropore is surrounded by gelation walls through hydrogen bonding this allows the aggregated water to pass through the pores by breaking the water molecular film from the oily wastewater and leaving behind oil and the oil fouled membrane is completely biodegraded in soil over a period of one month chaudhary et al 2014 the porosity of such aerogel membrane is enhanced by replacing gelatin with chitosan where thin layered agarose is surrounded by chitosan walls with inter walled cross linked genipin which enhances the recovery of high quality water from oil spills chaudhary et al 2016 similarly transforming surface to hydrophobic enhances the selectivity of oil over water in order to achieve a superhydrophobic and superoleophilic surface the polyimide cellulose acetate fibrous membrane was coated with fluorinated polybenzoxazine along with silica nanoparticles showing water repellence by the air pockets of the membrane ma et al 2017 a porous unmanned ship pus with a low water adhesion force on the mesh surface infiltrates the oil through the porous mesh without any artificial operation which can protect humans from toxic oil spills however water wettability can change the superhydrophobic behavior of pus to hydrophobic the recycling of the pus after the removal of oil is simple with easy scale up wang et al 2015 4 3 aerogels aerogel is a gel in which the continuous liquid phase has been replaced by air resulting in a solid porous material the typical characteristics of an aerogel are high porosity 99 high surface area 100 m2 g and low density 10 mg ml these characteristics are ideal for oil sorption applications allowing for rapid sorption and flotation on water aerogels for oil sorption have been the subject of intensive research in recent years aerogels can be prepared using inorganic materials synthetic organic materials and natural biomaterials al majed et al 2012 such as silica wang et al 2012 graphene hu et al 2014 kabiri et al 2014 li et al 2014 and nanocellulose laitinen et al 2017b respectively however in this review we shall concentrate on aerogels derived from bio based sources a good number of the reported aerogels are prepared from nanocellulose which liu et al have recently reviewed liu et al 2017 the reported oil absorbency values in literature are based on large variety of different oils so the absorbency in table 6 is reported on a scale between the minimum and maximum values it has however been noted by multiple authors that the density of the oil affects the mass absorbency value giving higher values for higher density oils the use of volume based absorbency has been proposed but not yet been widely applied the main benefit of aerogels sorbents for oil spill treatment is the recovery of the oil and the recyclability of the sorbent material several different kinds of recovery methods have been reported such as extraction meng et al 2015 distillation cheng et al 2017 and mechanical squeezing jin et al 2015 combustion has also been reported as a way to recover the absorbent but not the oil bi et al 2013 squeezing might be the most environmentally friendly way to recover the oil followed by distillation and extraction extraction might be the least environmentally friendly of the three techniques due to the addition of organic solvents to produce a mixture of oil and the solvent that is then removed the mixture usually needs to be distilled to separate the oil and solvent so that the solvent may be recycled the sorbent also needs to be dried fig 7 shows the functioning of aerogel for the removal and recovery of oil from the spilled area the preparation of an aerogel usually involves freeze drying a gel containing the bio based material dispersed in water cheng et al 2017 tripathi et al 2017 many natural raw materials such as cellulose are amphiphilic so the prepared sorbents absorb both water and oil unless the sorbent is modified to be hydrophobic hydrophobicity was achieved by introducing hydrophobic moieties on the surface of the sorbent according to literature this has been achieved by chemical modifications jiang and hsieh 2014 laitinen et al 2017b or pyrolysis bi et al 2013 han et al 2016 in non pyrolyzed aerogels mechanical and distillation methods to recover the oil tend to decrease absorbency during multiple recycles of the material this is attributed to mechanical degradation of the materials due to mechanical stress caused by squeezing and capillary forces from the evaporating liquid at an increased temperature cheng et al 2017 freeze drying combined with pyrolysis is an environmentally friendly way to prepare hydrophobic aerogels due to the lack of added chemicals or reagents in addition pyrolysis usually increases the mechanical chemical and temperature durability of the materials compared to non pyrolyzed aerogels indicated by the more consistent performance in multiple use of the material table 6 and induces hydrophobicity due to the formation of saturated carbon moieties the downside of pyrolysis is the high temperature up to at least 1450 c reported in literature wu et al 2014 so high energy is required for the process freeze drying is also an energy intensive process due to low temperatures and high vacuum moreover the sublimation of water is slow and the scale up of the freeze drying process to industrial scale is not a trivial task cervin et al produced aerogels by air and oven drying foams were stabilized by surface modified nanofibrillated cellulose the aerogel produced had high porosity 98 and low density 30 mg ml and mechanical properties comparable to aerogels prepared by freeze drying cervin et al 2013 this kind of strategy to produce aerogels for oil spill treatment could be an interesting alternative to freeze drying nonetheless the production of a sufficient amount of aerogel sorbents may prove to be difficult for use in the treatment of large oil spills in general aerogels have higher production costs maleki 2016 than other sorbents in addition the aerogels are usually brittle maleki 2016 which is a drawback since the mechanical properties are important for the reuse of the materials and oil recovery lack of mechanical strength may degrade the materials and decrease sorption capacity ma et al prepared chitosan silica composite aerogel whose mechanical strength was enhanced through an increasing concentration of chitosan ma et al 2015 wu et al prepared a carbon nanofiber aerogel and applied it to oil recovery from oil water mixture carbonaceous nanofibers synthesized through the hydrothermal carbonization method from glucose followed by freeze drying and pyrolysis at 1450 c possessed low density 10 mg ml high porosity 99 good mechanical strength and large specific surface area 547 m2 g this material was also hydrophobic water contact angle 135 8 and superoleophilic oil contact angle 0 resulting in high selectivity to oils and it showed high absorbency 50 140 g g of variety of oils the material was also recyclable with stable performance over ten cycles as demonstrated by the recovery of n hexane by distillation at 69 c wu et al 2014 yuan et al prepared carbon aerogel from bamboo pulp fibers using the freeze drying and pyrolysis up to 800 c method this material showed low density 5 65 mg ml hydrophobicity water contact angle 135 9 large specific surface area 379 39 m2 g high sorption capacity 50 150 g g of a variety of oils and was reusable over five cycles with constant performance two different recovery methods were employed evaporation at an elevated temperature and extraction with cyclohexane followed by evaporation at an elevated temperature to remove residual organics yuan et al 2017 bi et al pyrolyzed 800 c raw cotton to prepare a carbon aerogel the prepared material had low density 12 mg ml hydrophobicity due to pyrolysis and loss of functional groups and high sorption capacity 50 190 g g for a variety of oils oil could be recycled by distillation combustion or the squeezing for five cycles distillation and combustion did not decrease the absorbance of the material in the subsequent cycles but squeezing reduced the absorbance after the first cycle after which the absorbance remained constant bi et al 2013 cellulose diacetate cross linked with 1 2 4 5 benzenetetracarboxylic acid pmda in acetone to form a gel followed by solvent exchange to water and freeze drying the resulted aerogels were subjected to chemical vapor deposition cvd with trichloro octylsilane tcos to introduce hydrophobicity and oleophilicity the prepared material showed low density 4 3 mg ml and highly porosity 99 7 the highest kerosene oil uptake was 111 8 g g aerogel the aerogel could be recycled and the oil recovered ten times by mechanical compression with a 40 reduction in the original value tripathi et al 2017 cellulose nanofibril aerogel was prepared from recycled waste fibers using deep eutectic solvents choline chloride urea for pre treatment and freeze drying silylation was used to introduce hydrophobicity into the materials the materials have low density 2 9 mg ml high porosity 99 81 and hydrophobicity and high sorption capacity for a variety of oils 70 200 g g oil was recovered by mechanical squeezing and the absorbency decreased linearly to approximately 70 80 of the original value

absorbency of diesel approximately 120 g g sai et al 2015 hydrophobic nanocellulose aerogel with oleophilic coating absorb a variety of organic solvents and oil but tio2 deposition through atomic layer deposition techniques is very expensive korhonen et al 2011 so funchin et al introduced a cost effective technique through magnetic cellulose aerogel coated with tio2 which sorbs oil up to 28 times its own weight and can be easily regenerated by immersing in ethanol funchin et al 2014 4 4 gelators low molecular weight phase selective organogelators have been proposed for oil spill treatment applications the gelator is a supramolecular instead of polymeric and is insoluble in water leaving the water phase unchanged the gel formed via non covalent interactions between the gelator molecules allows them to self assemble reversibly into polymeric solid like networks this fiber like network is capable of immobilizing a large volume of liquid usually 99 in ideal conditions due to capillary forces there are several phase selective gelation processes reported in literature where the gelator can be dissolved into the oil by heating and then cooling to form the gel or the gelator can be dissolved in an oil soluble or water soluble solvent or the oil that is being gelated can be applied to the oil to form the gel or dried gel xerogel can be directly applied to the oil the gels are responsive to a number of external stimuli such as ph temperature and light due to the non covalent interactions which when applied reverse the gelation in their review okesola smith compiled the ideal properties of organogelators for oil spill treatment feasible and scalable synthesis rapid gelation without solvents or temperature change recoverable oil reusable gelator environmentally friendly gelator derived from bio resources stable gels at natural temperatures high mechanical strength of the gel okseloa and smith 2016 recently many gelators have been prepared from sugars and sugar derivatives such as galactose mukherjee and mukhopadhyay 2013 mannitol prathap and sureshan 2012 xylitol raju et al 2017 and n acetyl glucosamine narayana et al 2017 through organic synthesis methods usually involving organic solvents and petroleum derived chemicals to introduce suitable functional groups and allow oil gelation the initial gelation is usually quick and happens in few seconds but the strengthening of the gel takes several minutes to over 1 h table 7 the mechanical properties of the gel are important for their removal from the water surface and further handling for the recovery of the oil and gelator the oil can be recovered by distillation and in some cases the gelator can be reused multiple times mukherjee and mukhopadhyay 2013 narayana et al 2017 the reusability of the gelator depends on the temperature stability of the gelator as well as the type of oil some oil types require high temperatures to evaporate which might be challenging if the gelator is temperature sensitive many of the reported gelators require a co solvent such as thf mukherjee and mukhopadhyay 2013 toluene raju et al 2017 or ethanol jadhav et al 2010 in which the gelator is dissolved 10 w v prior to application often the gelator solution needs to be heated for sufficient dissolution of the gelator fig 8 shows the behavior of gelators for oil spill response for example a gelator was synthesized from xylitol and benzaldehyde derivatives using 1 phenylethanone and 1 phenyl 1 propanone instead of benzaldehyde were also synthesized but these derivatives performed worse than benzaldehyde derivative due to the increased hydrophobicity the gelator was dissolved 10 in toluene by gentle heating and the gelator solution was added to crude oil on top of sea water and phase selective gelation was observed within 2 min the gelated crude oil was recovered with 53 efficiency up to a boiling point of 350 c raju et al 2017 the use of a co solvent is obviously a drawback considering a real life application due to the high amount of potentially hazardous co solvent discharged into the environment and the lack of control over the temperature in the environment therefore gelators applied in powder form would be a superior option the lack of co solvent makes the diffusion of the gelator in the oil phase slower resulting in slower and uneven distribution of the gelator and leading to insufficient mechanical properties of the gel vibhute et al synthesized an organogelator from d glucose that could be applied as a fine powder on benzene diesel and crude oil to form a gel in the presence of sea water they studied alkyl 4 6 o benzylidene glycopyranoside which is known as gelate non polar solvents but it is not phase selective presumably due to partial water solubility the gelation properties are attributed to benzylidene group and diol motifs among five different alkyl 4 6 o benzylidene glycopyranoside derivatives the authors found that the derivative with an additional phenyl group showed promising performance which was attributed to increased π π interactions this derivative was studied for oil gelation on sea water the amount of applied gelator was 1 w v and was enough to form a rigid gel in 1 h which could be skimmed off the water surface the oil could be separated by distillation and the gelator could be reused multiple times vibhute et al 2016 the problem with the co solvent was also addressed using a two component deep eutectic solvent des system where the solid gelator and solid co solvent produce a mixture with a significantly lower melting point than the pure components alone cui et al 2017 lauric acid and n methylacetaminde were mixed to prepare a des and it was applied to oil gelation lauric acid forms a gel with the oil phase while the n methylacetamide dissolves in water the components are biodegradable and the preparation of the des only requires mixing of the components the solvent in this case is less toxic than many other co solvents reported in literature also less co solvent is required since the concentration of the gelator in the co solvent is approximately 50 wt 5 outlook and challenges the greatest challenge with the sorbents are their effectiveness with respect to increase in oil and emulsion density changes in emulsion viscosity due to evaporation and emulsification over a period of time traditional sorbents derived from bio based waste materials are generally cost effective and environmentally friendly due to their abundance and biological origin also the possibility to recover the oil and reuse the sorbent is definitely a desirable attribute of the sorbents from environmental and economical points of view the downsides of these materials are low hydrophobicity that results in low oil sorption capacity and buoyancy properties these properties can be enhanced by modification of these materials which may result in decreased biocompatibility of the material simple effective and environmentally friendly modifications to bio based sorbent materials could increase their potential in oil spill treatment hydrophilic and hydrophobic particles can make stable emulsions when the wettability of particles organic as well as inorganic is partial with ca 20 120 the surface area and porosity of microspheres rules over nanosized particles in the sorption of oil however the dispersion rate of nano particles is higher to form stable emulsions pickering emulsions stabilized by particles are more stable against coalescence rather than the surfactant stabilized emulsions highly dispersed oil in a water column with hydrocarbon habituated microbes can enhance the biodegradation of the oil even though the bio surfactants are biodegradable and less toxic than chemical surfactants the scale up production cost is higher one way to minimize the cost is selectivity of the low cost substrate and another is to produce such surfactants from vegetable oils dairy and distillery waste aerogels are ideal sorbent materials due to high surface area and low density resulting in high sorption capacity and good buoyancy properties however aerogels share some of the same disadvantages as traditional sorbents as they are derived from biomaterials that are usually amphiphilic and require some form of additional modification to introduce hydrophobicity otherwise synthesis of aerogels can be very environmental friendly where biomaterial is dispersed in water freeze dried and pyrolyzed without any added reagents to form a hydrophobic aerogel sorbent on the other hand aerogel preparation may be difficult on account of high cost and the scale up of the aerogel production therefore aerogels may not be a feasible alternative for the treatment of large oil spills the development of more convenient preparation methods could make aerogels a more practical option for oil spill treatment a less studied method to prepare aerogels is air drying of foams stabilized by nanoscale biomaterials which is an interesting alternative to freeze drying sugar based gelators are effective at immobilizing the oil at the water surface for mechanical removal and the oil can be recovered and the gelator can be reused however the gelators were derived from sugars and the synthesis usually involves organic solvents and petroleum derived chemicals also most of the gelators reported in literature require a co solvent to dissolve them prior to addition into the oil recently fine powder gelators have been reported which can eliminate the need for co solvent the use of des in dissolving the gelators an interesting alternative to co solvents can reduce the amount of required solvent and utilize more environmentally friendly solvents green synthesis of efficient gelators as powders proves to be effective at controlling oil spills and oil removal oil and water separation from their mixtures through separators is solely a gravity driven process and mainly depends on their density difference together with the porosity and wettability of the separator generally coated or sprayed surface materials show lack of long term stability and reusability of the membrane in comparison to covalently grafted hydrophobic polymer however the spray coating process increases the surface roughness by favoring the amplification of surface wettability the wetting properties of the separators are switchable between hydrophilic and hydrophobic states by surface modification with hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials moreover hydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic material separators are superior to hydrophobic and oleophilic materials due to the reduction in external fouling and water barrier capacity bio based foam membranes are biodegradable but the production and scale up cost is more than that of mesh due to the lyophilization 6 conclusions in general when the booms and skimmers are ineffective in rough seas dispersants composed of surfactants could be the best option for oil spill response however for an arctic oil spill in situ burning is preferable in a cold ecosystem prevention of an oil spill is environmentally and economically preferable to costly land remediation the two major things of any sorbent affecting the sorption of oils are its physical characteristics and hydrophobic properties in terms of oil selectivity from an environmental point of view the removal of the oil from the environment is always the best solution but economical aspects may restrict the methods available for oil spill treatment both sorbents and gelators can be used to immobilize the oil by different mechanisms for easier removal from the water surface the oil can be recovered and the sorbent gelator can be reused although the collection of the immobilized oil is slow and labor intensive resulting in high costs the recovery of the oil and the reusability of the materials increase the environmental friendliness and could decrease the cost of the methods in comparison to other sorbents the scale up cost of magnetic particles along with the recovery of oil could be cheaper the different bio based sorbents discussed in this review paper have threefold benefits in treating oily wastewater a steep reduction in oil content from water reutilization of waste and recovery of oil effective materials from bio based resources can be prepared but this often requires significant and costly modification of the native materials the future challenge and prospective is to produce effective materials with minimal feasible and environmentally friendly modifications while still retaining the desirable properties of the native bio based materials such as biodegradability and non toxicity acknowledgement this work

19662,sulfide modified nanoscale zero valent iron s nzvi has been considered as an efficient material to degrade trichloroethylene tce in groundwater however some critical factors influencing the dechlorination of tce by s nzvi have not been investigated clearly in this study the effects of fe s molar ratio initial ph dissolved oxygen and particle aging on tce dechlorination by s nzvi using dithionite as sulfidation reagent were studied besides the feasibility of reactivation of the aged nzvi by sulfidation treatment was looked into the results show that the fe s molar ratio and initial ph significantly influenced the tce dechlorination and a higher tce dechlorination was observed at fe s molar ratio of 60 under alkaline condition spectroscopic analyses demonstrate that the enhanced tce dechlorination was associated with the presence of fes on the surface of s nzvi dissolved oxygen had little effect on tce dechlorination by s nzvi revealing that the fes layer could be able to alleviate the surface passivation of nzvi caused by oxidation aging of s nzvi up to 10 20 d only slightly decreased the dechlorination efficiency of tce although an obvious drop in dechorination efficiency was observed for the s nzvi aged for 30 d it still exhibited a higher reactivity than the bare nzvi this indicates that sulfidation of nzvi did prolong its lifetime additionally sulfidation treatment was used to reactivate the aged nzvi and the results show that the reactivated nzvi even had higher reactivity than the fresh nzvi suggesting that sulfidation treatment would be a promising

spite of the high reactivity of nzvi corrosion of iron in aqueous solutions may cause surface passivation thus decreasing its reactivity liang et al 2014 dong et al 2016a 2017c qin et al 2017 xie et al 2017 recently some studies have reported the reactivity of nzvi towards chlorinated contaminants was enhanced in the presence of sulfur compounds kim et al 2013 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 han and

the enhanced dechlorination efficiency caused by the sulfide modification researchers have not reached a consensus yet some mechanisms were proposed including more efficient electron transfer mediated by the iron sulfide layer rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 improved contaminant specific property selective against the background reaction of water reduction of s nzvi han and yan 2016 increased depassivation of iron surface hansson et al 2008 the different mechanisms might result from the difference in experiment conditions e g type of sulfidation reagent molar ratio of fe s han and yan 2016 reported that the reactivity of sulfur treated nzvi was unaffected by the sulfidation reagent i e sodium sulfide dithionite and thiosulfate but was dependent strongly on the molar ratio of fe s however in regard to the effect of fe s molar ratio different findings were reported kim et al 2011 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 han and yan 2016 kim et al 2011 found that the fe fes nanoparticles had a higher reactivity towards tce than the unamended nzvi and the enhancements in reactivity were relatively constant over a large range of dithionite doses the study of rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 however reported that fe s ratios in the range of 12 25 provided the highest tce dechlorination rates and rates decreased at both higher and lower fe s ratio different from both the above two studies han and yan 2016 reported that tce degradation was accelerated with increasing sulfur dose at a low sulfur loading but the rate constant reached a constant value as the fe s ratio was lower than 40 accordingly the effect of fe s molar ratio on tce degardation and the underlying mechanisms need to be further investigated moreover some other critical factors which might influence the reactivity of s nzvi e g ph dissolved oxygen particle aging are not well studied in previous studies and need to be further identified these factors have been reported to significantly influence the corrosion process and thus the reactivity of bare nzvi dong et al 2016b thus a comparison study on the influences of these factors on the reactivity of s nzvi and bare nzvi is essential to better understand the underlying mechanisms of the enhanced reactivity of s nzvi yet no studies have systematically compared the reactivity of s nzvi and nzvi under the varying conditions the objectives of this study were to assess the influences of the molar ratio of fe s solution ph dissolved oxygen and aging time of particles on the removal efficiency and dechlorination efficiency of tce by s nzvi besides we also

conditions the initial ph ph 5 57 7 10 and 8 02 of solutions was adjusted using dilute naoh or hcl the samples were prepared in 40 ml glass vials containing 20 ml solution 100 mg dry particles were added into the vials to reach a particle concentration of 5 g l then a certain volume of tce stock solution dissolved in methanol was injected into the vials to prepare tce with initial concentration of 30 mg l the vials were transferred to a horizontal shaker at 250 rpm at 20 2 c aqueous suspensions were periodically sampled from the glass vials and filtered through 0 45 μm needle filter then the tce in aqueous phase were extracted with chromatographically pure n hexane and analyzed using a gas chromatograph flame ionization detector gc fid equipped with a db 624 capillary column 30 m 0 53 mm 3 μm simultaneously the concentration of cl in aqueous solution was detected with uv spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu japan utsumi 2006 to differentiate the two possible ways adsorption and degradation of tce removal from aqueous solution the total residual tce i e both in aqueous phase and solid phase in the sample was extracted by addition of pure n hexane then the portion of tce adsorbed onto the particle surface was obtained by subtraction of tce concentration in aqueous phase from the total residual tce concentration and the portion of degraded tce was determined by the subtraction of the adsorbed tce from the total removed tce to assess the effect of aging time on tce removal by s nzvi 100 mg s nzvi particles and 20 ml deoxygenated deionized water were added into the 40 ml vial then the vials were sealed and placed in dark room for aging at determined time intervals 10 d 20 d and 30 d the aged samples were collected and used for tce removal following the same procedure as described above in the experiment of reactivation of the aged nzvi by na2s2o4 the nzvi particles were exposed to air and aged naturally for different time then the aged nzvi was reactivated by na2s2o4 following a similar procedure as the synthesis of s nzvi briefly 1 g aged nzvi particles were added into a three necked flask with 714 ml deionized water the solution was degassed with n2 for at least 30 min to achieve an anoxic environment 522 μl na2s2o4 solution 100 g l was dropped into the flask the theoretical ratio of fe s was 60 followed by 30 min of mechanical stirring then the treated particles were collected and used for tce removal following the same procedure as described above all experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure that reproducible results were obtained the data reported here were the average of three replicated experiments and error bars represent the standard deviation of the averages 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe s molar ratio on tce removal by s nzvi s nzvi particles synthesized at different molar ratios of fe s ranging from 100 to 10 were used for tce removal and the results are shown in fig 1 a it was found that the molar ratio of fe s had a significant effect on the removal of tce by s nzvi on the whole the sulfidation of nzvi greatly increased the removal efficiency of tce compared with the bare nzvi however the removal rate of tce differed for s nzvi synthesized at different molar ratios of fe s it was found that s nzvi fe s 60 provided the highest tce removal efficiency which decreased at both higher and lower fe s our observed trends on the effects of sulfide concentration on reactivity were similar to that of rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 han and yan 2016 also reported the rate of tce degradation by s nzvi was accelerated with increasing sulfur dose at a low sulfur loading but the rate constant reached a limiting value and kept constant rather than decreasing with further increase of sulfur loading given that the removal efficiency might not represent the degradation efficiency of tce by s nzvi the dechlorination efficiency was further studied at selected fe s molar ratios i e 10 60 and 100 the concentration of chloride ions generated in the solution was examined and the theoretical dechlorination efficiency was shown in fig 1b in general the dechlorination efficiency of tce by s nzvi was much higher than that of bare nzvi when increasing the dosage of sulfur the dechlorination increased to a maximum value at fe s ratio of 60 and then decreased which shows the same trend as that observed in the removal efficiency of tce as demonstrated in fig 1a however it was found that even though the removal efficiency of tce reached nearly 100 after 9 h reaction at fe s molar ratio of 60 the dechlorination efficiency was only around 35 this indicates that tce was only partially degraded or adsorbed onto the surface of s nzvi particles then the proportion of tce by degradation and adsorption was further determined fig 1c the results show that the tce degradation by bare nzvi was trivial within 9 h reaction and the removal of tce by nzvi was mainly due to adsorption this is consistent with the previous studies wang and zhang 1997 liu et al 2005 dong et al 2017a in which it was reported that the reaction rate of bare nzvi with tce was slow and the degradation occurred only after several days of reaction the results further verified that the sulfidation of nzvi significantly enhanced the degradation of tce and the optimum degradation efficiency was observed at fe s molar ratio of 60 fig 1c previous studies have reported that the enhanced reactivity of nzvi by sulfidation should be ascribed to the formation of fesx layer on the surface of nzvi rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 han and yan 2016 thus given the different performance of tce degradation by s nzvi prepared at different fe s molar ratios in this study it was suspected that different fe s compounds might be formed on the surface of nzvi at different fe s molar ratios in the synthesis process of s nzvi the decomposition of s2o4 2 could produce a variety of sulfur species eqs 1 6 garcia et al 2016 han and yan 2016 among such sulfur species the presence of sulfide s2 or elemental sulfur s0 would contribute to the formation of fes on the surface of fe0 eqs 7 9 which could promote the dechlorination of tce rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 han and yan 2016 nevertheless the excessive amount of sulfur might generate polysulfide compounds sn 2 which has a lower reactivity towards tce compared with fes garcia et al 2016 han and yan 2016 meanwhile the excessive s2o4 2 might be decomposed into sulfite so3 2 and sulfate so4 2 eqs 1 3 the salts of which would deposit onto the surface of fe0 and then influence the electron transfer between fe0 and tce garcia et al 2016 1 2 s 2 o 4 2 h 2 o 2 s o 3 2 s 2 o 3 2 2 h 2 2 s o 3 2 h 2 o 2 s o 4 2 4 e 4 h 3 s 2 o 3 2 5 h 2 o 2

physicochemical properties of s nzvi spectroscopic analysis were performed on the three types of s nzvi prepared at fe s molar ratios of 100 60 and 10 s nzvi and nzvi samples were characterized using tem coupled with eds for comparison fig s1 shows nzvi particles with primary particle diameters 10 20 nm are aggregated in chain structures fig 2 a c shows tem images of s nzvi at fe s molar ratios of 100 60 and 10 it was found that aggregation of s nzvi is not as significant as nzvi which might be due to the reason that the fesx coating decreases magnetic attractions between the particles su et al 2015 it was also observed that s nzvi has different particle size and morphology compared to nzvi the particle size of s nzvi increases with the decreasing fe s molar ratio which is 50 nm 100 nm and 200 nm at fe s molar ratios of 100 60 and 10 respectively s nzvi has a flake like shell and the level of flaking increases with decreasing fe s ratio the flake like shell was also observed by su et al 2015 who reported that s nzvi has much higher surface to volume ratio due to the abundant flake like structure compared with nzvi thus the decreased aggregation and the higher surface to volume ratio might contribute to the enhanced reactivity of s nzvi the eds however showed only fe and o as the main elements with no or very low levels of sulfur fig s2 this phenomenon was also observed by fan et al 2014 it is possible that these structures on the surface of s nzvi were some transient phases of fes oxidation and had yet to be transformed to more stable phases to verify the formation of sulfur compounds on the surface of s nzvi as illustrated in eqs 1 9 ftir spectra of nzvi and s nzvi were collected for comparison fig 3 the broad band appeared at 3400 cm 1 could come from hydroxyl groups of lattice water the peak at around 2350 cm 1 should be assigned to the saturation band of co2 the bands at 1630 cm 1 and 1450 cm 1 can be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of c o dong et al 2016b the above bands existed in both nzvi and s nzvi samples however some new bands appeared at 1100 cm 1 and 920 cm 1 for s nzvi samples which could be assigned to the presence of so4 2 s2o3 2 or so3 2 chernyshova 2003 reyes bozo et al 2015 this verified the mechanisms proposed in eqs 1 4 the bands observed at lower wavenumbers between 620 cm 1 and 500 cm 1 could be assigned to the typical fe o and fe s bonds dong et al 2016b reyes bozo et al 2015 however as demonstrated in fig 3 it is difficult to differentiate the iron oxides and iron sulfide fesx to further clarify the exact fe s compounds formed on the surface of s nzvi xps analysis were carried out fig 4 fig 4a shows the high resolution xps for the s 2p region for s nzvi the 2p3 2 peaks for sulfide s2 and polysulfide sn 2 were detected at 161 7 ev and 162 6 ev respectively garcia et al 2016 for s nzvi with fe s molar ratio of 100 the contents of sulfide and polysulfide were low but obviously the content of sulfide was much higher than that of polysulfide the content of sulfide and polysulfide increased with the increasing dosage of s2o4 2 and the content of polysulfide was similar to that of sulfide for s nzvi with fe s molar ratio of 60 when the dosage of s2o4 2 was further increased sulfide content increased slightly while polysulfide content increased markedly simultaneously a small peak of sulfite so3 2 and a pronounced peak of sulfate so4 2 were detected at 167 4 ev and 168 9 ev respectively garcia et al 2016 due to the addition of s2o4 2 fe0 would convert into iron with different valences and the content of fe0 could indirectly reflect the reducing capacity of s nzvi therefore the high resolution xps for the fe 2p region was detected and shown in fig 4b the broad peaks of fe 2p1 2 723 ev and fe 2p3 2 710 ev account for the oxidized iron species fe2 and fe3 yamashita and hayes 2008 jeong et al 2010 garcia et al 2016 which are predominant in all the three types of s nzvi particles the satellite peak obtained at 714 ev was assigned to fe 2p3 2 of fe2 yamashita and hayes 2008 the oxidized iron for these nanoparticles could be present as iron oxides oxyhydroxides hydroxides and sulfides the peaks of fe0 2p3 2 707ev and fe0 2p1 2 719ev account for less proportion indicating that the oxidized iron species were dominant on the surface of s nzvi when the fe s molar ratio was 10 the peaks representing fe0 even disappeared it could be speculated that the large portion of fe0 was oxidized with the addition of s2o4 2 in the synthesis process generating iron oxide or fe s compounds the above xps analysis indicates that fes was generated on the surface of nzvi at lower dosage of s2o4 2 while large amounts of fes2 and so4 2 accumulated on the surface of nzvi at higher dosage of s2o4 2 although the presence of fes could enhance the reactivity of fe0 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 fes2 has a much lower reactivity towards tce than fes lee and batchelor 2002 meanwhile at higher dosage of s2o4 2 fe0 content decreased significantly and a large amount of sulfate were deposited onto the particle surface which reduced the electron donor and also hindered the transfer of electrons accordingly the enhanced degradation of tce by s nzvi at higher molar ratio of fe s from 100 to 60 should be due to the presence of fes while the inhibited tce degradation at lower molar ratio of fe s from 60 to 10 should be due to the accumulation of fes2 sulfate and iron oxides on the surface of s nzvi and the consumption of fe0 3 2 effect of ph it is known that the reactivity of nzvi is greatly susceptible to solution ph under alkaline conditions nzvi has a lower reactivity due to surface passivation while under acidic conditions nzvi has a higher reactivity due to rapid corrosion matheson and tratnyek 1994 however the fe s layer formed on the surface of nzvi via sulfidation was reported to be able to enhance electron transfer and increase depassivation of nzvi hansson et al 2008 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 han and yan 2016 which might exert some different effects on the removal of tce by s nzvi at different ph therefore the effect of initial ph on the removal of tce by s nzvi was studied fig 5 it was found that the removal of tce by s nzvi was slightly affected by ph value all of which could reach 90 after 9 h of reaction fig 5a the trend of tce removal with ph seems to be contrary to the previous literature kim et al 2013 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 in which the increasing solution ph could significantly increase tce degradation however as discussed in our previous section the tce removal in this study could result from both degardation and adsorption which might give rise to the differences in ph dependent trend from other studies that only take degardation into account thus the degradation of tce with ph was further examined by determining the dechlorination efficiency fig 5b as shown in fig 5b the dechlorination efficiency increased significantly with increase of ph value the dechlorination efficiency merely achieved 31 5 at initial ph 5 57 while it could reach up to 60 7 at initial ph 8 02 the trend of tce degradation with ph is consistent with the ph effect observed in iron sulfide systems reported previously but opposite to that in the single nzvi systems butler and hayes 2001 kim et al 2013 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 in order to further explore the role of ph played on the tce degradation process the variation of ph with reaction time was monitored fig 5c although there was a great difference in the initial ph from 5 57 to 8 02 of the three samples the ph of solution became similar after reaction for just a few minutes the final ph increased to around 8 5 in all three samples this indicates that the initial ph plays a more important role in the dechlorination of tce by s nzvi as shown in fig 5c the initial ph 5 57 rapidly rose to around 8 5 within a few minutes which should be due to the release of oh from the fast corrosion of s nzvi as demonstrated in eq 7 this reveals that the reaction between s nzvi and water was fast at initial ph of 5 57 which might be the reason for the lower tce dechlorination this seems to be contrary to the findings of han and yan 2016 in which the reactivity of s nzvi is contaminant specific and is selective against the background reaction of water reduction the controversy might result from the different initial ph employed in the study of han and yan 2016 in which the experiments were carried out at initial ph of 7 8 8 2 in this study it was also found that more efficient tce dechlorination was obtained at ph 8 02 than ph 5 57 bulter and hayes 2001 reported that the rate of tce degradation by fes increased with increase of ph from 7 3 to 9 3 which was possibly due to a decrease in the reduction potential of reactive surface species with increasing ph it was also reported that the deprotonated ligands i e feo and s are more favorable for electron donation kim et al 2013 which results in the increased rates of tce reduction at higher ph levels 3 3 effect of dissolved oxygen in the real application the lifetime of nzvi would be significantly influenced by the existence of oxidizing substances e g dissolved oxygen do in the aqueous environment the presence of do can cause rapid oxidation of nzvi resulting in a loss of reactivity towards contaminants dong et al 2016b in order to verify if the coated fes shell could relieve the oxidation of nzvi by do the effect of do on tce removal by s nzvi was examined and the results are shown in fig 6 a as for s nzvi although the removal rate of tce was slightly slower in air water environment than that in air stripping water environment at the beginning of the reaction there was no difference in the total removal efficiency after 6 h of reaction however under the same circumstance the removal efficiency of tce by nzvi decreased from 79 without do to 58 with do to further explore the influence of do on the degradation of tce the dechlorination efficiency was examined as shown in fig 6b in the s nzvi reaction system the dechlorination was significantly inhibited in the first 2 h of reaction under air condition however there was only a slight decrease in dechlorination efficiency under air condition than that under air stripping condition at the end of the reaction it was presumed that the inhibition of dechlorination at the outset of experiments might be due to the competition between do and tce for reaction with s nzvi yet the fact that the final dechlorination efficiency was slightly influenced by do reveals that although s nzvi could not be selective against reaction with do the presence of fes layer might be able to alleviate the surface passivation of nzvi caused by do oxidation to approve this the corrosion of s nzvi in the absence and presence of do was compared with that of nzvi by monitoring the variation of oxidation reduction potential orp during the reactions fig 6c it was found that the orp value decreased sharply to around 700 ev in the s nzvi systems under both air stripping condition and air condition as for the nzvi system the orp value also decreased sharply to around 600 ev under air stripping or air condition the drop of orp in s nzvi system was more than that in nzvi system suggesting a higher degree of corrosion of s nzvi than nzvi this further reveals that s nzvi had stronger anti passivation ability than nzvi thus it can be presumed that the sulfidation of nzvi could not avoid the side reaction with do but could possibly alleviate the surface passivation of nzvi caused by oxidation this resulted in a higher reactivity of s nzvi towards tce than the bare nzvi in addition it has been reported that the free radicals such as o 2 and o h derived from dissolved molecular oxygen could be yielded in the s nzvi system eqs 10 12 song et al 2016 which could facilitate the elimination of tce beltrán et al 1996 10 fe s f e 2 o 2 a d f e s f e 3 o 2 11 f e 2 o 2 2 h f e 3 h 2 o 2 12 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h overall it can be seen that the presence of do exerted more influence on the nzvi system than the s nzvi system this verifies that the sulfidation of nzvi could alleviate the negative impact of do on the reactivity of nzvi 3 4 effect of aging to further verify whether and how the sulfidation of nzvi could alleviate the surface passivation of nzvi caused by corrosion the s nzvi particles were aged in water for different time and then used for tce degradation as demonstrated in fig 7 a the effect of aging time on the dechlorination of tce by the aged s nzvi was determined it was found that s nzvi aged for 10 20 d still kept a high capacity of tce dechlorination compared with the fresh s nzvi whereas an obvious drop in tce dechlorination was observed for s nzvi aged for 30 d the dechlorination efficiency of tce by freshly prepared s nzvi was 31 2 while that of s nzvi 10d s nzvi 20d and s nzvi 30d were 30 27 5 and 23 respectively previous studies have shown that the reactivity of nzvi towards contaminants could be rapidly reduced after aging for just several days due to serious surface passivation caused by corrosion kim et al 2010 dong et al 2016b in comparison it was clear that the sulfidation of nzvi did prolong its lifetime given that the reactivity of s nzvi was directly associated with the surface composition kim et al 2014 xrd analysis was then conducted to identify the composition evolution of s nzvi with aging time fig 7b fig 7b shows the xrd patterns of fresh nzvi and s nzvi which indicate the presence of fe0 2θ 44 6 in s nzvi just like nzvi dong et al 2016b however no iron sulfide peak is observed similar phenomenon was also observed in other studies kim et al 2011 su et al 2015 the peaks of iron sulfide in the fresh s nzvi could not be discerned in the pattern which might be due to their low concentrations or low degree of crystallinity or the overlapping with the peak of fe0 kim et al 2011 fan et al 2014 for the aged samples some peaks assigned to iron oxide and iron sulfide appeared indicating the chemical and structural transformation of s nzvi with aging the peaks l and n at 35 and 30 54 56 in the aged s nzvi represent lepidocrocite γ feooh and magnetite maghemite fe3o4 γ fe2o3 respectively dong et al 2018 another major peak m at 22 41 68 represents the existence of ferrous sulfide fes and the minor peaks p and g at 43 and 33 represent pyrite fes2 and greigite fe3s4 respectively he et al 2010 with the increase of aging time the peak of fe0 receded and the peaks of fes fes2 and fe3s4 became obvious even though there was still obvious peak of fe0 in the s nzvi aged for 10 20 d however in the s nzvi aged for 30 d the peak of fe0 disappeared and the peaks of γ feooh and fe3o4 γ fe2o3 increased rapidly the reduction of fe0 content and the accumulation of iron oxides should be the reason for the decreased dechlorination efficiency of the aged s nzvi especially for s nzvi 30d nevertheless although the iron oxides e g γ feooh and fe3o4 γ fe2o3 were accumulated on the surface of s nzvi 30d the dechlorination efficiency of s nzvi 30d still reached a higher level 23 compared with that of fresh prepared nzvi 12 3 this should be attributed to the excellent electron conductivity of fes on the particle surface butler and hayes 2001 3 5 reactivation of aged nzvi by sulfidation in real application nzvi particles are usually synthesized on site during the site remediation to avoid oxidation otherwise the particles can be easily passivated and lose reactivity during long term storage dong et al 2016a liang et al 2014 qin et al 2017 for the aged nzvi previous studies have developed various methods e g acid washing h2 pretreatment ultrasound premagnetization to reactivate its reactivity before the application guan et al 2015 li et al 2015 sun et al 2017 in this study we tried to examine whether the sulfidation with na2s2o4 could reactivate the aged nzvi as shown in fig 8 a the dechlorination of tce by the na2s2o4 reactivated aged nzvi r nzvi were measured and compared with that of fresh s nzvi and fresh nzvi the results show that although the dechlorination efficiency of r nzvi was still not comparable to that of s nzvi but was superior to that of fresh nzvi besides it was found that the aging time of nzvi had limited influence on the reactivation of nzvi by sulfidation the dechlorination efficiency by r nzvi decreased slightly with the increase of aging time of nzvi reaching 23 20 and 19 with aging time of 10 d 20 d and 30 d respectively the results suggest that sulfidation with na2s2o4 could be a feasible way for the reactivation of aged nzvi for the degradation of tce in addition the chemical composition of aged nzvi and r nzvi were further analyzed by xrd fig 8b the xrd pattern of aged nzvi shows the existence of fe0 and small amount of iron oxides a comparison of xrd patterns of nzvi with different aging time indicates that the peak of fe0 became weaker with the increase of aging time when na2s2o4 was added to reactivate the aged nzvi the peaks of ferrous sulfide fes greigite fe3s4 and lepidocrocite γ feooh appeared thus the presence of fes on the surface of r nzvi should contribute to the enhanced dechlorination of tce compared with fresh nzvi however the reactivity of r nzvi was still not as good as s nzvi which should be due to the presence of iron oxides e g γ feooh on the surface of r nzvi and the less content of fe0 4 conclusion in this study we investigated the effects of fe s molar ratio ph dissolved oxygen do and particle aging on tce degradation by s nzvi the following conclusions were made fe s ratio greatly affected the dechlorination efficiency of tce by s nzvi the tce dechlorination efficiency achieved the maximum value at fe s molar ratio of 60 and it decreased at both higher and lower fe s the spectroscopic analysis reveal that the presence of fes formed on the surface of nzvi played a key role in the dechlorination process the increasing solution ph from 5 to 8 significantly increased tce degradation by s nzvi this suggests that s nzvi would be an efficient reagent for the remediation of groundwater with typical ph 8 the presence of do and the aging time of s nzvi had limited effect on tce dechlorination efficiency the results reveal that the presence of fes layer could be able to alleviate the surface passivation of nzvi caused by corrosion prolonging the lifetime of s nzvi the feasibility of reactivation of the aged nzvi by sulfidation treatment was examined it was found the reactivated nzvi even had higher reactivity than the fresh nzvi xrd analysis shows that fes was generated on the surface of the aged nzvi after sulfidation which should contribute to the improved reactivity this reveals that sulfidation treatment could be a feasible way for the reactivation of aged nzvi acknowledgements this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51409100 51521006 the fundamental research funds

19662,sulfide modified nanoscale zero valent iron s nzvi has been considered as an efficient material to degrade trichloroethylene tce in groundwater however some critical factors influencing the dechlorination of tce by s nzvi have not been investigated clearly in this study the effects of fe s molar ratio initial ph dissolved oxygen and particle aging on tce dechlorination by s nzvi using dithionite as sulfidation reagent were studied besides the feasibility of reactivation of the aged nzvi by sulfidation treatment was looked into the results show that the fe s molar ratio and initial ph significantly influenced the tce dechlorination and a higher tce dechlorination was observed at fe s molar ratio of 60 under alkaline condition spectroscopic analyses demonstrate that the enhanced tce dechlorination was associated with the presence of fes on the surface of s nzvi dissolved oxygen had little effect on tce dechlorination by s nzvi revealing that the fes layer could be able to alleviate the surface passivation of nzvi caused by oxidation aging of s nzvi up to 10 20 d only slightly decreased the dechlorination efficiency of tce although an obvious drop in dechorination efficiency was observed for the s nzvi aged for 30 d it still exhibited a higher reactivity than the bare nzvi this indicates that sulfidation of nzvi did prolong its lifetime additionally sulfidation treatment was used to reactivate the aged nzvi and the results show that the reactivated nzvi even had higher reactivity than the fresh nzvi suggesting that sulfidation treatment would be a promising

the enhanced dechlorination efficiency caused by the sulfide modification researchers have not reached a consensus yet some mechanisms were proposed including more efficient electron transfer mediated by the iron sulfide layer rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 improved contaminant specific property selective against the background reaction of water reduction of s nzvi han and yan 2016 increased depassivation of iron surface hansson et al 2008 the different mechanisms might result from the difference in experiment conditions e g type of sulfidation reagent molar ratio of fe s han and yan 2016 reported that the reactivity of sulfur treated nzvi was unaffected by the sulfidation reagent i e sodium sulfide dithionite and thiosulfate but was dependent strongly on the molar ratio of fe s however in regard to the effect of fe s molar ratio different findings were reported kim et al 2011 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 han and yan 2016 kim et al 2011 found that the fe fes nanoparticles had a higher reactivity towards tce than the unamended nzvi and the enhancements in reactivity were relatively constant over a large range of dithionite doses the study of rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 however reported that fe s ratios in the range of 12 25 provided the highest tce dechlorination rates and rates decreased at both higher and lower fe s ratio different from both the above two studies han and yan 2016 reported that tce degradation was accelerated with increasing sulfur dose at a low sulfur loading but the rate constant reached a constant value as the fe s ratio was lower than 40 accordingly the effect of fe s molar ratio on tce degardation and the underlying mechanisms need to be further investigated moreover some other critical factors which might influence the reactivity of s nzvi e g ph dissolved oxygen particle aging are not well studied in previous studies and need to be further identified these factors have been reported to significantly influence the corrosion process and thus the reactivity of bare nzvi dong et al 2016b thus a comparison study on the influences of these factors on the reactivity of s nzvi and bare nzvi is essential to better understand the underlying mechanisms of the enhanced reactivity of s nzvi yet no studies have systematically compared the reactivity of s nzvi and nzvi under the varying conditions the objectives of this study were to assess the influences of the molar ratio of fe s solution ph dissolved oxygen and aging time of particles on the removal efficiency and dechlorination efficiency of tce by s nzvi besides we also

added drop wisely into the fecl3 6h2o solution followed by 30 min of mechanical stirring the dosage of na2s2o4 was varied in the synthesis mixture such that the fe s molar ratio changed in the range of 10 100 the resulting nzvi or s nzvi suspension was washed at least 3 times with deionized water and ethanol and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 60 c for 8 h the dry particles were stored in

conditions the initial ph ph 5 57 7 10 and 8 02 of solutions was adjusted using dilute naoh or hcl the samples were prepared in 40 ml glass vials containing 20 ml solution 100 mg dry particles were added into the vials to reach a particle concentration of 5 g l then a certain volume of tce stock solution dissolved in methanol was injected into the vials to prepare tce with initial concentration of 30 mg l the vials were transferred to a horizontal shaker at 250 rpm at 20 2 c aqueous suspensions were periodically sampled from the glass vials and filtered through 0 45 μm needle filter then the tce in aqueous phase were extracted with chromatographically pure n hexane and analyzed using a gas chromatograph flame ionization detector gc fid equipped with a db 624 capillary column 30 m 0 53 mm 3 μm simultaneously the concentration of cl in aqueous solution was detected with uv spectrophotometer uv 2550 shimadzu japan utsumi 2006 to differentiate the two possible ways adsorption and degradation of tce removal from aqueous solution the total residual tce i e both in aqueous phase and solid phase in the sample was extracted by addition of pure n hexane then the portion of tce adsorbed onto the particle surface was obtained by subtraction of tce concentration in aqueous phase from the total residual tce concentration and the portion of degraded tce was determined by the subtraction of the adsorbed tce from the total removed tce to assess the effect of aging time on tce removal by s nzvi 100 mg s nzvi particles and 20 ml deoxygenated deionized water were added into the 40 ml vial then the vials were sealed and placed in dark room for aging at determined time intervals 10 d 20 d and 30 d the aged samples were collected and used for tce removal following the same procedure as described above in the experiment of reactivation of the aged nzvi by na2s2o4 the nzvi particles were exposed to air and aged naturally for different time then the aged nzvi was reactivated by na2s2o4 following a similar procedure as the synthesis of s nzvi briefly 1 g aged nzvi particles were added into a three necked flask with 714 ml deionized water the solution was degassed with n2 for at least 30 min to achieve an anoxic environment 522 μl na2s2o4 solution 100 g l was dropped into the flask the theoretical ratio of fe s was 60 followed by 30 min of mechanical stirring then the treated particles were collected and used for tce removal following the same procedure as described above all experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure that reproducible results were obtained the data reported here were the average of three replicated experiments and error bars represent the standard deviation of the averages 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of fe s molar ratio on tce removal by s nzvi s nzvi particles synthesized at different molar ratios of fe s ranging from 100 to 10 were used for tce removal and the results are shown in fig 1 a it was found that the molar ratio of fe s had a significant effect on the removal of tce by s nzvi on the whole the sulfidation of nzvi greatly increased the removal efficiency of tce compared with the bare nzvi however the removal rate of tce differed for s nzvi synthesized at different molar ratios of fe s it was found that s nzvi fe s 60 provided the highest tce removal efficiency which decreased at both higher and lower fe s our observed trends on the effects of sulfide concentration on reactivity were similar to that of rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 han and yan 2016 also reported the rate of tce degradation by s nzvi was accelerated with increasing sulfur dose at a low sulfur loading but the rate constant reached a limiting value and kept constant rather than decreasing with further increase of sulfur loading given that the removal efficiency might not represent the degradation efficiency of tce by s nzvi the dechlorination efficiency was further studied at selected fe s molar ratios i e 10 60 and 100 the concentration of chloride ions generated in the solution was examined and the theoretical dechlorination efficiency was shown in fig 1b in general the dechlorination efficiency of tce by s nzvi was much higher than that of bare nzvi when increasing the dosage of sulfur the dechlorination increased to a maximum value at fe s ratio of 60 and then decreased which shows the same trend as that observed in the removal efficiency of tce as demonstrated in fig 1a however it was found that even though the removal efficiency of tce reached nearly 100 after 9 h reaction at fe s molar ratio of 60 the dechlorination efficiency was only around 35 this indicates that tce was only partially degraded or adsorbed onto the surface of s nzvi particles then the proportion of tce by degradation and adsorption was further determined fig 1c the results show that the tce degradation by bare nzvi was trivial within 9 h reaction and the removal of tce by nzvi was mainly due to adsorption this is consistent with the previous studies wang and zhang 1997 liu et al 2005 dong et al 2017a in which it was reported that the reaction rate of bare nzvi with tce was slow and the degradation occurred only after several days of reaction the results further verified that the sulfidation of nzvi significantly enhanced the degradation of tce and the optimum degradation efficiency was observed at fe s molar ratio of 60 fig 1c previous studies have reported that the enhanced reactivity of nzvi by sulfidation should be ascribed to the formation of fesx layer on the surface of nzvi rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 han and yan 2016 thus given the different performance of tce degradation by s nzvi prepared at different fe s molar ratios in this study it was suspected that different fe s compounds might be formed on the surface of nzvi at different fe s molar ratios in the synthesis process of s nzvi the decomposition of s2o4 2 could produce a variety of sulfur species eqs 1 6 garcia et al 2016 han and yan 2016 among such sulfur species the presence of sulfide s2 or elemental sulfur s0 would contribute to the formation of fes on the surface of fe0 eqs 7 9 which could promote the dechlorination of tce rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 han and yan 2016 nevertheless the excessive amount of sulfur might generate polysulfide compounds sn 2 which has a lower reactivity towards tce compared with fes garcia et al 2016 han and yan 2016 meanwhile the excessive s2o4 2 might be decomposed into sulfite so3 2 and sulfate so4 2 eqs 1 3 the salts of which would deposit onto the surface of fe0 and then influence the electron transfer between fe0 and tce garcia et al 2016 1 2 s 2 o 4 2 h 2 o 2 s o 3 2 s 2 o 3 2 2 h 2 2 s o 3 2 h 2 o 2 s o 4 2 4 e 4 h 3 s 2 o 3 2 5 h 2 o 2

physicochemical properties of s nzvi spectroscopic analysis were performed on the three types of s nzvi prepared at fe s molar ratios of 100 60 and 10 s nzvi and nzvi samples were characterized using tem coupled with eds for comparison fig s1 shows nzvi particles with primary particle diameters 10 20 nm are aggregated in chain structures fig 2 a c shows tem images of s nzvi at fe s molar ratios of 100 60 and 10 it was found that aggregation of s nzvi is not as significant as nzvi which might be due to the reason that the fesx coating decreases magnetic attractions between the particles su et al 2015 it was also observed that s nzvi has different particle size and morphology compared to nzvi the particle size of s nzvi increases with the decreasing fe s molar ratio which is 50 nm 100 nm and 200 nm at fe s molar ratios of 100 60 and 10 respectively s nzvi has a flake like shell and the level of flaking increases with decreasing fe s ratio the flake like shell was also observed by su et al 2015 who reported that s nzvi has much higher surface to volume ratio due to the abundant flake like structure compared with nzvi thus the decreased aggregation and the higher surface to volume ratio might contribute to the enhanced reactivity of s nzvi the eds however showed only fe and o as the main elements with no or very low levels of sulfur fig s2 this phenomenon was also observed by fan et al 2014 it is possible that these structures on the surface of s nzvi were some transient phases of fes oxidation and had yet to be transformed to more stable phases to verify the formation of sulfur compounds on the surface of s nzvi as illustrated in eqs 1 9 ftir spectra of nzvi and s nzvi were collected for comparison fig 3 the broad band appeared at 3400 cm 1 could come from hydroxyl groups of lattice water the peak at around 2350 cm 1 should be assigned to the saturation band of co2 the bands at 1630 cm 1 and 1450 cm 1 can be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of c o dong et al 2016b the above bands existed in both nzvi and s nzvi samples however some new bands appeared at 1100 cm 1 and 920 cm 1 for s nzvi samples which could be assigned to the presence of so4 2 s2o3 2 or so3 2 chernyshova 2003 reyes bozo et al 2015 this verified the mechanisms proposed in eqs 1 4 the bands observed at lower wavenumbers between 620 cm 1 and 500 cm 1 could be assigned to the typical fe o and fe s bonds dong et al 2016b reyes bozo et al 2015 however as demonstrated in fig 3 it is difficult to differentiate the iron oxides and iron sulfide fesx to further clarify the exact fe s compounds formed on the surface of s nzvi xps analysis were carried out fig 4 fig 4a shows the high resolution xps for the s 2p region for s nzvi the 2p3 2 peaks for sulfide s2 and polysulfide sn 2 were detected at 161 7 ev and 162 6 ev respectively garcia et al 2016 for s nzvi with fe s molar ratio of 100 the contents of sulfide and polysulfide were low but obviously the content of sulfide was much higher than that of polysulfide the content of sulfide and polysulfide increased with the increasing dosage of s2o4 2 and the content of polysulfide was similar to that of sulfide for s nzvi with fe s molar ratio of 60 when the dosage of s2o4 2 was further increased sulfide content increased slightly while polysulfide content increased markedly simultaneously a small peak of sulfite so3 2 and a pronounced peak of sulfate so4 2 were detected at 167 4 ev and 168 9 ev respectively garcia et al 2016 due to the addition of s2o4 2 fe0 would convert into iron with different valences and the content of fe0 could indirectly reflect the reducing capacity of s nzvi therefore the high resolution xps for the fe 2p region was detected and shown in fig 4b the broad peaks of fe 2p1 2 723 ev and fe 2p3 2 710 ev account for the oxidized iron species fe2 and fe3 yamashita and hayes 2008 jeong et al 2010 garcia et al 2016 which are predominant in all the three types of s nzvi particles the satellite peak obtained at 714 ev was assigned to fe 2p3 2 of fe2 yamashita and hayes 2008 the oxidized iron for these nanoparticles could be present as iron oxides oxyhydroxides hydroxides and sulfides the peaks of fe0 2p3 2 707ev and fe0 2p1 2 719ev account for less proportion indicating that the oxidized iron species were dominant on the surface of s nzvi when the fe s molar ratio was 10 the peaks representing fe0 even disappeared it could be speculated that the large portion of fe0 was oxidized with the addition of s2o4 2 in the synthesis process generating iron oxide or fe s compounds the above xps analysis indicates that fes was generated on the surface of nzvi at lower dosage of s2o4 2 while large amounts of fes2 and so4 2 accumulated on the surface of nzvi at higher dosage of s2o4 2 although the presence of fes could enhance the reactivity of fe0 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 fes2 has a much lower reactivity towards tce than fes lee and batchelor 2002 meanwhile at higher dosage of s2o4 2 fe0 content decreased significantly and a large amount of sulfate were deposited onto the particle surface which reduced the electron donor and also hindered the transfer of electrons accordingly the enhanced degradation of tce by s nzvi at higher molar ratio of fe s from 100 to 60 should be due to the presence of fes while the inhibited tce degradation at lower molar ratio of fe s from 60 to 10 should be due to the accumulation of fes2 sulfate and iron oxides on the surface of s nzvi and the consumption of fe0 3 2 effect of ph it is known that the reactivity of nzvi is greatly susceptible to solution ph under alkaline conditions nzvi has a lower reactivity due to surface passivation while under acidic conditions nzvi has a higher reactivity due to rapid corrosion matheson and tratnyek 1994 however the fe s layer formed on the surface of nzvi via sulfidation was reported to be able to enhance electron transfer and increase depassivation of nzvi hansson et al 2008 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 han and yan 2016 which might exert some different effects on the removal of tce by s nzvi at different ph therefore the effect of initial ph on the removal of tce by s nzvi was studied fig 5 it was found that the removal of tce by s nzvi was slightly affected by ph value all of which could reach 90 after 9 h of reaction fig 5a the trend of tce removal with ph seems to be contrary to the previous literature kim et al 2013 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 in which the increasing solution ph could significantly increase tce degradation however as discussed in our previous section the tce removal in this study could result from both degardation and adsorption which might give rise to the differences in ph dependent trend from other studies that only take degardation into account thus the degradation of tce with ph was further examined by determining the dechlorination efficiency fig 5b as shown in fig 5b the dechlorination efficiency increased significantly with increase of ph value the dechlorination efficiency merely achieved 31 5 at initial ph 5 57 while it could reach up to 60 7 at initial ph 8 02 the trend of tce degradation with ph is consistent with the ph effect observed in iron sulfide systems reported previously but opposite to that in the single nzvi systems butler and hayes 2001 kim et al 2013 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 in order to further explore the role of ph played on the tce degradation process the variation of ph with reaction time was monitored fig 5c although there was a great difference in the initial ph from 5 57 to 8 02 of the three samples the ph of solution became similar after reaction for just a few minutes the final ph increased to around 8 5 in all three samples this indicates that the initial ph plays a more important role in the dechlorination of tce by s nzvi as shown in fig 5c the initial ph 5 57 rapidly rose to around 8 5 within a few minutes which should be due to the release of oh from the fast corrosion of s nzvi as demonstrated in eq 7 this reveals that the reaction between s nzvi and water was fast at initial ph of 5 57 which might be the reason for the lower tce dechlorination this seems to be contrary to the findings of han and yan 2016 in which the reactivity of s nzvi is contaminant specific and is selective against the background reaction of water reduction the controversy might result from the different initial ph employed in the study of han and yan 2016 in which the experiments were carried out at initial ph of 7 8 8 2 in this study it was also found that more efficient tce dechlorination was obtained at ph 8 02 than ph 5 57 bulter and hayes 2001 reported that the rate of tce degradation by fes increased with increase of ph from 7 3 to 9 3 which was possibly due to a decrease in the reduction potential of reactive surface species with increasing ph it was also reported that the deprotonated ligands i e feo and s are more favorable for electron donation kim et al 2013 which results in the increased rates of tce reduction at higher ph levels 3 3 effect of dissolved oxygen in the real application the lifetime of nzvi would be significantly influenced by the existence of oxidizing substances e g dissolved oxygen do in the aqueous environment the presence of do can cause rapid oxidation of nzvi resulting in a loss of reactivity towards contaminants dong et al 2016b in order to verify if the coated fes shell could relieve the oxidation of nzvi by do the effect of do on tce removal by s nzvi was examined and the results are shown in fig 6 a as for s nzvi although the removal rate of tce was slightly slower in air water environment than that in air stripping water environment at the beginning of the reaction there was no difference in the total removal efficiency after 6 h of reaction however under the same circumstance the removal efficiency of tce by nzvi decreased from 79 without do to 58 with do to further explore the influence of do on the degradation of tce the dechlorination efficiency was examined as shown in fig 6b in the s nzvi reaction system the dechlorination was significantly inhibited in the first 2 h of reaction under air condition however there was only a slight decrease in dechlorination efficiency under air condition than that under air stripping condition at the end of the reaction it was presumed that the inhibition of dechlorination at the outset of experiments might be due to the competition between do and tce for reaction with s nzvi yet the fact that the final dechlorination efficiency was slightly influenced by do reveals that although s nzvi could not be selective against reaction with do the presence of fes layer might be able to alleviate the surface passivation of nzvi caused by do oxidation to approve this the corrosion of s nzvi in the absence and presence of do was compared with that of nzvi by monitoring the variation of oxidation reduction potential orp during the reactions fig 6c it was found that the orp value decreased sharply to around 700 ev in the s nzvi systems under both air stripping condition and air condition as for the nzvi system the orp value also decreased sharply to around 600 ev under air stripping or air condition the drop of orp in s nzvi system was more than that in nzvi system suggesting a higher degree of corrosion of s nzvi than nzvi this further reveals that s nzvi had stronger anti passivation ability than nzvi thus it can be presumed that the sulfidation of nzvi could not avoid the side reaction with do but could possibly alleviate the surface passivation of nzvi caused by oxidation this resulted in a higher reactivity of s nzvi towards tce than the bare nzvi in addition it has been reported that the free radicals such as o 2 and o h derived from dissolved molecular oxygen could be yielded in the s nzvi system eqs 10 12 song et al 2016 which could facilitate the elimination of tce beltrán et al 1996 10 fe s f e 2 o 2 a d f e s f e 3 o 2 11 f e 2 o 2 2 h f e 3 h 2 o 2 12 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h overall it can be seen that the presence of do exerted more influence on the nzvi system than the s nzvi system this verifies that the sulfidation of nzvi could alleviate the negative impact of do on the reactivity of nzvi 3 4 effect of aging to further verify whether and how the sulfidation of nzvi could alleviate the surface passivation of nzvi caused by corrosion the s nzvi particles were aged in water for different time and then used for tce degradation as demonstrated in fig 7 a the effect of aging time on the dechlorination of tce by the aged s nzvi was determined it was found that s nzvi aged for 10 20 d still kept a high capacity of tce dechlorination compared with the fresh s nzvi whereas an obvious drop in tce dechlorination was observed for s nzvi aged for 30 d the dechlorination efficiency of tce by freshly prepared s nzvi was 31 2 while that of s nzvi 10d s nzvi 20d and s nzvi 30d were 30 27 5 and 23 respectively previous studies have shown that the reactivity of nzvi towards contaminants could be rapidly reduced after aging for just several days due to serious surface passivation caused by corrosion kim et al 2010 dong et al 2016b in comparison it was clear that the sulfidation of nzvi did prolong its lifetime given that the reactivity of s nzvi was directly associated with the surface composition kim et al 2014 xrd analysis was then conducted to identify the composition evolution of s nzvi with aging time fig 7b fig 7b shows the xrd patterns of fresh nzvi and s nzvi which indicate the presence of fe0 2θ 44 6 in s nzvi just like nzvi dong et al 2016b however no iron sulfide peak is observed similar phenomenon was also observed in other studies kim et al 2011 su et al 2015 the peaks of iron sulfide in the fresh s nzvi could not be discerned in the pattern which might be due to their low concentrations or low degree of crystallinity or the overlapping with the peak of fe0 kim et al 2011 fan et al 2014 for the aged samples some peaks assigned to iron oxide and iron sulfide appeared indicating the chemical and structural transformation of s nzvi with aging the peaks l and n at 35 and 30 54 56 in the aged s nzvi represent lepidocrocite γ feooh and magnetite maghemite fe3o4 γ fe2o3 respectively dong et al 2018 another major peak m at 22 41 68 represents the existence of ferrous sulfide fes and the minor peaks p and g at 43 and 33 represent pyrite fes2 and greigite fe3s4 respectively he et al 2010 with the increase of aging time the peak of fe0 receded and the peaks of fes fes2 and fe3s4 became obvious even though there was still obvious peak of fe0 in the s nzvi aged for 10 20 d however in the s nzvi aged for 30 d the peak of fe0 disappeared and the peaks of γ feooh and fe3o4 γ fe2o3 increased rapidly the reduction of fe0 content and the accumulation of iron oxides should be the reason for the decreased dechlorination efficiency of the aged s nzvi especially for s nzvi 30d nevertheless although the iron oxides e g γ feooh and fe3o4 γ fe2o3 were accumulated on the surface of s nzvi 30d the dechlorination efficiency of s nzvi 30d still reached a higher level 23 compared with that of fresh prepared nzvi 12 3 this should be attributed to the excellent electron conductivity of fes on the particle surface butler and hayes 2001 3 5 reactivation of aged nzvi by sulfidation in real application nzvi particles are usually synthesized on site during the site remediation to avoid oxidation otherwise the particles can be easily passivated and lose reactivity during long term storage dong et al 2016a liang et al 2014 qin et al 2017 for the aged nzvi previous studies have developed various methods e g acid washing h2 pretreatment ultrasound premagnetization to reactivate its reactivity before the application guan et al 2015 li et al 2015 sun et al 2017 in this study we tried to examine whether the sulfidation with na2s2o4 could reactivate the aged nzvi as shown in fig 8 a the dechlorination of tce by the na2s2o4 reactivated aged nzvi r nzvi were measured and compared with that of fresh s nzvi and fresh nzvi the results show that although the dechlorination efficiency of r nzvi was still not comparable to that of s nzvi but was superior to that of fresh nzvi besides it was found that the aging time of nzvi had limited influence on the reactivation of nzvi by sulfidation the dechlorination efficiency by r nzvi decreased slightly with the increase of aging time of nzvi reaching 23 20 and 19 with aging time of 10 d 20 d and 30 d respectively the results suggest that sulfidation with na2s2o4 could be a feasible way for the reactivation of aged nzvi for the degradation of tce in addition the chemical composition of aged nzvi and r nzvi were further analyzed by xrd fig 8b the xrd pattern of aged nzvi shows the existence of fe0 and small amount of iron oxides a comparison of xrd patterns of nzvi with different aging time indicates that the peak of fe0 became weaker with the increase of aging time when na2s2o4 was added to reactivate the aged nzvi the peaks of ferrous sulfide fes greigite fe3s4 and lepidocrocite γ feooh appeared thus the presence of fes on the surface of r nzvi should contribute to the enhanced dechlorination of tce compared with fresh nzvi however the reactivity of r nzvi was still not as good as s nzvi which should be due to the presence of iron oxides e g γ feooh on the surface of r nzvi and the less content of fe0 4 conclusion in this study we investigated the effects of fe s molar ratio ph dissolved oxygen do and particle aging on tce degradation by s nzvi the following conclusions were made fe s ratio greatly affected the dechlorination efficiency of tce by s nzvi the tce dechlorination efficiency achieved the maximum value at fe s molar ratio of 60 and it decreased at both higher and lower fe s the spectroscopic analysis reveal that the presence of fes formed on the surface of nzvi played a key role in the dechlorination process the increasing solution ph from 5 to 8 significantly increased tce degradation by s nzvi this suggests that s nzvi would be an efficient reagent for the remediation of groundwater with typical ph 8 the presence of do and the aging time of s nzvi had limited effect on tce dechlorination efficiency the results reveal that the presence of fes layer could be able to alleviate the surface passivation of nzvi caused by corrosion prolonging the lifetime of s nzvi the feasibility of reactivation of the aged nzvi by sulfidation treatment was examined it was found the reactivated nzvi even had higher reactivity than the fresh nzvi xrd analysis shows that fes was generated on the surface of the aged nzvi after sulfidation which should contribute to the improved reactivity this reveals that sulfidation treatment could be a feasible way for the reactivation of aged nzvi acknowledgements this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51409100 51521006 the fundamental research funds

19663,considering the increasing identification of trace organic contaminants in natural aquatic environments the removal of trace organic contaminants from water or wastewater discharge is an urgent task ultraviolet uv and uv based advanced oxidation processes aops such as uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 uv free chlorine and uv persulfate are attractive and promising approaches for the removal of these contaminants due to the high reactivity of active radical species produced in these uv aops with a wide variety of organic contaminants however the removal efficiency of trace contaminants is greatly affected by the presence of background dissolved organic matter dom in this study we use ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to evaluate the transformation of a standard suwanee river fulvic acid dom isolate in uv photolysis and uv aops the use of probe compounds allows for the determination of the steady state concentrations of active radical species in each uv aop the changes in the h c and o c elemental ratios double bond equivalents and the low molecular weight transformation product concentrations of organic acids reveal that different dom transformation patterns are induced by each uv aop by comparison with the known reactivities of each radical species with specific organic compounds we mechanistically and systematically elucidate the molecular level dom transformation pathways induced by hydroxyl chlorine and sulfate radicals in uv aops we find that there is a distinct transformation in the aliphatic components of dom due to ho in uv h2o2 and uv free chlorine cl induced transformation of olefinic species is also observed in the uv free chlorine system transformation of aromatic and olefinic moieties by so4 are the predominant pathways in the uv persulfate system graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved organic matter uv h2o2 uv free chlorine uv persulfate active radical species ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry 1 introduction prior studies have uncovered an alarmingly wide range of trace organic contaminants in natural waterbodies kolpin et al 2002 richardson 2008 actual effluent data from wastewater utilities have shown that conventional treatment technologies are not able to effectively remove trace organic contaminants heidler and halden 2008 westerhoff et al 2005 yoon et al 2006 the presence of these organic contaminants continues to raise public concern over the uncertain toxicological risks to human health and ecosystems posed by these contaminants hayes et al 2010 the lack of a holistic management approach to understand and mitigate their potential harmful side effects further heightens this concern national research council 1999a b advanced oxidation processes aops that produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals ho chlorine radicals cl and sulfate radicals so4 produced under ultraviolet uv light i e uv h2o2 uv free chlorine and uv persulfate at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure are attractive and promising technologies that can destroy many trace organic contaminants in water glaze et al 1987 glaze and kang 1989 although many advanced physical chemical treatment processes e g membrane adsorption ion exchange and air stripping only transfer the fate of contaminants from one phase to another aops can mineralize contaminants if appropriately designed factors affecting the destruction of target organic contaminants in aops include the presence of background dissolved organic matter dom inorganic water constituents such as iron and manganese alkalinity and ph li et al 2008 keen et al 2014 among these factors background dom considerably reduces the removal efficiency of target contaminants because of the high carbon concentration of background dom if not removed prior to the aop dom scavenges active radical species and interacts with photons from uv light furthermore the removal efficiency of target contaminants varies with different aops for example the ho induced degradation of 2 methylisoborneol example of an aliphatic contaminant and geosmin example of an aromatic contaminant were more strongly impeded than the so4 induced degradation of these contaminants due to the scavenging effects of background natural organic matter nom in the uv persulfate system this is attributed to the greater scavenging of ho by nom than the scavenging of so4 xie et al 2015 an interference of matrix nom in the decay of azathioprine model aromatic contaminant was reported to be stronger in the uv h2o2 system than in the uv persulfate system which was ascribed to the higher scavenging of ho by nom zhang et al 2016 nom was found to compete with the decay of carbamazepine model aromatic contaminant by scavenging both ho and cl in the uv free chlorine system zhou et al 2016 in general the scavenging effect of background dom is based on the overall reactivity with active radical species with a second order reaction rate constant k and the interaction with photons is based on the molar absorptivity while many studies have investigated the reactivity of ho with site specific dom westerhoff et al 2007 little is known about the radical induced fate of dom because the heterogeneous complex mixture of dom causes numerous reactions the dom structures are transformed by direct uv photolysis and reactions with active radicals although the total dissolved organic carbon doc concentration does not considerably change a spectral index such as uv254 and fluorescence spectra have confirmed the transformation of dom during aops sarathy and mohseni 2007 ho induced dom transformation produces small molecular weight organic compounds such as aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids bolton and cater 1994 westerhoff et al 2009 and the final products include formic acids acetic acids and oxalic acids historically the characterization of dom by fractionation and nmr spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry did not provide molecular level understanding of the fate of dom fichot and benner 2012 with recent advancements of analytical instrumentation e g ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry a molecular level analysis of the elemental composition of dom has become feasible koch and dittmar 2006 kujawinski et al 2004 van krevelen diagrams are often generated to represent the h c o c and n c elemental ratios of the dom molecular formulas which allows one to separate and visualize the distribution of similar dom classes van krevelen 1950 while numerous studies have used ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry such as ft icr ms or orbitrap ms to characterize various types of dom in natural aquatic environments and engineered water treatment systems makarov et al 2006 cortés francisco and caixach 2013 gonsior et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 various active radical induced dom transformations in aops have not yet been investigated ho cl and so4 are hypothesized to transform dom in different patterns because of their different apparent overall reactivities with surrogate dom and specific organic compounds with different functional groups thus the observed transformation products would vary for example the k values for the reactions of ho and so4 with dom were reported as 1 39 0 16 108 m 1 s 1 westerhoff et al 2007 and 8 16 0 3 107 m 1 s 1 lutze et al 2015 respectively the k values for the reactions of ho with aliphatic compounds range from 108 m 1 s 1 to 109 m 1 s 1 via hydrogen atom h abstraction from a c h bond and those for ho addition to a c c double bond are approximately 109 m 1 s 1 cl undergoes single electron transfer set with oxygenated functional groups i e k 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 does not show higher reactivity with aliphatic compounds i e k 109 m 1 s 1 see supplementary material sm figs s1 s4 revealing the transformations of the elemental compositions in complex mixtures of dom will advance our understandings of unique radical reactivity and the subsequent molecular level reaction pathways furthermore understanding the dynamic effect of dom will help predict the degradation of a wide variety of organic contaminants provide insight into the fate of dom and aid in engineering preliminary designs of uv based aops for water and wastewater treatment applications in this proof of concept study we use standard suwanee river fulvic acid srfa as a test dom isolate to study the molecular level

with a 30 w low pressure uv lamp emitting at 254 nm atlantic uv was used to study the transformation of dom a quartz immersion well was used to circulate tap water to maintain the lamp surface temperature during photolysis the experimental solution was contained in a 1 8 l quartz roller bottle photoreactor open to the atmosphere the photoreactor was exposed to uv light and operated under completely mixed conditions as was confirmed see sm the solution temperature was maintained at 20 c by circulating temperature controlled tap water in a water bath the overall light intensity of the

concentrations of active radical species in order to provide their quantitative contributions to the reaction rates with dom then we will discuss the mechanistic dom transformation caused by these species in the subsequent sections in our uv photolysis the steady state concentrations of triplet state of dom 3dom and 1o2 were determined to be 5 0 10 14 m and 1 67 10 12 m respectively which are consistent with the values reported in the literature lutze et al 2015 although ho is also generated through hydrogen extraction from water by 3dom lester et al 2013 the ho concentration is negligible compared to the 1o2 concentration as the generation of 1o2 via the reaction of 3dom with dissolved oxygen in aqueous solution is preferred over the production of ho from 3dom schwarzenbach et al 2016 despite the lower 3dom concentration compared to the 1o2 concentration in the uv photolysis system the faster reactivity of 3dom with dom i e k 1 3 3 85 107 mc 1s 1 wenk et al 2013 relative to the reactivity of 1o2 with dom i e k 2 6 105 mc 1s 1 cory et al 2008 renders the role of 3dom in the dom transformation significant the ho concentration was determined to be 6 0 10 14 m in the uv h2o2 system in the uv free chlorine system the ho concentration was found to be 2 81 10 14 m which is an order of magnitude higher than the cl concentration of 4 39 10 15 m in the same uv free chlorine system to the best of our knowledge experimentally determined k values for the reactivity of cl with dom have not been reported but fang et al 2014 estimated k 1 56 108 mc 1 s 1 for the reaction of cl with natural organic matter nom from a steady state ho concentration analysis using this value the overall reactivity of ho k 1 39 4 53 108 mc 1s 1 keen et al 2014 and the reactivity of cl with dom are almost identical but the reaction rate of ho dominates due to the higher steady state ho concentration in the uv free chlorine aop in the uv persulfate system the ho concentration was determined to be 3 12 10 14 m and the so4 concentration was determined to be 1 38 10 13 m the reaction rate constant of ho with dom is an order of magnitude higher than that of so4 with dom i e k 8 16 0 3 107 mc 1s 1 zhang et al 2012 however the contribution of the reaction rate of so4 is comparable to ho due to the higher steady state so4 concentration in the uv persulfate system 3 2 characterization of the transformed elemental compositions 3 2 1 oxygen to carbon o c and hydrogen to carbon h c atomic ratios in this study the observed o c and h c ratios of standard srfa sm figs s5 s8 prior to uv photolysis and the uv aops were similar to those reported by many previous studies in the literature remucal et al 2012 stenson et al 2003 the distribution of o c ratios indicates the different degrees of oxidation similarly the distribution of h c ratios indicates the different degrees of saturation aromaticity while the o c and h c ratios did not considerably change over various energy consumptions during uv photolysis sm fig s5 these ratios displayed different patterns in the uv aops sm figs s6 s8 indicating different radical induced molecular level dom transformations it is noted that doc in all systems did not considerably change except the uv persulfate system and the uv254 values indicated a slight decrease over energy consumption in uv h2o2 system sm figs s9 s10 fig 1 compares the o c and h c ratios in uv photolysis and the three different uv aops i e uv h2o2 uv persulfate and uv free chlorine at an energy consumption of 0 073 kwh m3 each subgroup of compounds i e condensed aromatic compounds aromatic compounds olefins and aliphatic compounds in fig 1 was determined based on an aromaticity index see sm first the distribution of aliphatic compounds within the range of 0 5 o c 2 and 1 h c 3 0 are greater i e red dots in fig 1 in all the uv aops compared to those of photolysis indicating that increased oxidation and cleavage of unsaturated c c bonds of the aromatic rings and olefins caused the formation of more aliphatic compounds in the uv aops second in uv h2o2 ho is the major oxidant that readily reacts via both by addition to the unsaturated c c double bonds of olefins and aromatic compounds and hydrogen atom h abstraction from the c h bonds of aliphatic compounds the former reactions of ho with individual compounds are close to the diffusion limited rate i e 1 1 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 and the latter reaction of h abstraction has a rate constant of approximately 108 109 m 1s 1 sm fig s1 buxton et al 1988 in contrast the experimentally measured overall reaction rate constants with surrogate dom have been reported as k 1 39 4 53 108 mc 1 s 1 keen et al 2014 which implies that the reactions of ho with aliphatic components via h abstraction in the complex dom mixture are the rate determining steps this unique ho reactivity with surrogate dom is supported by a wider distribution of aliphatic components from dom transformation at 0 073 kwh m3 in uv h2o2 third in the uv free chlorine aop both ho and cl and cl derived radicals such as cl2 and clo are active radical species although the overall reaction rate constant of cl with surrogate dom has not been reported similar reactivity as that of ho in uv h2o2 can be expected based on the reported number of rate constants with individual compounds sm figs s1 and s2 minakata et al 2017 herrmann 2003 with this specific reactivity the h c and o c ratios obtained in uv free chlorine in fig 1 are very similar to those in uv h2o2 and support the reaction rates contributed by both ho and cl based on steady state concentrations one noticeable difference in the h c and o c ratios between the uv h2o2 and uv free chlorine aops is that the olefin groups and some aromatic compounds in uv free chlorine have lower concentrations compared to those in uv h2o2 indicating the presence of additional reactions involving cl cl can react via h abstraction of c h bonds or via set by attacking the o h moieties in oxygen containing organic compounds gilbert et al 1988 additionally cl shows an affinity toward hydrated carbonyl compounds buxton et al 2000 although cl2 resulting from the reaction of cl with cl can be present in the uv free chlorine system the reactivity of cl2 with nom has been reported to be insignificant alegre et al 2000 a more specific reactivity difference between uv h2o2 and uv free chlorine will be discussed in the low molecular weight transformation products section below finally compared to the h c and o c distributions obtained in uv h2o2 and uv free chlorine those in uv persulfate showed distinct differences disappearances of the condensed aromatic component and aromatic compounds these differences clearly indicate the selective reactivity of so4 with aromatic compounds and lower reactivity of so4 with aliphatic compounds sm fig s3 so4 induced reactions can be responsible for aromatic and olefinic transformations via set and the addition to unsaturated carbon carbon bonds of aromatic rings and unsaturated alkenes ye et al 2017 while so4 shows lower reactivity with c h bonds via h abstraction neta et al 1977 the high reactivity of so4 with carboxylic functional groups via decarboxylation provides evidence for the occurrence of aliphatic species in uv persulfate when compared to uv photolysis the higher generation of new compounds and the subsequent wider distributions of h c and o c ratios among the uv aops are corroborated by sm fig s11 3 2 2 double bond equivalents to support the discussion on the different reactivities of various radical species with dom and their transformations described in the previous section we calculated the molecular formula double bond equivalents dbe bae et al 2011 as shown in equation 1 and plotted dbe as a function of the number of carbon atoms in each process at an energy consumption of 0 073 kwh m3 fig 2 1 dbe of 12 c 0 5 of h 0 5 of n 1 where of 12c is the number of isotope carbon 12 dbe are a measure of the number of double bonds and rings to carbon atoms bae et al 2011 here we specifically investigated the transformations of the unsaturated carbon carbon double bonds in the aromatic and olefin components as oxidation progresses thus the dbe values were plotted against the number of carbon atoms associated with the o c ratios conceptually a smaller dbe value indicates less double bonds available from c c or c o groups a smaller number of carbon atoms indicates a smaller molecular weight segment and a larger o c ratio indicates higher degree of oxidation the overall distributions of dbe to carbon were similar in the uv photolysis and uv h2o2 but more oxidation was observed at dbe 15 in uv h2o2 which indicates a greater contribution of ho to components containing more than 20 carbon atoms compared to those containing less than 10 this indicates ho preferably reacts with aliphatic chains of larger molecules in the mixture of dom and causes further oxidation probably because of the ease of accessibility this is important to elucidate the overall reactivity of ho with complex mixtures of dom because previously the smaller size of isolated fraction of dom showed higher reactivity with ho dong et al 2010 interestingly this fragile component of dom was observed to possess between 10 and 20 carbon atoms in uv free chlorine additionally in uv free chlorine the components with dbe greater than 15 and more than 18 carbon atoms disappeared which may result from the higher reactivity of cl with aromatic structures k 1010 m 1 s 1 via set or cl addition than the reactivity of ho with aromatic rings via ho addition k 109 1010 m 1 s 1 alegre et al 2000 a more distinct difference in the dbe to carbon was seen in uv persulfate the so4 induced transformation of aromatic and olefinic species via set occurred and destroyed components comprising more than 20 carbon atoms and dbe values greater than 10 as doc in the uv persulfate system decreased significantly considerable mineralization i e reducing the carbon numbers occurred 3 2 3 mean oxygen to carbon ratios in addition to evaluating the dbe to carbon relationship we evaluated the degree of oxidation in each process by calculating the mean o c ratios for the four elemental groups 1 cho 2 chno 3 chos and 4 chnos to investigate the impact of heterogeneous atoms i e oxygen nitrogen and sulfur atoms on the degree of oxidation fig 3 shows the o c ratios of the four groups in uv photolysis and the uv aops at an energy consumption of 0 073 kwh m3 as previously described a larger o c ratio indicates a higher degree of oxidation higher degrees of oxidation for the cho and chno compound groups relative to the others were observed in the uv h2o2 aop owing to their higher mean o c ratios the possible presence of electron donating functional groups such as ch2 and oh ye et al 2017 in the cho compounds and nox and nhx functional groups in the chno compounds can play a role in the oxidation of the cho and chno compounds by ho in the uv free chlorine aop the chno and chos compounds possess higher mean o c ratios relative to the other groups in particular the uv free chlorine aop showed considerably larger mean o c ratios for the chno and chos groups compared to those of the uv h2o2 aop indicating enhanced reactivity resulting from cl nearly no reaction rate constants have been reported for the reactions of cl with n or s containing compounds however cl reacts with n or s atoms via set and n containing functional groups such as nox and nhx or s containing functional groups such as sulfides asmus 1979 donate electrons to c h bonds and enhance the h abstraction by ho cl the considerably smaller o c ratios for the cho and chno groups in the uv persulfate aop indicates that the majority of these groups contain aliphatic c h chains which is consistent with the substantially lower reactivity of so4 with c h bonds via h abstraction in aliphatic n containing compounds compared to those of ho and cl in contrast the higher o c ratios of the chos and chnos groups indicate a faster reaction of so4 with sulfide functional groups via set remucal et al 2012 ye et al 2017 3 3 low molecular weight transformation products following the initial reactions of ho cl and so4 with dom subsequent complex radical reactions cause dom transformations different reactivities of each active radical species caused different patterns for the dom transformations as discussed in the previous section which may result in the formation of varying transformation products to investigate the final dom transformation products we measured the concentrations of three major carboxylic acids i e acetate oxalate and formate see fig 4 and evaluated the influence of the different reactivities on the product distribution in the given initial ph and change in ph over an energy consumption see sm fig s12 all acids are dissociated and present as anions and oxalic acid is partially dissociated as the pka values of oxalic acid are 1 23 and 4 19 faria et al 2008 we observed a steady increase in the concentrations of all three carboxylic acids in the uv h2o2 aop while uv free chlorine showed a gradual increase in the acetate concentration and a rapid initial increase in the both the oxalate and formate concentrations the uv persulfate aop did not show detectable concentrations of the three acids in the uv h2o2 aop a high degree of oxidation of aliphatic structures likely resulted in the formation of low molecular weight carboxylic acids as transformation products as only a small amount of transformation from aromatic components compared to the considerable amount of transformation from the aliphatic components was observed in figs 1 and 2 the reported rate constants for the reactions of ho with acetate oxalate and formate are 7 3 107 m 1 s 1 chin and wine 1994 4 7 107 m 1 s 1 getoff et al 1971 and 3 2 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 respectively the reaction with acetate occurs via h abstraction from the c h bond of a methyl functional group which follows with an addition of molecular oxygen to produce a peroxyl radical that undergoes uni bimolecular decay to produce an aldehyde ketone and carboxylic acid i e oxalate then the reaction of ho with oxalate produces formate with this transformation and the given reaction rate constants we observed steady increases in all three acid concentrations in uv free chlorine a similar transformation occurs but the rapid increases in the oxalate and formate concentrations seem to result from the higher reactivity of cl with carboxylate compounds via a set reaction of cl with a carboxylate functional group the reported rate constants for the reactions of cl with acetate and formate are 3 7 0 4 109 m 1 s 1 and 4 2 0 5 109 m 1 s 1 respectively buxton et al 2000 because of the difference in reaction mechanisms between ho and cl the cl reactivity with carboxylate is much higher which likely contributes to the rapid increases in the oxalate and formate concentrations in the initial phase the primary oxidation in the uv persulfate system results from the reactions of so4 with aromatic and olefinic structures but the oxidation did not yield small molecular weight organic acids and some mineralization occurred as doc decreased significantly moreover the reactivities of so4 with aliphatic acids and alcohols are lower than those of ho and cl buxton et al 2001 4 conclusions this study highlights the impact of different radical species i e ho cl and so4 generated in uv h2o2 uv free chlorine and uv persulfate aops on background dom the energy consumption of uv aops in this study 0 014 kwh m3 0 073 kwh m3 is within the range of typical energy consumptions of aops in water treatment processes with this energy consumption different dom transformation patterns induced by different radical species indicate the structural transformations of complex dom mixtures depending on the reactivity of a particular active radical species with different organic entities there is a resultant difference in the overall dom transformation while different uv aops can be applied based on the target compounds this study implicates the applicability of different uv aops in the presence of a complex mixture of dom for example the performances of uv h2o2 and uv free chlorine are affected by background dom containing more aliphatic components whereas the uv persulfate aop is more affected by background dom containing more aromatic components which was verified by the transformation of o c and h c elemental ratios and reactivities of each radical with specific organic compounds with this available information and prior analyses of dom components in real water and wastewater the determination of the proper uv aop can be made for application in the real field of course the applications of uv aops for real water or wastewater should be tested which is planned in our ongoing study additionally the impacts of other water constituents such as chloride ions in uv free chlorine and uv persulfate and bromide ions in uv persulfate should be considered in real water applications the effects of these water constituents are also being evaluated under the ongoing study acknowledgements this work was supported by the national science foundation award no

19663,considering the increasing identification of trace organic contaminants in natural aquatic environments the removal of trace organic contaminants from water or wastewater discharge is an urgent task ultraviolet uv and uv based advanced oxidation processes aops such as uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 uv free chlorine and uv persulfate are attractive and promising approaches for the removal of these contaminants due to the high reactivity of active radical species produced in these uv aops with a wide variety of organic contaminants however the removal efficiency of trace contaminants is greatly affected by the presence of background dissolved organic matter dom in this study we use ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry to evaluate the transformation of a standard suwanee river fulvic acid dom isolate in uv photolysis and uv aops the use of probe compounds allows for the determination of the steady state concentrations of active radical species in each uv aop the changes in the h c and o c elemental ratios double bond equivalents and the low molecular weight transformation product concentrations of organic acids reveal that different dom transformation patterns are induced by each uv aop by comparison with the known reactivities of each radical species with specific organic compounds we mechanistically and systematically elucidate the molecular level dom transformation pathways induced by hydroxyl chlorine and sulfate radicals in uv aops we find that there is a distinct transformation in the aliphatic components of dom due to ho in uv h2o2 and uv free chlorine cl induced transformation of olefinic species is also observed in the uv free chlorine system transformation of aromatic and olefinic moieties by so4 are the predominant pathways in the uv persulfate system graphical abstract image 1 keywords dissolved organic matter uv h2o2 uv free chlorine uv persulfate active radical species ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry 1 introduction prior studies have uncovered an alarmingly wide range of trace organic contaminants in natural waterbodies kolpin et al 2002 richardson 2008 actual effluent data from wastewater utilities have shown that conventional treatment technologies are not able to effectively remove trace organic contaminants heidler and halden 2008 westerhoff et al 2005 yoon et al 2006 the presence of these organic contaminants continues to raise public concern over the uncertain toxicological risks to human health and ecosystems posed by these contaminants hayes et al 2010 the lack of a holistic management approach to understand and mitigate their potential harmful side effects further heightens this concern national research council 1999a b advanced oxidation processes aops that produce highly reactive hydroxyl radicals ho chlorine radicals cl and sulfate radicals so4 produced under ultraviolet uv light i e uv h2o2 uv free chlorine and uv persulfate at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure are attractive and promising technologies that can destroy many trace organic contaminants in water glaze et al 1987 glaze and kang 1989 although many advanced physical chemical treatment processes e g membrane adsorption ion exchange and air stripping only transfer the fate of contaminants from one phase to another aops can mineralize contaminants if appropriately designed factors affecting the destruction of target organic contaminants in aops include the presence of background dissolved organic matter dom inorganic water constituents such as iron and manganese alkalinity and ph li et al 2008 keen et al 2014 among these factors background dom considerably reduces the removal efficiency of target contaminants because of the high carbon concentration of background dom if not removed prior to the aop dom scavenges active radical species and interacts with photons from uv light furthermore the removal efficiency of target contaminants varies with different aops for example the ho induced degradation of 2 methylisoborneol example of an aliphatic contaminant and geosmin example of an aromatic contaminant were more strongly impeded than the so4 induced degradation of these contaminants due to the scavenging effects of background natural organic matter nom in the uv persulfate system this is attributed to the greater scavenging of ho by nom than the scavenging of so4 xie et al 2015 an interference of matrix nom in the decay of azathioprine model aromatic contaminant was reported to be stronger in the uv h2o2 system than in the uv persulfate system which was ascribed to the higher scavenging of ho by nom zhang et al 2016 nom was found to compete with the decay of carbamazepine model aromatic contaminant by scavenging both ho and cl in the uv free chlorine system zhou et al 2016 in general the scavenging effect of background dom is based on the overall reactivity with active radical species with a second order reaction rate constant k and the interaction with photons is based on the molar absorptivity while many studies have investigated the reactivity of ho with site specific dom westerhoff et al 2007 little is known about the radical induced fate of dom because the heterogeneous complex mixture of dom causes numerous reactions the dom structures are transformed by direct uv photolysis and reactions with active radicals although the total dissolved organic carbon doc concentration does not considerably change a spectral index such as uv254 and fluorescence spectra have confirmed the transformation of dom during aops sarathy and mohseni 2007 ho induced dom transformation produces small molecular weight organic compounds such as aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids bolton and cater 1994 westerhoff et al 2009 and the final products include formic acids acetic acids and oxalic acids historically the characterization of dom by fractionation and nmr spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry did not provide molecular level understanding of the fate of dom fichot and benner 2012 with recent advancements of analytical instrumentation e g ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry a molecular level analysis of the elemental composition of dom has become feasible koch and dittmar 2006 kujawinski et al 2004 van krevelen diagrams are often generated to represent the h c o c and n c elemental ratios of the dom molecular formulas which allows one to separate and visualize the distribution of similar dom classes van krevelen 1950 while numerous studies have used ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry such as ft icr ms or orbitrap ms to characterize various types of dom in natural aquatic environments and engineered water treatment systems makarov et al 2006 cortés francisco and caixach 2013 gonsior et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 various active radical induced dom transformations in aops have not yet been investigated ho cl and so4 are hypothesized to transform dom in different patterns because of their different apparent overall reactivities with surrogate dom and specific organic compounds with different functional groups thus the observed transformation products would vary for example the k values for the reactions of ho and so4 with dom were reported as 1 39 0 16 108 m 1 s 1 westerhoff et al 2007 and 8 16 0 3 107 m 1 s 1 lutze et al 2015 respectively the k values for the reactions of ho with aliphatic compounds range from 108 m 1 s 1 to 109 m 1 s 1 via hydrogen atom h abstraction from a c h bond and those for ho addition to a c c double bond are approximately 109 m 1 s 1 cl undergoes single electron transfer set with oxygenated functional groups i e k 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 does not show higher reactivity with aliphatic compounds i e k 109 m 1 s 1 see supplementary material sm figs s1 s4 revealing the transformations of the elemental compositions in complex mixtures of dom will advance our understandings of unique radical reactivity and the subsequent molecular level reaction pathways furthermore understanding the dynamic effect of dom will help predict the degradation of a wide variety of organic contaminants provide insight into the fate of dom and aid in engineering preliminary designs of uv based aops for water and wastewater treatment applications in this proof of concept study we use standard suwanee river fulvic acid srfa as a test dom isolate to study the molecular level transformation induced by photolysis alone and ho cl and so4 in uv based aops such as uv h2o2 uv free chlorine and uv persulfate using probe compounds we measure the steady state concentration of each active radical species the dom transformations are analyzed using an ultrahigh resolution orbitrap elite mass spectrometer to investigate the changes in elemental composition and double bond equivalents we also measure the concentrations of low molecular weight carboxylic acids as final transformation products 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemicals are used at acs grade

with a 30 w low pressure uv lamp emitting at 254 nm atlantic uv was used to study the transformation of dom a quartz immersion well was used to circulate tap water to maintain the lamp surface temperature during photolysis the experimental solution was contained in a 1 8 l quartz roller bottle photoreactor open to the atmosphere the photoreactor was exposed to uv light and operated under completely mixed conditions as was confirmed see sm the solution temperature was maintained at 20 c by circulating temperature controlled tap water in a water bath the overall light intensity of the uv lamp was measured to be 4 13 10 8 e l s using the ferroactinometry procedure described by parker 1953 a 10 mg c l srfa solution was used as a model dom isolate for the experimental solutions in the uv photolysis uv h2o2 uv free chlorine and uv persulfate systems in the uv h2o2 system 13 9 mg l 0 41 mm h2o2 was added to the experimental solution in the uv free chlorine system sodium hypochlorite

was withdrawn prior to uv light exposure i e at time 0 served as the control sample sample solutions were stored at 4 c until further analysis all chemical analyses were completed within 24 h of the experiments the solution ph was not controlled as inorganic phosphorus buffering systems interfere with the subsequent mass spectrometry analysis however the ph was monitored during the experiments the initial ph values in the uv photolysis uv h2o2 uv free chlorine and uv persulfate systems were 5 1 3 5 6 2 and 4 6 respectively dissolved oxygen was measured to be 7 8 mg l in all experiments the energy consumption kwh m3 was calculated based on the light intensity einstein l s and reaction time see sm 2 3 analytical methods the chemical oxidants and dom elemental compositions were measured using ultrahigh resolution orbitrap elite mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray esi source samples were infused at 5 μl min into esi source in negative ion mode full ms scans were recorded

gas flow rate of 20 arb auxiliary gas flow rate of 5 arb spray voltage of 2 40 kv capillary temperature of 280 c and the esi probe was at position b prior to mass analysis the orbitrap ms was externally calibrated in negative mode using the thermo calibration mixture the resulting mass accuracy was better than 2 ppm molecular formulas for the mass spectral data of dom were assigned using the sierra analytics composer64 software and r studio see sm the probe compounds were measured using ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography low molecular weight organic acids such as acetate oxalate and formate were measured using ion chromatography the detailed measurement procedures are given in the sm 3 results and discussion 3 1 steady state concentrations of active radical species steady state concentration of each active radical species is determined by the concentration of probe compounds see the sm for the procedure to determine the steady state radical concentrations steady state concentrations of active radical species provide insight into the extent to which particular active radical species can contribute toward dom transformation we first report the steady state concentrations of active radical species in order to provide their quantitative contributions to the reaction rates with dom then we will discuss the mechanistic dom transformation caused by these species in the subsequent sections in our uv photolysis the steady state concentrations of triplet state of dom 3dom and 1o2 were determined to be 5 0 10 14 m and 1 67 10 12 m respectively which are consistent with the values reported in the literature lutze et al 2015 although ho is also generated through hydrogen extraction from water by 3dom lester et al 2013 the ho concentration is negligible compared to the 1o2 concentration as the generation of 1o2 via the reaction of 3dom with dissolved oxygen in aqueous solution is preferred over the production of ho from 3dom schwarzenbach et al 2016 despite the lower 3dom concentration compared to the 1o2 concentration in the uv photolysis system the faster reactivity of 3dom with dom i e k 1 3 3 85 107 mc 1s 1 wenk et al 2013 relative to the reactivity of 1o2 with dom i e k 2 6 105 mc 1s 1 cory et al 2008 renders the role of 3dom in the dom transformation significant the ho concentration was determined to be 6 0 10 14 m in the uv h2o2 system in the uv free chlorine system the ho concentration was found to be 2 81 10 14 m which is an order of magnitude higher than the cl concentration of 4 39 10 15 m in the same uv free chlorine system to the best of our knowledge experimentally determined k values for the reactivity of cl with dom have not been reported but fang et al 2014 estimated k 1 56 108 mc 1 s 1 for the reaction of cl with natural organic matter nom from a steady state ho concentration analysis using this value the overall reactivity of ho k 1 39 4 53 108 mc 1s 1 keen et al 2014 and the reactivity of cl with dom are almost identical but the reaction rate of ho dominates due to the higher steady state ho concentration in the uv free chlorine aop in the uv persulfate system the ho concentration was determined to be 3 12 10 14 m and the so4 concentration was determined to be 1 38 10 13 m the reaction rate constant of ho with dom is an order of magnitude higher than that of so4 with dom i e k 8 16 0 3 107 mc 1s 1 zhang et al 2012 however the contribution of the reaction rate of so4 is comparable to ho due to the higher steady state so4 concentration in the uv persulfate system 3 2 characterization of the transformed elemental compositions 3 2 1 oxygen to carbon o c and hydrogen to carbon h c atomic ratios in this study the observed o c and h c ratios of standard srfa sm figs s5 s8 prior to uv photolysis and the uv aops were similar to those reported by many previous studies in the literature remucal et al 2012 stenson et al 2003 the distribution of o c ratios indicates the different degrees of oxidation similarly the distribution of h c ratios indicates the different degrees of saturation aromaticity while the o c and h c ratios did not considerably change over various energy consumptions during uv photolysis sm fig s5 these ratios displayed different patterns in the uv aops sm figs s6 s8 indicating different radical induced molecular level dom transformations it is noted that doc in all systems did not considerably change except the uv persulfate system and the uv254 values indicated a slight decrease over energy consumption in uv h2o2 system sm figs s9 s10 fig 1 compares the o c and h c ratios in uv photolysis and the three different uv aops i e uv h2o2 uv persulfate and uv free chlorine at an energy consumption of 0 073 kwh m3 each subgroup of compounds i e condensed aromatic compounds aromatic compounds olefins and aliphatic compounds in fig 1 was determined based on an aromaticity index see sm first the distribution of aliphatic compounds within the range of 0 5 o c 2 and 1 h c 3 0 are greater i e red dots in fig 1 in all the uv aops compared to those of photolysis indicating that increased oxidation and cleavage of unsaturated c c bonds of the aromatic rings and olefins caused the formation of more aliphatic compounds in the uv aops second in uv h2o2 ho is the major oxidant that readily reacts via both by addition to the unsaturated c c double bonds of olefins and aromatic compounds and hydrogen atom h abstraction from the c h bonds of aliphatic compounds the former reactions of ho with individual compounds are close to the diffusion limited rate i e 1 1 1 2 1010 m 1 s 1 and the latter reaction of h abstraction has a rate constant of approximately 108 109 m 1s 1 sm fig s1 buxton et al 1988 in contrast the experimentally measured overall reaction rate constants with surrogate dom have been reported as k 1 39 4 53 108 mc 1 s 1 keen et al 2014 which implies that the reactions of ho with aliphatic components via h abstraction in the complex dom mixture are the rate determining steps this unique ho reactivity with surrogate dom is supported by a wider distribution of aliphatic components from dom transformation at 0 073 kwh m3 in uv h2o2 third in the uv free chlorine aop both ho and cl and cl derived radicals such as cl2 and clo are active radical species although the overall reaction rate constant of cl with surrogate dom has not been reported similar reactivity as that of ho in uv h2o2 can be expected based on the reported number of rate constants with individual compounds sm figs s1 and s2 minakata et al 2017 herrmann 2003 with this specific reactivity the h c and o c ratios obtained in uv free chlorine in fig 1 are very similar to those in uv h2o2 and support the reaction rates contributed by both ho and cl based on steady state concentrations one noticeable difference in the h c and o c ratios between the uv h2o2 and uv free chlorine aops is that the olefin groups and some aromatic compounds in uv free chlorine have lower concentrations compared to those in uv h2o2 indicating the presence of additional reactions involving cl cl can react via h abstraction of c h bonds or via set by attacking the o h moieties in oxygen containing organic compounds gilbert et al 1988 additionally cl shows an affinity toward hydrated carbonyl compounds buxton et al 2000 although cl2 resulting from the reaction of cl with cl can be present in the uv free chlorine system the reactivity of cl2 with nom has been reported to be insignificant alegre et al 2000 a more specific reactivity difference between uv h2o2 and uv free chlorine will be discussed in the low molecular weight transformation products section below finally compared to the h c and o c distributions obtained in uv h2o2 and uv free chlorine those in uv persulfate showed distinct differences disappearances of the condensed aromatic component and aromatic compounds these differences clearly indicate the selective reactivity of so4 with aromatic compounds and lower reactivity of so4 with aliphatic compounds sm fig s3 so4 induced reactions can be responsible for aromatic and olefinic transformations via set and the addition to unsaturated carbon carbon bonds of aromatic rings and unsaturated alkenes ye et al 2017 while so4 shows lower reactivity with c h bonds via h abstraction neta et al 1977 the high reactivity of so4 with carboxylic functional groups via decarboxylation provides evidence for the occurrence of aliphatic species in uv persulfate when compared to uv photolysis the higher generation of new compounds and the subsequent wider distributions of h c and o c ratios among the uv aops are corroborated by sm fig s11 3 2 2 double bond equivalents to support the discussion on the different reactivities of various radical species with dom and their transformations described in the previous section we calculated the molecular formula double bond equivalents dbe bae et al 2011 as shown in equation 1 and plotted dbe as a function of the number of carbon atoms in each process at an energy consumption of 0 073 kwh m3 fig 2 1 dbe of 12 c 0 5 of h 0 5 of n 1 where of 12c is the number of isotope carbon 12 dbe are a measure of the number of double bonds and rings to carbon atoms bae et al 2011 here we specifically investigated the transformations of the unsaturated carbon carbon double bonds in the aromatic and olefin components as oxidation progresses thus the dbe values were plotted against the number of carbon atoms associated with the o c ratios conceptually a smaller dbe value indicates less double bonds available from c c or c o groups a smaller number of carbon atoms indicates a smaller molecular weight segment and a larger o c ratio indicates higher degree of oxidation the overall distributions of dbe to carbon were similar in the uv photolysis and uv h2o2 but more oxidation was observed at dbe 15 in uv h2o2 which indicates a greater contribution of ho to components containing more than 20 carbon atoms compared to those containing less than 10 this indicates ho preferably reacts with aliphatic chains of larger molecules in the mixture of dom and causes further oxidation probably because of the ease of accessibility this is important to elucidate the overall reactivity of ho with complex mixtures of dom because previously the smaller size of isolated fraction of dom showed higher reactivity with ho dong et al 2010 interestingly this fragile component of dom was observed to possess between 10 and 20 carbon atoms in uv free chlorine additionally in uv free chlorine the components with dbe greater than 15 and more than 18 carbon atoms disappeared which may result from the higher reactivity of cl with aromatic structures k 1010 m 1 s 1 via set or cl addition than the reactivity of ho with aromatic rings via ho addition k 109 1010 m 1 s 1 alegre et al 2000 a more distinct difference in the dbe to carbon was seen in uv persulfate the so4 induced transformation of aromatic and olefinic species via set occurred and destroyed components comprising more than 20 carbon atoms and dbe values greater than 10 as doc in the uv persulfate system decreased significantly considerable mineralization i e reducing the carbon numbers occurred 3 2 3 mean oxygen to carbon ratios in addition to evaluating the dbe to carbon relationship we evaluated the degree of oxidation in each process by calculating the mean o c ratios for the four elemental groups 1 cho 2 chno 3 chos and 4 chnos to investigate the impact of heterogeneous atoms i e oxygen nitrogen and sulfur atoms on the degree of oxidation fig 3 shows the o c ratios of the four groups in uv photolysis and the uv aops at an energy consumption of 0 073 kwh m3 as previously described a larger o c ratio indicates a higher degree of oxidation higher degrees of oxidation for the cho and chno compound groups relative to the others were observed in the uv h2o2 aop owing to their higher mean o c ratios the possible presence of electron donating functional groups such as ch2 and oh ye et al 2017 in the cho compounds and nox and nhx functional groups in the chno compounds can play a role in the oxidation of the cho and chno compounds by ho in the uv free chlorine aop the chno and chos compounds possess higher mean o c ratios relative to the other groups in particular the uv free chlorine aop showed considerably larger mean o c ratios for the chno and chos groups compared to those of the uv h2o2 aop indicating enhanced reactivity resulting from cl nearly no reaction rate constants have been reported for the reactions of cl with n or s containing compounds however cl reacts with n or s atoms via set and n containing functional groups such as nox and nhx or s containing functional groups such as sulfides asmus 1979 donate electrons to c h bonds and enhance the h abstraction by ho cl the considerably smaller o c ratios for the cho and chno groups in the uv persulfate aop indicates that the majority of these groups contain aliphatic c h chains which is consistent with the substantially lower reactivity of so4 with c h bonds via h abstraction in aliphatic n containing compounds compared to those of ho and cl in contrast the higher o c ratios of the chos and chnos groups indicate a faster reaction of so4 with sulfide functional groups via set remucal et al 2012 ye et al 2017 3 3 low molecular weight transformation products following the initial reactions of ho cl and so4 with dom subsequent complex radical reactions cause dom transformations different reactivities of each active radical species caused different patterns for the dom transformations as discussed in the previous section which may result in the formation of varying transformation products to investigate the final dom transformation products we measured the concentrations of three major carboxylic acids i e acetate oxalate and formate see fig 4 and evaluated the influence of the different reactivities on the product distribution in the given initial ph and change in ph over an energy consumption see sm fig s12 all acids are dissociated and present as anions and oxalic acid is partially dissociated as the pka values of oxalic acid are 1 23 and 4 19 faria et al 2008 we observed a steady increase in the concentrations of all three carboxylic acids in the uv h2o2 aop while uv free chlorine showed a gradual increase in the acetate concentration and a rapid initial increase in the both the oxalate and formate concentrations the uv persulfate aop did not show detectable concentrations of the three acids in the uv h2o2 aop a high degree of oxidation of aliphatic structures likely resulted in the formation of low molecular weight carboxylic acids as transformation products as only a small amount of transformation from aromatic components compared to the considerable amount of transformation from the aliphatic components was observed in figs 1 and 2 the reported rate constants for the reactions of ho with acetate oxalate and formate are 7 3 107 m 1 s 1 chin and wine 1994 4 7 107 m 1 s 1 getoff et al 1971 and 3 2 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 respectively the reaction with acetate occurs via h abstraction from the c h bond of a methyl functional group which follows with an addition of molecular oxygen to produce a peroxyl radical that undergoes uni bimolecular decay to produce an aldehyde ketone and carboxylic acid i e oxalate then the reaction of ho with oxalate produces formate with this transformation and the given reaction rate constants we observed steady increases in all three acid concentrations in uv free chlorine a similar transformation occurs but the rapid increases in the oxalate and formate concentrations seem to result from the higher reactivity of cl with carboxylate compounds via a set reaction of cl with a carboxylate functional group the reported rate constants for the reactions of cl with acetate and formate are 3 7 0 4 109 m 1 s 1 and 4 2 0 5 109 m 1 s 1 respectively buxton et al 2000 because of the difference in reaction mechanisms between ho and cl the cl reactivity with carboxylate is much higher which likely contributes to the rapid increases in the oxalate and formate concentrations in the initial phase the primary oxidation in the uv persulfate system results from the reactions of so4 with aromatic and olefinic structures but the oxidation did not yield small molecular weight organic acids and some mineralization occurred as doc decreased significantly moreover the reactivities of so4 with aliphatic acids and alcohols are lower than those of ho and cl buxton et al 2001 4 conclusions this study highlights the impact of different radical species i e ho cl and so4 generated in uv h2o2 uv free chlorine and uv persulfate aops on background dom the energy consumption of uv aops in this study 0 014 kwh m3 0 073 kwh m3 is within the range of typical energy consumptions of aops in water treatment processes with this energy consumption different dom transformation patterns induced by different radical species indicate the structural transformations of complex dom mixtures depending on the reactivity of a particular active radical species with different organic entities there is a resultant difference in the overall dom transformation while different uv aops can be applied based on the target compounds this study implicates the applicability of different uv aops in the presence of a complex mixture of dom for example the performances of uv h2o2 and uv free chlorine are affected by background dom containing more aliphatic components whereas the uv persulfate aop is more affected by background dom containing more aromatic components which was verified by the transformation of o c and h c elemental ratios and reactivities of each radical with specific organic compounds with this available information and prior analyses of dom components in real water and wastewater the determination of the proper uv aop can be made for application in the real field of course the applications of uv aops for real water or wastewater should be tested which is planned in our ongoing study additionally the impacts of other water constituents such as chloride ions in uv free chlorine and uv persulfate and bromide ions in uv persulfate should be considered in real water applications the effects of these water constituents are also being evaluated under the ongoing study acknowledgements this work was supported by the national science foundation award no

19664,phenol recovery from phenol laden saline wastewater plays an important role in the waste reclamation and pollution control a membrane aromatic recovery system like membrane contactor mars like membrane contactor was set up in this study using electrospun polydimethylsiloxane polymethyl methacrylate pdms pmma membrane with 0 0048 m2 effective area to separate phenol from saline wastewater phenol and water contact angles of 0 and 162 were achieved on this membrane surface simultaneously indicating its potential in the separation of phenol and water soluble salt feed solution 500 ml of 0 90 l h and receiving solution 500 ml of 1 26 l h were investigated to be the optimum conditions for phenol separation which corresponds to the employed reynolds number of 14 6 and 20 5 during 108 h continuous separation for feed solution 2 0 g l phenol 10 0 g l nacl under room temperature 20 c 42 6 of phenol was recycled in receiving solution with a salt rejection of 99 95 meanwhile the mean phenol mass transfer coefficient k ov was 6 7 10 7 m s 1 as a membrane based process though the permeated phenol increased with the increase of phenol concentration in feed solution the phenol recovery ratio was determined by the membrane properties rather than the pollutant concentrations phenol was found to permeate this membrane via adsorption diffusion and desorption and therefore the membrane fouling generated from pore blockage in other membrane separation processes was totally avoided graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane contactor pdms electrospun membrane phenol separation mass transfer 1 introduction saline industrial wastewaters are widely generated in various kinds of industries including petroleum refining coal processing pharmaceutical manufacturing food processing leather production etc with high concentrations of refractory organic compounds lefebvre and moletta 2006 as a typical organic contaminant phenol is frequently found in these saline industrial wastewaters to form phenol laden saline wastewaters which are rich in both phenol and salt moussavi et al 2010 for instance the wastewaters from petroleum refining coal processing and resin production contain high concentrations of phenol 2 8 10 000 mg l bayram 2004 gonzález et al 2001 phenol has been regarded as one of priority hazardous organic pollutants which emphasizes the toxicity and corresponding adverse effects of phenol laden saline wastewaters on soil water groundwater and organisms even ecosystem juang et al 2009 as an important and essential raw material in various industries senthilvelan et al 2014 the separation of phenol from saline wastewaters would result in significant economic value and environmental value the main methods for phenol separation are solvent extraction activated carbon adsorption and pervaporation caetano et al 2009 víctor ortega et al 2016a 2016b however there are the requirements of re treatment for removing dissolved polar solvents solvent extraction elution of phenols from the loaded carbons activated carbon adsorption and high standard operation apparatus and demands pervaporation making these methods partly limited in the applications of phenol separation as a novel membrane based process for phenol separation membrane aromatic recovery system mars is preferred to the above technologies based on its low cost and high efficiency han et al 2001 ferreira et al 2002a dastgir et al 2005a dastgir et al 2005b daisley et al 2006 a high organic permeable membrane mainly non porous membranes divides mars into wastewater side and stripping solution side firstly organic phenol transports across the selective permeable membrane into stripping solution naoh and be converted into phenolate while the inorganic salt could not transport the membrane then acid hcl is added into the collected stripping solution to convert phenolate into phenol as a result the separation and recovery of phenol from saline wastewater were achieved the first attempt of mars for phenol separation was conducted by han et al in 2001 using silicon rubber tube contains 70 pdms as selective permeable membrane in a 1 5 l lab scale system han et al 2001 over 94 phenol was recovered from 10 0 g l phenol wastewater with a purity of 86 5 wt after 40 days operation han et al 2001 novel membranes were also investigated in mars process to improve the mass transfer of phenol composite pdms pvdf polyvinylidene fluoride membrane was prepared by coating pdms on the surface of commercial pvdf membrane and the effects of wastewater concentration flow rate and temperature on mass transfer were investigated xiao et al 2013 the obtained k ov for phenol pertraction was increased to 8 7 10 7 m s 1 from 1 0 to 3 5 10 7 m s 1 for silicon rubber tubes xiao et al 2013 supported liquid membranes slm also attracted attention in mars which was prepared by filling the pores of flat microporous polypropylene pp membrane with polypropylene glycol ppg after γ radiation dastgir et al 2005c the generated slm exhibited high phenol mass transfer coefficient of 2 7 10 6 m s 1 unfortunately water permeation was also observed during phenol permeation indicating this membrane was unsuitable for phenol separation from saline wastewater generally speaking the employed membranes for mars were still suffered from the low mass transfer coefficient and low chemical resistance to stripping solution xiao et al 2013 therefore a more proper membrane is desired for the wider application of mars electrospinning has gained increasing appeal as a fibrous membrane fabrication method that produces nano to sub micron scale fibers from polymer solution under repulsive electric force ahmed et al 2015 nuraje et al 2013 in electric field a conical shape of solution is formed at the tip of needle being loaded with polymer solution and is named as taylor cone when the produced electric force overcomes the surface tension force of polymer solution continuous fine charged jet would be ejected from the tip of taylor cone then the solvent gradually evaporates in air during jet travel to collector remaining the randomly arranged polymer fibers finally continuous formed fibers are collected to fabricate a non woven fabric membrane ahmed et al 2015 nuraje et al 2013 as a solution based process the property of electrospinning solution decides the property of electrospun membrane as an elastomeric and hydrophobic polymer pdms is suitable to electrospin superhydrophobic membrane due to the insufficient chain entanglements of pdms poly methyl methacrylate pmma is usually added as carrier polymer during electrospinning ren et al 2017 electrospun pdms pmma membrane exhibits several attractive attributes such as high hydrophobicity organophilicity controllable pore size interconnected pore structure high porosity and high specific surface area ren et al 2017 the backbone of si o in pdms gives it high flexibility for phenol adsorption and permeation chang et al 2012 phenol also could be adsorbed by pmma via the formation of hydrogen bond for subsequent separation al muhtaseb et al 2011 when the high phenol mass transfer coefficient is achieved the use of stripping solution could be avoided as a result the lengthened membrane service life simplified operation and lower cost are achieved however no relevant work has been published on the employment of porous electrospun pdms pmma membrane for phenol separation in this study a mars like membrane contactor was set up using porous electrospun pdms pmma membrane hydrophobicity and organophilicity of membrane were investigated to analyze the mechanisms of phenol separation phenol permeation and salt rejection different operation parameters phenol and salt concentrations were used to investigate their effects on phenol separation from phenol laden saline wastewater long term phenol separation was operated under optimized condition to calculate the phenol mass transfer coefficient and evaluate the membrane stability to the best of our knowledge all these attempts are firstly applied in mars like membrane contactor for phenol separation 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane fabrication pdms sylgard 184 mw 60 000 g mol and pmma 182265 mw 996 000 g mol were purchased from dow corning and sigma aldrich respectively n n dimethylformamide dmf and tetrahydrofuran thf were purchased from sinopharm all chemicals were used as received otherwise being noted pmma was firstly dissolved in binary thf and dmf to prepare pmma solution 10 0 wt by stirring at 300 rpm 50 c then pdms pmma dope solution was prepared by dissolving pdms 10 0 wt and curing agent 1 0 wt by stirring prepared dope solution was loaded into a syringe with spinneret of 0 6 mm inner diameter the subsequent electrospinning process was carried out at a voltage difference of 11 5 kv positive 10 5 kv negative 1 kv with a distance of 16 cm between the needle tip and the collector the membrane was fabricated at feeding speed of 1 0 ml h for 500 min resultant electrospun pdms pmma membranes were heated at 60 c for 0 5 h more detailed information was provided in our previous study ren et al 2017 2 2 membrane characterization the morphology of electrospun pdms pmma membrane was observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem nanosem 450 fei with prior gold coating and the element distribution on membrane was characterized by corresponding energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds chemical composition on membrane surface was verified by a x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps kratos axis ultradld spectrometer shimadzu kratos using al kα 1486 6 ev as monochromatic phonon source under an electron take off angle of 90 c relative to the membrane sample infrared absorption was observed by a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir spectrum 100 perkin elmer in 3500 500 cm 1 wavenumber with 0 4 cm 1 resolution membrane pore size was measured by bubble point pressure method on a pore size analyzer 3h2000 pb beishide brunauer emmett teller bet surface area was conducted by n2 physisorption at 195 850 c in an accelerated surface area and porosimetry system asap 2640 micromeritics thermal stability was performed on a thermogravimetric analyzer pyris 1 tga from 25 c room temperature to 800 c at a heating rate of 10 c min under n2 flow surface roughness of membrane was detected using a 3d automatic optical profiler zegage zygolamda the hydrophobicity organophilicity of membrane surface was measured using a contact angle analysis system a 200 maist di water pure phenol solution of 5 μl was dropped on membrane and the image was instantly captured to calculate the contact angle by young laplace circle algorithm water contact angle was also measured after 24 h with water drop on the membrane membrane thickness was measured by a micrometer thickness gauge ch 12 7 jsm 6700 f liuling more detailed information about membrane characterization was reported in our previous study ren et al 2017 2 3 lab scale mars like membrane contactor phenol separation experiments were conducted on a lab scale mars like membrane contactor as shown in fig 1 which mainly consisted of two glass tanks two circulation pumps one polytetrafluoroethylene membrane cell and polyurethane tubings the flat electrospun pdms pmma membrane was installed to divide the membrane cell into two relatively independent semi cells depth 0 4 cm for feed solution and receiving solution respectively the effective membrane area was 0 0048 m2 with width and length of 6 0 and 8 0 cm two peristaltic pumps bj100 2 j longerpump were used for the circulations of feed solution 0 5 l and receiving solution 0 5 l in corresponding semi cell and the flow rates were measured by flowmeters the receiving solution tank was assembled with an electronic balance wt20002 vante and conductivity meter ddsj 308 a inesa to reflect the variations of weight and conductivity phenol laden saline wastewater was simulated by synthetic feed solution containing phenol and nacl and di water was used as receiving solution the mainly used feed solution was prepared by dissolving 2 0 g l phenol and 10 0 g l nacl in di water otherwise being stated 2 4 effect of flow rates on mars like membrane contactor a set of phenol separation experiments using different flow rates for feed solution 0 18 0 54 0 90 1 26 and 1 62 l h was conducted when the flow rate for receiving solution was set to 0 90 l h the phenol concentration weight and conductivity in receiving solution tank were monitored for 24 h to evaluate the effect of feed solution flow rate on phenol separation phenol permeation and salt rejection virgin electrospun pdms pmma membrane was used for each condition and the used membranes were stored for other analysis of sem eds and ftir another set of phenol separation experiments using different flow rates 0 18 0 54 0 90 1 26 and 1 62 l h for receiving solution was also conducted with optimized flow rate for feed solution except for the receiving solution flow rate all other relevant parameters and conditions were same as above the optimized flow rates for feed solution and receiving solution were used in the following experiments 2 5 effects of phenol salt concentration on mars like membrane contactor experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of phenol concentration 2 0 6 0 10 0 g l on phenol separation from same saline 10 0 g l feed solution effects of nacl concentration 10 0 30 0 50 0 g l on phenol separation were also investigated on this system under same phenol laden 2 0 g l feed solution all other relevant parameters and conditions were same as described in 2 4 2 6 effects of ph and temperature on mars like membrane contactor experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of ph 2 5 4 0 5 6 and temperature 20 30 40 c of feed solution on phenol separation from same feed solution phenol 2 0 g l nacl 10 0 g l the ph and temperature of pristine feed solution were 5 6 and 20 c respectively alkaline condition was not included as phenol would react with naoh higher temperature 40 c was not included due to excess evaporation all other relevant parameters and conditions were same as described in 2 4 2 7 long term mars like membrane contactor during non stop long term experiment the mars like membrane contactor was operated continuously for 108 h until reaching a steady state when the phenol concentration in feed solution and receiving solution was stable during periodical experiment the mars like membrane contactor was operated continuously for 24 h for three rounds at the end of each round the membrane and system were rinsed for 6 h using di water then the phenol laden saline feed solution was renewed and the phenol permeation and salt rejection was measured for the following round all other relevant parameters and conditions were same as described in 2 4 2 8 analytical methods phenol concentrations in feed receiving solution were measured by a spectrophotometer uv 1 800 mapada at 269 nm after dilution the applicable concentration range of this method is 0 100 mg l with a resolution of 0 066 mg l electrical conductivity of receiving solution was monitored using an online conductivity meter ddsj 308 a inesa to calculate the salt rejection weight of receiving solution tank was also monitored using an online electronic balance wt20002 vante to reflect the water rejection 2 9 mass transfer for phenol the change of phenol in receiving solution tank can be regarded as the difference between the phenol transport through the membrane and the phenol loss through the purging and therefore the overall mass transfer coefficient k ov could be determined as loh et al 2015 1 v r d c r dt q r c r k ov a c f c r where a is the effective membrane area m2 c f is the phenol concentration in feed solution g m 3 c r q r v r is the phenol concentration g m 3 purging flow rate m3 s 1 volume m3 of receiving solution t is the operation time s and dc r dt is the change rate of phenol concentration in receiving solution tank g m 3 s 1 in this experiment q r 0 the equation can be derived as follows assuming the sum of c f and c r at time t is a t 2 k ov v r 2 at ln a t 2 c r t a 0 2 c r 0 so k ov can be illustrated as 3 k ov v r 2 at ln c f t c r t c f 0 c r 0 therefore the phenol mass transfer flux can be described as xiao et al 2013 4 j ov k ov c f c r the phenol recovery pr can be calculated by 5 pr c r t v r c f 0 v f 100 the reynolds number re is calculated as 6 re ρvd μ where ρ v and μ are the density kg m 3 velocity m s 1 and viscosity parameter of feed receiving solution respectively d m is the characteristic length of membrane semi cells for feed receiving solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization the morphology of electrospun pdms pmma membrane is shown in fig 2 a it can be seen that the membrane was formed by randomly distributed fibers in multilayer and the mean fiber diameter was 1 28 μm the resultant mean pore size and specific surface area of electrospun pdms pmma membrane were 4 74 μm fig 2 a and 0 9914 m2 g fig 2 b respectively the pore structure was interconnected due to these multilayer fibers which is usually regarded as an advantage of electrospun membrane for separation ahmed et al 2015 it is observed from the xps spectrum in fig 2 c that carbon c 1s 284 ev oxygen o 1s 531 ev and silicon si 2s 153 ev si 2p 102 ev are the main elements on membrane surface element hydrogen h is immeasurable further analysis revealed that the atom concentrations of element c o and si were 56 22 24 55 and 19 23 respectively table 1 the tga curve for electrospun pdms pmma membrane is shown in fig 2 d no weight loss for the membrane was observed in a wide temperature range from 20 weight 100 to 200 c weight 99 98 which could be attributed to the high thermal stability of polymers and strong interaction of polymer chains the formed hierarchical microstructure also increased the surface roughness of membrane 5 8 μm as shown in surface profile images fig 2 e the difference between water and phenol contact angles for membrane surface would affect the permeability of inorganics and organics it was observed from fig 3 that when a water drop was placed on the membrane surface the resultant water contact angle maintained at 162 0 3 2 instant after 24 h meanwhile phenol instantly spread into membrane when phenol solution was dropped on membrane surface resulting in a phenol contact angle about 0 therefore superhydrophobicity contact angle 150 and superorganophilicity contact angle 5 were obtained simultaneously indicating that the membrane can be used for the phenol permeation and water soluble salt rejection membrane thickness is another crucial factor that influences the mass transfer rate and coefficient an overall thickness of membrane was measured to be 78 7 μm as a thin membrane the transportation path of phenol is reduced which would lead to the high mass transfer of phenol 3 2 mars like membrane contactor optimization the phenol separation mechanism from feed solution is mainly described as follows ferreira et al 2005a b i phenol and nacl diffusions from feed solution to membrane surface ii phenol adsorption and nacl rejection at feed solution membrane interface iii phenol diffusion in polymer membrane iv phenol desorption at membrane receiving solution interface and v phenol diffusion in receiving solution the flow rates for feed and receiving solution in mars like membrane contactor play key roles on the phenol separation performance in this experimental set the initial phenol and nacl concentrations in feed solution were set to 2 0 g l actual concentration 1993 1 10 7 mg l and 10 0 g l actual conductivity 16 5 0 1 ms cm respectively as shown in fig 4 a the permeated phenol in receiving solution increased from 203 5 to 359 9 mg l after 24 h operation when the flow rates of feed solution increased from 0 18 to 0 90 l h under a flow rate of 0 90 l h for receiving solution flow rate for feed solution is mainly related to the phenol diffusion from feed solution to membrane interface and the phenol adsorption at membrane surface it was observed that more phenol could be adsorbed by membrane and then permeated into receiving solution under a higher feed solution flow rate the real time concentration difference between feed solution and membrane also increased when the phenol in membrane was desorbed and therefore more phenol would be adsorbed by membrane to repeat this promotion process however the phenol permeation decreased to 343 5 and 307 2 mg l when the feed solution flow rate was further increased to 1 26 and 1 62 l h as a result the corresponding mean k ov also increased under the feed solution flow rates from 0 18 to 0 90 l h and decreased from 1 26 to 1 62 l h which was shown in fig 4 c such result was similar to the previous study on membrane contactor for phenol separation trivunac et al 2004 which also indicated that too high feed solution flow rate decreased the efficiency of phenol permeation this phenomenon might be caused by the membrane deformation under relatively high external pressure conditions which would lead to the reduced effective membrane area as a result the phenol permeation and corresponding overall mass transfer coefficient was decreased trivunac et al 2004 therefore the feed solution flow rate of 0 90 l h was used in the following experiment similar tendency was observed on the phenol permeation performance with the flow rate variation of receiving solution with the increase of receiving solution flow rate from 0 18 to 1 26 l h the obtained phenol permeation increased from 252 9 to 427 4 mg l the further increased receiving solution flow rate of 1 62 l h led to the phenol permeation decreased to 419 2 mg l fig 4 b the calculated mean k ov also increased with the change of flow rate from 0 18 to 1 26 l h and then decreased when the flow rate incrased from 1 26 to 1 62 l h fig 4 d it can be concluded that the phenol permeation would be inhibited when the receiving solution flow rate was too high similar to previous study trivunac et al 2004 this might be attributed from the membrane deformation which resulted in the reduced effective membrane area and phenol permeation performance meanwhile the weights of receiving solution in all experiments were almost stable indicating that no feed solution directly flowed into this side this was due to the superhydrophobic nature of membrane surface which made the water droplet tend to roll off the membrane surface rather than adhere on it the hierarchical microstructure was also beneficial in avoiding water invasion the conductivity variations in receiving solution during the whole process were lower than 3 5 μs cm which suggested high salt rejections 99 97 based on these experimental results the flow rates of 0 90 l h and 1 26 l h for feed and receiving solution were considered to be the optimum conditions and used in subsequent operations it is usually considered that hydrodynamic conditions are related to the liquid solid boundary layer mass transfer including phenol adsorption at feed solution membrane interface and desorption at membrane receiving solution interface xiao et al 2013 the fluid reynolds numbers re inside the membrane semi cells for feed receiving solution were 2 9 8 8 14 6 20 5 and 26 3 corresponding to the flow rates of 0 18 0 54 0 90 1 26 and 1 62 l h as shown in fig 4 e f the highest phenol recovery ratio 21 4 was observed at reynolds numbers of 14 6 for feed solution and 20 5 for receiving solution the high coefficients in fig 4 e and fig 4 f indicated that the polynomial fitted curves were suitable to describe the relation between phenol recovery and hydrodynamics conditions meanwhile the distribution of salt rejection points was quite stable with reynolds number variation according to the fitted curves and corresponding mars like membrane contactor performances the best hydrodynamics conditions re were 14 6 for feed solution and 20 5 for receiving solution since the smallest adjustable gap of re is 5 8 adjustable gap of flow rate 0 18 l h 3 3 effect of concentration on mars like membrane contactor 3 3 1 effect of phenol concentration fig 5 a shows the phenol separation performances under different feed solutions during 24 h operation phenol concentration in feed solutions increased from 2 0 to 6 0 and 10 0 g l actual concentrations 1995 2 7 9 5988 1 13 3 and 9987 3 25 7 mg l the permeated phenol in receiving solution proportionally increased from 427 4 to 1332 5 2386 4 mg l respectively it was clear that the phenol concentration in feed solution had a significant effect on the phenol permeation in receiving solution with the increase of phenol concentration in feed solution the concentration difference between two sides increased at same time therefore the mass transfer driving force of phenol increased which resulted in more phenol being transported into receiving solution slight increase for conductivity variation was observed in receiving solution with the increased permeated phenol such as 2 16 μs cm under 2 0 g l phenol and 5 14 μs cm under 10 0 g l phenol in feed solution since such slight conductivity variation can be neglected when compared with the high conductivity of nacl solution noting that only 1 ml nacl solution 10 0 g l 16 5 ms cm was permeated into another side the conductivity in receiving solution would increase about 30 0 μs cm results of the overall phenol mass transfer coefficient and concentration difference ratio between feed and receiving solution are provided in fig 5 b the initial phenol concentration difference between two sides was almost 2 000 6000 and 10 000 mg l leading to a ratio of 1 for c f t c r t c f 0 c r 0 during the start of experiment the concentration difference between two sides was relatively high which would result in high ratio of c f t c r t c f 0 c r 0 and high value of k ov then the ratio of c f t c r t c f 0 c r 0 gradually decreased with the phenol permeation from feed solution to receiving solution showing an obvious decreased k ov meanwhile the ratio of phenol concentration change in receiving solution was almost stable under different phenol concentrations and hence the values of c f t c r t c f 0 c r 0 were almost stable at same time although mass transfer driving forces were different under different feed solutions the ratios of concentration difference between two sides were similar during operation therefore the calculated k ov were all in the range from 1 5 to 1 8 10 6 m s 1 at 1st h indicating phenol concentration had no effect on mass transfer coefficient then these coefficients decreased synchronously during operation and finally maintained around 5 2 6 4 10 7 m s 1 it can be seen that k ov was independent of phenol concentration and mass transfer driving force being related to the ratio of concentration difference between two sides c f t c r t c f 0 c r 0 their values of mean k ov were also similar as shown in fig 5 c the conclusion that overall phenol mass transfer coefficient tends to be independent of phenol concentration in feed solution was also obtained elsewhere xiao et al 2013 phenol mass transfer flux is a function of mass transfer coefficient k ov and concentration difference in two sides c f c r and is shown in fig 5 d the initial phenol mass transfer flux at 1st hour was 2 8 10 3 kg m 2 s 1 during the separation for 2 0 g l phenol saline feed solution with the decrease in phenol concentration difference between two sides from 2000 at 0 h to 839 mg l at 24th h this flux gradually decreased to 4 4 10 4 kg m 2 s 1 at 24th hour when the phenol concentration in feed solution gradually increased the concentration difference between two sides increased resulting in an increased flux for instance the phenol mass transfer flux at 1st hour increased to 8 2 10 3 6 0 g l phenol and 1 6 10 2 kg m 2 s 1 10 0 g l phenol respectively such results of j ov were in accordance with the results of phenol permeation under different feed solutions as shown in fig 5 a the phenol recovery in receiving solution under different feed solutions is presented in fig 5 e it is shown that the recovery lines for three feed solutions were generally coincident during the whole process after 24 h operation the phenol recovery ratios were around 21 2 23 9 during the separation of phenol 2 0 10 0 g l from feed solutions the phenol recovery ratio did not depend on the initial phenol concentration in feed solution and usually remained constant this observation was in agreement with the other literature praveen and loh 2015 which suggested that the phenol recovery ratio mainly depended on the membrane nature rather than the concentration of feed solution 3 3 2 effect of salt concentration fig 6 a summarizes the effect of feed solution salinity 10 0 30 0 50 0 g l on phenol separation from feed solutions containing 2 0 g l phenol actual concentration 1994 7 8 2 mg l though the conductivity of feed solution significantly increased from 16 5 to 41 8 63 3 ms cm with the increase of salinity shown in table s1 the conductivity variations in receiving solution maintained at low level 2 16 4 37 μs cm after 24 h operation resulting in high salt rejections above 99 98 meanwhile no nacl crystallization within the pores of used membrane was observed even at high nacl concentration fig s1 the phenol permeation from feed solution was the main reason for this small conductivity increase in receiving solution meanwhile the washout of residual solvent in membrane also might contribute to this conductivity increase it was clear that there was no linear increase of the conductivity variation in receiving solution with the nacl concentration increase in feed solution which indicated that the superhydrophobic membrane surface could avoid the salt invasion of feed solution furthermore the trend lines for phenol permeation in receiving solution were almost same during the whole process which indicated that the salinity of feed solution had no effect on phenol separation therefore the permeated phenol in receiving solution was all in the range of 424 2 430 7 mg l under three salinity conditions after 24 h operation the effect of the feed solution salinity on the mass transfer is illustrated in fig 6 b small difference of 0 23 10 6 m s 1 was presented in the calculated k ov at 1st h 1 58 10 6 m s 1 under 10 0 g l nacl 1 36 10 6 under 30 0 g l nacl and 1 43 10 6 under 50 0 g l nacl this was the contribution of different phenol transfer performance between two sides rather than the different salinity in feed solution it was worth mentioning that the difference in mean k ov during 24 h was negligible during separation for different feed solutions in which the phenol permeation performance was almost same as a product of k ov and c f c r the highest and mean mass transfer flux for phenol also exhibited similar tendency in comparison with k ov therefore it could be concluded that salinity of feed solution had no effect on phenol separation 3 4 effect of ph and temperature on mars like membrane contactor fig 7 a and b show the phenol permeation and its mean k ov under different ph value for feed solution the actual phenol concentration in feed solutions was around 1999 8 9 7 mg l with the ph decrease from 5 6 to 4 0 and 2 5 the phenol permeation in receiving solution increased from 427 4 to 494 9 and 521 3 mg l their mean k ov increased from 8 80 10 7 to 9 43 10 7 and 9 88 10 7 m s on the other hand ph variation did not influence the membrane performance for salt rejection 99 97 99 99 as a weak acid phenol would concentrate on its undissociated state rather than its ionic state i e ha h a under the low ph loh et al 2015 in this way membrane adsorption of phenol was enhanced via the hydrogen bond formation when compared with more ionic state phenol the under high ph al muhtaseb et al 2011 as a result ph decrease in feed solution was beneficial for phenol separation as shown in fig 7 c when the feed solution temperature increased from 20 to 30 and 40 c the permeated phenol gradually increased from 427 4 to 524 6 and 580 6 mg l respectively the corresponding mean k ov also showed an increasing tendency from 8 80 10 7 20 c to 1 03 10 6 m s 30 c and 1 06 10 6 m s 40 c fig 7 d it could be concluded that high temperature of feed solution is beneficial for phenol permeation this might be attributed to the enhanced mobility of polymer chains under higher temperature which made phenol diffuse more easily han et al 2001 meanwhile all salt rejections still maintained at a high level 99 97 which indicated no effect of temperature on salt rejection 3 5 long term mars like membrane contactor 3 5 1 continuous operation fig 8 a shows the long term phenol separation performance during 108 h operation the initial phenol and nacl concentrations in feed solution were 2 0 g l actual concentration 1994 5 10 1 mg l and 10 0 g l actual conductivity 16 5 0 1 ms cm respectively during this process only phenol was gradually permeated from high concentration side feed solution to low concentration side receiving solution to achieve the separation of phenol and salt and 760 1 mg l of phenol was collected in receiving solution after 72 h it was also observed that the residual phenol in feed solution gradually decreased when more and more phenol was gradually adsorbed by membrane and permeated into receiving solution the slopes of the resultant plot lines both gradually decreased indicating the corresponding phenol permeation rate from feed to receiving solution also gradually decreased especially during 72nd to 108th h after 108 h residual phenol dropped to 861 5 mg l in feed solution and collected phenol rose to 852 3 mg l in receiving solution resulting in total phenol recovery of 42 6 with 14 3 phenol remained in the electrospun membrane and tubes meanwhile the conductivity variation in receiving solution gradually increased from 0 to 6 19 μs cm during the 108 h of operation this small conductivity increase suggested that the electrospun pdms pmma membrane could be used for long term phenol separation to achieve high salt rejection about 99 95 the corresponding mass transfer values k ov and j ov are also presented in fig 8 b after reaching the highest k ov of 1 5 10 6 m s 1 at 1st h the quick lowering on overall mass transfer coefficient was observed due to the decrease of c f t c r t c f 0 c r 0 later the k ov values gradually maintained around 5 0 10 7 to 7 5 10 7 m s 1 and resulted in a mean value of 6 7 10 7 m s 1 during the whole process three reasons could be summarized to explain this high phenol mass transfer coefficient i the sio units formed the backbone structure of pdms which led the membrane to exhibit high flexibility and thus phenol molecules could transport through the membrane more easily makrodimitri and economou 2008 watson et al 1992 senthilkumar et al 2005 ii the superorganophilicity of membrane made phenol molecules permeate into membrane and be diffused into receiving side more easily iii the small thickness of membrane reduced the permeation path enabling the phenol molecules to transport into receiving side fast this thin membrane was also more sensitive to perceive the concentration variation in two sides which was beneficial in maintaining the transmembrane mass transfer driving force with the decrease of phenol concentration difference between feed and receiving solution the mass transfer driving force gradually decreased which led to the mass transfer flux gradually decreased from 2 6 10 3 1st h to 7 2 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 108th h as described in fig 8 b accompanied with this gradually decreased mass transfer flux the phenol permeation rate also gradually decreased during the operation shown in fig 8 a it could be noted that the k ov seemed slightly increased after 84th h the membrane could be regarded as partial wetted by phenol during the adsorption of phenol more and more adsorbed phenol might fill the fiber and pore of electrospun membrane after 84 h which might make the membrane as liquid membrane of phenol in this way the mass transfer resistance of membrane for phenol might decrease leading to phenol transport the membrane more easily higher k ov 3 5 2 comparison a comparison of phenol mass transfer coefficients in mars process using different membranes was shown in table 2 the mean overall phenol mass transfer coefficient k ov for electrospun pdms pmma membrane in this study was 6 7 10 7 m s 1 without the use of stripping solution this membrane exhibited higher coefficient when compared with commercial pdms tubular membranes han et al 2001 ferreira et al 2002b xiao et al 2006 and some of lab made membranes xiao et al 2013 dastgir et al 2005c loh et al 2015 wang et al 2006 zhu et al 2009 in this process there is no need to use base or acid for the promotion of phenol extraction or regeneration as a result this mars like membrane contactor could save 100 agents for extraction and regeneration in traditional mars moreover the operation cost of this mars like membrane contactor is significantly lower than other membrane separation processes as a temperature free and pressure free membrane process as shown in table 2 the price of used electrospun pdms pmma membrane 33 0 usd m2 was also lower than other commercial tubular pdms membranes 451 8 usd m2 the electrospun pdms pmma membrane appears to be more promising in mars like membrane contactors for pollutant separation with higher mass transfer efficiency simpler operation and lower cost 3 6 membrane stability in another test the electrospun pdms pmma membrane was used to evaluate phenol separation performance in periodic mode which consisted of three cycles of 24 h continuous operation the set concentration of phenol in feed solution was 2 0 g l actual concentration 1996 5 7 9 mg l as shown in fig 9 the permeated phenol in receiving solution gradually increased from 27 3 1st h to 155 7 6th h and 249 6 mg l 12th h with low conductivity variation under 1 74 μs cm finally 427 4 mg l phenol was collected in receiving solution after 24 h operation corresponding with a high salt rejection of 99 98 then di water was used in two sides to clean the membrane for 6 h and the used di water was renewed every 1 h as shown in the sem eds spectra for element na fig 10 a and b 0 32 at 0 37 wt element na was attached on used membrane surface and almost all attached na could be removed after cleaning fig 10 c it was worth noticing that the phenol separation performances in the subsequent second and third cycles were quite stable using the data in first cycle as standard 100 although the permeated phenol concentration was slightly fluctuant in the two cycles especially during the first 6 h the total permeated phenol maintained at the same level 100 5 102 1 when compared with the first cycle exhibiting high membrane stability in the third run the salt rejection even increased to 99 99 which might be caused by no residual solvent would be washed into receiving solution to cause the conductivity increase the performances of phenol separation in three cycles implied that no obvious membrane fouling was observed on the used electrospun pdms pmma membrane ftir transmittance peaks of virgin and used electrospun pdms pmma membranes at various wavelengths are shown in fig 11 to identify the change on membrane structure in virgin membrane sample the transmittance peak around 2960 cm 1 was due to the existence of ch3 functional groups in pdms and pmma the peaks around 1730 1020 and 795 cm 1 were assigned to c o c o and ch2 respectively which were the intrinsic parts of pmma the transmittances around 1260 cm 1 were the characteristic peaks of cooh which might be formed during electrospinning these peak locations of functional groups were in agreement with their reported values in other literature kim and jang 2006 sajjad et al 2016 no new born functional group was observed on the ftir spectrum for used membrane suggesting that no structure change was observed on membrane during phenol separation along with this the corresponding lower transmittance peaks on the used membrane surface indicated the membrane adsorption of phenol these results suggested that the phenol permeation mechanism was membrane adsorption diffusion desorption rather than direct transport through membrane pore this ftir pattern indicated that phenol permeation did not destroy or affect the structure integrity of virgin membrane and therefore the stable separation performance in periodical operation was achieved 4 conclusions in summary the superhydrophobic superorganophilic electrospun pdms pmma membrane was firstly applied in mars like membrane contactor to achieve the phenol separation from saline wastewater similar phenol recovery ratio 21 2 23 9 and high salt rejection 99 96 were achieved even under different concentrations of phenol or salt in 24 h operation revealing that phenol separation performance mainly depended on the membrane nature a high mean phenol mass transfer coefficient of 6 7 10 7 m s 1 was obtained during long term continuous mars like membrane contactor operation accompanied with a total phenol recovery of 42 6 based on the phenol permeation mechanism of adsorption diffusion desorption almost no membrane fouling was detected during periodical operation which exhibited quite stable phenol separation performance these findings become particularly significant in the separation of organic and inorganic pollutants and can contribute in the further application of mars like membrane contactor with easy operation and reasonable price acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the national

19664,phenol recovery from phenol laden saline wastewater plays an important role in the waste reclamation and pollution control a membrane aromatic recovery system like membrane contactor mars like membrane contactor was set up in this study using electrospun polydimethylsiloxane polymethyl methacrylate pdms pmma membrane with 0 0048 m2 effective area to separate phenol from saline wastewater phenol and water contact angles of 0 and 162 were achieved on this membrane surface simultaneously indicating its potential in the separation of phenol and water soluble salt feed solution 500 ml of 0 90 l h and receiving solution 500 ml of 1 26 l h were investigated to be the optimum conditions for phenol separation which corresponds to the employed reynolds number of 14 6 and 20 5 during 108 h continuous separation for feed solution 2 0 g l phenol 10 0 g l nacl under room temperature 20 c 42 6 of phenol was recycled in receiving solution with a salt rejection of 99 95 meanwhile the mean phenol mass transfer coefficient k ov was 6 7 10 7 m s 1 as a membrane based process though the permeated phenol increased with the increase of phenol concentration in feed solution the phenol recovery ratio was determined by the membrane properties rather than the pollutant concentrations phenol was found to permeate this membrane via adsorption diffusion and desorption and therefore the membrane fouling generated from pore blockage in other membrane separation processes was totally avoided graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane contactor pdms electrospun membrane phenol separation mass transfer 1 introduction saline industrial wastewaters are widely generated in various kinds of industries including petroleum refining coal processing pharmaceutical manufacturing food processing leather production etc with high concentrations of refractory organic compounds lefebvre and moletta 2006 as a typical organic contaminant phenol is frequently found in these saline industrial wastewaters to form phenol laden saline wastewaters which are rich in both phenol and salt moussavi et al 2010 for instance the wastewaters from petroleum refining coal processing and resin production contain high concentrations of phenol 2 8 10 000 mg l bayram 2004 gonzález et al 2001 phenol has been regarded as one of priority hazardous organic pollutants which emphasizes the toxicity and corresponding adverse effects of phenol laden saline wastewaters on soil water groundwater and organisms even ecosystem juang et al 2009 as an important and essential raw material in various industries senthilvelan et al 2014 the separation of phenol from saline wastewaters would result in significant economic value and environmental value the main methods for phenol separation are solvent extraction activated carbon adsorption and pervaporation caetano et al 2009 víctor ortega et al 2016a 2016b however there are the requirements of re treatment for removing dissolved polar solvents solvent extraction elution of phenols from the loaded carbons activated carbon adsorption and high standard operation apparatus and demands pervaporation making these methods partly limited in the applications of phenol separation as a novel membrane based process for phenol separation membrane aromatic recovery system mars is preferred to the above technologies based on its low cost and high efficiency han et al 2001 ferreira et al 2002a dastgir et al 2005a dastgir et al 2005b daisley et al 2006 a high organic permeable membrane mainly non porous membranes divides mars into wastewater side and stripping solution side firstly organic phenol transports across the selective permeable membrane into stripping solution naoh and be converted into phenolate while the inorganic salt could not transport the membrane then acid hcl is added into the collected stripping solution to convert phenolate into phenol as a result the separation and recovery of phenol from saline wastewater were achieved the first attempt of mars for phenol separation was conducted by han et al in 2001 using silicon rubber tube contains 70 pdms as selective permeable membrane in a 1 5 l lab scale system han et al 2001 over 94 phenol was recovered from 10 0 g l phenol wastewater with a purity of 86 5 wt after 40 days operation han et al 2001 novel membranes were also investigated in mars process to improve the mass transfer of phenol composite pdms pvdf polyvinylidene fluoride membrane was prepared by coating pdms on the surface of commercial pvdf membrane and the effects of wastewater concentration flow rate and temperature on mass transfer were investigated xiao et al 2013 the obtained k ov for phenol pertraction was increased to 8 7 10 7 m s 1 from 1 0 to 3 5 10 7 m s 1 for silicon rubber tubes xiao et al 2013 supported liquid membranes slm also attracted attention in mars which was prepared by filling the pores of flat microporous polypropylene pp membrane with polypropylene glycol ppg after γ radiation dastgir et al 2005c the generated slm exhibited high phenol mass transfer coefficient of 2 7 10 6 m s 1 unfortunately water permeation was also observed during phenol permeation indicating this membrane was unsuitable for phenol separation from saline wastewater generally speaking the employed membranes for mars were still suffered from the low mass transfer coefficient and low chemical resistance to stripping solution xiao et al 2013 therefore a more proper membrane is desired for the wider application of mars electrospinning has gained increasing appeal as a fibrous membrane fabrication method that produces nano to sub micron scale fibers from polymer solution under repulsive electric force ahmed et al 2015 nuraje et al 2013 in electric field a conical shape of solution is formed at the tip of needle being loaded with polymer solution and is named as taylor cone when the produced electric force overcomes the surface tension force of polymer solution continuous fine charged jet would be ejected from the tip of taylor cone then the solvent gradually evaporates in air during jet travel to collector remaining the randomly arranged polymer fibers finally continuous formed fibers are collected to fabricate a non woven fabric membrane ahmed et al 2015 nuraje et al 2013 as a solution based process the property of electrospinning solution decides the property of electrospun membrane as an elastomeric and hydrophobic polymer pdms is suitable to electrospin superhydrophobic membrane due to the insufficient chain entanglements of pdms poly methyl methacrylate pmma is usually added as carrier polymer during electrospinning ren et al 2017 electrospun pdms pmma membrane exhibits several attractive attributes such as high hydrophobicity organophilicity controllable pore size interconnected pore structure high porosity and high specific surface area ren et al 2017 the backbone of si o in pdms gives it high flexibility for phenol adsorption and permeation chang et al 2012 phenol also could be adsorbed by pmma via the formation of hydrogen bond for subsequent separation al muhtaseb et al 2011 when the high phenol mass transfer coefficient is achieved the use of stripping solution could be avoided as a result the lengthened membrane service life simplified operation and lower cost are achieved however no relevant work has been published on the employment of porous electrospun pdms pmma membrane for phenol separation in this study a mars like membrane contactor was set up using porous electrospun pdms pmma membrane hydrophobicity and organophilicity of membrane were investigated to analyze the mechanisms of phenol separation phenol permeation and salt rejection different operation parameters phenol and salt concentrations were used to investigate their effects on phenol separation from phenol laden saline wastewater long term phenol separation was operated under optimized condition to calculate the phenol mass transfer coefficient and evaluate the membrane stability to the best of our knowledge all these attempts are firstly applied in mars like membrane contactor for phenol separation 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane fabrication pdms sylgard 184 mw 60 000 g mol and pmma 182265 mw 996 000 g mol were purchased from dow corning and sigma aldrich respectively n n dimethylformamide dmf and tetrahydrofuran thf were purchased from sinopharm all chemicals were used as received otherwise being noted pmma was firstly dissolved in binary thf and dmf to prepare pmma solution 10 0 wt by stirring at 300 rpm 50 c then pdms pmma dope solution was prepared by dissolving pdms 10 0 wt and curing agent 1 0 wt by stirring prepared dope solution was loaded into a syringe

detailed information about membrane characterization was reported in our previous study ren et al 2017 2 3 lab scale mars like membrane contactor phenol separation experiments were conducted on a lab scale mars like membrane contactor as shown in fig 1 which mainly consisted of two glass tanks two circulation pumps one polytetrafluoroethylene membrane cell and polyurethane tubings the flat electrospun pdms pmma membrane was installed to divide the membrane cell into two relatively independent semi cells depth 0 4 cm for feed solution and receiving solution respectively the effective membrane area was 0 0048 m2 with width and length of 6 0 and 8 0 cm two peristaltic pumps bj100 2 j longerpump were used for the circulations of feed solution 0 5 l and receiving solution 0 5 l in corresponding semi cell and the flow rates were measured by flowmeters the receiving solution tank was assembled with an electronic balance wt20002 vante and conductivity meter ddsj 308 a inesa to reflect the variations of weight and conductivity phenol laden saline wastewater was simulated by synthetic feed solution containing phenol and nacl and di water was used as receiving solution the mainly used feed solution was prepared by dissolving 2 0 g l phenol and 10 0 g l nacl in di water otherwise being stated 2 4 effect of flow rates on mars like membrane contactor a set of phenol separation experiments using different flow rates for feed solution 0 18 0 54 0 90 1 26 and 1 62 l h was conducted when the flow rate for receiving solution was set to 0 90 l h the phenol concentration weight and conductivity in receiving solution tank were monitored for 24 h to evaluate the effect of feed solution flow rate on phenol separation phenol permeation and salt rejection virgin electrospun pdms pmma membrane was used for each condition and the used membranes were stored for other analysis of sem eds and ftir another set of phenol separation experiments using different flow rates 0 18 0 54 0 90 1 26 and 1 62 l h for receiving solution was also conducted with optimized flow rate for feed solution except for the receiving solution flow rate all other relevant parameters and conditions were same as above the optimized flow rates for feed solution and receiving solution were used in the following experiments 2 5 effects of phenol salt concentration on mars like membrane contactor experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of phenol concentration 2 0 6 0 10 0 g l on phenol separation from same saline 10 0 g l feed solution effects of nacl

described in 2 4 2 6 effects of ph and temperature on mars like membrane contactor experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of ph 2 5 4 0 5 6 and temperature 20 30 40 c of feed solution on phenol separation from same feed solution phenol 2 0 g l nacl 10 0 g l the ph and temperature of pristine feed solution were 5 6 and 20 c respectively alkaline condition was not included as phenol would react with naoh higher temperature 40 c was not included due to excess evaporation all other relevant parameters and conditions were same as described in 2 4 2 7 long term mars like membrane contactor during non stop long term experiment the mars like membrane contactor was operated continuously for 108 h until reaching a steady state when the phenol concentration in feed solution and receiving solution was stable during periodical experiment the mars like membrane contactor was operated continuously for 24 h for three rounds at the end of each round the membrane and system were rinsed for 6 h using di water then the phenol laden saline feed solution was renewed and the phenol permeation and salt rejection was measured for the following round all other relevant parameters and conditions were same as described in 2 4 2 8 analytical methods phenol concentrations in feed receiving solution were measured by a spectrophotometer uv 1 800 mapada at 269 nm after dilution the applicable concentration range of this method is 0 100 mg l with a resolution of 0 066 mg l electrical conductivity of receiving solution was monitored using an online conductivity meter ddsj 308 a inesa to calculate the salt rejection weight of receiving solution tank was also monitored using an online electronic balance wt20002 vante to reflect the water rejection 2 9 mass transfer for phenol the change of phenol in receiving solution tank can be regarded as the difference between the phenol transport through the membrane and the phenol loss through the purging and therefore the overall mass transfer coefficient k ov could be determined as loh et al 2015 1 v r d c r dt q r c r k ov a c f c r where a is the effective membrane area m2 c f is the phenol concentration in feed solution g m 3 c r q r v r is the phenol concentration g m 3 purging flow rate m3 s 1 volume m3 of receiving solution t is the operation time s and dc r dt is the change rate of phenol concentration in receiving solution tank g m 3 s 1 in this experiment q r 0 the equation can be derived as follows assuming the sum of c f and c r at time t is a t 2 k ov v r 2 at ln a t 2 c r t a 0 2 c r 0 so k ov can be illustrated as 3 k ov v r 2 at ln c f t c r t c f 0 c r 0 therefore the phenol mass transfer flux can be described as xiao et al 2013 4 j ov k ov c f c r the phenol recovery pr can be calculated by 5 pr c r t v r c f 0 v f 100 the reynolds number re is calculated as 6 re ρvd μ where ρ v and μ are the density kg m 3 velocity m s 1 and viscosity parameter of feed receiving solution respectively d m is the characteristic length of membrane semi cells for feed receiving solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization the morphology of electrospun pdms pmma membrane is shown in fig 2 a it can be seen that the membrane was formed by randomly distributed fibers in multilayer and the mean fiber diameter was 1 28 μm the resultant mean pore size and specific surface area of electrospun pdms pmma membrane were 4 74 μm fig 2 a and 0 9914 m2 g fig 2 b respectively the pore structure was interconnected due to these multilayer fibers which is usually regarded as an advantage of electrospun membrane for separation ahmed et al 2015 it is observed from the xps spectrum in fig 2 c that carbon c 1s 284 ev oxygen o 1s 531 ev and silicon si 2s 153 ev si 2p 102 ev are the main elements on membrane surface element hydrogen h is immeasurable further analysis revealed that the atom concentrations of element c o and si were 56 22 24 55 and 19 23 respectively table 1 the tga curve for electrospun pdms pmma membrane is shown in fig 2 d no weight loss for the membrane was observed in a wide temperature range from 20 weight 100 to 200 c weight 99 98 which could be attributed to the high thermal stability of polymers and strong interaction of polymer chains the formed hierarchical microstructure also increased the surface roughness of membrane 5 8 μm as shown in surface profile images fig 2 e the difference between water and phenol contact angles for membrane surface would affect the permeability of inorganics and organics it was observed from fig 3 that when a water drop was placed on the membrane surface the resultant water contact angle maintained at 162 0 3 2 instant after 24 h meanwhile phenol instantly spread into membrane when phenol solution was dropped on membrane surface resulting in a phenol contact angle about 0 therefore superhydrophobicity contact angle 150 and superorganophilicity contact angle 5 were obtained simultaneously indicating that the membrane can be used for the phenol permeation and water soluble salt rejection membrane thickness is another crucial factor that influences the mass transfer rate and coefficient an overall thickness of membrane was measured to be 78 7 μm as a thin membrane the transportation path of phenol is reduced which would lead to the high mass transfer of phenol 3 2 mars like membrane contactor optimization the phenol separation mechanism from feed solution is mainly described as follows ferreira et al 2005a b i phenol and nacl diffusions from feed solution to membrane surface ii phenol adsorption and nacl rejection at feed solution membrane interface iii phenol diffusion in polymer membrane iv phenol desorption at membrane receiving solution interface and v phenol diffusion in receiving solution the flow rates for feed and receiving solution in mars like membrane contactor play key roles on the phenol separation performance in this experimental set the initial phenol and nacl concentrations in feed solution were set to 2 0 g l actual concentration 1993 1 10 7 mg l and 10 0 g l actual conductivity 16 5 0 1 ms cm respectively as shown in fig 4 a the permeated phenol in receiving solution increased from 203 5 to 359 9 mg l after 24 h operation when the flow rates of feed solution increased from 0 18 to 0 90 l h under a flow rate of 0 90 l h for receiving solution flow rate for feed solution is mainly related to the phenol diffusion from feed solution to membrane interface and the phenol adsorption at membrane surface it was observed that more phenol could be adsorbed by membrane and then permeated into receiving solution under a higher feed solution flow rate the real time concentration difference between feed solution and membrane also increased when the phenol in membrane was desorbed and therefore more phenol would be adsorbed by membrane to repeat this promotion process however the phenol permeation decreased to 343 5 and 307 2 mg l when the feed solution flow rate was further increased to 1 26 and 1 62 l h as a result the corresponding mean k ov also increased under the feed solution flow rates from 0 18 to 0 90 l h and decreased from 1 26 to 1 62 l h which was shown in fig 4 c such result was similar to the previous study on membrane contactor for phenol separation trivunac et al 2004 which also indicated that too high feed solution flow rate decreased the efficiency of phenol permeation this phenomenon might be caused by the membrane deformation under relatively high external pressure conditions which would lead to the reduced effective membrane area as a result the phenol permeation and corresponding overall mass transfer coefficient was decreased trivunac et al 2004 therefore the feed solution flow rate of 0 90 l h was used in the following experiment similar tendency was observed on the phenol permeation performance with the flow rate variation of receiving solution with the increase of receiving solution flow rate from 0 18 to 1 26 l h the obtained phenol permeation increased from 252 9 to 427 4 mg l the further increased receiving solution flow rate of 1 62 l h led to the phenol permeation decreased to 419 2 mg l fig 4 b the calculated mean k ov also increased with the change of flow rate from 0 18 to 1 26 l h and then decreased when the flow rate incrased from 1 26 to 1 62 l h fig 4 d it can be concluded that the phenol permeation would be inhibited when the receiving solution flow rate was too high similar to previous study trivunac et al 2004 this might be attributed from the membrane deformation which resulted in the reduced effective membrane area and phenol permeation performance meanwhile the weights of receiving solution in all experiments were almost stable indicating that no feed solution directly flowed into this side this was due to the superhydrophobic nature of membrane surface which made the water droplet tend to roll off the membrane surface rather than adhere on it the hierarchical microstructure was also beneficial in avoiding water invasion the conductivity variations in receiving solution during the whole process were lower than 3 5 μs cm which suggested high salt rejections 99 97 based on these experimental results the flow rates of 0 90 l h and 1 26 l h for feed and receiving solution were considered to be the optimum conditions and used in subsequent operations it is usually considered that hydrodynamic conditions are related to the liquid solid boundary layer mass transfer including phenol adsorption at feed solution membrane interface and desorption at membrane receiving solution interface xiao et al 2013 the fluid reynolds numbers re inside the membrane semi cells for feed receiving solution were 2 9 8 8 14 6 20 5 and 26 3 corresponding to the flow rates of 0 18 0 54 0 90 1 26 and 1 62 l h as shown in fig 4 e f the highest phenol recovery ratio 21 4 was observed at reynolds numbers of 14 6 for feed solution and 20 5 for receiving solution the high coefficients in fig 4 e and fig 4 f indicated that the polynomial fitted curves were suitable to describe the relation between phenol recovery and hydrodynamics conditions meanwhile the distribution of salt rejection points was quite stable with reynolds number variation according to the fitted curves and corresponding mars like membrane contactor performances the best hydrodynamics conditions re were 14 6 for feed solution and 20 5 for receiving solution since the smallest adjustable gap of re is 5 8 adjustable gap of flow rate 0 18 l h 3 3 effect of concentration on mars like membrane contactor 3 3 1 effect of phenol concentration fig 5 a shows the phenol separation performances under different feed solutions during 24 h operation phenol concentration in feed solutions increased from 2 0 to 6 0 and 10 0 g l actual concentrations 1995 2 7 9 5988 1 13 3 and 9987 3 25 7 mg l the permeated phenol in receiving solution proportionally increased from 427 4 to 1332 5 2386 4 mg l respectively it was clear that the phenol concentration in feed solution had a significant effect on the phenol permeation in receiving solution with the increase of phenol concentration in feed solution the concentration difference between two sides increased at same time therefore the mass transfer driving force of phenol increased which resulted in more phenol being transported into receiving solution slight increase for conductivity variation was observed in receiving solution with the increased permeated phenol such as 2 16 μs cm under 2 0 g l phenol and 5 14 μs cm under 10 0 g l phenol in feed solution since such slight conductivity variation can be neglected when compared with the high conductivity of nacl solution noting that only 1 ml nacl solution 10 0 g l 16 5 ms cm was permeated into another side the conductivity in receiving solution would increase about 30 0 μs cm results of the overall phenol mass transfer coefficient and concentration difference ratio between feed and receiving solution are provided in fig 5 b the initial phenol concentration difference between two sides was almost 2 000 6000 and 10 000 mg l leading to a ratio of 1 for c f t c r t c f 0 c r 0 during the start of experiment the concentration difference between two sides was relatively high which would result in high ratio of c f t c r t c f 0 c r 0 and high value of k ov then the ratio of c f t c r t c f 0 c r 0 gradually decreased with the phenol permeation from feed solution to receiving solution showing an obvious decreased k ov meanwhile the ratio of phenol concentration change in receiving solution was almost stable under different phenol concentrations and hence the values of c f t c r t c f 0 c r 0 were almost stable at same time although mass transfer driving forces were different under different feed solutions the ratios of concentration difference between two sides were similar during operation therefore the calculated k ov were all in the range from 1 5 to 1 8 10 6 m s 1 at 1st h indicating phenol concentration had no effect on mass transfer coefficient then these coefficients decreased synchronously during operation and finally maintained around 5 2 6 4 10 7 m s 1 it can be seen that k ov was independent of phenol concentration and mass transfer driving force being related to the ratio of concentration difference between two sides c f t c r t c f 0 c r 0 their values of mean k ov were also similar as shown in fig 5 c the conclusion that overall phenol mass transfer coefficient tends to be independent of phenol concentration in feed solution was also obtained elsewhere xiao et al 2013 phenol mass transfer flux is a function of mass transfer coefficient k ov and concentration difference in two sides c f c r and is shown in fig 5 d the initial phenol mass transfer flux at 1st hour was 2 8 10 3 kg m 2 s 1 during the separation for 2 0 g l phenol saline feed solution with the decrease in phenol concentration difference between two sides from 2000 at 0 h to 839 mg l at 24th h this flux gradually decreased to 4 4 10 4 kg m 2 s 1 at 24th hour when the phenol concentration in feed solution gradually increased the concentration difference between two sides increased resulting in an increased flux for instance the phenol mass transfer flux at 1st hour increased to 8 2 10 3 6 0 g l phenol and 1 6 10 2 kg m 2 s 1 10 0 g l phenol respectively such results of j ov were in accordance with the results of phenol permeation under different feed solutions as shown in fig 5 a the phenol recovery in receiving solution under different feed solutions is presented in fig 5 e it is shown that the recovery lines for three feed solutions were generally coincident during the whole process after 24 h operation the phenol recovery ratios were around 21 2 23 9 during the separation of phenol 2 0 10 0 g l from feed solutions the phenol recovery ratio did not depend on the initial phenol concentration in feed solution and usually remained constant this observation was in agreement with the other literature praveen and loh 2015 which suggested that the phenol recovery ratio mainly depended on the membrane nature rather than the concentration of feed solution 3 3 2 effect of salt concentration fig 6 a summarizes the effect of feed solution salinity 10 0 30 0 50 0 g l on phenol separation from feed solutions containing 2 0 g l phenol actual concentration 1994 7 8 2 mg l though the conductivity of feed solution significantly increased from 16 5 to 41 8 63 3 ms cm with the increase of salinity shown in table s1 the conductivity variations in receiving solution maintained at low level 2 16 4 37 μs cm after 24 h operation resulting in high salt rejections above 99 98 meanwhile no nacl crystallization within the pores of used membrane was observed even at high nacl concentration fig s1 the phenol permeation from feed solution was the main reason for this small conductivity increase in receiving solution meanwhile the washout of residual solvent in membrane also might contribute to this conductivity increase it was clear that there was no linear increase of the conductivity variation in receiving solution with the nacl concentration increase in feed solution which indicated that the superhydrophobic membrane surface could avoid the salt invasion of feed solution furthermore the trend lines for phenol permeation in receiving solution were almost same during the whole process which indicated that the salinity of feed solution had no effect on phenol separation therefore the permeated phenol in receiving solution was all in the range of 424 2 430 7 mg l under three salinity conditions after 24 h operation the effect of the feed solution salinity on the mass transfer is illustrated in fig 6 b small difference of 0 23 10 6 m s 1 was presented in the calculated k ov at 1st h 1 58 10 6 m s 1 under 10 0 g l nacl 1 36 10 6 under 30 0 g l nacl and 1 43 10 6 under 50 0 g l nacl this was the contribution of different phenol transfer performance between two sides rather than the different salinity in feed solution it was worth mentioning that the difference in mean k ov during 24 h was negligible during separation for different feed solutions in which the phenol permeation performance was almost same as a product of k ov and c f c r the highest and mean mass transfer flux for phenol also exhibited similar tendency in comparison with k ov therefore it could be concluded that salinity of feed solution had no effect on phenol separation 3 4 effect of ph and temperature on mars like membrane contactor fig 7 a and b show the phenol permeation and its mean k ov under different ph value for feed solution the actual phenol concentration in feed solutions was around 1999 8 9 7 mg l with the ph decrease from 5 6 to 4 0 and 2 5 the phenol permeation in receiving solution increased from 427 4 to 494 9 and 521 3 mg l their mean k ov increased from 8 80 10 7 to 9 43 10 7 and 9 88 10 7 m s on the other hand ph variation did not influence the membrane performance for salt rejection 99 97 99 99 as a weak acid phenol would concentrate on its undissociated state rather than its ionic state i e ha h a under the low ph loh et al 2015 in this way membrane adsorption of phenol was enhanced via the hydrogen bond formation when compared with more ionic state phenol the under high ph al muhtaseb et al 2011 as a result ph decrease in feed solution was beneficial for phenol separation as shown in fig 7 c when the feed solution temperature increased from 20 to 30 and 40 c the permeated phenol gradually increased from 427 4 to 524 6 and 580 6 mg l respectively the corresponding mean k ov also showed an increasing tendency from 8 80 10 7 20 c to 1 03 10 6 m s 30 c and 1 06 10 6 m s 40 c fig 7 d it could be concluded that high temperature of feed solution is beneficial for phenol permeation this might be attributed to the enhanced mobility of polymer chains under higher temperature which made phenol diffuse more easily han et al 2001 meanwhile all salt rejections still maintained at a high level 99 97 which indicated no effect of temperature on salt rejection 3 5 long term mars like membrane contactor 3 5 1 continuous operation fig 8 a shows the long term phenol separation performance during 108 h operation the initial phenol and nacl concentrations in feed solution were 2 0 g l actual concentration 1994 5 10 1 mg l and 10 0 g l actual conductivity 16 5 0 1 ms cm respectively during this process only phenol was gradually permeated from high concentration side feed solution to low concentration side receiving solution to achieve the separation of phenol and salt and 760 1 mg l of phenol was collected in receiving solution after 72 h it was also observed that the residual phenol in feed solution gradually decreased when more and more phenol was gradually adsorbed by membrane and permeated into receiving solution the slopes of the resultant plot lines both gradually decreased indicating the corresponding phenol permeation rate from feed to receiving solution also gradually decreased especially during 72nd to 108th h after 108 h residual phenol dropped to 861 5 mg l in feed solution and collected phenol rose to 852 3 mg l in receiving solution resulting in total phenol recovery of 42 6 with 14 3 phenol remained in the electrospun membrane and tubes meanwhile the conductivity variation in receiving solution gradually increased from 0 to 6 19 μs cm during the 108 h of operation this small conductivity increase suggested that the electrospun pdms pmma membrane could be used for long term phenol separation to achieve high salt rejection about 99 95 the corresponding mass transfer values k ov and j ov are also presented in fig 8 b after reaching the highest k ov of 1 5 10 6 m s 1 at 1st h the quick lowering on overall mass transfer coefficient was observed due to the decrease of c f t c r t c f 0 c r 0 later the k ov values gradually maintained around 5 0 10 7 to 7 5 10 7 m s 1 and resulted in a mean value of 6 7 10 7 m s 1 during the whole process three reasons could be summarized to explain this high phenol mass transfer coefficient i the sio units formed the backbone structure of pdms which led the membrane to exhibit high flexibility and thus phenol molecules could transport through the membrane more easily makrodimitri and economou 2008 watson et al 1992 senthilkumar et al 2005 ii the superorganophilicity of membrane made phenol molecules permeate into membrane and be diffused into receiving side more easily iii the small thickness of membrane reduced the permeation path enabling the phenol molecules to transport into receiving side fast this thin membrane was also more sensitive to perceive the concentration variation in two sides which was beneficial in maintaining the transmembrane mass transfer driving force with the decrease of phenol concentration difference between feed and receiving solution the mass transfer driving force gradually decreased which led to the mass transfer flux gradually decreased from 2 6 10 3 1st h to 7 2 10 6 kg m 2 s 1 108th h as described in fig 8 b accompanied with this gradually decreased mass transfer flux the phenol permeation rate also gradually decreased during the operation shown in fig 8 a it could be noted that the k ov seemed slightly increased after 84th h the membrane could be regarded as partial wetted by phenol during the adsorption of phenol more and more adsorbed phenol might fill the fiber and pore of electrospun membrane after 84 h which might make the membrane as liquid membrane of phenol in this way the mass transfer resistance of membrane for phenol might decrease leading to phenol transport the membrane more easily higher k ov 3 5 2 comparison a comparison of phenol mass transfer coefficients in mars process using different membranes was shown in table 2 the mean overall phenol mass transfer coefficient k ov for electrospun pdms pmma membrane in this study was 6 7 10 7 m s 1 without the use of stripping solution this membrane exhibited higher coefficient when compared with commercial pdms tubular membranes han et al 2001 ferreira et al 2002b xiao et al 2006 and some of lab made membranes xiao et al 2013 dastgir et al 2005c loh et al 2015 wang et al 2006 zhu et al 2009 in this process there is no need to use base or acid for the promotion of phenol extraction or regeneration as a result this mars like membrane contactor could save 100 agents for extraction and regeneration in traditional mars moreover the operation cost of this mars like membrane contactor is significantly lower than other membrane separation processes as a temperature free and pressure free membrane process as shown in table 2 the price of used electrospun pdms pmma membrane 33 0 usd m2 was also lower than other commercial tubular pdms membranes 451 8 usd m2 the electrospun pdms pmma membrane appears to be more promising in mars like membrane contactors for pollutant separation with higher mass transfer efficiency simpler operation and lower cost 3 6 membrane stability in another test the electrospun pdms pmma membrane was used to evaluate phenol separation performance in periodic mode which consisted of three cycles of 24 h continuous operation the set concentration of phenol in feed solution was 2 0 g l actual concentration 1996 5 7 9 mg l as shown in fig 9 the permeated phenol in receiving solution gradually increased from 27 3 1st h to 155 7 6th h and 249 6 mg l 12th h with low conductivity variation under 1 74 μs cm finally 427 4 mg l phenol was collected in receiving solution after 24 h operation corresponding with a high salt rejection of 99 98 then di water was used in two sides to clean the membrane for 6 h and the used di water was renewed every 1 h as shown in the sem eds spectra for element na fig 10 a and b 0 32 at 0 37 wt element na was attached on used membrane surface and almost all attached na could be removed after cleaning fig 10 c it was worth noticing that the phenol separation performances in the subsequent second and third cycles were quite stable using the data in first cycle as standard 100 although the permeated phenol concentration was slightly fluctuant in the two cycles especially during the first 6 h the total permeated phenol maintained at the same level 100 5 102 1 when compared with the first cycle exhibiting high membrane stability in the third run the salt rejection even increased to 99 99 which might be caused by no residual solvent would be washed into receiving solution to cause the conductivity increase the performances of phenol separation in three cycles implied that no obvious membrane fouling was observed on the used electrospun pdms pmma membrane ftir transmittance peaks of virgin and used electrospun pdms pmma membranes at various wavelengths are shown in fig 11 to identify the change on membrane structure in virgin membrane sample the transmittance peak around 2960 cm 1 was due to the existence of ch3 functional groups in pdms and pmma the peaks around 1730 1020 and 795 cm 1 were assigned to c o c o and ch2 respectively which were the intrinsic parts of pmma the transmittances around 1260 cm 1 were the characteristic peaks of cooh which might be formed during electrospinning these peak locations of functional groups were in agreement with their reported values in other literature kim and jang 2006 sajjad et al 2016 no new born functional group was observed on the ftir spectrum for used membrane suggesting that no structure change was observed on membrane during phenol separation along with this the corresponding lower transmittance peaks on the used membrane surface indicated the membrane adsorption of phenol these results suggested that the phenol permeation mechanism was membrane adsorption diffusion desorption rather than direct transport through membrane pore this ftir pattern indicated that phenol permeation did not destroy or affect the structure integrity of virgin membrane and therefore the stable separation performance in periodical operation was achieved 4 conclusions in summary the superhydrophobic superorganophilic electrospun pdms pmma membrane was firstly applied in mars like membrane contactor to achieve the phenol separation from saline wastewater similar phenol recovery ratio 21 2 23 9 and high salt rejection 99 96 were achieved even under different concentrations of phenol or salt in 24 h operation revealing that phenol separation performance mainly depended on the membrane nature a high mean phenol mass transfer coefficient of 6 7 10 7 m s 1 was obtained during long term continuous mars like membrane contactor operation accompanied with a total phenol recovery of 42 6 based on the phenol permeation mechanism of adsorption diffusion desorption almost no membrane fouling was detected during periodical operation which exhibited quite stable phenol separation performance these findings become particularly significant in the separation of organic and inorganic pollutants and can contribute in the further application of mars like membrane contactor with easy operation and reasonable price acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the support from the national
