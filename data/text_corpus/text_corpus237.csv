1185,in situ chemical oxidation isco with persulfate an electrically conductive oxidant provides a powerful signal for noninvasive geophysical techniques to characterize the remediation process of hydrocarbon contaminants in this study remediation with isco is conducted in laboratory sandboxes to evaluate the ability of electrical resistivity tomography ert for monitoring the base activated persulfate remediation process of diesel contaminated soil it was found that the resistivity of contaminated sand significantly decreased from 846 ω m to below 10 ω m after persulfate injection and all measured chemical parameters showed a noticeable increase natural degradation and contamination plume migration were not evident in a reference sandbox without treatment the area with a resistivity ratio 0 95 based on imaging before and after injection indicated downward migration of the oxidation plume due to density driven flow a comparison between remediation and reference sandboxes showed that the observed resistivity decrease can be due to both contaminant degradation as well as the oxidation plume itself in the contaminated source zone in contrast the resistivity decrease in the area with low contamination concentration is attributed to the oxidation plume alone the derived relationships between resistivity and contaminant indicators further emphasize that the contribution of contaminant consumption to resistivity change in the source area is 25 6 while it is 16 in the low or non contaminated area although this study showed that resistivity is not solely affected by the chemical transformation of diesel components it can be combined with sampling data to allow an assessment of the effectiveness of isco treatment and to identify target areas for subsequent treatment keywords isco persulfate electrical resistivity tomography diesel contamination data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrocarbon contamination of soil and groundwater represents a threat to the environment and human health the presence of these compounds e g gasoline diesel or lubricants in the environment may be associated with a variety of anthropogenic activities such as oil extraction leaks from storage tanks or pipelines as well as smelting and oily wastewater discharge pinedo et al 2013 besides natural attenuation of contaminants serrano et al 2008 various technologies such as bioremediation imron et al 2020 surfactant flushing karthick et al 2019 and redox degradation flores orozco et al 2015 have been used to remediate soil or groundwater contaminated with hydrocarbons in situ chemical oxidation isco is a soil remediation technique that is highly effective in removing contaminants such as petroleum and halogenated hydrocarbons huling and pivetz 2006 persulfate s2o8 2 is a powerful oxidant with a redox potential e0 of 2 01 v and is more persistent within soil than many other isco oxidants yen et al 2011 in addition persulfate can be activated to further increase its reactivity activation can be achieved by four main methods relying on the addition of hydrogen peroxide ferrous or chelated iron heat or bases to achieve a high ph huling and pivetz 2006 in particular base activation high ph of persulfate has been applied in around 60 of the isco remediation studies with persulfate furman et al 2010 after base activation powerful oxidants can be generated depending on the achieved ph in particular sulfate so4 e0 2 6 v and hydroxyl radicals oh e0 2 7 v huling and pivetz 2006 these radicals with strong oxidizing properties can consume many petroleum contaminants such as benzene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons the implementation of isco remediation techniques at contaminated sites needs to be accompanied by real time monitoring to capture the development of the chemical reaction characteristics of contaminants and oxidants for assessment purposes accurate information about remediation progress is usually constrained by the lack of sampling density the shortcomings of traditional monitoring methods have promoted the application of geophysical methods lekmine et al 2017 the electrical resistivity method is the most commonly used geophysical technique in contaminant studies as the subsurface resistivity depends heavily on the effective porosity saturation and the conductivity of the pore water binley and slater 2020 electrical resistivity tomography ert is a non destructive electrical imaging method that can be used from the surface as well as between boreholes to obtain valuable information about the distribution of the electrical properties of soils and aquifers during resistivity measurements current is injected using two electrodes while the potential difference is measured at two other electrodes kemna et al 2002 for a larger survey area more electrodes are needed and multi channel measurements dahlin and zhou 2006 make the ert method faster and easier to perform in the field ert has been widely used in a range of near surface applications including monitoring of groundwater flow coscia et al 2011 saline water intrusion alpaslan 2021 as well as tracer tests müller et al 2010 several studies have shown the potential of ert measurements on sites contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbon e g sentenac et al 2015 time lapse ert imaging was found to be particularly powerful to monitor temporal changes in subsurface resistivity which is commonly related to the variation of saturation water and or oil temperature and pore fluid composition associated with migration degradation and remediation seferou et al 2013 both numerical and field tests have illustrated that cross borehole surveys are best suited for reconstructing tracer paths and contaminant plumes lekmine et al 2017 several laboratory studies have established a relationship between resistivity and contaminant concentration by mixing different contents of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination with uncontaminated soil e g schmutz et al 2010 for non wetting oil it was found that the measured resistivity correlates well with the hydrocarbon content i e a higher content corresponds to a higher resistivity revil et al 2011 schwartz et al 2012 typically laboratory as well as field studies using ert monitoring of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination have focused on the migration of the contaminant plume halihan et al 2017 deng et al 2017 although previous studies have used electrical resistivity methods to monitor the remediation or degradation processes of petroleum hydrocarbons such as diesel mao et al 2016 monitoring of persulfate remediation has mostly been based on periodic chemical sampling he et al 2022 within this context the aim of the present work is to investigate the ability of ert monitoring of the isco remediation process to evaluate the effectiveness of persulfate remediation in real time diesel was chosen as the hydrocarbon contaminant and the remediation process by base activated persulfate was monitored using cross borehole ert measurements in laboratory experiments specifically the relationship between diesel content and resistivity is first verified by sand column measurements and then two parallel sandbox experiments were conducted for both remediation and reference sandbox tests the resistivity changes of diesel contaminated soil were monitored together with hydrochemical indicators additionally contaminant indicators of soil and water samples from the two sandboxes were measured after the monitoring experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and materials two identical sandboxes were designed for monitoring experiments i e a remediation sandbox with persulfate injection and a reference sandbox the dimensions of both sandboxes are 51 cm high 60 cm long 10 cm thick fig 1 non polarizing ag agcl electrodes 4 mm in diameter were fixed to the inner wall of the sandbox in 4 rows with 16 electrodes each fig 1 the vertical spacing between electrodes was 2 7 cm and the lowest electrode was located 3 8 cm above the bottom of the sandbox only the tip of each electrode was allowed to have contact with the porous media and the remaining of the electrode was wrapped with insulated epoxy mao et al 2015 to mimic a point measurement to the extent possible two measurement tubes were set up on both sides of the sandbox for hydrochemical monitoring during the experiment the lower 8 cm segment was punched similar to a well screen to allow water sampling the persulfate injection tube with a 5 mm inner diameter was located in the center of the remediation sandbox and the lower 10 cm was punched with holes for persulfate outflow while the bottom of the tube was sealed to allow only horizontal flow all these components were made of pmma to minimize electrical disturbances all experiments were performed at room temperature 25 2 c quartz sand with a median grain diameter of d50 500 10 μm a porosity of 0 41 0 02 and a bulk density of 5 076 g cm3 was used for all experiments china macklin co ltd the difference between the column s unsaturated and saturated weight was used to determine its porosity and the ratio of weight to volume was used to determine its bulk density the maximum capillary rise of the quartz sand was 15 cm determined using the standpipe method before the experiments the quartz sand was washed with distilled water and dried at 90 c for 12 h the sand was saturated with an nacl electrolyte with an electrical conductivity of 45 ms m the chemical substances sodium persulfate na2s2o8 analytical reagent ar 99 7 purity sodium hydroxide naoh ar and sodium chloride nacl ar were acquired from macklin co ltd of shanghai china diesel fuel was purchased from the chinese petroleum corporation china and its composition and characteristics are similar to those of diesel fuel no 1 reported by gad 2005 it is composed of about 75 saturated hydrocarbons e g alkanes cnh2n 2 cycloalkanes cnh2n and 25 aromatic hydrocarbons e g mono aromatic hydrocarbon cnh2n 6 the diesel used in the experiments has a density between 0 82 and 0 86 g ml typical atomic mass concentrations are approximately 86 c 14 h and a small amount of sulfur depending on the crude oil source and cleaning quality accordingly the average chemical formula for diesel ranges from about c10h20 to c15h28 2 2 column experiments bulk electrical conductivity of porous media can be influenced by both surface conductivity and pore fluid conductivity and these two contributions cannot easily be separated in resistivity measurements lesmes and frye 2001 therefore additional column experiments were conducted to separate the effects of surface conductivity and diesel content for this laboratory columns similar to those reported by mellage et al 2018 were used the ontash psip instrument http www ontash com was used for complex resistivity measurements using a four electrode configuration resistivity magnitude ρ 1 σ in ω m and phase shift φ in mrad were measured at 19 log frequency intervals between 0 001 and 1000 hz four different diesel concentrations were used i e 0 0 g kg 10 6 g kg 63 5 g kg and 105 9 g kg based on the proportions of diesel and electrolyte the desired oil and water saturations were obtained and the content of diesel in the sand was calculated while the porosity was assumed to be constant this resulted in a water saturation of 1 00 0 95 0 70 and 0 50 for the four different diesel concentrations note that the electrolyte was added to sand first and diesel was then added which was consistent with the procedure for the preparation of samples with non wetting oil reported by revil et al 2011 following the mixing we packed the mixture tightly in the column similar packing procedures can be found in previous studies e g schwartz et al 2012 after all columns were measured about 5 pore volumes of base activated persulfate solution consisting of 3 m sodium hydroxide and 0 5 m persulfate was injected into the sand column with a diesel content of 105 9 g kg using a peristaltic pump and the complex resistivity response was measured again 2 3 diesel contaminated sand and base activated persulfate remediation diesel was selected as the contaminant in this study are due to its low toxicity relatively low volatility and its similar electrical characteristics to other hydrocarbons the diesel contaminated sand used in the sandbox experiments was prepared in the same way as in the column experiments using a diesel content of 105 9 g kg the pore space was fully saturated with nacl electrolyte for uncontaminated sand similar to the packing method in the column experiments the sand was put into the sandbox after saturation and was manually compressed by a rectangular plate during the packing process the boundaries between contaminated and uncontaminated sand were stabilized by two thin plates during sample preparation which were removed after packing the contaminated sand was packed in the middle of the sandboxes x 26 34 cm z 20 42 cm fig 1a the whole packing process was completed within 40 min the filling height of the sand was 50 cm and the water level in the monitoring tubes on both sides was 25 5 cm thus we assumed that the initial saturation height was 40 5 cm water level height of 25 5 cm and 15 cm capillary rise to minimize evaporation the top layer of sand was covered with a 1 cm thick layer of silt and the surface was covered with plastic wrap sodium hydroxide was used to activate the persulfate the radicals generated in the base activated persulfate system are sulfate so4 hydroxyl oh and superoxide radicals o2 e0 0 33 v watts 2011 liang and guo 2012 the alkaline ph environment promotes the following activating reactions 1 na 2 s 2 o 8 h 2 o so 5 2 so 4 2 2h 2 so 5 2 h 2 o base ho 2 so 4 2 h 3 s 2 o 8 2 ho 2 so 4 so 4 2 h o 2 the net reaction of base activated persulfate decomposition is summarized as furman et al 2010 4 2s 2 o 8 2 2h 2 o 3so 4 2 so 4 o 2 4h in conditions with ph 10 formation of so4 may promote the formation of oh initiating a series of radical propagation and termination chain reactions in which organic compounds can be transformed liang and lee 2008 5 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 oh h 6 so 4 oh so 4 2 oh the simultaneous generation of so4 oh and o2 leads to the generation of molecular oxygen furman et al 2010 watts 2011 i e 7 oh o 2 o 2 oh 8 so 4 o 2 o 2 so 4 2 thus superoxide o2 is reductive and may constrain the effects of hydroxyl oh and sulfate radicals so4 so4 and oh have been reported to play a dominant role in the degradation of diesel although sulfate radicals are highly oxidizing they are more likely to react with short chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and mono or lower cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in diesel by hydrogen extraction eq 9 or electron transfer eq 10 to produce oxidized organic compounds waldemer et al 2007 zhao et al 2013 in contrast hydroxyl radicals can react with most components including those that cannot be oxidized by sulfate radicals thus contributing to the breaking of cc bonds eq 11 or extracting hydrogen from ch bonds eq 12 the resulting degradation reactions can be written as cronk 2008 9 so 4 rh r hso 4 10 so 4 rh rh hso 4 11 oh rh r h 2 o 12 oh rh rh 2 o where rh represents the organic carbon compounds and r rh and rh2o represent the oxidized organic compounds to investigate base activated persulfate remediation of diesel contaminated soil 0 5 m sodium persulfate and 3 m sodium hydroxide 250 ml of each solution were mixed and immediately injected into the remediation sandbox using a peristaltic pump 20 ml min on day 21 after sample preparation the ratio of persulfate to sodium hydroxide was similar to furman et al 2010 the summary statistics of sandbox experiment are shown in table 1 2 4 data acquisition and processing resistivity measurements were conducted seven times throughout the monitoring experiment at day 11 21 38 55 115 149 and 181 measurements were collected in triplicates using a skip two and skip four measuring protocol slater et al 2000 for each current electrode pairs ab potential electrode pairs mn were selected with the same skip for example for the skip two protocol for ab 1 and 4 potential electrode pairs mn 5 and 8 6 and 9 and so on were measured while for the skip four protocol for ab 1 and 6 mn 7 and 12 8 and 13 and so on were measured in this way the measurement array also contained reciprocal measurements e g for ab 1 and 4 mn 5 and 8 while the corresponding reciprocal measurement array is ab 5 and 8 mn 1 and 4 each between borehole dataset contained 1112 measurements e g 1112 measurements for electrodes 1 32 17 48 and 33 64 respectively consequently 3336 resistance data were measured to cover the whole sandbox the resistivity measurements were made with the multi channel abem terrameter ls2 instrument http www guidelinegeo com the acquisition time for all dataset was 35 min the inversion was performed using a 3d finite element code written in the comsol and matlab environments mao et al 2015 we assumed no resistivity variation in the y direction due to the small sandbox thickness therefore the inversion results are presented as 2d tomograms besides geophysical measurements chemical parameters were measured on the left and right sides of each sandbox the interval during the first 40 days was 4 days while the interval was increased to 15 days after 40 days due to insignificant changes in the measured chemical parameters the investigated parameters included oxidation reduction potential orp ph dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity orp ph and do were measured using a multi parameter analyzer leici dzb 715 china and electrical conductivity was measured using a conductivity meter ectestr 11 usa at the end of the experiment eight positions in each sandbox s1 s8 and s9 s16 were selected to collect soil samples in addition water samples w1 w2 and w3 w4 were collected at the bottom of both sides of each sandbox using water outlet valves fig 1a the soil samples were analyzed for total organic carbon toc and total petroleum hydrocarbons tph while water samples were analyzed for petroleum chemical oxygen demand cod and anion concentrations so4 2 and hco3 the toc in the soil samples was measured using a potassium dichromate oxidation spectrophotometric method and the tph in these samples was determined using a gas chromatography method the petroleum cod so4 2 and hco3 concentration in the water samples were determined by infrared spectrophotometry dichromate ion chromatography and titration methods respectively the selection of chemical parameters followed the geological survey and evaluation standards for soil and groundwater in contaminated sites china geological survey 2014 3 results 3 1 effect of diesel contamination on complex resistivity the results of the column experiments indicate that the resistivity and the phase increase with diesel content fig 2 i e the oil saturation this is consistent with results described by cassiani et al 2009 and schmutz et al 2010 for non wetting oil the values of the resistivity magnitude and the phase peak are provided in table 2 the resistivity increased from 82 6 ω m for 0 0 g kg diesel content sw 1 to 745 2 ω m for 105 9 g kg diesel content sw 0 5 the peak phase increased from 2 36 mrad for 0 0 g kg diesel content to 6 6 mrad for 105 9 g kg diesel content moreover a shift in peak frequency from 0 022 hz at 0 0 g kg diesel to 0 0046 hz at 105 9 g kg diesel content was observed these features are well explained by the model developed by schmutz et al 2010 after the injection of base activated persulfate into the sand column with 105 9 g kg diesel content the resistivity decreased significantly from 745 2 ω m to about 2 6 ω m while a phase measurement with sufficient accuracy could not be obtained this is because the activated persulfate produces a large number of ions and the resulting high salinity environment is not favorable for accurate complex resistivity measurements xia et al 2021 niu et al 2016 the interpretation of ert inversion results in contaminant studies is sometimes complicated by geological heterogeneity which can produce resistivity differences that are stronger than those associated with the presence of the oil itself deng et al 2017 to ensure sufficient contrast in this study a high diesel content of 105 9 g kg was used in the sandbox experiments with this level of contamination the resistivity of the contaminated sand is about 9 times higher than that of clean water saturated sand 3 2 results of electrical resistivity tomography measurements on sandboxes a total of seven resistivity measurements were taken over a six month period the reciprocal errors of all datasets are summarized in fig 3 reciprocal error refers to the relative error of data obtained from two sets of reciprocal measurements the data quality obtained in the remediation sandbox is slightly worse than that of reference sandbox which is particularly evident before and after persulfate injection specifically the reciprocal errors is below 2 on day 11 before persulfate injection for 85 4 of the measurements and this percentage is reduced to 80 8 on day 21 after persulfate injection for the reference sandbox the percentage of measurements with errors 2 is similar on day 11 and 21 85 3 and 85 7 respectively which is also consistent with the percentage obtained before persulfate injection for the remediation sandbox it is important to note that the overall data quality is generally acceptable loke et al 2015 with at least 98 7 of reciprocal errors 5 for the reference sandbox and at least 96 6 of reciprocal errors 5 for the remediation sandbox time lapse ert inversion results are presented in fig 4 at the end of the monitoring experiment day 181 the water level in the reference sandbox was 24 3 cm and the water level in the remediation sandbox was slightly higher at 25 1 cm due to the persulfate injection therefore the saturation heights red dashed lines were also slightly different with 39 3 cm for the reference sandbox and 40 1 cm for the remediation sandbox before persulfate injection the resistivity distributions are similar for the remediation and reference sandbox specifically the resistivity within the black rectangle ranges from 575 ω m to 1200 ω m with an average value of 846 ω m corresponding to the diesel contaminated sand which is 150 ω m higher than the surrounding resistivity after persulfate injection day 21 in the remediation sandbox the resistivity decreased significantly especially at the injection port where the resistivity reached values lower than 10 ω m which is consistent with the results of the sand column experiments in addition it was also observed that a low resistivity plume migrated to the left and right side beyond the originally contaminated area immediately after injection as time progressed this plume was observed to gradually expand and migrate downwards from day 38 to 181 in addition the resistivity of the unsaturated zone above 39 cm in the two sandboxes gradually increased which is attributed to water evaporation over the experimental period the resistivity around the contaminated sand shows an increase in both vertical and horizontal directions at the end of the experiment in the reference sandbox however these increases are only minor suggesting that diesel migration is not significant sentenac et al 2015 also reported limited migration of hydrocarbons in a similar sandbox experiment also in the presence of a hydraulic gradient from left to right that may lead to diesel migration by advection therefore the lack of migration in our experiments with diffusion dominated diesel transport is not surprising in addition the gentle resistivity variation also indicates that the natural degradation of contaminated sand is not significant note that the high resistivity response of at the top of sandbox is not only caused by evaporation but also may be caused by upward movement of free phase diesel 3 3 chemical analysis and sampling results orp ph do and conductivity are important indicators to characterize the oxidation reactions and fig 5 shows their variation during the remediation and reference experiment in general all chemical parameters measured on day 21 in the remediation sandbox showed a noticeable jump due to the injection of persulfate while the results for the reference sandbox showed a slight downward trend specifically the orp measured on day 21 in the remediation sandbox was 417 mv which was higher than that measured in the reference sandbox 263 mv saturated with nacl electrolyte these results are consistent with experiments conducted by zhao et al 2013 who showed that the orp of the base activated persulfate reaction system ph 12 in laboratory vials was 562 17 mv while the background value without persulfate was 367 mv the increased orp reflects the oxidative properties of persulfate with respect to ph it is evident that highly alkaline conditions ph 13 were created after base activated persulfate injection in these conditions it is expected that superoxide o2 hydroxyl oh and sulfate radicals so4 were generated at the same time o2 radicals were likely scavenged by oh radicals through the reaction given in eq 7 similarly so4 radicals were removed through the reaction given in eq 8 this resulted in the generation of one mole of o2 per mole of generated o2 furman et al 2010 hayyan et al 2016 additionally persulfate dissolves in water and then reacts with water to produce a small amount of o2 which is another reason for the increase in do 13 2na 2 s 2 o 8 2h 2 o 2na 4so 4 2 4h o 2 therefore the do measured in the remediation sandbox increased by approximately 38 5 after persulfate injection 9 5 mg l compared to that measured before persulfate injection 6 86 mg l and reference sandbox 6 85 mg l in addition consumption of hydroxide as well as the decomposition and activation of persulfate release hydrogen ions and other anions e g so4 2 hco3 or co3 2 which leads to a decrease of ph and an increase of conductivity huang et al 2002 li et al 2020 chang et al 2022 at the same time persulfate consumption results in a decrease of orp and do although the monitoring tubes are not located in the direct vicinity of the persulfate injection the measured data still reflect the general chemical variations in the sandboxes it is anticipated that the changes in the chemical parameters near the injection tube will be even more dramatic at the same time the difference in position also explains why the change of chemical parameters is insignificant in the early stages and more evident in the later stages i e it takes time for the plume to migrate to the water sampling ports the chemical parameters measured in soil and water samples at the end of the experiments are shown in table 3 see fig 1 for sampling points the results of the soil samples suggest that the hydroxyl and sulfate radicals formed by base activated persulfate resulted in substantial degradation of diesel especially near the outflow holes for example the measured toc and tph at location s1 in the remediation sandbox is 1 73 g kg and 1 67 g kg respectively this was much lower than the concentrations measured at the same location s9 in the reference sandbox where the toc was 36 1 g kg and the tph was 33 8 g kg the degradation products are eventually mineralized and converted into co2 or metabolic byproducts arato et al 2014 for instance the degradation reactions of benzene a component of diesel with so4 and oh are liu et al 2016 14 so 4 c 6 h 6 c 6 h 6 so 4 2 15 oh c 6 h 6 c 6 h 7 o in addition short chain aliphatic hydrocarbons e g decane which are another major component of diesel undergo hydrogen extraction from the ch bonds when reacting with so4 and oh 16 so 4 c 10 h 22 c 6 h 11 hso 4 17 oh c 10 h 22 c 10 h 21 h 2 o the net chemical reactions in which benzene and decane are completely degraded by persulfate are 18 15 s 2 o 8 2 c 6 h 6 12 h 2 o 6co 2 30 h 30 so 4 2 19 31 s 2 o 8 2 c 10 h 22 20 h 2 o 10 co 2 62 h 62 so 4 2 we assume that c12h23 is the average chemical formula for diesel which does not contain structural information but only takes into account the carbon hydrogen ratio gad 2005 i e c12h23 does not refer to alkynes or alkenes alone but is composed of various hydrocarbons accordingly the net chemical reaction of diesel consumption by persulfate can be expressed as 20 71 s 2 o 8 2 2c 12 h 23 48 h 2 o 24 co 2 14 2h 14 2so 4 2 this net reaction is consistent with the observed chemical parameters after degradation in the remediation sandbox the tph and toc of the soil samples decreased compared to the reference sandbox while the so4 2 and hco3 concentrations in the water samples increased table 3 considering that hco3 was not present in the electrolyte used to prepare the sample it is likely to be a degradation product from the oxidation of diesel wu 2021 accordingly the degradation of diesel by persulfate releases a large number of ions causing an increase in so4 2 and hco3 concentrations measured at locations w1 and w2 compared to locations w3 and w4 e g the average concentration of so4 2 and hco3 in water samples collected from the remediation sandbox are 3235 mg l and 793 mg l while those measured in the reference sandbox are 14 mg l and 204 mg l although diesel is characterized by low solubility a small fraction of dissolved phase still is expected to occur in the saturated zone atekwana and atekwana 2010 the average values of the petroleum concentration and cod in the reference sandbox were 2 3 mg l and 139 5 mg l which are higher than those measured in the remediation sandbox where dissolved diesel components were likely oxidated 4 discussion 4 1 migration pathway of oxidation plume based on the column and sandbox experiments it is evident that the persulfate remediation system causes a significant resistivity decrease to better capture the observed changes in resistivity caused by the persulfate injection resistivity ratio tomograms are presented in fig 6 the measurements before the injection day 11 were used as a reference persulfate injection caused a decrease in resistivity in a significant part of the sandbox as indicated by the area with resistivity ratio 1 although the reciprocal error indicates that the quality of data acquisition is acceptable we nevertheless prefer to take a conservative approach and assume that the area with a resistivity ratio 0 95 is affected by oxidation plume migration blue solid lines considering that the injection locations 20 30 cm are distributed on the side walls of a tube sealed at the bottom persulfate is expected to radially spread away from the injection tube at the center following the persulfate injection at day 21 the resistivity ratio near the outflow locations was 0 1 and the tomogram suggests that the migration distance of persulfate in horizontal direction x 16 44 cm was larger than in the vertical direction z 10 34 cm since persulfate has a high solubility in water 73 g 100 ml at 25 c and the density e g 2 59 g ml for sodium persulfate at 25 c is greater than water yen et al 2011 persulfate solution with a high concentration can migrate due to density driven transport huling and pivetz 2006 this is also observed in the remediation sandbox after 17 days of persulfate injection day 38 the oxidation plume has clearly migrated downward and it reached the bottom of the sandbox on day 115 given the slow migration of the contaminant it is clear from eq 1 6 13 and 20 that the main components of this oxidation plume stem from the persulfate remediation system and ions released by the associated chemical reactions in the later stages of the experiment after the plume reached the bottom of the sandbox especially on day 149 and 181 the oxidation plume gradually migrated outward to both sides again under the influence of concentration differences although the lateral migration distance of persulfate during injection was greater than that in vertical direction due to the high injection pressure the oxidation plume was dominated by vertical migration due to density driven transport the results clearly showed that this general migration pathway of the persulfate could easily be captured by the electrical resistivity distribution which highlights the potential of time lapse ert images for capturing the delivery and fate of persulfate in isco remediation in field conditions it should be noted that parts of unsaturated zone above 39 cm have a resistivity ratio 1 indicating that the resistivity of this area has increased after injection compared with that before injection besides evaporation considering that surface is covered with silt the capillary rise phenomenon may drive a small amount of free phase diesel to migrate upward 4 2 influence of diesel degradation on the resistivity distribution the resistivity monitoring results for the reference sandbox indicate that natural degradation and migration of the contaminated plume are limited during the entire experiment to further illustrate this the resistivity difference ρ reference ρ remediation between sandboxes is analyzed to characterize the resistivity response caused by persulfate remediation alone fig 7 clearly the resistivity of the reference sandbox is higher than that of the remediation sandbox everywhere specifically the results illustrate that the largest differences 600 ω m correspond to the location of the outflow within the contaminated sand white solid rectangle at these locations the average resistivity difference for the two sandboxes is about 1010 ω m obviously the resistivity difference within the contaminated sand is not only related to the change of diesel concentration but also to the oxidation plume the blue solid lines in fig 6 show the area of oxidation plume migration z 34 cm derived from a resistivity ratio 0 95 see fig 6 at the same time the red solid lines delineate the area below the height of plume migration with a resistivity difference above 80 ω m the average resistivity difference within the red solid lines excluding the contaminated sand in the black rectangle is 126 7 ω m much less than the difference calculated at the location of contaminated sand moreover the similar contour shapes of the red and blue solid lines suggest that unlike the resistivity difference of contaminated sand the difference between the two sandboxes within the red solid lines is mainly influenced by the migration of the oxidation plume in addition the average resistivity difference of the unsaturated zone z 39 cm above red dashed line is small compared to that of the saturated zone to characterize the resistivity variations in even more detail fig 8 shows the temporal development of the resistivity difference between the two sandboxes at x 30 cm and various z positions black dashed line in fig 7 based on the observed resistivity differences we identified four zones below the contaminated sand 0 20 cm bottom of the contaminated sand 20 30 cm top of the contaminated sand 30 42 cm and above the contaminated sand 42 51 cm in the zone below the contaminated sand the resistivity difference is increasing with time fig 8b the oxidation plume gradually migrates downward in the early stages before day 55 due to density which explains the increase of the resistivity difference the oxidation plume partly consists of ions that are continuously released by the degradation reaction therefore the plume continues to extend to both sides under the effect of concentration differences resulting in a flat overall change in the later stages of the experiment this is consistent with the fact that the hydrochemical parameters measured in the monitoring tubes are low until day 50 60 the resistivity difference of the area with contaminated sand shows two opposite trends for the bottom part of the contaminated sand the resistivity difference between the two sandboxes is decreasing with time from 1062 3 ω m to 972 3 ω m fig 8b due to the migration of the oxidation plume thus we speculate that besides the oxidation plume the consumption of contaminants and the generation of degradation products are the main reasons for the resistivity difference in this area with respect to the top part of the contaminated sand a small amount of persulfate migrates upward under the effect of injection pressure see day 21 in fig 6 as a result degradation and the corresponding resistivity difference decreases with increasing distance from the injection position i e the resistivity difference decreases with increasing elevation on the other hand the increase in resistivity difference at z 38 cm and z 41 cm is the main reason for the increasing trend of the average resistivity difference fig 8b this is related to the difference in saturation height of the reference sandbox 39 3 cm and the remediation sandbox 40 1 cm fig 7 for the unsaturated zone above the contaminated sand the resistivity difference between the two sandboxes shows a gradual but insignificant increasing trend slope 4 16 and r2 0 55 however it should be noted that this part does not involve diesel contamination or oxidation plume migration and the average resistivity difference is only 60 ω m overall the resistivity differences between the reference and remediation sandboxes are related to changes in concentration of the contaminant migration of the oxidation plume and evaporation at the surface for the contaminated source zone near the injection well consumption of contaminants generation of degradation products and migration of the oxidation plume are determining the decrease in resistivity after persulfate injection for the non contaminated areas around the source zone the migration of the oxidation plume is determining the decrease in resistivity for field scale isco remediation it can thus be concluded that resistivity changes in areas with low initial contamination concentration are expected to be mainly related to the migration of the oxidation plume making it difficult to discern the degradation of contaminants there are only few studies on ert monitoring of base activated persulfate degradation of hydrocarbon contaminated soils taking a similar case as an example harte et al 2012 had conducted geophysical monitoring of in situ permanganate remediation process of pce at field scale speculated that the low resistivity response was due to oxidant and guessed that the resistivity decrease due to contaminant degradation was estimated to account for only 5 10 4 3 effect of oxidation plume on resistivity of contaminated soil as the diesel concentration and the oxidation plume are the main drivers of the decrease of the resistivity it is important to understand the relationship between resistivity and contaminant concentration in the presence of the oxidizing plume the relationships between resistivity and the chemical parameters indicating contamination tph and toc obtained from reference sandbox are shown in fig 9 and the data from remediation sandbox black solid rectangle are also shown in the figure here resistivity is the average value within the sampling area for the reference sandbox the resistivity is expected to be related to the contaminant concentration based on the sand column experiments and previous studies revil et al 2011 schwartz et al 2012 mao et al 2016 this is confirmed by fig 9 which shows a relationship between resistivity and tph and toc of the soil samples s9 s16 in reference sandbox with relatively high explained variance r2 0 94 and 0 97 as expected resistivity increased with increasing tph and toc for the remediation sandbox the relationships between resistivity and the chemical parameters indicating contamination are less pronounced which reflects the degradation effect of persulfate on diesel contamination note that both s1 and s6 are located in the area above the height of oxidation plume migration z 34 cm which means that the resistivity is less affected by the plume the other sampling locations are all below the height of the area affected by the oxidation plume and the resistivity is lower than expected under the influence of the plume accordingly it is difficult to accurately distinguish the contamination and the oxidation plume based on the resistivity alone likewise resistivity can be influenced by the contaminated source and plume zones in a field survey but it cannot directly distinguish these zones e g elis et al 2016 based on the fitting line calculated from the reference sandbox data the relationship model between resistivity and tph without in situ remediation is shown as follows 21 ρ 0 089 c tph 168 4 where ρ represents the calculated resistivity without in situ remediation c tph is the concentration of tph respectively in this study the deviation between measured resistivity and calculated resistivity is caused by migration of oxidant plume therefore the influence ratio of oxidant plume i o is 22 i o ρ ρ measure ρ 100 while the influence ratio of contaminant consumption i c is 23 i c 1 i o 100 for remediation sandbox the influence ratio of oxidant and contaminant consumption on resistivity decrease at difference locations are shown in table 4 note that the influence ratios of different factor are calculated by average deviation of tph for the areas above the height of the persulfate outflow hole e g s1 and s6 the oxidant plume has a smaller effect on resistivity decrease than contaminant consumption for the contaminated source zone near the injection well i e s2 although the influence of oxidant plume is dominant contaminant consumption contributes to 25 6 of the resistivity decrease for area with low or non contaminated area the influence of contaminant consumption on resistivity decrease is 16 the ratio calculated based on the relationship between toc and resistivity is similar to the ratio shown in table 4 although the half life of persulfate is 10 to 20 days when reacting with hydrocarbon contaminants in water watts 2011 the degradation rate of diesel within soil by base activated persulfate can vary considerably due to different reaction conditions and contamination types specifically previous studies illustrated that aromatic and short chain aliphatic hydrocarbons in diesel are more easily degraded by persulfate in contrast long chain aliphatic hydrocarbons are considered to be the least degradable due to limited hydrophobicity and strong sorption on the soil siegrist et al 2011 for example lominchar et al 2018 reported that dodecane tetradecane pentadecane and aromatic hydrocarbons were essentially degraded by base activated persulfate in the first 4 days while aliphatic hydrocarbons with carbon numbers above 16 were more recalcitrant and still present in small amounts at the end of the treatment after 56 days to obtain contaminant information during persulfate remediation resistivity measurements should thus be combined with sampling data for comprehensive analysis in the field ert method has advantages and challenges to dynamically monitor the in situ remediation process of contaminants on one hand it utilizes multiple monitoring modes i e surface cross borehole or in a combination of cross borehole surface and is able to delineate the resistivity changes over a wide remediation area especially the migration range of oxidants plume this means ert can quickly identify the area not covered by oxidant for secondary injection and can improve efficiency while reducing sampling costs on the other hand it is difficult to directly distinguish the effects of oxidant plume and contaminant consumption on resistivity decrease and a comprehensive analysis combined with sampling data is usually required this study quantified the effect of hydrocarbon removal on resistivity change based on well controlled conditions e g the contribution of contaminant consumption to resistivity change in the source area is 25 6 while it is 16 in the low or non contaminated area however this contribution is related to the soil characteristics the type and concentration of contaminant and oxidant thus it may vary in the field or other laboratory conditions 5 conclusion this study directly visualized the remediation of diesel contaminated soil by base activated persulfate using cross borehole ert measurements and evaluated the capability of resistivity measurements for characterizing oxidation plume migration and contaminant degradation since the resistivity response is affected by diesel content and the presence of persulfate two sandbox experiments were conducted to compare the resistivity distribution of diesel contaminated sand with and without the persulfate remediation system to support the interpretation of the resistivity measurements hydrochemical measurements were made periodically the results indicated that the resistivity was significantly decreased in response to persulfate injection for the remediation sandbox e g from 846 ω m to below 10 ω m for contaminated sand natural degradation and contaminant plume migration were not evident for the reference sandbox without persulfate injection the chemical parameters i e orp ph do and conductivity showed a noticeable increase due to the oxidant injection while the parameters measured in the reference sandbox showed a gentle and slightly downward trend moreover the results of soil and water samples suggested that the hydroxyl and sulfate radicals formed by base activated persulfate resulted in substantial degradation of diesel producing a large number of ions that further decreased the resistivity resistivity ratio tomograms allowed to delineate the area affected by oxidation plume migration it was observed that the persulfate plume mainly migrated vertically due to density driven distribution after an initial phase of horizontal flow associated with the high pressure injection in addition the resistivity difference between the contaminated areas of the two sandboxes was related to the change in contaminant concentration and the migration of the oxidation plume in the contaminated source zone near the injection well consumption of contaminants generation of degradation products and migration of the oxidation plume determined the decrease in resistivity after persulfate injection while in the low or non contaminated area around the source zone the oxidation plume was dominant for the decrease in resistivity it was found that the resistivity correlates well with the contaminant indicators i e tph and toc however the resistivity corresponding to contaminated indicators was generally lower than expected in the presence of the oxidation plume this further illustrates that resistivity changes due to the decrease of contaminant concentrations after degradation are still influenced by the oxidation plume even in the source zone near the injection well concretely for the contaminated source zone near the injection well contaminant consumption contributes to 25 6 of the resistivity decrease while for area with low or non contaminated area the influence of contaminant consumption on resistivity change is 16 it is difficult to capture the characteristics of chemical reactions at the pore scale using the ert method an extension of ert is the induced polarization ip method which is more sensitive to properties at the pore scale future research should thus additionally consider the ip response during isco remediation e g to characterize chemical reactions of the diesel degradation process it is necessary to design the periodic contaminant concentration tests for direct comparison of ip parameter changes with degradation processes nevertheless the ert monitoring results presented above for diesel remediation clearly show resistivity responses that are related to the effects of oxidation plume migration and changes in contaminant concentration which has not been

1185,in situ chemical oxidation isco with persulfate an electrically conductive oxidant provides a powerful signal for noninvasive geophysical techniques to characterize the remediation process of hydrocarbon contaminants in this study remediation with isco is conducted in laboratory sandboxes to evaluate the ability of electrical resistivity tomography ert for monitoring the base activated persulfate remediation process of diesel contaminated soil it was found that the resistivity of contaminated sand significantly decreased from 846 ω m to below 10 ω m after persulfate injection and all measured chemical parameters showed a noticeable increase natural degradation and contamination plume migration were not evident in a reference sandbox without treatment the area with a resistivity ratio 0 95 based on imaging before and after injection indicated downward migration of the oxidation plume due to density driven flow a comparison between remediation and reference sandboxes showed that the observed resistivity decrease can be due to both contaminant degradation as well as the oxidation plume itself in the contaminated source zone in contrast the resistivity decrease in the area with low contamination concentration is attributed to the oxidation plume alone the derived relationships between resistivity and contaminant indicators further emphasize that the contribution of contaminant consumption to resistivity change in the source area is 25 6 while it is 16 in the low or non contaminated area although this study showed that resistivity is not solely affected by the chemical transformation of diesel components it can be combined with sampling data to allow an assessment of the effectiveness of isco treatment and to identify target areas for subsequent treatment keywords isco persulfate electrical resistivity tomography diesel contamination data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydrocarbon contamination of soil and groundwater represents a threat to the environment and human health the presence of these compounds e g gasoline diesel or lubricants in the environment may be associated with a variety of anthropogenic activities such as oil extraction leaks from storage tanks or pipelines as well as smelting and oily wastewater discharge pinedo et al 2013 besides natural attenuation of contaminants serrano et al 2008 various technologies such as bioremediation imron et al 2020 surfactant flushing karthick et al 2019 and redox degradation flores orozco et al 2015 have been used to remediate soil or groundwater contaminated with hydrocarbons in situ chemical oxidation isco is a soil remediation technique that is highly effective in removing contaminants such as petroleum and halogenated hydrocarbons huling and pivetz 2006 persulfate s2o8 2 is a powerful oxidant with a redox potential e0 of 2 01 v and is more persistent within soil than many other isco oxidants yen et al 2011 in addition persulfate can be activated to further increase its reactivity activation can be achieved by four main methods relying on the addition of hydrogen peroxide ferrous or chelated iron heat or bases to achieve a high ph huling and pivetz 2006 in particular base activation high ph of persulfate has been applied in around 60 of the isco remediation studies with persulfate furman et al 2010 after base activation powerful oxidants can be generated depending on the achieved ph in particular sulfate so4 e0 2 6 v and hydroxyl radicals oh e0 2 7 v huling and pivetz 2006 these radicals with strong oxidizing properties can consume many petroleum contaminants such as benzene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons the implementation of isco remediation techniques at contaminated sites needs to be accompanied by real time monitoring to capture the development of the chemical reaction characteristics of contaminants and oxidants for assessment purposes accurate information about remediation progress is usually constrained by the lack of sampling density the shortcomings of traditional monitoring methods have promoted the application of geophysical methods lekmine et al 2017 the electrical resistivity method is the most commonly used geophysical technique in contaminant studies as the subsurface resistivity depends heavily on the effective porosity saturation and the conductivity of the pore water binley and slater 2020 electrical resistivity tomography ert is a non destructive electrical imaging method that can be used from the surface as well as between boreholes to obtain valuable information about the distribution of the electrical properties of soils and aquifers during resistivity measurements current is injected using two electrodes while the potential difference is measured at two other electrodes kemna et al 2002 for a larger survey area more electrodes are needed and multi channel measurements dahlin and zhou 2006 make the ert method faster and easier to perform in the field ert has been widely used in a range of near surface applications including monitoring of groundwater flow coscia et al 2011 saline water intrusion alpaslan 2021 as well as tracer tests müller et al 2010 several studies have shown the potential of ert measurements on sites contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbon e g sentenac et al 2015 time lapse ert imaging was found to be particularly powerful to monitor temporal changes in subsurface resistivity which is commonly related to the variation of saturation water and or oil temperature and pore fluid composition associated with migration degradation and remediation seferou et al 2013 both numerical and field tests have illustrated that cross borehole surveys are best suited for reconstructing tracer paths and contaminant plumes lekmine et al 2017 several laboratory studies have established a relationship between resistivity and contaminant concentration by mixing different contents of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination with uncontaminated soil e g schmutz et al 2010 for non wetting oil it was found that the measured resistivity correlates well with the hydrocarbon content i e a higher content corresponds to a higher resistivity revil et al 2011 schwartz et al 2012 typically laboratory as well as field studies using ert monitoring of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination have focused on the migration of the contaminant plume halihan et al 2017 deng et al 2017 although previous studies have used electrical resistivity methods to monitor the remediation or degradation processes of petroleum hydrocarbons such as diesel mao et al 2016 monitoring of persulfate remediation has mostly been based on periodic chemical sampling he et al 2022 within this context the aim of the present work is to investigate the ability of ert monitoring of the isco remediation process to evaluate the effectiveness of persulfate remediation in real time diesel was chosen as the hydrocarbon contaminant and the remediation process by base activated persulfate was monitored using cross borehole ert measurements in laboratory experiments specifically the relationship between diesel content and resistivity is first verified by sand column measurements and then two parallel sandbox experiments were conducted for both remediation and reference sandbox tests the resistivity changes of diesel contaminated soil were monitored together with hydrochemical indicators additionally contaminant indicators of soil and water samples from the two sandboxes were measured after the monitoring experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and materials two identical sandboxes were designed for monitoring experiments i e a remediation sandbox with persulfate injection and a reference sandbox the dimensions of both sandboxes are 51 cm high 60 cm long 10 cm thick fig 1 non polarizing ag agcl electrodes 4 mm in diameter were fixed to the inner wall of the sandbox in 4 rows with 16 electrodes each fig 1 the vertical spacing between electrodes was 2 7 cm and the lowest electrode was located 3 8 cm above the bottom of the sandbox only the tip of each electrode was allowed to have contact with the porous media and the remaining of the electrode was wrapped with insulated epoxy mao et al 2015 to mimic a point measurement to the extent possible two measurement tubes were set up on both sides of the sandbox for hydrochemical monitoring during the experiment the lower 8 cm segment was punched similar to a well screen to allow water sampling the persulfate injection tube with a 5 mm inner diameter was located in the center of the remediation sandbox and the lower 10 cm was punched with holes for persulfate outflow while the bottom of the tube was sealed to allow only horizontal flow all these components were made of pmma to minimize electrical disturbances all experiments were performed at room temperature 25 2 c quartz sand with a median grain diameter of d50 500 10 μm a porosity of 0 41 0 02 and a bulk density of 5 076 g cm3 was used for all experiments china macklin co ltd the difference between the column s unsaturated and saturated weight was used to determine its porosity and the ratio of weight to volume was used to determine its bulk density the maximum capillary rise of the quartz sand was 15 cm determined using the standpipe method before the experiments the quartz sand was washed with distilled water and dried at 90 c for 12 h the sand was saturated with an nacl electrolyte with an electrical conductivity of 45 ms m the chemical substances sodium persulfate na2s2o8 analytical reagent ar 99 7 purity sodium hydroxide naoh ar and sodium chloride nacl ar were acquired from macklin co ltd of shanghai china diesel fuel was purchased from the chinese petroleum corporation china and its composition and characteristics are similar to those of diesel fuel no 1 reported by gad 2005 it is composed of about 75 saturated hydrocarbons e g alkanes cnh2n 2 cycloalkanes cnh2n and 25 aromatic hydrocarbons e g mono aromatic hydrocarbon cnh2n 6 the diesel used in the experiments has a density between 0 82 and 0 86 g ml typical atomic mass concentrations are approximately 86 c 14 h and a small amount of sulfur depending on the crude oil source and cleaning quality accordingly the average chemical formula for diesel ranges from about c10h20 to c15h28 2 2 column experiments bulk electrical conductivity of porous media can be influenced by both surface conductivity and pore fluid conductivity and these two contributions cannot easily be separated in resistivity measurements lesmes and frye 2001 therefore additional column experiments were conducted to separate the effects of surface conductivity and diesel content for this laboratory columns similar to those reported by mellage et al 2018 were used the ontash psip instrument http www ontash com was used for complex resistivity measurements using a four electrode configuration resistivity magnitude ρ 1 σ in ω m and phase shift φ in mrad were measured at 19 log frequency intervals between 0 001 and 1000 hz four different diesel concentrations were used i e 0 0 g kg 10 6 g kg 63 5 g kg and 105 9 g kg based on the proportions of diesel and electrolyte the desired oil and water saturations were obtained and the content of diesel in the sand was calculated while the porosity was assumed to be constant this resulted in a water saturation of 1 00 0 95 0 70 and 0 50 for the four different diesel concentrations note that the electrolyte was added to sand first and diesel was then added which was consistent with the procedure for the preparation of samples with non wetting oil reported by revil et al 2011 following the mixing we packed the mixture tightly in the column similar packing procedures can be found in previous studies e g schwartz et al 2012 after all columns were measured about 5 pore volumes of base activated persulfate solution consisting of 3 m sodium hydroxide and 0 5 m persulfate was injected into the sand column with a diesel content of 105 9 g kg using a peristaltic pump and the complex resistivity response was measured again 2 3 diesel contaminated sand and base activated persulfate remediation diesel was selected as the contaminant in this study are due to its low toxicity relatively low volatility and its similar electrical characteristics to other hydrocarbons the diesel contaminated sand used in the sandbox experiments was prepared in the same way as in the column experiments using a diesel content of 105 9 g kg the pore space was fully saturated with nacl electrolyte for uncontaminated sand similar to the packing method in the column experiments the sand was put into the sandbox after saturation and was manually compressed by a rectangular plate during the packing process the boundaries between contaminated and uncontaminated sand were stabilized by two thin plates during sample preparation which were removed after packing the contaminated sand was packed in the middle of the sandboxes x 26 34 cm z 20 42 cm fig 1a the whole packing process was completed within 40 min the filling height of the sand was 50 cm and the water level in the monitoring tubes on both sides was 25 5 cm thus we assumed that the initial saturation height was 40 5 cm water level height of 25 5 cm and 15 cm capillary rise to minimize evaporation the top layer of sand was covered with a 1 cm thick layer of silt and the surface was covered with plastic wrap sodium hydroxide was used to activate the persulfate the radicals generated in the base activated persulfate system are sulfate so4 hydroxyl oh and superoxide radicals o2 e0 0 33 v watts 2011 liang and guo 2012 the alkaline ph environment promotes the following activating reactions 1 na 2 s 2 o 8 h 2 o so 5 2 so 4 2 2h 2 so 5 2 h 2 o base ho 2 so 4 2 h 3 s 2 o 8 2 ho 2 so 4 so 4 2 h o 2 the net reaction of base activated persulfate

propagation and termination chain reactions in which organic compounds can be transformed liang and lee 2008 5 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 oh h 6 so 4 oh so 4 2 oh the simultaneous generation of so4 oh and o2 leads to the generation of molecular oxygen furman et al 2010 watts 2011 i e 7 oh o 2 o 2 oh 8 so 4 o 2 o 2 so 4 2 thus superoxide o2 is reductive and may constrain the effects of hydroxyl oh and sulfate radicals so4 so4 and oh have been reported to play a dominant role in the degradation of diesel although sulfate radicals are highly oxidizing they are more likely to react with short chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and mono or lower cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in diesel by hydrogen extraction eq 9 or electron transfer eq 10 to produce oxidized organic compounds waldemer et al 2007 zhao et al 2013 in contrast hydroxyl radicals can react with most components including those that cannot be oxidized by sulfate radicals thus contributing to the breaking of cc bonds eq 11 or extracting hydrogen from ch bonds eq 12 the resulting degradation reactions can be written as cronk 2008 9 so 4 rh r hso 4 10 so 4 rh rh hso 4 11 oh rh r h 2 o 12 oh rh rh 2 o where rh represents the organic carbon compounds and r rh and rh2o represent the oxidized organic compounds to investigate base activated persulfate remediation of diesel contaminated soil 0 5 m sodium persulfate and 3 m sodium hydroxide 250 ml of each solution were mixed and immediately injected into the remediation sandbox using a peristaltic pump 20 ml min on day 21 after sample preparation the ratio of persulfate to sodium hydroxide was similar to furman et al 2010 the summary statistics of sandbox experiment are shown in table 1 2 4 data acquisition and processing resistivity measurements were conducted seven times throughout the monitoring experiment at day 11 21 38 55 115 149 and 181 measurements were collected in triplicates using a skip two and skip four measuring protocol slater et al 2000 for each current electrode pairs ab potential electrode pairs mn were selected with the same skip for example for the skip two protocol for ab 1 and 4 potential electrode pairs mn 5 and 8 6 and 9 and so on were measured while for the skip four protocol for ab 1 and 6 mn 7 and 12 8 and 13 and so on were measured in this way the measurement array also contained reciprocal measurements e g for ab 1 and 4 mn 5 and 8 while the corresponding reciprocal measurement array is ab 5 and 8 mn 1 and 4 each between borehole dataset contained 1112 measurements e g 1112 measurements for electrodes 1 32 17 48 and 33 64 respectively consequently 3336 resistance data were measured to cover the whole sandbox the resistivity measurements were made with the multi channel abem terrameter ls2 instrument http www guidelinegeo com the acquisition time for all dataset was 35 min the inversion was performed using a 3d finite element code written in the comsol and matlab environments mao et al 2015 we assumed no resistivity variation in the y direction due to the small sandbox thickness therefore the inversion results are presented as 2d tomograms besides geophysical measurements chemical parameters were measured on the left and right sides of each sandbox the interval during the first 40 days was 4 days while the interval was increased to 15 days after 40 days due to insignificant changes in the measured chemical parameters the investigated parameters included oxidation reduction potential orp ph dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity orp ph and do were measured using a multi parameter analyzer leici dzb 715 china and electrical conductivity was measured using a conductivity meter ectestr 11 usa at the end of the experiment eight positions in each sandbox s1 s8 and s9 s16 were selected to collect soil samples in addition water samples w1 w2 and w3 w4 were collected at the bottom of both sides of each sandbox using water outlet valves fig 1a the soil samples were analyzed for total organic carbon toc and total petroleum hydrocarbons tph while water samples were analyzed for petroleum chemical oxygen demand cod and anion concentrations so4 2 and hco3 the toc in the soil samples was measured using a potassium dichromate oxidation spectrophotometric method and the tph in these samples was determined using a gas chromatography method the petroleum cod so4 2 and hco3 concentration in the water samples were determined by infrared spectrophotometry dichromate ion chromatography and titration methods respectively the selection of chemical parameters followed the geological survey and evaluation standards for soil and groundwater in contaminated sites china geological survey 2014 3 results 3 1 effect of diesel contamination on complex resistivity the results of the column experiments indicate that the resistivity and the phase increase with diesel content fig 2 i e the oil saturation this is consistent with results described by cassiani et al 2009 and schmutz et al 2010 for non wetting oil the values of the resistivity magnitude and the phase peak are provided in table 2 the resistivity increased from 82 6 ω m for 0 0 g kg diesel content sw 1 to 745 2 ω m for 105 9 g kg diesel content sw 0 5 the peak phase increased from 2 36 mrad for 0 0 g kg diesel content to 6 6 mrad for 105 9 g kg diesel content moreover a shift in peak frequency from 0 022 hz at 0 0 g kg diesel to 0 0046 hz at 105 9 g kg diesel content was observed these features are well explained by the model developed by schmutz et al 2010 after the injection of base activated persulfate into the sand column with 105 9 g kg diesel content the resistivity decreased significantly from 745 2 ω m to about 2 6 ω m while a phase measurement with sufficient accuracy could not be obtained this is because the activated persulfate produces a large number of ions and the resulting high salinity environment is not favorable for accurate complex resistivity measurements xia et al 2021 niu et al 2016 the interpretation of ert inversion results in contaminant studies is sometimes complicated by geological heterogeneity which can produce resistivity differences that are stronger than those associated with the presence of the oil itself deng et al 2017 to ensure sufficient contrast in this study a high diesel content of 105 9 g kg was used in the sandbox experiments with this level of contamination the resistivity of the contaminated sand is about 9 times higher than that of clean water saturated sand 3 2 results of electrical resistivity tomography measurements on sandboxes a total of seven resistivity measurements were taken over a six month period the reciprocal errors of all datasets are summarized in fig 3 reciprocal error refers to the relative error of data obtained from two sets of reciprocal measurements the data quality obtained in the remediation sandbox is slightly worse than that of reference sandbox which is particularly evident before and after persulfate injection specifically the reciprocal errors is below 2 on day 11 before persulfate injection for 85 4 of the measurements and this percentage is reduced to 80 8 on day 21 after persulfate injection for the reference sandbox the percentage of measurements with errors 2 is similar on day 11 and 21 85 3 and 85 7 respectively which is also consistent with the percentage obtained before persulfate injection for the remediation sandbox it is important to note that the overall data quality is generally acceptable loke et al 2015 with at least 98 7 of reciprocal errors 5 for the reference sandbox and at least 96 6 of reciprocal errors 5 for the remediation sandbox time lapse ert inversion results are presented in fig 4 at the end of the monitoring experiment day 181 the water level in the reference sandbox was 24 3 cm and the water level in the remediation sandbox was slightly higher at 25 1 cm due to the persulfate injection therefore the saturation heights red dashed lines were also slightly different with 39 3 cm for the reference sandbox and 40 1 cm for the remediation sandbox before persulfate injection the resistivity distributions are similar for the remediation and reference sandbox specifically the resistivity within the black rectangle ranges from 575 ω m to 1200 ω m with an average value of 846 ω m corresponding to the diesel contaminated sand which is 150 ω m higher than the surrounding resistivity after persulfate injection day 21 in the remediation sandbox the resistivity decreased significantly especially at the injection port where the resistivity reached values lower than 10 ω m which is consistent with the results of the sand column experiments in addition it was also observed that a low resistivity plume migrated to the left and right side beyond the originally contaminated area immediately after injection as time progressed this plume was observed to gradually expand and migrate downwards from day 38 to 181 in addition the resistivity of the unsaturated zone above 39 cm in the two sandboxes gradually increased which is attributed to water evaporation over the experimental period the resistivity around the contaminated sand shows an increase in both vertical and horizontal directions at the end of the experiment in the reference sandbox however these increases are only minor suggesting that diesel migration is not significant sentenac et al 2015 also reported limited migration of hydrocarbons in a similar sandbox experiment also in the presence of a hydraulic gradient from left to right that may lead to diesel migration by advection therefore the lack of migration in our experiments with diffusion dominated diesel transport is not surprising in addition the gentle resistivity variation also indicates that the natural degradation of contaminated sand is not significant note that the high resistivity response of at the top of sandbox is not only caused by evaporation but also may be caused by upward movement of free phase diesel 3 3 chemical analysis and sampling results orp ph do and conductivity are important indicators to characterize the oxidation reactions and fig 5 shows their variation during the remediation and reference experiment in general all chemical parameters measured on day 21 in the remediation sandbox showed a noticeable jump due to the injection of persulfate while the results for the reference sandbox showed a slight downward trend specifically the orp measured on day 21 in the remediation sandbox was 417 mv which was higher than that measured in the reference sandbox 263 mv saturated with nacl electrolyte these results are consistent with experiments conducted by zhao et al 2013 who showed that the orp of the base activated persulfate reaction system ph 12 in laboratory vials was 562 17 mv while the background value without persulfate was 367 mv the increased orp reflects the oxidative properties of persulfate with respect to ph it is evident that highly alkaline conditions ph 13 were created after base activated persulfate injection in these conditions it is expected that superoxide o2 hydroxyl oh and sulfate radicals so4 were generated at the same time o2 radicals were likely scavenged by oh radicals through the reaction given in eq 7 similarly so4 radicals were removed through the reaction given in eq 8 this resulted in the generation of one mole of o2 per mole of generated o2 furman et al 2010 hayyan et al 2016 additionally persulfate dissolves in water and then reacts with water to produce a small amount of o2 which is another reason for the increase in do 13 2na 2 s 2 o 8 2h 2 o 2na 4so 4 2 4h o 2 therefore the do measured in the remediation sandbox increased by approximately 38 5 after persulfate injection 9 5 mg l compared to that measured before persulfate injection 6 86 mg l and reference sandbox 6 85 mg l in addition consumption of hydroxide as well as the decomposition and activation of persulfate release hydrogen ions and other anions e g so4 2 hco3 or co3 2 which leads to a decrease of ph and an increase of conductivity huang et al 2002 li et al 2020 chang et al 2022 at the same time persulfate consumption results in a decrease of orp and do although the monitoring tubes are not located in the direct vicinity of the persulfate injection the measured data still reflect the general chemical variations in the sandboxes it is anticipated that the changes in the chemical parameters near the injection tube will be even more dramatic at the same time the difference in position also explains why the change of chemical parameters is insignificant in the early stages and more evident in the later stages i e it takes time for the plume to migrate to the water sampling ports the chemical parameters measured in soil and water samples at the end of the experiments are shown in table 3 see fig 1 for sampling points the results of the soil samples suggest that the hydroxyl and sulfate radicals formed by base activated persulfate resulted in substantial degradation of diesel especially near the outflow holes for example the measured toc and tph at location s1 in the remediation sandbox is 1 73 g kg and 1 67 g kg respectively this was much lower than the concentrations measured at the same location s9 in the reference sandbox where the toc was 36 1 g kg and the tph was 33 8 g kg the degradation products are eventually mineralized and converted into co2 or metabolic byproducts arato et al 2014 for instance the degradation reactions of benzene a component of diesel with so4 and oh are liu et al 2016 14 so 4 c 6 h 6 c 6 h 6 so 4 2 15 oh c 6 h 6 c 6 h 7 o in addition short chain aliphatic hydrocarbons e g decane which are another major component of diesel undergo hydrogen extraction from the ch bonds when reacting with so4 and oh 16 so 4 c 10 h 22 c 6 h 11 hso 4 17 oh c 10 h 22 c 10 h 21 h 2 o the net chemical reactions in which benzene and decane are completely degraded by persulfate are 18 15 s 2 o 8 2 c 6 h 6 12 h 2 o 6co 2 30 h 30 so 4 2 19 31 s 2 o 8 2 c 10 h 22 20 h 2 o 10 co 2 62 h 62 so 4 2 we assume that c12h23 is the average chemical formula for diesel which does not contain structural information but only takes into account the carbon hydrogen ratio gad 2005 i e c12h23 does not refer to alkynes or alkenes alone but is composed of various hydrocarbons accordingly the net chemical reaction of diesel consumption by persulfate can be expressed as 20 71 s 2 o 8 2 2c 12 h 23 48 h 2 o 24 co 2 14 2h 14 2so 4 2 this net reaction is consistent with the observed chemical parameters after degradation in the remediation sandbox the tph and toc of the soil samples decreased compared to the reference sandbox while the so4 2 and hco3 concentrations in the water samples increased table 3 considering that hco3 was not present in the electrolyte used to prepare the sample it is likely to be a degradation product from the oxidation of diesel wu 2021 accordingly the degradation of diesel by persulfate releases a large number of ions causing an increase in so4 2 and hco3 concentrations measured at locations w1 and w2 compared to locations w3 and w4 e g the average concentration of so4 2 and hco3 in water samples collected from the remediation sandbox are 3235 mg l and 793 mg l while those measured in the reference sandbox are 14 mg l and 204 mg l although diesel is characterized by low solubility a small fraction of dissolved phase still is expected to occur in the saturated zone atekwana and atekwana 2010 the average values of the petroleum concentration and cod in the reference sandbox were 2 3 mg l and 139 5 mg l which are higher than those measured in the remediation sandbox where dissolved diesel components were likely oxidated 4 discussion 4 1 migration pathway of oxidation plume based on the column and sandbox experiments it is evident that the persulfate remediation system causes a significant resistivity decrease to better capture the observed changes in resistivity caused by the persulfate injection resistivity ratio tomograms are presented in fig 6 the measurements before the injection day 11 were used as a reference persulfate injection caused a decrease in resistivity in a significant part of the sandbox as indicated by the area with resistivity ratio 1 although the reciprocal error indicates that the quality of data acquisition is acceptable we nevertheless prefer to take a conservative approach and assume that the area with a resistivity ratio 0 95 is affected by oxidation plume migration blue solid lines considering that the injection locations 20 30 cm are distributed on the side walls of a tube sealed at the bottom persulfate is expected to radially spread away from the injection tube at the center following the persulfate injection at day 21 the resistivity ratio near the outflow locations was 0 1 and the tomogram suggests that the migration distance of persulfate in horizontal direction x 16 44 cm was larger than in the vertical direction z 10 34 cm since persulfate has a high solubility in water 73 g 100 ml at 25 c and the density e g 2 59 g ml for sodium persulfate at 25 c is greater than water yen et al 2011 persulfate solution with a high concentration can migrate due to density driven transport huling and pivetz 2006 this is also observed in the remediation sandbox after 17 days of persulfate injection day 38 the oxidation plume has clearly migrated downward and it reached the bottom of the sandbox on day 115 given the slow migration of the contaminant it is clear from eq 1 6 13 and 20 that the main components of this oxidation plume stem from the persulfate remediation system and ions released by the associated chemical reactions in the later stages of the experiment after the plume reached the bottom of the sandbox especially on day 149 and 181 the oxidation plume gradually migrated outward to both sides again under the influence of concentration differences although the lateral migration distance of persulfate during injection was greater than that in vertical direction due to the high injection pressure the oxidation plume was dominated by vertical migration due to density driven transport the results clearly showed that this general migration pathway of the persulfate could easily be captured by the electrical resistivity distribution which highlights the potential of time lapse ert images for capturing the delivery and fate of persulfate in isco remediation in field conditions it should be noted that parts of unsaturated zone above 39 cm have a resistivity ratio 1 indicating that the resistivity of this area has increased after injection compared with that before injection besides evaporation considering that surface is covered with silt the capillary rise phenomenon may drive a small amount of free phase diesel to migrate upward 4 2 influence of diesel degradation on the resistivity distribution the resistivity monitoring results for the reference sandbox indicate that natural degradation and migration of the contaminated plume are limited during the entire experiment to further illustrate this the resistivity difference ρ reference ρ remediation between sandboxes is analyzed to characterize the resistivity response caused by persulfate remediation alone fig 7 clearly the resistivity of the reference sandbox is higher than that of the remediation sandbox everywhere specifically the results illustrate that the largest differences 600 ω m correspond to the location of the outflow within the contaminated sand white solid rectangle at these locations the average resistivity difference for the two sandboxes is about 1010 ω m obviously the resistivity difference within the contaminated sand is not only related to the change of diesel concentration but also to the oxidation plume the blue solid lines in fig 6 show the area of oxidation plume migration z 34 cm derived from a resistivity ratio 0 95 see fig 6 at the same time the red solid lines delineate the area below the height of plume migration with a resistivity difference above 80 ω m the average resistivity difference within the red solid lines excluding the contaminated sand in the black rectangle is 126 7 ω m much less than the difference calculated at the location of contaminated sand moreover the similar contour shapes of the red and blue solid lines suggest that unlike the resistivity difference of contaminated sand the difference between the two sandboxes within the red solid lines is mainly influenced by the migration of the oxidation plume in addition the average resistivity difference of the unsaturated zone z 39 cm above red dashed line is small compared to that of the saturated zone to characterize the resistivity variations in even more detail fig 8 shows the temporal development of the resistivity difference between the two sandboxes at x 30 cm and various z positions black dashed line in fig 7 based on the observed resistivity differences we identified four zones below the contaminated sand 0 20 cm bottom of the contaminated sand 20 30 cm top of the contaminated sand 30 42 cm and above the contaminated sand 42 51 cm in the zone below the contaminated sand the resistivity difference is increasing with time fig 8b the oxidation plume gradually migrates downward in the early stages before day 55 due to density which explains the increase of the resistivity difference the oxidation plume partly consists of ions that are continuously released by the degradation reaction therefore the plume continues to extend to both sides under the effect of concentration differences resulting in a flat overall change in the later stages of the experiment this is consistent with the fact that the hydrochemical parameters measured in the monitoring tubes are low until day 50 60 the resistivity difference of the area with contaminated sand shows two opposite trends for the bottom part of the contaminated sand the resistivity difference between the two sandboxes is decreasing with time from 1062 3 ω m to 972 3 ω m fig 8b due to the migration of the oxidation plume thus we speculate that besides the oxidation plume the consumption of contaminants and the generation of degradation products are the main reasons for the resistivity difference in this area with respect to the top part of the contaminated sand a small amount of persulfate migrates upward under the effect of injection pressure see day 21 in fig 6 as a result degradation and the corresponding resistivity difference decreases with increasing distance from the injection position i e the resistivity difference decreases with increasing elevation on the other hand the increase in resistivity difference at z 38 cm and z 41 cm is the main reason for the increasing trend of the average resistivity difference fig 8b this is related to the difference in saturation height of the reference sandbox 39 3 cm and the remediation sandbox 40 1 cm fig 7 for the unsaturated zone above the contaminated sand the resistivity difference between the two sandboxes shows a gradual but insignificant increasing trend slope 4 16 and r2 0 55 however it should be noted that this part does not involve diesel contamination or oxidation plume migration and the average resistivity difference is only 60 ω m overall the resistivity differences between the reference and remediation sandboxes are related to changes in concentration of the contaminant migration of the oxidation plume and evaporation at the surface for the contaminated source zone near the injection well consumption of contaminants generation of degradation products and migration of the oxidation plume are determining the decrease in resistivity after persulfate injection for the non contaminated areas around the source zone the migration of the oxidation plume is determining the decrease in resistivity for field scale isco remediation it can thus be concluded that resistivity changes in areas with low initial contamination concentration are expected to be mainly related to the migration of the oxidation plume making it difficult to discern the degradation of contaminants there are only few studies on ert monitoring of base activated persulfate degradation of hydrocarbon contaminated soils taking a similar case as an example harte et al 2012 had conducted geophysical monitoring of in situ permanganate remediation process of pce at field scale speculated that the low resistivity response was due to oxidant and guessed that the resistivity decrease due to contaminant degradation was estimated to account for only 5 10 4 3 effect of oxidation plume on resistivity of contaminated soil as the diesel concentration and the oxidation plume are the main drivers of the decrease of the resistivity it is important to understand the relationship between resistivity and contaminant concentration in the presence of the oxidizing plume the relationships between resistivity and the chemical parameters indicating contamination tph and toc obtained from reference sandbox are shown in fig 9 and the data from remediation sandbox black solid rectangle are also shown in the figure here resistivity is the average value within the sampling area for the reference sandbox the resistivity is expected to be related to the contaminant concentration based on the sand column experiments and previous studies revil et al 2011 schwartz et al 2012 mao et al 2016 this is confirmed by fig 9 which shows a relationship between resistivity and tph and toc of the soil samples s9 s16 in reference sandbox with relatively high explained variance r2 0 94 and 0 97 as expected resistivity increased with increasing tph and toc for the remediation sandbox the relationships between resistivity and the chemical parameters indicating contamination are less pronounced which reflects the degradation effect of persulfate on diesel contamination note that both s1 and s6 are located in the area above the height of oxidation plume migration z 34 cm which means that the resistivity is less affected by the plume the other sampling locations are all below the height of the area affected by the oxidation plume and the resistivity is lower than expected under the influence of the plume accordingly it is difficult to accurately distinguish the contamination and the oxidation plume based on the resistivity alone likewise resistivity can be influenced by the contaminated source and plume zones in a field survey but it cannot directly distinguish these zones e g elis et al 2016 based on the fitting line calculated from the reference sandbox data the relationship model between resistivity and tph without in situ remediation is shown as follows 21 ρ 0 089 c tph 168 4 where ρ represents the calculated resistivity without in situ remediation c tph is the concentration of tph respectively in this study the deviation between measured resistivity and calculated resistivity is caused by migration of oxidant plume therefore the influence ratio of oxidant plume i o is 22 i o ρ ρ measure ρ 100 while the influence ratio of contaminant consumption i c is 23 i c 1 i o 100 for remediation sandbox the influence ratio of oxidant and contaminant consumption on resistivity decrease at difference locations are shown in table 4 note that the influence ratios of different factor are calculated by average deviation of tph for the areas above the height of the persulfate outflow hole e g s1 and s6 the oxidant plume has a smaller effect on resistivity decrease than contaminant consumption for the contaminated source zone near the injection well i e s2 although the influence of oxidant plume is dominant contaminant consumption contributes to 25 6 of the resistivity decrease for area with low or non contaminated area the influence of contaminant consumption on resistivity decrease is 16 the ratio calculated based on the relationship between toc and resistivity is similar to the ratio shown in table 4 although the half life of persulfate is 10 to 20 days when reacting with hydrocarbon contaminants in water watts 2011 the degradation rate of diesel within soil by base activated persulfate can vary considerably due to different reaction conditions and contamination types specifically previous studies illustrated that aromatic and short chain aliphatic hydrocarbons in diesel are more easily degraded by persulfate in contrast long chain aliphatic hydrocarbons are considered to be the least degradable due to limited hydrophobicity and strong sorption on the soil siegrist et al 2011 for example lominchar et al 2018 reported that dodecane tetradecane pentadecane and aromatic hydrocarbons were essentially degraded by base activated persulfate in the first 4 days while aliphatic hydrocarbons with carbon numbers above 16 were more recalcitrant and still present in small amounts at the end of the treatment after 56 days to obtain contaminant information during persulfate remediation resistivity measurements should thus be combined with sampling data for comprehensive analysis in the field ert method has advantages and challenges to dynamically monitor the in situ remediation process of contaminants on one hand it utilizes multiple monitoring modes i e surface cross borehole or in a combination of cross borehole surface and is able to delineate the resistivity changes over a wide remediation area especially the migration range of oxidants plume this means ert can quickly identify the area not covered by oxidant for secondary injection and can improve efficiency while reducing sampling costs on the other hand it is difficult to directly distinguish the effects of oxidant plume and contaminant consumption on resistivity decrease and a comprehensive analysis combined with sampling data is usually required this study quantified the effect of hydrocarbon removal on resistivity change based on well controlled conditions e g the contribution of contaminant consumption to resistivity change in the source area is 25 6 while it is 16 in the low or non contaminated area however this contribution is related to the soil characteristics the type and concentration of contaminant and oxidant thus it may vary in the field or other laboratory conditions 5 conclusion this study directly visualized the remediation of diesel contaminated soil by base activated persulfate using cross borehole ert measurements and evaluated the capability of resistivity measurements for characterizing oxidation plume migration and contaminant degradation since the resistivity response is affected by diesel content and the presence of persulfate two sandbox experiments were conducted to compare the resistivity distribution of diesel contaminated sand with and without the persulfate remediation system to support the interpretation of the resistivity measurements hydrochemical measurements were made periodically the results indicated that the resistivity was significantly decreased in response to persulfate injection for the remediation sandbox e g from 846 ω m to below 10 ω m for contaminated sand natural degradation and contaminant plume migration were not evident for the reference sandbox without persulfate injection the chemical parameters i e orp ph do and conductivity showed a noticeable increase due to the oxidant injection while the parameters measured in the reference sandbox showed a gentle and slightly downward trend moreover the results of soil and water samples suggested that the hydroxyl and sulfate radicals formed by base activated persulfate resulted in substantial degradation of diesel producing a large number of ions that further decreased the resistivity resistivity ratio tomograms allowed to delineate the area affected by oxidation plume migration it was observed that the persulfate plume mainly migrated vertically due to density driven distribution after an initial phase of horizontal flow associated with the high pressure injection in addition the resistivity difference between the contaminated areas of the two sandboxes was related to the change in contaminant concentration and the migration of the oxidation plume in the contaminated source zone near the injection well consumption of contaminants generation of degradation products and migration of the oxidation plume determined the decrease in resistivity after persulfate injection while in the low or non contaminated area around the source zone the oxidation plume was dominant for the decrease in resistivity it was found that the resistivity correlates well with the contaminant indicators i e tph and toc however the resistivity corresponding to contaminated indicators was generally lower than expected in the presence of the oxidation plume this further illustrates that resistivity changes due to the decrease of contaminant concentrations after degradation are still influenced by the oxidation plume even in the source zone near the injection well concretely for the contaminated source zone near the injection well contaminant consumption contributes to 25 6 of the resistivity decrease while for area with low or non contaminated area the influence of contaminant consumption on resistivity change is 16 it is difficult to capture the characteristics of chemical reactions at the pore scale using the ert method an extension of ert is the induced polarization ip method which is more sensitive to properties at the pore scale future research should thus additionally consider the ip response during isco remediation e g to characterize chemical reactions of the diesel degradation process it is necessary to design the periodic contaminant concentration tests for direct comparison of ip parameter changes with degradation processes nevertheless the ert monitoring results presented above for diesel remediation clearly show resistivity responses that are related to the effects of oxidation plume migration and changes in contaminant concentration which has not been

1186,ground surface analysis of co2 emissions with δ13c determination is experimentally demonstrated to be a potential methodology to monitor on line the dynamics of petroleum hydrocarbon biodegradation in soil aquifers thanks to the improvement of the isotopic ratio infra red spectroscopy technique biodegradation rate of remaining hydrocarbon substrates in groundwater can be quantified using basic application of the rayleigh equations by δ13cco2 analysis released at ground surface above the pollution plume instead of usual approaches based on groundwater hydrocarbons δ13c analysis when physical and chemical properties for the contaminated site meet appropriate conditions the validation approach for that gasoline contaminated specific site is discussed and verified by comparison of first order attenuation rate constant determined from δ13cco2 analysis emitted at ground surface and from δ13ctoluene analysis in ground water a kinetic fractionation factor α of 0 9979 or ε value of 2 1 0 5 is estimated for the biodegradation of the most reactive hydrocarbon substrates tex the treatment of this rayleigh equations by linear regression of δ13cco2 values along the predominant direction of groundwater flow leads to the following results and conclusions for that site i first order biodegradation rate constants and annual variation are maximum after the activation of a permeable reactive barrier prb in may 2014 0 92 0 29 0 17 year 1 and during july and october 0 46 0 14 0 09 year 1 and minimum in mid winter in february 2015 0 17 0 05 0 03 year 1 given by the estimation range for ε these results are in the lower range with reported in literature for similar contaminated sites 1 6 18 year 1 considering natural attenuation under sulfate reducing conditions and ii the seasonal variation of the first order biodegradation rate constant is mainly correlated with the seasonal variation of the co2 flux where maximum values are in summers and minimum values in winters both seasonal variations are mainly due to the annual cycle of the natural biodegradation activity at the scale of the pollution plume rather than the activation of the prb this work demonstrates that δ13cco2 analysis released at ground surface from biodegradation of groundwater hydrocarbons could provide under characterized and appropriate conditions a non intrusive without soil samplings fast and low cost online method to monitor and therefore to optimize soil remediation processes in real time monitored natural attenuation or enhanced bioremediation keywords groundwater

from gasoline station lead to contamination of soil and groundwater especially by benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene btex compounds btex are the most toxic petroleum hydrocarbons and are usually the primary drivers for remediation barona et al 2007 el naas et al 2014 monitored natural attenuation or enhanced bioremediation of btex are two major site remediation technologies that rely on the occurrence of biodegradation biodegradation processes of hydrocarbons substrates by micro organisms usually induces unidirectional reactions hydrocarbons to the biologically mediated product or final product such as co2 with isotope fractionation of carbon c involving an increase of the isotopic ratio 13c 12c rs in the remaining substrate s and a decrease of the isotopic ratio 13c 12c rp in the released product p associated kinetic fractionation factor α is expressed as in mariotti et al 1981 eq 1 α α ps r p r s isotope δ13c values are more often used than isotope r values for sample data analysis and discussion δ13c value is defined for any sample according to eq 2 eq 2 δ 13 c r r vpdb 1 1000 where r and rvpdb are the isotopic concentration ratios 13c 12c of the groundwater sample and of the international standard the vienna pee dee belemnite respectively rvpdb is 1 12372 as defined by craig 1954 the isotopic fractionation of groundwater hydrocarbon substrate can be described using a simple rayleigh model which was originally derived by rayleigh 1896 for the case of fractional distillation of mixed liquid using the following equation eq 3 r s t1 r s t0 n s t1 n s t0 α 1 f t 1 t0 α 1 where rs t1 and rs 0 are the 13c 12c of the unreacted substrate s at time t1 and at the initial time t0 respectively ns t1 and ns t0 are the molar or molecule number of the unreacted s at time t1 relative to time t0 and thus f t1 t0 is the molar or mass fraction of s remaining in the sample at time t1 relative to t0 measured in a well mixed aquifer considering a closed system for the substrate not movable or movable such as a plume carried by the stream of ground water the rayleigh model is used to quantify the degradation of a single substrate in a well mixed aquifer to a single product assuming that other non degradative physical processes such as dissolution sorption and volatilization do not cause large carbon isotopic shifts at equilibrium mariotti et al 1981 u s epa 2008 guidance document on csia discusses how to use and interpret compound specific stable isotope data in field settings using rayleigh model in a groundwater plume in all discussion provided in sections 3 3 4 2 table 4 2 5 3 and 7 4 of the u s epa 2008 document it is assumed that the difference in isotopic signature between two points a source or upgradient monitoring point and b downgradient monitoring point at a snapshot in time t in a groundwater plume is due to the transformation that occurred during the travel time estimated as distance l between spots a and b divided by groundwater velocity v as written in eqs 4 in other words this use of rayleigh model is similar to changes in isotopic signatures over time for a constituent in a closed system say lab microcosm or a batch reactor eq 4 r b s t r a s t n b s t n a s t α 1 f t α 1 to estimate the mass loss of s of groundwater hydrocarbon substrates by δ13c analysis within the plume the remaining substrate mass fraction ft

associated isotope fractionation factor expressed in eqs 5 are identical to eq 7 17 in the u s epa 2008 guidance document on csia the extent of the hydrocarbon biodegradation could be expressed as the mass loss of s in the time interval t mlt as expressed in eq 6 to discuss in later section one of the boundary condition limiting the use of this rayleigh equation form eq 6 ml 1 f 100 the evolution of ml over time is also a key parameter to estimate the time to achieve groundwater objectives due to natural or enhanced bioremediation of hydrocarbons contaminated aquifers the main inconvenient of this monitoring approach based on hydrocarbon substrate pollutants concentration and δ determination is that monitoring wells to be drilled for sampling groundwater are needed it has been suggested that monitoring the isotope δ13c values of the biodegradation product pco2 labeled δ13cco2 or δ13cp released at ground surface as a proxy of the hydrocarbon substrate pollutant δ values could be a more convenient way to assess the groundwater hydrocarbon biodegradation kinetic within high spatial and temporal resolutions within the latter approach soil drilling or excavation is not needed the keeling plot method to measure δ values of the biodegradation product pco2 released at ground surface only requires a movable closed chamber set on ground surface where δ values of the accumulated co2 gas is directly measured online by isotopic ratio infra red spectroscopy iris technique noel et al 2016a 2016b guimbaud et al 2016 only for few minutes thanks to the precision improvements made by iris techniques in the last decades in the gas phase this paper aims to demonstrate that the biodegradation efficiency of hydrocarbons in a gasoline contaminated aquifer under monitored natural attenuation or enhanced bioremediation could be monitored by ground surface δco2 emissions as a first approximation improving then the ability to observe and assess quickly effects of remediation processes that could be applied in the field boundary conditions for the application of the rayleigh model to assess biodegradation rate of the groundwater hydrocarbon substrates from ground surface δ13cco2 emissions is discussed at the scale of the contaminated field 2 material and methods and theory calculation 2 1 characterization of the investigating site the site widely described in verardo 2016 and verardo et al 2021 is a gas station near paris france where gasoline and diesel fuels leaked from tanks a simplified map of the site showing the permeable reactive barrier prb and the monitoring disposal of the gas metering station is presented in fig 1 a permeable reactive barrier prb was implemented 22 m downstream of the pollution source to stimulate biodegradation started on march 27 2014 and ended on june 26 2015 diluted h2o2 is added continuously to pumped water from wells located upstream the prb then oxygenated pumped water was injected across the prb that industrial site is composed of sandy and gravelly materials 1 5 m thick at surface and of a sandy lightly loamy layer containing mainly gritstone coarse grained of siliceous sandstone from brie region above 6 m depth the aquifer layer varies from 2 to 3 m depth on top from end of winter to end of summer and lies above the impermeable soil layer at 6 m depth the gas station is still in activity but the former tank source of contamination was removed in 1997 since that time a large reservoir of residual hydrocarbons located in the vadose zone just below the former tanks is continuously feeding the underneath groundwater with refined petroleum residual light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl was found in soil between 2 and 4 m depth at saturation range between 0 5 and 2 4 localization of the residual lnapl is shown in fig 2 where collars 19 20 and 21 are the only ones located above the residual lnapl area ending upstream collar 11 from these observations the simplifying assumption that groundwater system is well mixed will be considered upstream and downstream the prb to estimate the mass loss of hydrocarbon substrates and their attenuation rate constant actually the pollution plume in groundwater is mainly composed of btex due to their longer resistance to biodegradation and their higher solubility compared to other hydrocarbons verardo et al 2021 groundwater analysis performed from 2012 to 2014 at the exit of the pollution plume monitoring well p4 fig 2 located 5 m upstream the front head of the prb 4 m upstream collar 11 and 17 m downstream the dismantled tanks in 1997 indicates max values of pollutants from the layer depth 2 m 4 m below soil surface with max values verardo et al 2021 for benzene 11 mgl 1 toluene 3 mgl 1 ethylbenzene 1 mgl 1 and xylene 6 mgl 1 total petroleum hydrocarbon tph c10 c40 and mtbe methyl tert butyl ether concentration max values are 1 mgl 1 and 100 μgl 1 respectively btex distribution extracted from verardo 2016 is shown in fig 3 btex are sampled from static headspace and analyzed by gc ms according to the nf iso 11423 1 protocol with quantification limit of 1 μgl 1 tph are sampled from liquid liquid extraction and analyzed by cg fid according to the nf en iso 9377 2 protocol accuracy varied from 30 to 50 blessing and saada 2013 the biodegradation of btex can be carried out under aerobic anoxic or anaerobic conditions in aerobic respiration the terminal electron acceptors tea is o2 but in the absence of oxygen a number of less highly oxidized compounds may serve assuming organisms capable of making use of them are present available teas are used in the environment in decreasing order of oxidation reduction potential no3 fe iii mn iv so4 2 and co2 davis et al 1999 johnson et al 2003 lari et al 2019 groundwater at the contaminant plume is anaerobic as shown in fig 4 extracted from verardo 2016 the concentrations of nitrates iron ii manganese ii and sulphates measured in the groundwater of the site made it possible to define the redox zones of biodegradation of hydrocarbons the biodegradation mechanisms existing within the plume of contaminants are also presented in fig 4 demonstrating that hydrocarbon biodegradation remains processed via anaerobic conditions and more precisely via sulfate reduction before enhanced bioremediation along the pollution plume mainly within the gas metering station zone after activation of the prb no evolution of the redox potential stable between 100 and 50 mv in the piezometers located near prb was noticed despite the injection of hydrogen peroxide this result and the presence of sulphates absence of manganese ii production and low iron ii production demonstrate that biodegradation remains anaerobic and processed via sulfate reduction due to a default of treatment verardo 2016 according to these lower limits of redox potential biodegradation seems not to proceed via methanogenenis this could be notified by the absence of methane realized at ground surface 0 1 nmol m 2 s 1 at one most active period july 1 2015 corresponding the detection limit of the ir greenhouse gas analyzer los gatos research inc ca used and at least to one order of magnitude lower than fluxes which can be found in literature for water bodies or aerobic soil surfaces guimbaud et al 2016 however hydrocarbon biodegradation under acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic reducing conditions methanogenesis may not be ignored within the residual lnapl light non aqueous phase liquid source zone located upstream the prb according to high btex concentration found in fig 4 conrad et al 1997 these methanogenesis paths are known to produce high δ13c values 13c enrichment of both co2 and ch4 gas and dic and dissolved methane in groundwater in addition aerobic oxidation of overlying ch4 in the vadose zone may also produce additional 13c enrichment of co2 conrad et al 1997 neumann et al 2016 and references therein despite concentration change in redox indicator compounds do not play for significant methanogenesis processes the δ13c value decays less upstream than downstream the prb 2 5 versus 4 vpdb guimbaud et al 2016 it implies that higher δ13c co2 could be produced upstream the prb from methanogenesis reducing then this δ13c value decays observed the kinetic approach given in that paper is thus limited by the relative importance of co2 produced methanogenesis paths in residual lnapl zone methanogenesis is assumed to be neglected in our study case as data including the lnapl zone do not affect the general trend of δ13c co2 and btex in order to assess the significance of co2 contribution by in direct methanogenesis conrad et al 1997 suggested that combined δ13c and 14c analyses of soil co2 gas and groundwater dic can yield to valuable insights into modes of microbial petroleum hydrocarbon degradation geophysical methods electrical resistivity and induced polarization had shown a high conductive and chargeable zone around 2 to 3 m depth which matches the polluted zone defined by geochemical borehole analyses at the top layer of the water table noel et al 2016b authors conclude that pollutant degradation mainly occurs in the top layer of the groundwater table where numerous chargeable bacteria produce conductive metabolites the age of the hydrocarbon leakage almost twenty years ago is sufficient to allow the development of natural bacterial flora able to degrade hydrocarbon the direction of the groundwater flow is oriented toward the northwest by 30 relative to the north fig 1 and obtained from piezometric maps using krigeage interpolation this direction defines also the pollution plume coordinate relative to the prb verardo 2016 the average groundwater velocity 17 m yr 1 is derived from the kinematic porosity of 15 the hydraulic gradient of 1 and an average hydraulic conductivity of 8 10 6 m s 1 measured in that site material and methods for co2 flux and δ13c characterization on each 21 gaz metric station see fig 1 for the position of the 21 collars set on ground surface are described in guimbaud et al 2016 lpc2e cnrs developed home built high resolution infra red spectrometers which performances are discussed elsewhere guimbaud et al 2011 guimbaud et al 2016 catoire et al 2017 among them the iris instrument named spirit biophy to measure co2 volume mixing ratio and δ13c released at ground surface guimbaud et al 2016 measurements were made using the closed chamber method and the keeling plot approach pataki et al 2003 precision and accuracy for δ13cco2 usually varies from 0 15 to 0 5 from a single keeling plot extraction with best precision obtained for high co2 flux intensity in summer and for high temperature stability of the instrument under cloudy and low wind periods it has been shown guimbaud et al 2016 noel et al 2016b that before and after biodegradation stimulation a correlation is observed from upstream to downstream the pollution plume between i co2 flux emitted at the surface and the btex concentration in the aquifer and ii δ13c values of co2 emitted at the surface δ13cco2 and δ13c values of btex in groundwater δ13cbtex as representative main hydrocarbons in that site from upstream to downstream the pollution plume δ13cco2 values at ground surface are correlated with δ13c values of btex hydrocarbons benzene b and toluene t in that site in the aquifer with a difference δ δ13cco2 δ13cbt 3 mainly for toluene see guimbaud et al 2016 and result section this difference observed is mainly due to preferential selection of light isotopes 12c during bacterial metabolism hydrocarbon redox degradation pathways and hence release of 13c depleted co2 slightly magnified by fractionation during vertical diffusion of co2 to the surface assuming that no other fractionation process occurs other fractionation processes leading to high δ13c co2 may interact and complexify the system conrad et al 1997 such as co2 issued from atmospheric contamination co2 produced from methanogenic activity dissolution of carbonate minerals biodegradation of endogenous soil organic matter such depleted δ13cco2 values observed in that site could indicate that hydrocarbon biodegradation occurs via sulfate reduction conrad et al 1997 landmeyer et al 1996 wanner et al 2019 the guide for assessing biodegradation and source identification of organic ground water contaminants using compound specific isotope analysis csia from the united states environmental protection agency u s epa 2008 provides the recommended isotope enrichment factors εps under sulfate reducing conditions for main btex ranging from 3 7 to 0 8 as summarized in table 1 it is commonly observed that the rate of benzene biodegradation is much slower than tex and other petroleum hydrocarbon constituents under anaerobic conditions atteia and guillot 2007 guimbaud et al 2016 kolhatkar and schnobrich 2017 toth et al 2021 sra et al 2022 half lives for natural degradation of gasoline compounds in anaerobic groundwater under sulfate reducing conditions were found to be larger than 800 days for benzene significantly higher than for other tex 230 days for ethylbenzene 120 days for toluene 125 to 180 days for xylenes and 160 to 180 days for naphthalene and trimethylbenzene thierrin et al 1993 equivalent to first order attenuation rates 0 5 year 1 for benzene and 1 6 to 3 0 year 1 for tex kolhatkar and schnobrich 2017 reported natural attenuation rate constants for benzene under sulphate reducing condition 0 20 0 46 year 1 under such conditions verardo 2016 reported from literature review first order natural degradation rates 1 to 2 order of magnitude lower for benzene 1 8 10 2 1 8 year 1 than for tex 1 8 18 year 1 due to the higher concentration of tex in the pollution plume and to the higher reactivity of tex having similar first order attenuation rates than benzene it is considered that attenuation is mainly due from these most abundant and reactive species where tex have also similar δ13chydrocarbon value see next section and similar estimated attenuation first order rate constants under sulfate reducing conditions an εps range is found to be 2 1 with a mean deviation of 0 5 for typical concentration values 9 3 1 for x t e respectively using εps from table 1 given from the csia data base u s epa 2008 2 2 approach to monitor the biodegradation rate of hydrocarbon substrates by δ13cco2 analysis released from ground surface within an expanding plume the quantification of pollutant substrate biodegradation efficiency within an expanding plume from the source to an observation well using solution of rayleigh model based on single substrate concentration and δ analysis is well documented richnow et al 2003 fischer et al 2007 thullner et al 2012 denk et al 2017 van breukelen 2007a van breukelen 2007b boundary conditions for the application of the rayleigh model are given from assumption a 1 to 3 a1 the pollutant plume is only fed by the dissolution of the hydrocarbon source located upstream in the former gasoline tank area and groundwater pollutants are well mixed systems downstream the area of extension the lnapl as discussed in verardo 2016 a2 biodegradation is the dominant process over others affecting the dissolved pollutant migration such as volatilization or sorption desorption as discussed in verardo 2016 a3 low percentage mass loss of substrate should occurs from two monitoring wells or during migration of the plume within the period of investigation ideally considered below 10 to assume mass balance conservation made a boundary condition for this derived form of the rayleigh equation additional boundary conditions or hypothesis are required to assess biodegradation rate of the groundwater hydrocarbon substrates from ground surface δco2 emissions analysis in real conditions hydrocarbon pollutants in contaminated aquifer are present as a mixture biodegradation kinetic fractionation factor α depends mainly on the chemical composition of hydrocarbon contaminant and biochemical pathways of biodegradation associated with redox conditions to assess an average dynamic for a pool of hydrocarbons substrate biodegradation in contaminated aquifer one can assume a4 that considered contaminants starts with similar average initial δ value same biodegradation rate and same αps pco2 resulting from biodegradation of s substrates this site is characterized by close δ values of btex benzene 28 toluene and m p xylenes 27 5 and ethyl benzene 27 upstream nearby the prb with isotopic enrichment from 0 5 to 1 after bioactivation of the pbr the highest for toluene verardo 2016 a common biodegradation rate could be assumed in previous section for the largest pool of reactive substrates with a common kinetic fractionation factor α 0 9979 or ε 2 1 the apparent fractionation factor αapp from the transformation of the hydrocarbon substrate s solubilized in the top layer of groundwater to co2 product p released to the atmosphere ground surface is given by eq 7 α app r x p r x s where the substrate s concentration in groundwater at spot x along the main migration axis at time t is given by cx s t and the isotopic concentration ratio 13c 12c of s in groundwater and of the biodegradation product p co2 released at soil surface to the atmosphere are given by rx s and rx p respectively αapp results from the kinetic fractionation factor of p relative to s in the water aquifer α and from the fractionation factor due to selective vertical diffusion of the lighter isotope of co2 product from the top layer of groundwater to the ground surface αdiff if one assume a5 that the source of co2 released at ground surface from hydrocarbons biodegradation at water table of the aquifer should be dominant versus co2 released from other potential sources such as co2 issued from atmospheric contamination i dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals ii biodegradation of endogenous soil organic matter reducing then the effect of other type of fractionation processes i the groundwater is also in equilibrium with calcite verardo 2016 meaning that there is no precipitation of carbonate or dissolution of from sediment which could affect the content of mineral carbon in the aquifers and its isotopic composition the aquifer is characterized by high alkalinity 5 10 3 m with a stable ph 6 8 with no significant changes after biostimulation during treatment anaerobic conditions remained mainly unchanged as regards o2 dissolved concentration collected from p1 p2 and pz29 relative to data shown in fig 4 left panel just before treatment february 2014 except for p4 above the prb at the beginning and at the end of treatment where o2 dissolved concentration could reach 5 mg l 1 verardo 2016 ii possible competition and seasonal effects occurring for the natural soil respiration and petroleum hydrocarbon biodegradation benisrael et al 2019 wanner et al 2019 in this specific site natural soil respiration can be neglected due to the low amount of organic matter inside the soil surface vegetation is homogeneous covered by a layer of grass during the high vegetation season which almost disappears during the winter season in order to minimize the contribution of natural soil respiration the 15 cm top layer of the ground surface was removed before installation of collars into the soil for each metering station co2 fluxes from uncontaminated or less contaminated area collars 7 and 8 located out of the contamination plume vary from 0 7 to 2 5 μmol m 2 s 1 from end of winter to summer this is assumed to be the maximum contribution of soil respiration or other processes of co2 released above the hydrocarbon underground layer as a consequence fluxes observed under contaminated areas with typical values varying from 5 to 45 μmol m 2 s 1 imply that co2 natural soil respiration represents at most 5 of co2 emissions relative to hydrocarbon biodegradation from winter to summer as a consequence under that specific site the low emissions levels of co2 outside the pollution plume imply that the fraction of co2 emissions issued from natural soil respiration is assumed to be negligible compared to co2 emitted from gasoline hydrocarbon biodegradation previous studies revealed that diffusion through the non saturated zone could lead to isotope distillation effects with negative δ values for co2 cerling et al 1991 and for organic compounds bouchard et al 2008a bouchard et al 2008b the isotope effect due to co2 volatilization in the non saturated zone to soil surface is assessed by measuring gas phase δ13cco2 directly on top of the water table through monitoring wells above the reactive barriers to bypass the underground soil intermediate and δ13cco2 on soil surface i e from closest collars july 2014 data provides δ13cco2 values of 29 2 0 6 vpdb from monitoring wells versus 29 9 0 4 vpdb from collars surrounding the reactive barriers respectively values are found to be more spread 28 4 0 7 vpdb versus 29 2 0 5 vpdb in october 2014 this indicate vertical diffusion δdiff value of 0 7 leading to a vertical diffusion fractionation factor αdiff value of 0 9993 therefore possible negative δ values fractionated co2 produced from volatilized fractionated organic compounds in the non saturated zone is neglected because the loss of organic compounds by volatilization is insignificant relative to their mass balance in the aquifer under our study site αapp 0 997 obtained from δ δ13cco2 δ13cbtex 3 results approximatively from the kinetic fractionation factor of co2 relative to tex estimated in the water aquifer α 0 9979 or ε 2 1 and from the fractionation factor due to selective vertical diffusion of the lighter isotope of co2 product from the top layer of groundwater to the ground surface αdiff of 0 9993 or ε 0 7 where αapp is then given by eq 8 α app α α diff among α values αapp is the only assessable variable from field measurable data δp of co2 released in atmosphere at ground surface and δs of hydrocarbon substrate solubilized in top layer of aquifer αapp can be expressed from eq 7 eq 9 α app δ 13 c p 1000 δ 13 c s 1000 α αdiff and thus αapp are generally assumed to be invariable with time t mariotti et al 1981 and remained constant along the horizontal migration of s at the scale of the pollution plume a6 solving rb s and ra s from eq 7 and replacing into the left member of eq 5 yields to eq 10 by removal of αapp eq 10a f r b p r a p 1 α 1 eq 10b f δ 13 c b p 1000 δ 13 c a p 1000 1000 ε with pco2 and eq 11 ε α 1 1000 being the associated isotope fractionation factor expressed in to support derivation of eq 10 from eqs 5 and 7 co2 realized at ground surface should be directly issued from the biodegradation of the underneath hydrocarbons substrate in the saturated zone meaning additional assumption are made a7 horizontal migration velocity of the well mixed hydrocarbon substrates is assimilated to the velocity of the groundwater flow because sorption and desorption are neglected processes in this site a8 sorption and desorption during advective horizontal and vertical migrations in the saturated zone are not leading to isotope fractionation as neglected in this site and from discussion in elsner et al 2005 and schmidt et al 2004 a9 vertical diffusion of co2 within the unsaturated zone from top layer of the aquifer to ground surface is assumed to be extremely fast relative to advective horizontal migration of co2 in the saturated zone in the aquifer along the pollution plume according to abreu and johnson 2006 and to luo et al 2009 under this site the soil effective porosity of 15 is known to be characterized by efficient gas transport in air filled pores according to de robert 2006 where the author also mentioned that co2 exchange through water filled pores is very slow relatively to air filled pores because co2 diffusion coefficient in water is 10 000 less than in air the percentage of mass loss for a pool of substrates between spot a and b ml with similar initial δ value and biodegradation rate can be derived from eq 12 assuming a6 if an average α value can be obtained either i from field data by derivation of an αapp value from eq 7 with measurements rx p and rx s followed by assessment of α from eq 8 i e α αapp αdiff or ii from estimated value of α from the csia data base u s epa 2008 derivation of ml from conditions i an assessment of αdiff is needed from field data to verify assumption a10 αdiff 1 α 1 or εdiff 1000 ε 1000 leading then to α αapp where αapp is extracted from field study the percentage of mass loss from biodegradation for a pool of substrates between spot a and b ml is obtained from solving f from eq 10 and replacing it into eq 6 eq 12a ml 1 r b p r a p 1 α 1 100 eq 12b ml 1 δ 13 c b p 1000 δ 13 c a p 1000 1000 ε 100 as a summary percentage of mass loss ml from biodegradation of hydrocarbons along a pollution plume migrating horizontally with the flow of groundwater from spot a to spot b could be obtained by measuring the isotopic concentration ratio 13c 12c rp values of the co2 product p released at ground surface above spots a and b at time t when physical and chemical properties for the contaminated site meet appropriate conditions in addition to the usual approaches based on groundwater hydrocarbons δ13c substrate s analysis eq 12c eq 12c ml 1 δ 13 c b s 1000 δ 13 c a s 1000 1000 ε 100 the first order kinetic approach of the monod model is commonly used for remediation site bekins et al 1998 bauer et al 2006 with good approximation for upper limits of btex concentration of 5 mg l 1 according to bekins et al 1998 and cozzarelli et al 2010 first order kinetic approach is used along the pollution plume according to the btex mixing ratios monitored in well p4 located 5 m upstream the front head of the prb section ii 1 the estimated first order attenuation rate constant is commonly presented to discuss and compare biodegradation rate in aquifers between 2 monitoring points along a flow path u s epa 2008 the first order kinetic assumption is usually an appropriate simplification to describe the biodegradation in aquifers because i mass transfer limiting factors are often rate limits in porous media and ii fickian diffusion is a first order process with respect to the substrate concentration in the bulk liquid alvarez de pedro and ilman 2005 wiedemeier et al 2007 biodegradation rate between spot a and spot b is calculated from travelling time t of substrates between the two spots given by the ratio of the distance l between spots a and b and the horizontal velocity v of the substrate migration thus the 1st order biodegradation rate constant k is given in eq 13e based on the δ13cco2 product monitoring eq 13a n b s n a s e k t eq 13b k ln n b s n a s t ln f t eq 13c k ln r b p r a p 1 α 1 t eq 13d k ln r a p r

discussion assessment of the biodegradation rate br f t of the groundwater hydrocarbon substrates using δ13cco2 surface analysis 3 1 δ13cco2 values at the scale of the pollution plume and spatial resolution this work uses additional data set compared to guimbaud et al 2016 from the less bioactive season and new data from the year 2015 period δ13cco2 values increase 13c enrichment as a function of the pollution plume coordinate figs 5 and 6a c fig 5 shows that δ13c values of toluene increase by 3 7 and 2 1 in may and december 2014 respectively over a distance of 40 m along the pollution plume in the same conditions δ13c values of benzene increase by 1 8 and 1 2 according also to linear regression given in fig 5 this is the consequence of selective biodegradation of the lighter carbon isotope 12c for toluene and benzene leading then to 13c enrichment of toluene and benzene during their migration in the groundwater the higher 13c enrichment for toluene is due to its faster biodegradation rate than benzene as a consequence δ13c values of co2 released at ground surface follows the same trend with and increase by 4 4 and 2 7 in may and december 2014 respectively from upstream to downstream the pollution plume δ13cco2 values at ground surface are correlated with δ13c values in groundwater with a difference δ δ13cco2 δ13chydrocarbon 2 0 and 0 9 for toluene and benzene respectively at prb 0 coordinate fig 5 this difference observed is also due to preferential selection of light isotopes 12c during bacterial metabolism leading to 13c depletion of co2 produced and then released at ground surface geophysical methods electrical resistivity and induced polarization noel et al 2016b combined with gas analyses co2 fluxes mainly guimbaud et al 2016 have demonstrated that the amplitude of natural biodegradation changes due to seasonal variations is much more pronounced at the all scale of the pollution plume than at the scale of the prb local effect around or downstream of the prb during the period of investigation according to this point mentioned above the percentage mass loss of the hydrocarbon substrate ml in given in eqs 12 along the axis of the pollution plume is best determined at the relevant scale of the site with the aim to identify a seasonal variation linear enrichment of δ13cbt and thus δ13cco2 heavy isotopes as a function of the distance to the source is expected for biodegradation in a contaminant plume aelion et al 2010 due to the few numbers of collars set right above the axis of the pollution plume and the precision given for δ13cco2 and δ13cbt data along the axis of the pollution plume attenuation rate for hydrocarbon degradation is not given between two monitoring collars or wells as commonly done but along the axis the pollution plume by reporting each collar position as a function of a pollution plume coordinate then a linear function is adjusted along the axis of the pollution plume from data shown in figs 5 and 6a c best fit is confirmed to be linear for the δ13cco2 and δ13cbt trend as a function of the pollution plume coordinate however linear regression of δ13cco2 values as a function of plume coordinates is significant at the 0 05 level p value only in 05 06 2014 0 01 10 07 2014 0 03 and 12 02 2014 0 04 and at the 0 1 level p value in 07 01 2014 0 10 and 02 03 2015 0 08 when higher emission of co2 lead to higher precision on δ13cco2 values summer or early falls or when experimental conditions stable weather conditions lead to more frequent and accurate data see figs 5 and 6a c for r2 and p values linear regression becomes significant at the 0 05 level for fig 6 a and b using their whole dataset due to the higher number of data points used but with degraded r2 values r2 0 20 p value 0 015 for fig 6a r2 0 14 p value 0 019 for fig 6b because this aggregation approach is not theoretically justified due to the overall degradation rate of hydrocarbons which depends on a seasonal cycle this linear trend is disrupted just above the prb where fresh deeper hydrocarbons with lower δ13chydrocabon value may have migrated to the upper bioactive layer from pumping wells low spatial resolution for δ13cco2 above and just around the prb is explained by the too few effective hours per day available for measurements on that site and priority has been focused to perform measurements at the scale of the pollution plume area therefore quantification of the bioremediation efficiency at the resolution scale of the prb had to be suppressed as mentioned above but could be discussed from additional observations 3 2 biodegradation rate of the groundwater residual hydrocarbon substrate the percentage of mass loss for the pool of hydrocarbon substrates ml and the 1st order biodegradation rate constant k are determined i from eqs 12b and 13e respectively based on the δ13cco2 product monitoring and ii from eqs 12c and 13f respectively based on the δ13ctoluene substrate monitoring ml and k values are determined by using the kinetic fractionation factor of co2 relative to the most reactive substrates tex estimated in the water aquifer α 0 9979 or ε 2 1 from the csia data base u s epa 2008 approach ii used for data presented in table 2 and 5 approach ii is consistent with the other possible approach i made in earlier section measurements in the field of an overall αapp 0 997 obtained from δ δ13cco2 δ13cbtex 3 and of a fractionation factor due to selective vertical diffusion of the lighter isotope of co2 product from the top layer of groundwater to the ground surface αdiff of 0 9993 or εdiff 0 7 resulting then to the kinetic fractionation factor of co2 relative to tex estimated in the water aquifer from eq 8 α 0 9993 or ε 2 3 similar to the one estimated from csia α 0 9979 or ε 2 1 0 5 according to previous discussions ml month 1 and k years 1 values given in table 2 are best derived from the linear regression of δ13c as a function of the pollution plume coordinate in figs 5 and 6a c where the slope of the fitted linear function provides the δ13c values of co2 or toluene per unit of travelling distance l the travelling time t of hydrocarbon substrates in ground water between spots are given by the ratio of the travelling distance l and the horizontal velocity v of the substrate migration ml and k values are discussed for data with p value 0 1 and to have enough data for significant precision on data sensitivity versus seasonal variation ml and k maximum values are obtained 6 weeks after the activation of the prb in may 2014 7 4 2 2 1 4 month 1 and 0 92 0 29 0 17 year 1 and during july and october with closed averaged value 3 8 1 1 0 7 month 1 and 0 46 0 14 0 09 year 1 ml and k minimum values are obtained 10 months after activation of the prb in mid winter in february 2015 1 4 0 4 0 3 month 1 and 0 17 0 05 0 03 year 1 these values are close or lower than the one obtained 6 months before activation the prb in september 2013 2 2 0 7 0 4 month 1 and 0 27 0 09 0 05 year 1 in addition k values obtained after the activation of the prb in may and december 2014 from δ13cco2 monitoring 0 92 0 29 0 17 year 1 and 0 28 0 08 0 06 year 1 respectively are consistent with the ones obtained from simultaneous δ13ctoluene monitoring 0 78 0 24 0 15 year 1 and 0 44 0 13 0 09 year 1 according to the precision on d δ13c d l m 1 derived from the linear regression on each data set indeed ml and k precision depends also on the precision on d δ13c d l m 1 derived from the linear regression of the linear fit 5 to 30 linked to precision on each δ13cco2 value 0 15 at the best all best obtained in summer for the highest flux of co2 precision decays in winter and in early spring due to lower precision for individual δ13cco2 determination from keeling plot approach the small fluxes of co2 in that periods increases the duration from 5 to 30 min for enough co2 accumulation usually up to 800 ppmv in the chamber for accurate δ13cco2 value determination from keeling plot approach competing then with the stability drift of the instrument in addition in such small flux conditions linear fits used less numbers of δ13cco2 values at low active seasons because of this longer period needed to obtain one δ13cco2 value acknowledging that each field campaign were limited to the same duration 7 to 8 effective hours per day the similar simultaneous δ13c trends for toluene and benzene and δ13c trends for co2 along the gw path coordinates as well as the agreement of first order attenuation rate constants derived from δ13c trend for co2 with the one derived from δ13c trend for toluene considered as a representative hydrocarbon for attenuation rate of gasoline compounds in the contaminated site argue that 13c enrichment of co2 along the pollution plume is more triggered from btex biodegradation toluene mainly than 13c enrichment of co2 produced from possible indirect processes implying methanogenesis intermediates 3 3 seasonal variation of the biodegradation rate and effect of the prb 3 3 1 seasonal variation of the biodegradation rate fig 7 presents the co2 average flux μmol m 2 s 1 along the pollution plume upstream above and downstream the prb co2 emission intensity is also a proxy of biodegradation efficiency for a better visualization the y x axis intercept is set on march 27 2014 which is the starting date for the activation of the prb co2 emissions are observed to be stimulated during the high microbial activity season september 2013 june july and august 2014 june 2015 varying in a similar way downstream above and upstream the prb from 5 to 45 μmol m 2 s 1 from winter to summer co2 emissions are correlated to the annual cycle of the soil temperature and anti correlated with the groundwater table level guimbaud et al 2016 noel et al 2016a in agreement with stimulation factors of biodegradation efficiency temperature increase first order attenuation rate constant k table 2 are mainly correlated with the seasonal variation of co2 fluxes fig 7 where max values are in summers and min values in winters except for june 2015 where k value derived from d δ13c d l has high level of imprecision p value 0 23 both values seasonal variation is mainly due to the annual cycle of the natural biodegradation activity at the scale of the pollution plume 3 3 2 effect of the prb on the biodegradation rate k and co2 fluxes values rise after activation of the prb due to possible biodegradation stimulation indeed geophysics measurements in noel et al 2016b argued that an efficient natural biodegradation already prevails before activation of the prb despite δ13cco2 low spatial resolution that do not cover the zone affected by the biostimulation and the short duration of the biostimulation 1 year a co2 flux increase fig 7 and a δ13cco2 decrease or some more negative value fig 6a c are observed above the prb meaning that possible effect of the prb can be discussed hereafter 1 after aerobic biostimulation co2 emissions increase significantly just above the prb relative to upstream and downstream the barrier during the highest season summer 2014 and june 2015 in fig 7 this is also shown from data provided in table 3 table 3 presents the average changes of co2 fluxes over a one year lapse time i e the ratio year 1 average flux to year flux at given date for upstream above and downstream the prb the one year lapse time is chosen for ratios to remove seasonal variation of natural biodegradation in order to provide a better evaluation of the stimulated bioremediation efficiency started on march 27 2014 ratio of average flux are the highest above the prb when calculated after biostimulation relative to before biostimulation 3 9 2 6 and 3 5 in sep 14 oct 14 and feb 15 respectively late effect of the prb is also observed downstream the pollution plume more than one year after aerobic biostimulation the ratio of average flux in 2015 2 1 1 2 2 4 reached higher values than in 2014 1 0 and 1 2 2 more negative values of δ13cco2 observed at ground surface above the reactive barrier after biostimulation fig 6a c may be explained by possible remobilization of fresh unreacted contaminants btex from the lower to upper level of the saturated zone of the aquifer table 4 presents the btex concentration mg l 1 measured as the main hydrocarbon substrates in the groundwater surface aquifer btex concentration reported along the axis of the pollution plume increased above and near the prb after its treatment starting in march 27 2014 within the accuracies given for data in table 4 the consequence could be an underestimation more negative values observed than expected for the δ13cco2 emissions after biostimulation above and downstream the prb leading to degraded r2 values for linearity observed in fig 6a c one can note that co2 fluxes combined with isotopic analysis are complementary to interpret biodegradation processes at the scale of the prb indeed in the basis of isotopic analysis only no effect of the prb on the biodegradation efficiency would have been specifically noticed as a result of the two following observations i summer k value obtained in september 2013 p value 0 43 is note accurate enough to compare with summer 2014 k values fig 6c and ii the only ground water btex analysis performed before and at early stage of the biophy project was a benzene δ13c analysis performed on june 1 2012 exhibiting similar d δ13c d l value 0 0345 r2 0 77 than in april 2014 0 0240 r2 0 78 and may 2014 0 0404 r2 0 59 and december 2014 0 0331 r2 0 13 arguing that the activation of the prb did not have an obvious effect on benzene biodegradation 4 conclusions and perspectives it has been demonstrated that natural remediation efficiency of contaminated soil aquifers by gasoline hydrocarbons btex mainly can be quantified using the rayleigh equations for δ13cco2 released at ground surface above the pollution plume instead of usual approaches based on groundwater hydrocarbons δ13c analysis when physical and chemical properties for the contaminated site are appropriate the validation approach for that specific site is discussed and verified by comparison of first order attenuation rate constant determined from δ13cco2 analysis emitted at ground surface and from δ13ctoluene analysis in ground water and also supported by seasonal variation of co2 flux analysis in that field first order biodegradation rate constants and annual variation calculated from this approach shows max values after the activation of the prb in may 2014 0 92 0 29 0 17 year 1 and during july and october 0 46 0 14 0 09 year 1 and minimum values in mid winter in february 2015 0 17 0 05 0 03 year 1 these values are close or lower than the one obtained before activation the prb in september 2013 0 27 0 09 0 05 year 1 supporting that biodegradation still remained process under anaerobic reducing conditions as it was before activation of the prb during natural attenuation first order biodegradation rate constants values are triggered by seasonal variation of microbial activities rather than activation of the prb at the scale of the pollution plume these first order biodegradation rate constants 0 14 1 21 year 1 are in the lower range with reported in literature for similar contaminated sites 1 6 18 year 1 considering natural attenuation under sulfate reducing conditions as regards improvements for fields studies and investigation for that and future sites i higher spatial resolutions analysis with an extension period would have been needed to assess the bioremediation efficiency around the prb due to the large spatial variability of co2 flux and δ13c measured also linked to a large spatial inhomogeneity of biodegradation soil structure and diffusivity higher spatial resolution for samples grid of 5 m or less instead of 10 m around the bioremediation barrier would have been needed for that specific site to get a better precision on biodegradation rate constant values and to assess the bioremediation efficiency around the prb remediation process should have been pursued for a longer period at least until end of 2015 to assess the relative efficiency of this bioactivation through a significant migration plume distance and the post effect after steady state remobilization of btex in the upper layer of the aquifer indeed the important delay for the settlement of the pilot site within the limited period of the anr ecotech biophy project and the short periods available for investigation 1 day month 1 in average had limited spatial resolution and the period of measurements after bioactivation one can note that such spatial resolution and delay are less needed for homogenous soils structure or for natural attenuation by opposition to enhanced bioremediation where the installation of the treatment process prb or other techniques may remobilize contaminants leading to complex interpretation of the dynamic process of biodegradation this remobilization problematic is unfortunately common to whatever kind of the approach substrate or product used for biodegradation monitoring ii to improve assessment of bioremediation rate kinetic more accurate values of ε fractionation factor for the representative hydrocarbon contaminants are also required as a consequence more experiments need to be done in surrogate soils and pollutants on large laboratory well characterized soil macrocosms such soil experimental platform is under construction at brgm within the joint region centre europe funded project ard2020 pivots prime as regards economical aspect the ability to quantify the biodegradation rate of hydrocarbons in a contaminated aquifer using the δ 13 c co2 approach analysis is of great interest the δ13cco2 online surface gas monitoring approach is an efficient substitute of the classical methods where the monitoring of groundwater hydrocarbon substrates δ13c analysis requires land manipulations and underground sampling δ13cco2 surface gas monitoring is fast to be set up and of low cost installation because no boreholes or wells have to be dug and only movable manual chambers are needed therefore δ13cco2 surface gas monitoring provides fast analysis of the status of the contaminated sites if mechanisms of co2 production and transfer could be understood a strong economic interest can be found in this gas monitoring approach the best cost efficiency policy for the choice of the remediation process for contaminated

1186,ground surface analysis of co2 emissions with δ13c determination is experimentally demonstrated to be a potential methodology to monitor on line the dynamics of petroleum hydrocarbon biodegradation in soil aquifers thanks to the improvement of the isotopic ratio infra red spectroscopy technique biodegradation rate of remaining hydrocarbon substrates in groundwater can be quantified using basic application of the rayleigh equations by δ13cco2 analysis released at ground surface above the pollution plume instead of usual approaches based on groundwater hydrocarbons δ13c analysis when physical and chemical properties for the contaminated site meet appropriate conditions the validation approach for that gasoline contaminated specific site is discussed and verified by comparison of first order attenuation rate constant determined from δ13cco2 analysis emitted at ground surface and from δ13ctoluene analysis in ground water a kinetic fractionation factor α of 0 9979 or ε value of 2 1 0 5 is estimated for the biodegradation of the most reactive hydrocarbon substrates tex the treatment of this rayleigh equations by linear regression of δ13cco2 values along the predominant direction of groundwater flow leads to the following results and conclusions for that site i first order biodegradation rate constants and annual variation are maximum after the activation of a permeable reactive barrier prb in may 2014 0 92 0 29 0 17 year 1 and during july and october 0 46 0 14 0 09 year 1 and minimum in mid winter in february 2015 0 17 0 05 0 03 year 1 given by the estimation range for ε these results are in the lower range with reported in literature for similar contaminated sites 1 6 18 year 1 considering natural attenuation under sulfate reducing conditions and ii the seasonal variation of the first order biodegradation rate constant is mainly correlated with the seasonal variation of the co2 flux where maximum values are in summers and minimum values in winters both seasonal variations are mainly due to the annual cycle of the natural biodegradation activity at the scale of the pollution plume rather than the activation of the prb this work demonstrates that δ13cco2 analysis released at ground surface from biodegradation of groundwater hydrocarbons could provide under characterized and appropriate conditions a non intrusive without soil samplings fast and low cost online method to monitor and therefore to optimize soil remediation processes in real time monitored natural attenuation or enhanced bioremediation keywords groundwater bioremediation hydrocarbon btex iris δ13cco2 δ13ctoluene rayleigh eqs data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction and challenges spills or leaks of petroleum hydrocarbons from gasoline station lead to contamination of soil and groundwater especially by benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene btex compounds btex are the most toxic petroleum hydrocarbons and are usually the primary drivers for remediation barona et al 2007 el naas et al 2014 monitored natural attenuation or enhanced bioremediation of btex are two major site remediation technologies that rely on the occurrence of biodegradation biodegradation processes of hydrocarbons substrates by micro organisms usually induces unidirectional reactions hydrocarbons to the biologically mediated product or final product such as co2 with isotope fractionation of carbon c involving an increase of the isotopic ratio 13c 12c rs in the remaining substrate s and a decrease of the isotopic ratio 13c 12c rp in the released product p associated kinetic fractionation factor α is expressed as in mariotti et al 1981 eq 1 α α ps r p r s isotope δ13c values are more often used than isotope r values for sample data analysis and discussion δ13c value is defined for any sample according to eq 2 eq 2 δ 13 c r r vpdb 1 1000 where r and rvpdb are the isotopic concentration ratios 13c 12c of the groundwater sample and of the international standard the vienna pee dee belemnite respectively rvpdb is 1 12372 as defined by craig 1954 the isotopic fractionation of groundwater hydrocarbon substrate can be described using a simple rayleigh model which was originally derived by rayleigh 1896 for the case of fractional distillation of mixed liquid using the following equation eq 3 r s t1 r s t0 n s t1 n s t0 α 1 f t 1 t0 α 1 where rs t1 and rs 0 are the 13c 12c of the unreacted substrate s at time t1 and at the initial time t0 respectively ns t1 and ns t0 are the molar or molecule number of the unreacted s at time t1 relative to time t0 and thus f t1 t0 is the molar or mass fraction of s remaining in the sample at time t1 relative to t0 measured in a well mixed aquifer considering a closed system for the substrate not movable or movable such as a plume carried by the stream of ground water the rayleigh model is used to quantify the degradation of a single substrate in a well mixed aquifer to a single product assuming that other non degradative physical processes such as dissolution sorption and volatilization do not cause large carbon isotopic shifts at equilibrium mariotti et al 1981 u s epa 2008 guidance document on csia discusses how to use and interpret compound specific stable isotope data in field settings using rayleigh model in a groundwater plume in all discussion provided in sections 3 3 4 2 table 4 2 5 3 and 7 4 of the u s epa 2008 document it is assumed that the difference in isotopic signature between two points a source or upgradient monitoring point and b downgradient monitoring point at a snapshot in time t in a groundwater plume is due to the transformation that occurred during the travel time estimated as distance l between spots a and b divided by groundwater velocity v as written in eqs 4 in other words this use of rayleigh model is similar to changes in isotopic signatures over time for a constituent in a closed system say lab microcosm or a batch reactor eq 4 r b s t r a s t n b s t n a s t α 1 f t α 1 to estimate the mass loss of s of groundwater hydrocarbon substrates by δ13c analysis within the plume the remaining substrate mass fraction ft at time t between two spots a and b can be derived from the kinetic fractionation factor α measured in laboratories or assessed under field conditions and the isotopic concentration ratio 13c 12c of s ra s or rb s measured in observation wells a and b at time t with suffix t removed from latter equations eq 5 f r b s r a s 1 α 1 f δ 13 c b s 1000 δ 13 c a s 1000 1000 ε with ε α 1 1000 being the associated isotope fractionation factor expressed in eqs 5 are identical to eq 7 17 in the u s epa 2008 guidance document on csia the extent of the hydrocarbon biodegradation could be expressed as the mass loss of s in the time interval t mlt as expressed in eq 6 to discuss in later section one of the boundary condition limiting the use of this rayleigh equation form eq 6 ml 1 f 100 the evolution of ml over time is also a key parameter to estimate the time to achieve groundwater objectives due to natural or enhanced bioremediation of hydrocarbons contaminated aquifers the main inconvenient of this monitoring approach based on hydrocarbon substrate pollutants concentration and δ determination is that monitoring wells to be drilled for sampling groundwater are needed it has been suggested that monitoring the isotope δ13c values of the biodegradation product pco2 labeled δ13cco2 or δ13cp released at ground surface as a proxy of the hydrocarbon substrate pollutant δ values could be a more convenient way to assess the groundwater hydrocarbon biodegradation kinetic within high spatial and temporal resolutions within the latter approach soil drilling or excavation is not needed the keeling plot method to measure δ values of the biodegradation product pco2 released at ground surface only requires a movable closed chamber set on ground surface where δ values of the accumulated co2 gas is directly measured online by isotopic ratio infra red spectroscopy iris technique noel et al 2016a 2016b guimbaud et al 2016 only for few minutes thanks to the precision improvements made by iris techniques in the last decades in the gas phase this paper aims to demonstrate that the biodegradation efficiency of hydrocarbons in a gasoline contaminated aquifer under monitored natural attenuation or enhanced bioremediation could be monitored by ground surface δco2 emissions as a first approximation improving then the ability to observe and assess quickly effects of remediation processes that could be applied in the field boundary conditions for the application of the rayleigh model to assess biodegradation rate of the groundwater hydrocarbon substrates from ground surface δ13cco2 emissions is discussed at the scale of the contaminated field 2 material and methods and theory calculation 2 1 characterization of the investigating site the site widely described in verardo 2016 and verardo et al 2021 is a gas station near paris france where gasoline and diesel fuels leaked from tanks a simplified map of the site showing the permeable reactive barrier prb and the monitoring disposal of the gas metering station is presented in fig 1 a permeable reactive barrier prb was implemented 22 m downstream of the pollution source to stimulate biodegradation started on march 27 2014 and ended on june 26 2015 diluted h2o2 is added continuously to pumped water from wells located upstream the prb then oxygenated pumped water was injected across the prb that industrial site is composed of sandy and gravelly materials 1 5 m thick at surface and of a sandy lightly loamy layer containing mainly gritstone coarse grained of siliceous sandstone from brie region above 6 m depth the aquifer layer varies from 2 to 3 m depth on top from end of winter to end of summer and lies above the impermeable soil layer at 6 m depth the gas station is still in activity but the former tank source of contamination was removed in 1997 since that time a large reservoir of residual hydrocarbons located in the vadose zone just below the former tanks is continuously feeding the underneath groundwater with refined petroleum residual light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl was found in soil between 2 and 4 m depth at saturation range between 0 5 and 2 4 localization of the residual lnapl is shown in fig 2 where collars 19 20 and 21 are the only ones located above the residual lnapl area ending upstream collar 11 from these observations the simplifying assumption that groundwater system is well mixed will be considered upstream and downstream the prb to estimate the mass loss of hydrocarbon substrates and their attenuation rate constant actually the pollution plume in groundwater is mainly composed of btex due to their longer resistance to biodegradation and their higher solubility compared to other hydrocarbons verardo et al 2021 groundwater analysis performed from 2012 to 2014 at the exit of the pollution plume monitoring well p4 fig 2 located 5 m upstream the front head of the prb 4 m upstream collar 11 and 17 m downstream the dismantled tanks in 1997 indicates max values of pollutants from the layer depth 2 m 4 m below soil surface with max values verardo et al 2021 for benzene 11 mgl 1 toluene 3 mgl 1 ethylbenzene 1 mgl 1 and xylene 6 mgl 1 total petroleum hydrocarbon tph c10 c40 and mtbe methyl tert butyl ether concentration max values are 1 mgl 1 and 100 μgl 1 respectively btex distribution extracted from verardo 2016 is shown in fig 3 btex are sampled from static headspace and analyzed by gc ms according to the nf iso 11423 1 protocol with quantification limit of 1 μgl 1 tph are sampled from liquid liquid extraction and analyzed by cg fid according to the nf en iso 9377 2 protocol accuracy varied from 30 to 50 blessing and saada 2013 the biodegradation of btex can be carried out under aerobic anoxic or anaerobic conditions in aerobic respiration the terminal electron acceptors tea is o2 but in the absence of oxygen a number of less highly oxidized compounds may serve assuming organisms capable of making use of them are present available teas are used in the environment in decreasing order of oxidation reduction potential no3 fe iii mn iv so4 2 and co2 davis et al 1999 johnson et al 2003 lari et al 2019 groundwater at the contaminant plume is anaerobic as shown in fig 4 extracted from verardo 2016 the concentrations of nitrates iron ii manganese ii and sulphates measured in the groundwater of the site made it possible to define the redox zones of biodegradation of hydrocarbons the biodegradation mechanisms existing within the plume of contaminants are also presented in fig 4 demonstrating that hydrocarbon biodegradation remains processed via anaerobic conditions and more precisely via sulfate reduction before enhanced bioremediation along the pollution plume mainly within the gas metering station zone after activation of the prb no evolution of the redox potential stable between 100 and 50 mv in the piezometers located near prb was noticed despite the injection of hydrogen peroxide this result and the presence of sulphates absence of manganese ii production and low iron ii production demonstrate that biodegradation remains anaerobic and processed via sulfate reduction due to a default of treatment verardo 2016 according to these lower limits of redox potential biodegradation seems not to proceed via methanogenenis this could be notified by the absence of methane realized at ground surface 0 1 nmol m 2 s 1 at one most active period july 1 2015 corresponding the detection limit of the ir greenhouse gas analyzer los gatos research inc ca used and at least to one order of magnitude lower than fluxes which can be found in literature for water bodies or aerobic soil surfaces guimbaud et al 2016 however hydrocarbon biodegradation under acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic reducing conditions methanogenesis may not be ignored within the residual lnapl light non aqueous phase liquid source zone located upstream the prb according to high btex concentration found in fig 4 conrad et al 1997 these methanogenesis paths are known to produce high δ13c values 13c enrichment of both co2 and ch4 gas and dic and dissolved methane in groundwater in addition aerobic oxidation of overlying ch4 in the vadose zone may also produce additional 13c enrichment of co2 conrad et al 1997 neumann et al 2016 and references therein despite concentration change in redox indicator compounds do not play for significant methanogenesis processes the δ13c value decays less upstream than downstream the prb 2 5 versus 4 vpdb guimbaud et al 2016 it implies that higher δ13c co2 could be produced upstream the prb from methanogenesis reducing then this δ13c value decays observed the kinetic approach given in that paper is thus limited by the relative importance of co2 produced methanogenesis paths in residual lnapl zone methanogenesis is assumed to be neglected in our study case as data including the lnapl zone do not affect the general trend of δ13c co2 and btex in order to assess the significance of co2 contribution by in direct methanogenesis conrad et al 1997 suggested that combined δ13c and 14c analyses of soil co2 gas and groundwater dic can yield to valuable insights into modes of microbial petroleum hydrocarbon degradation geophysical methods electrical resistivity and induced polarization had shown a high conductive and chargeable zone around 2 to 3 m depth which matches the polluted zone defined by geochemical borehole analyses at the top layer of the water table noel et al 2016b authors conclude that pollutant degradation mainly occurs in the top layer of the groundwater table where numerous chargeable bacteria produce conductive metabolites the age of the hydrocarbon leakage almost twenty years ago is sufficient to allow the development of natural bacterial flora able to degrade hydrocarbon the direction of the groundwater flow is oriented toward the northwest by 30 relative to the north fig 1 and obtained from piezometric maps using krigeage interpolation this direction defines also the pollution plume coordinate relative to the prb verardo 2016 the average groundwater velocity 17 m yr 1 is derived from the kinematic porosity of 15 the hydraulic gradient of 1 and an average hydraulic conductivity of 8 10 6 m s 1 measured in that site material and methods for co2 flux and δ13c characterization on each 21 gaz metric station see fig 1 for the position of the 21 collars set on ground surface are described in guimbaud et al 2016 lpc2e cnrs developed home built high resolution infra red spectrometers which performances are discussed elsewhere guimbaud et al 2011 guimbaud et al 2016 catoire et al 2017 among them the iris instrument named spirit biophy to measure co2 volume mixing ratio and δ13c released at ground surface guimbaud et al 2016 measurements were made using the closed chamber method and the keeling plot approach pataki et al 2003 precision and accuracy for δ13cco2 usually varies from 0 15 to 0 5 from a single keeling plot extraction with best precision obtained for high co2 flux intensity in summer and for high temperature stability of the instrument under cloudy and low wind periods it has been shown guimbaud et al 2016 noel et al 2016b that before and after biodegradation stimulation a correlation is observed from upstream to downstream the pollution plume between i co2 flux emitted at the surface and the btex concentration in the aquifer and ii δ13c values of co2 emitted at the surface δ13cco2 and δ13c values of btex in groundwater δ13cbtex as representative main hydrocarbons in that site from upstream to downstream the pollution plume δ13cco2 values at ground surface are correlated with δ13c values of btex hydrocarbons benzene b and toluene t in that site in the aquifer with a difference δ δ13cco2 δ13cbt 3 mainly for toluene see guimbaud et al 2016 and result section this difference observed is mainly due to preferential selection of light isotopes 12c during bacterial metabolism hydrocarbon redox degradation pathways and hence release of 13c depleted co2 slightly magnified by fractionation during vertical diffusion of co2 to the surface assuming that no other fractionation process occurs other fractionation processes leading to high δ13c co2 may interact and complexify the system conrad et al 1997 such as co2 issued from atmospheric contamination co2 produced from methanogenic activity dissolution of carbonate minerals biodegradation of endogenous soil organic matter such depleted δ13cco2 values observed in that site could indicate that hydrocarbon biodegradation occurs via sulfate reduction conrad et al 1997 landmeyer et al 1996 wanner et al 2019 the guide for assessing biodegradation and source identification of organic ground water contaminants using compound specific isotope analysis csia from the united states environmental protection agency u s epa 2008 provides the recommended isotope enrichment factors εps under sulfate reducing conditions for main btex ranging from 3 7 to 0 8 as summarized in table 1 it is commonly observed that the rate of benzene biodegradation is much slower than tex and other petroleum hydrocarbon constituents under anaerobic conditions atteia and guillot 2007 guimbaud et al 2016 kolhatkar and schnobrich 2017 toth et al 2021 sra et al 2022 half lives for natural degradation of gasoline compounds in anaerobic groundwater under sulfate reducing conditions were found to be larger than 800 days for benzene significantly higher than for other tex 230 days for ethylbenzene 120 days for toluene 125 to 180 days for xylenes and 160 to 180 days for naphthalene and trimethylbenzene thierrin et al 1993 equivalent to first order attenuation rates 0 5 year 1 for benzene and 1 6 to 3 0 year 1 for tex kolhatkar and schnobrich 2017 reported natural attenuation rate constants for benzene under sulphate reducing condition 0 20 0 46 year 1 under such conditions verardo 2016 reported from literature review first order natural degradation rates 1 to 2 order of magnitude lower for benzene 1 8 10 2 1 8 year 1 than for tex 1 8 18 year 1 due to the higher concentration of tex in the pollution plume and to the higher reactivity of tex having similar first order attenuation rates than benzene it is considered that attenuation is mainly due from these most abundant and reactive species where tex have also similar δ13chydrocarbon value see next section and similar estimated attenuation first order rate constants under sulfate reducing conditions an εps range is found to be 2 1 with a mean deviation of 0 5 for typical concentration values 9 3 1 for x t e respectively using εps from table 1 given from the csia data base u s epa 2008 2 2 approach to monitor the biodegradation rate of hydrocarbon substrates by δ13cco2 analysis released from ground surface within an expanding plume the quantification of pollutant substrate biodegradation efficiency within an expanding plume from the source to an observation well using solution of rayleigh model based on single substrate concentration and δ analysis is well documented richnow et al 2003 fischer et al 2007 thullner et al 2012 denk et al 2017 van breukelen 2007a van breukelen 2007b boundary conditions for the application of the rayleigh model are given from assumption a 1 to 3 a1 the pollutant plume is only fed by the dissolution of the hydrocarbon source located upstream in the former gasoline tank area and groundwater pollutants are well mixed systems downstream the area of extension the lnapl as discussed in verardo 2016 a2 biodegradation is the dominant process over others affecting the dissolved pollutant migration such as volatilization or sorption desorption as discussed in verardo 2016 a3 low percentage mass loss of substrate should occurs from two monitoring wells or during migration of the plume within the period of investigation ideally considered below 10 to assume mass balance conservation made a boundary condition for this derived form of the rayleigh equation additional boundary conditions or hypothesis are required to assess biodegradation rate of the groundwater hydrocarbon substrates from ground surface δco2 emissions analysis in real conditions hydrocarbon pollutants in contaminated aquifer are present as a mixture biodegradation kinetic fractionation factor α depends mainly on the chemical composition of hydrocarbon contaminant and biochemical pathways of biodegradation associated with redox conditions to assess an average dynamic for a pool of hydrocarbons substrate biodegradation in contaminated aquifer one can assume a4 that considered contaminants starts with similar average initial δ value same biodegradation rate and same αps pco2 resulting from biodegradation of s substrates this site is characterized by close δ values of btex benzene 28 toluene and m p xylenes 27 5 and ethyl benzene 27 upstream nearby the prb with isotopic enrichment from 0 5 to 1 after bioactivation of the pbr the highest for toluene verardo 2016 a common biodegradation rate could be assumed in previous section for the largest pool of reactive substrates with a common kinetic fractionation factor α 0 9979 or ε 2 1 the apparent fractionation factor αapp from the transformation of the hydrocarbon substrate s solubilized in the top layer of groundwater to co2 product p released to the atmosphere ground surface is given by eq 7 α app r x p r x s where the substrate s concentration in groundwater at spot x along the main migration axis at time t is given by cx s t and the isotopic concentration ratio 13c 12c of s in groundwater and of the biodegradation product p co2 released at soil surface to the atmosphere are given by rx s and rx p respectively αapp results from the kinetic fractionation factor of p relative to s in the water aquifer α and from the fractionation factor due to selective vertical diffusion of the lighter isotope of co2 product from the top layer of groundwater to the ground surface αdiff if one assume a5 that the source of co2 released at ground surface from hydrocarbons biodegradation at water table of the aquifer should be dominant versus co2 released from other potential sources such as co2 issued from atmospheric contamination i dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals ii biodegradation of endogenous soil organic matter reducing then the effect of other type of fractionation processes i the groundwater is also in equilibrium with calcite verardo 2016 meaning that there is no precipitation of carbonate or dissolution of from sediment which could affect the content of mineral carbon in the aquifers and its isotopic composition the aquifer is characterized by high alkalinity 5 10 3 m with a stable ph 6 8 with no significant changes after biostimulation during treatment anaerobic conditions remained mainly unchanged as regards o2 dissolved concentration collected from p1 p2 and pz29 relative to data shown in fig 4 left panel just before treatment february 2014 except for p4 above the prb at the beginning and at the end of treatment where o2 dissolved concentration could reach 5 mg l 1 verardo 2016 ii possible competition and seasonal effects occurring for the natural soil respiration and petroleum hydrocarbon biodegradation benisrael et al 2019 wanner et al 2019 in this specific site natural soil respiration can be neglected due to the low amount of organic matter inside the soil surface vegetation is homogeneous covered by a layer of grass during the high vegetation season which almost disappears during the winter season in order to minimize the contribution of natural soil respiration the 15 cm top layer of the ground surface was removed before installation of collars into the soil for each metering station co2 fluxes from uncontaminated or less contaminated area collars 7 and 8 located out of the contamination plume vary from 0 7 to 2 5 μmol m 2 s 1 from end of winter to summer this is assumed to be the maximum contribution of soil respiration or other processes of co2 released above the hydrocarbon underground layer as a consequence fluxes observed under contaminated areas with typical values varying from 5 to 45 μmol m 2 s 1 imply that co2 natural soil respiration represents at most 5 of co2 emissions relative to hydrocarbon biodegradation from winter to summer as a consequence under that specific site the low emissions levels of co2 outside the pollution plume imply that the fraction of co2 emissions issued from natural soil respiration is assumed to be negligible compared to co2 emitted from gasoline hydrocarbon biodegradation previous studies revealed that diffusion through the non saturated zone could lead to isotope distillation effects with negative δ values for co2 cerling et al 1991 and for organic compounds bouchard et al 2008a bouchard et al 2008b the isotope effect due to co2 volatilization in the non saturated zone to soil surface is assessed by measuring gas phase δ13cco2 directly on top of the water table through monitoring wells above the reactive barriers to bypass the underground soil intermediate and δ13cco2 on soil surface i e from closest collars july 2014 data provides δ13cco2 values of 29 2 0 6 vpdb from monitoring wells versus 29 9 0 4 vpdb from collars surrounding the reactive barriers respectively values are found to be more spread 28 4 0 7 vpdb versus 29 2 0 5 vpdb in october 2014 this indicate vertical diffusion δdiff value of 0 7 leading to a vertical diffusion fractionation factor αdiff value of 0 9993 therefore possible negative δ values fractionated co2 produced from volatilized fractionated organic compounds in the non saturated zone is neglected because the loss of organic compounds by volatilization is insignificant relative to their mass balance in the aquifer under our study site αapp 0 997 obtained from δ δ13cco2 δ13cbtex 3 results approximatively from the kinetic fractionation factor of co2 relative to tex estimated in the water aquifer α 0 9979 or ε 2 1 and from the fractionation factor due to selective vertical diffusion of the lighter isotope of co2 product from the top layer of groundwater to the ground surface αdiff of 0 9993 or ε 0 7 where αapp is then given by eq 8 α app α α diff among α values αapp is the only assessable variable from field measurable data δp of co2 released in atmosphere at ground surface and δs of hydrocarbon substrate solubilized in top layer of aquifer αapp can be expressed from eq 7 eq 9 α app δ 13 c p 1000 δ 13 c s 1000 α αdiff and thus αapp are generally assumed to be invariable with time t mariotti et al 1981 and remained constant along the horizontal migration of s at the scale of the pollution plume a6 solving rb s and ra s from eq 7 and replacing into the left member of eq 5 yields to eq 10 by removal of αapp eq 10a f r b p r a p 1 α 1 eq 10b f δ 13 c b p 1000 δ 13 c a p 1000 1000 ε with pco2 and eq 11 ε α 1 1000 being the associated isotope fractionation factor expressed in to support derivation of eq 10 from eqs 5 and 7 co2 realized at ground surface should be directly issued from the biodegradation of the underneath hydrocarbons substrate in the saturated zone meaning additional assumption are made a7 horizontal migration velocity of the well mixed hydrocarbon substrates is assimilated to the velocity of the groundwater flow because sorption and desorption are neglected processes in this site a8 sorption and desorption during advective horizontal and vertical migrations in the saturated zone are not leading to isotope fractionation as neglected in this site and from discussion in elsner et al 2005 and schmidt et al 2004 a9 vertical diffusion of co2 within the unsaturated zone from top layer of the aquifer to ground surface is assumed to be extremely fast relative to advective horizontal migration of co2 in the saturated zone in the aquifer along the pollution plume according to abreu and johnson 2006 and to luo et al 2009 under this site the soil effective porosity of 15 is known to be characterized by efficient gas transport in air filled pores according to de robert 2006 where the author also mentioned that co2 exchange through water filled pores is very slow relatively to air filled pores because co2 diffusion coefficient in water is 10 000 less than in air the percentage of mass loss for a pool of substrates between spot a and b ml with similar initial δ value and biodegradation rate can be derived from eq 12 assuming a6 if an average α value can be obtained either i from field data by derivation of an αapp value from eq 7 with measurements rx p and rx s followed by assessment of α from eq 8 i e α αapp αdiff or ii from estimated value of α from the csia data base u s epa 2008 derivation of ml from conditions i an assessment of αdiff is needed from field data to verify assumption a10 αdiff 1 α 1 or εdiff 1000 ε 1000 leading then to α αapp where αapp is extracted from field study the percentage of mass loss from biodegradation for a pool of substrates between spot a and b ml is obtained from solving f from eq 10 and replacing it into eq 6 eq 12a ml 1 r b p r a p 1 α 1 100 eq 12b ml 1 δ 13 c b p 1000 δ 13 c a p 1000 1000 ε 100 as a summary percentage of mass loss ml from biodegradation of hydrocarbons along a pollution plume migrating horizontally with the flow of groundwater from spot a to spot b could be obtained by measuring the isotopic concentration ratio 13c 12c rp values of the co2 product p released at ground surface above spots a and b at time t when physical and chemical properties for the contaminated site meet appropriate conditions in addition to the usual approaches

remediation site bekins et al 1998 bauer et al 2006 with good approximation for upper limits of btex concentration of 5 mg l 1 according to bekins et al 1998 and cozzarelli et al 2010 first order kinetic approach is used along the pollution plume according to the btex mixing ratios monitored in well p4 located 5 m upstream the front head of the prb section ii 1 the estimated first order attenuation rate constant is commonly presented to discuss and compare biodegradation rate in aquifers between 2 monitoring points along a flow path u s epa 2008 the first order kinetic assumption is usually an appropriate simplification to describe the biodegradation in aquifers because i mass transfer limiting factors are often rate limits in porous media and ii fickian diffusion is a first order process with respect to the substrate concentration in the bulk liquid alvarez de pedro and ilman 2005 wiedemeier et al 2007 biodegradation rate between spot a and spot b is calculated from travelling time t of substrates between the two spots given by the ratio of the distance l between spots a and b and the horizontal velocity v of the substrate migration thus the 1st order

discussion assessment of the biodegradation rate br f t of the groundwater hydrocarbon substrates using δ13cco2 surface analysis 3 1 δ13cco2 values at the scale of the pollution plume and spatial resolution this work uses additional data set compared to guimbaud et al 2016 from the less bioactive season and new data from the year 2015 period δ13cco2 values increase 13c enrichment as a function of the pollution plume coordinate figs 5 and 6a c fig 5 shows that δ13c values of toluene increase by 3 7 and 2 1 in may and december 2014 respectively over a distance of 40 m along the pollution plume in the same conditions δ13c values of benzene increase by 1 8 and 1 2 according also to linear regression given in fig 5 this is the consequence of selective biodegradation of the lighter carbon isotope 12c for toluene and benzene leading then to 13c enrichment of toluene and benzene during their migration in the groundwater the higher 13c enrichment for toluene is due to its faster biodegradation rate than benzene as a consequence δ13c values of co2 released at ground surface follows the same trend with and increase by 4 4 and 2 7 in may and december 2014 respectively from upstream to downstream the pollution plume δ13cco2 values at ground surface are correlated with δ13c values in groundwater with a difference δ δ13cco2 δ13chydrocarbon 2 0 and 0 9 for toluene and benzene respectively at prb 0 coordinate fig 5 this difference observed is also due to preferential selection of light isotopes 12c during bacterial metabolism leading to 13c depletion of co2 produced and then released at ground surface geophysical methods electrical resistivity and induced polarization noel et al 2016b combined with gas analyses co2 fluxes mainly guimbaud et al 2016 have demonstrated that the amplitude of natural biodegradation changes due to seasonal variations is much more pronounced at the all scale of the pollution plume than at the scale of the prb local effect around or downstream of the prb during the period of investigation according to this point mentioned above the percentage mass loss of the hydrocarbon substrate ml in given in eqs 12 along the axis of the pollution plume is best determined at the relevant scale of the site with the aim to identify a seasonal variation linear enrichment of δ13cbt and thus δ13cco2 heavy isotopes as a function of the distance to the source is expected for biodegradation in a contaminant plume aelion et al 2010 due to the few numbers of collars set right above the axis of the pollution plume and the precision given for δ13cco2 and δ13cbt data along the axis of the pollution plume attenuation rate for hydrocarbon degradation is not given between two monitoring collars or wells as commonly done but along the axis the pollution plume by reporting each collar position as a function of a pollution plume coordinate then a linear function is adjusted along the axis of the pollution plume from data shown in figs 5 and 6a c best fit is confirmed to be linear for the δ13cco2 and δ13cbt trend as a function of the pollution plume coordinate however linear regression of δ13cco2 values as a function of plume coordinates is significant at the 0 05 level p value only in 05 06 2014 0 01 10 07 2014 0 03 and 12 02 2014 0 04 and at the 0 1 level p value in 07 01 2014 0 10 and 02 03 2015 0 08 when higher emission of co2 lead to higher precision on δ13cco2 values summer or early falls or when experimental conditions stable weather conditions lead to more frequent and accurate data see figs 5 and 6a c for r2 and p values linear regression becomes significant at the 0 05 level for fig 6 a and b using their whole dataset due to the higher number of data points used but with degraded r2 values r2 0 20 p value 0 015 for fig 6a r2 0 14 p value 0 019 for fig 6b because this aggregation approach is not theoretically justified due to the overall degradation rate of hydrocarbons which depends on a seasonal cycle this linear trend is disrupted just above the prb where fresh deeper hydrocarbons with lower δ13chydrocabon value may have migrated to the upper bioactive layer from pumping wells low spatial resolution for δ13cco2 above and just around the prb is explained by the too few effective hours per day available for measurements on that site and priority has been focused to perform measurements at the scale of the pollution plume area therefore quantification of the bioremediation efficiency at the resolution scale of the prb had to be suppressed as mentioned above but could be discussed from additional observations 3 2 biodegradation rate of the groundwater residual hydrocarbon substrate the percentage of mass loss for the pool of hydrocarbon substrates ml and the 1st order biodegradation rate constant k are determined i from eqs 12b and 13e respectively based on the δ13cco2 product monitoring and ii from eqs 12c and 13f respectively based on the δ13ctoluene substrate monitoring ml and k values are determined by using the kinetic fractionation factor of co2 relative to the most reactive substrates tex estimated in the water aquifer α 0 9979 or ε 2 1 from the csia data base u s epa 2008 approach ii used for data presented in table 2 and 5 approach ii is consistent with the other possible approach i made in earlier section measurements in the field of an overall αapp 0 997 obtained from δ δ13cco2 δ13cbtex 3 and of a fractionation factor due to selective vertical diffusion of the lighter isotope of co2 product from the top layer of groundwater to the ground surface αdiff of 0 9993 or εdiff 0 7 resulting then to the kinetic fractionation factor of co2 relative to tex estimated in the water aquifer from eq 8 α 0 9993 or ε 2 3 similar to the one estimated from csia α 0 9979 or ε 2 1 0 5 according to previous discussions ml month 1 and k years 1 values given in table 2 are best derived from the linear regression of δ13c as a function of the pollution plume coordinate in figs 5 and 6a c where the slope of the fitted linear function provides the δ13c values of co2 or toluene per unit of travelling distance l the travelling time t of hydrocarbon substrates in ground water between spots are given by the ratio of the travelling distance l and the horizontal velocity v of the substrate migration ml and k values are discussed for data with p value 0 1 and to have enough data for significant precision on data sensitivity versus seasonal variation ml and k maximum values are obtained 6 weeks after the activation of the prb in may 2014 7 4 2 2 1 4 month 1 and 0 92 0 29 0 17 year 1 and during july and october with closed averaged value 3 8 1 1 0 7 month 1 and 0 46 0 14 0 09 year 1 ml and k minimum values are obtained 10 months after activation of the prb in mid winter in february 2015 1 4 0 4 0 3 month 1 and 0 17 0 05 0 03 year 1 these values are close or lower than the one obtained 6 months before activation the prb in september 2013 2 2 0 7 0 4 month 1 and 0 27 0 09 0 05 year 1 in addition k values obtained after the activation of the prb in may and december 2014 from δ13cco2 monitoring 0 92 0 29 0 17 year 1 and 0 28 0 08 0 06 year 1 respectively are consistent with the ones obtained from simultaneous δ13ctoluene monitoring 0 78 0 24 0 15 year 1 and 0 44 0 13 0 09 year 1 according to the precision on d δ13c d l m 1 derived from the linear regression on each data set indeed ml and k precision depends also on the precision on d δ13c d l m 1 derived from the linear regression of the linear fit 5 to 30 linked to precision on each δ13cco2 value 0 15 at the best all best obtained in summer for the highest flux of co2 precision decays in winter and in early spring due to lower precision for individual δ13cco2 determination from keeling plot approach the small fluxes of co2 in that periods increases the duration from 5 to 30 min for enough co2 accumulation usually up to 800 ppmv in the chamber for accurate δ13cco2 value determination from keeling plot approach competing then with the stability drift of the instrument in addition in such small flux conditions linear fits used less numbers of δ13cco2 values at low active seasons because of this longer period needed to obtain one δ13cco2 value acknowledging that each field campaign were limited to the same duration 7 to 8 effective hours per day the similar simultaneous δ13c trends for toluene and benzene and δ13c trends for co2 along the gw path coordinates as well as the agreement of first order attenuation rate constants derived from δ13c trend for co2 with the one derived from δ13c trend for toluene considered as a representative hydrocarbon for attenuation rate of gasoline compounds in the contaminated site argue that 13c enrichment of co2 along the pollution plume is more triggered from btex biodegradation toluene mainly than 13c enrichment of co2 produced from possible indirect processes implying methanogenesis intermediates 3 3 seasonal variation of the biodegradation rate and effect of the prb 3 3 1 seasonal variation of the biodegradation rate fig 7 presents the co2 average flux μmol m 2 s 1 along the pollution plume upstream above and downstream the prb co2 emission intensity is also a proxy of biodegradation efficiency for a better visualization the y x axis intercept is set on march 27 2014 which is the starting date for the activation of the prb co2 emissions are observed to be stimulated during the high microbial activity season september 2013 june july and august 2014 june 2015 varying in a similar way downstream above and upstream the prb from 5 to 45 μmol m 2 s 1 from winter to summer co2 emissions are correlated to the annual cycle of the soil temperature and anti correlated with the groundwater table level guimbaud et al 2016 noel et al 2016a in agreement with stimulation factors of biodegradation efficiency temperature increase first order attenuation rate constant k table 2 are mainly correlated with the seasonal variation of co2 fluxes fig 7 where max values are in summers and min values in winters except for june 2015 where k value derived from d δ13c d l has high level of imprecision p value 0 23 both values seasonal variation is mainly due to the annual cycle of the natural biodegradation activity at the scale of the pollution plume 3 3 2 effect of the prb on the biodegradation rate k and co2 fluxes values rise after activation of the prb due to possible biodegradation stimulation indeed geophysics measurements in noel et al 2016b argued that an efficient natural biodegradation already prevails before activation of the prb despite δ13cco2 low spatial resolution that do not cover the zone affected by the biostimulation and the short duration of the biostimulation 1 year a co2 flux increase fig 7 and a δ13cco2 decrease or some more negative value fig 6a c are observed above the prb meaning that possible effect of the prb can be discussed hereafter 1 after aerobic biostimulation co2 emissions increase significantly just above the prb relative to upstream and downstream the barrier during the highest season summer 2014 and june 2015 in fig 7 this is also shown from data provided in table 3 table 3 presents the average changes of co2 fluxes over a one year lapse time i e the ratio year 1 average flux to year flux at given date for upstream above and downstream the prb the one year lapse time is chosen for ratios to remove seasonal variation of natural biodegradation in order to provide a better evaluation of the stimulated bioremediation efficiency started on march 27 2014 ratio of average flux are the highest above the prb when calculated after biostimulation relative to before biostimulation 3 9 2 6 and 3 5 in sep 14 oct 14 and feb 15 respectively late effect of the prb is also observed downstream the pollution plume more than one year after aerobic biostimulation the ratio of average flux in 2015 2 1 1 2 2 4 reached higher values than in 2014 1 0 and 1 2 2 more negative values of δ13cco2 observed at ground surface above the reactive barrier after biostimulation fig 6a c may be explained by possible remobilization of fresh unreacted contaminants btex from the lower to upper level of the saturated zone of the aquifer table 4 presents the btex concentration mg l 1 measured as the main hydrocarbon substrates in the groundwater surface aquifer btex concentration reported along the axis of the pollution plume increased above and near the prb after its treatment starting in march 27 2014 within the accuracies given for data in table 4 the consequence could be an underestimation more negative values observed than expected for the δ13cco2 emissions after biostimulation above and downstream the prb leading to degraded r2 values for linearity observed in fig 6a c one can note that co2 fluxes combined with isotopic analysis are complementary to interpret biodegradation processes at the scale of the prb indeed in the basis of isotopic analysis only no effect of the prb on the biodegradation efficiency would have been specifically noticed as a result of the two following observations i summer k value obtained in september 2013 p value 0 43 is note accurate enough to compare with summer 2014 k values fig 6c and ii the only ground water btex analysis performed before and at early stage of the biophy project was a benzene δ13c analysis performed on june 1 2012 exhibiting similar d δ13c d l value 0 0345 r2 0 77 than in april 2014 0 0240 r2 0 78 and may 2014 0 0404 r2 0 59 and december 2014 0 0331 r2 0 13 arguing that the activation of the prb did not have an obvious effect on benzene biodegradation 4 conclusions and perspectives it has been demonstrated that natural remediation efficiency of contaminated soil aquifers by gasoline hydrocarbons btex mainly can be quantified using the rayleigh equations for δ13cco2 released at ground surface above the pollution plume instead of usual approaches based on groundwater hydrocarbons δ13c analysis when physical and chemical properties for the contaminated site are appropriate the validation approach for that specific site is discussed and verified by comparison of first order attenuation rate constant determined from δ13cco2 analysis emitted at ground surface and from δ13ctoluene analysis in ground water and also supported by seasonal variation of co2 flux analysis in that field first order biodegradation rate constants and annual variation calculated from this approach shows max values after the activation of the prb in may 2014 0 92 0 29 0 17 year 1 and during july and october 0 46 0 14 0 09 year 1 and minimum values in mid winter in february 2015 0 17 0 05 0 03 year 1 these values are close or lower than the one obtained before activation the prb in september 2013 0 27 0 09 0 05 year 1 supporting that biodegradation still remained process under anaerobic reducing conditions as it was before activation of the prb during natural attenuation first order biodegradation rate constants values are triggered by seasonal variation of microbial activities rather than activation of the prb at the scale of the pollution plume these first order biodegradation rate constants 0 14 1 21 year 1 are in the lower range with reported in literature for similar contaminated sites 1 6 18 year 1 considering natural attenuation under sulfate reducing conditions as regards improvements for fields studies and investigation for that and future sites i higher spatial resolutions analysis with an extension period would have been needed to assess the bioremediation efficiency around the prb due to the large spatial variability of co2 flux and δ13c measured also linked to a large spatial inhomogeneity of biodegradation soil structure and diffusivity higher spatial resolution for samples grid of 5 m or less instead of 10 m around the bioremediation barrier would have been needed for that specific site to get a better precision on biodegradation rate constant values and to assess the bioremediation efficiency around the prb remediation process should have been pursued for a longer period at least until end of 2015 to assess the relative efficiency of this bioactivation through a significant migration plume distance and the post effect after steady state remobilization of btex in the upper layer of the aquifer indeed the important delay for the settlement of the pilot site within the limited period of the anr ecotech biophy project and the short periods available for investigation 1 day month 1 in average had limited spatial resolution and the period of measurements after bioactivation one can note that such spatial resolution and delay are less needed for homogenous soils structure or for natural attenuation by opposition to enhanced bioremediation where the installation of the treatment process prb or other techniques may remobilize contaminants leading to complex interpretation of the dynamic process of biodegradation this remobilization problematic is unfortunately common to whatever kind of the approach substrate or product used for biodegradation monitoring ii to improve assessment of bioremediation rate kinetic more accurate values of ε fractionation factor for the representative hydrocarbon contaminants are also required as a consequence more experiments need to be done in surrogate soils and pollutants on large laboratory well characterized soil macrocosms such soil experimental platform is under construction at brgm within the joint region centre europe funded project ard2020 pivots prime as regards economical aspect the ability to quantify the biodegradation rate of hydrocarbons in a contaminated aquifer using the δ 13 c co2 approach analysis is of great interest the δ13cco2 online surface gas monitoring approach is an efficient substitute of the classical methods where the monitoring of groundwater hydrocarbon substrates δ13c analysis requires land manipulations and underground sampling δ13cco2 surface gas monitoring is fast to be set up and of low cost installation because no boreholes or wells have to be dug and only movable manual chambers are needed therefore δ13cco2 surface gas monitoring provides fast analysis of the status of the contaminated sites if mechanisms of co2 production and transfer could be understood a strong economic interest can be found in this gas monitoring approach the best cost efficiency policy for the choice of the remediation process for contaminated

1187,cadmium cd has impacted groundwater resources and can pose a serious threat to human health and the environment its fate in groundwater is complex and challenging to predict as it is affected by adsorption to sediments complexation with aqueous phase ligands and variations in hydraulic conductivity in this study a 2d reactive transport model based on modflow and rt3d is used to simulate published experimental results of cadmium migration without and with edta present in a flow cell containing high and low permeability zones i e hpzs and lpzs the model is then extended to conceptual flow cells with more complex lpz configurations simulation results generally match the experimental data well and analysis of experimental and simulated cd effluent concentration profiles shows that edta enhances cd removal from lpzs relative to water alone simulation results indicate that faster cd removal is due to edta complexation with adsorbed cd in lpzs which enhances its solubilization and subsequent back diffusion lastly simulation results show that with increasing lpz heterogeneity more cd is retained in flow cells and edta is more effective in enhancing cd removal relative to water alone these results are attributed to more lpz hpz interfaces that enhance cd mass transfer into lpzs during contamination and enhance edta mass transfer into lpzs to promote cleanup overall the results highlight the promise of using edta to remove cd from heterogeneous sites but caution is advised due to model simplicity and lack of consideration of changes in solution ph redox potential or competing cations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords edta high and low permeability back diffusion modflow rt3d complexation cadmium data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heavy metals are widespread nondegradable and often toxic groundwater pollutants jensen et al 1999 chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 cadmium cd is the heavy metal of focus in this work it has impacted groundwater from industrial and sanitary wastewater discharges agricultural irrigation runoff etc kubier et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a cadmium poses a serious threat to human health and ecosystems accumulating in living organisms hou et al 2022 causing organ disorders liu and borst 2018 and increasing cancer risk anđelković et al 2021 cadmium fate in groundwater is complex and challenging to predict it is affected by adsorption to sediments complexation with aqueous phase ligands and variations in hydraulic conductivity of special concern is the accumulation of cadmium in low permeability zones where it strongly associates with high surface area clays and represents a long term source of contamination via back diffusion to adjacent high permeability sands prior efforts have been made to simulate cadmium transport in groundwater wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 but validation of the underlying mechanisms controlling cadmium back diffusion and the impacts of complexing ligands is lacking groundwater environments are typically complicated often containing interspersed high and low permeability zones i e hpzs and lpzs respectively you et al 2020a ding and feng 2022 the latter consist of clays and or silts and can serve as reservoirs that initially retard pollutant migration in hpzs and later when pollutant concentrations in hpzs drop as source zones that slowly release pollutants to hpzs via back diffusion tatti et al 2018 yang et al 2018 mihajlov et al 2020 this can significantly enhance the difficulty and timeframe of groundwater remediation parker et al 2008 yang et al 2015 berns et al 2019 halloran and hunkeler 2020 cadmium back diffusion is strongly affected by adsorption to groundwater sediments adsorption reactions include 1 physical e g electrostatic van der waals adsorption between cd2 and sediment surfaces in aquifers which is reversible and 2 chemical adsorption between cd2 and specific functional groups on sediment surfaces e g oxygen containing functional groups on clay minerals which can coordinate with cd2 to form xi o cd e g si o cd al o cd zhang and tsang 2013 zhang et al 2016 which is less reversible these adsorption reactions depend on a number of factors including sediment surface area mineral composition and solution ph clays often have much greater adsorption capacities than sands for cd2 due to their larger surface areas mosai and tutu 2019 specific clays like montmorillonite kaolinite and illite have shown especially high cadmium adsorption capacities durrant et al 2018 and this has been attributed to their high cation exchange capacities cec and abundance of chemisorbing functional groups zhang and tsang 2013 tournassat et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 in acidic environments low ph functional groups on minerals will be protonated repo et al 2010 resulting in a less negatively charged surface and less favorable physical adsorption of positively charged cd2 aqueous phase ligands in groundwater can form complexes with cd2 and are expected to affect back diffusion natural ligands are common but generally at low concentrations in groundwater and occur within the diversity of natural organic matter nom moieties synthetic ligands are often introduced to groundwater either as co pollutants or intentionally to enhance heavy metal removal guo and brusseau 2017 gong et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b for example ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta has been added to groundwater to facilitate heavy metal extraction because it forms strong aqueous phase complexes with divalent metal cations such as cd2 via its four carboxylate and two amino groups ortega et al 2008 qiao et al 2017 the resulting complex is negatively charged i e cd edta 2 and the adsorption of free cd2 is greatly reduced because most mineral surfaces in groundwater are negatively charged at neutral ph may et al 2012 mosai and tutu 2019 also strong ligands like edta can form complexes with physically or chemically adsorbed cd2 and thereby enhance cd2 desorption to solution hering and morel 1988 kedziorek et al 1998 this may be especially important in lpzs where edta may complex with adsorbed cd2 facilitate back diffusion and reduce overall cleanup times numerous studies have focused on modeling pollutant back diffusion from low to high permeability zones to explore the underlying mechanisms time scales of mass transport and risks to potable groundwater resources singh and olson 2012 hnatko et al 2020 esfahani et al 2021 in some cases these models were developed or validated using observations from experimental datasets however there have been no prior efforts to model the effect of edta on cd2 back diffusion from lpzs our research group recently explored the effects of edta on cadmium back diffusion from an lpz in an experimental aquifer created in a quasi two dimensional 2d tank you et al 2020b the resulting dataset represents an excellent platform to extend modeling efforts to advance understanding of the mechanisms controlling edta promoted cd2 removal from complex groundwater environments the objectives of this study are to a develop a reactive transport model for cadmium removal via edta complexation from a heterogeneous groundwater aquifer b test the model assumptions against a published data set of cd mobilization in a quasi two dimensional bench top flow cell experiment c extend the model to more complex lpz hpz configurations to evaluate the effects of heterogeneity d demonstrate the mechanisms that limit cd removal from lpzs in the flow cell experiment you et al 2020b cd removal from an lpz was promoted by flushing the surrounding high permeability material with edta to promote cd desorption reactive transport of cd was simulated using modflow and rt3d second order reactions specific for cd and edta sorption to sediments grains and complexation of edta with cd were incorporated into the custom reaction module of rt3d and used to simulate the experimental results the ability of the model to match the experiment results the corresponding parameter values and model results for more complex lpz hpz configurations are used to interpret the mechanisms controlling cd removal 2 simulating edta and cd reactive transport in high and low permeability systems 2 1 experiment description the experiments were presented in an earlier publication you et al 2020b and are briefly described to justify the model setup in total 5 different experiments i e case i case v in table s1 were performed in the quasi two dimensional flow cell shown in fig s1 flow cell dimensions were 45 cm length 16 cm height 7 cm width and there was an inflow chamber 5 cm 16 cm 7 cm connected to the inlet on the left side which maintained a constant flow boundary both the bottom and upper layers were hpzs with dimensions of 45 cm length 4 cm height 7 cm width while the middle layer was an lpz with dimensions of 45 cm length 8 cm height 7 cm width during the breakthrough stage of each experiment aqueous phase nacl or cdcl2 or a mixture of cdcl2 and edta used in case v was initially delivered to the flow cell at a constant concentration and flow rate the nacl or cdcl2 advected through the hpzs diffused into the lpz see calculation in table s2 and for cd2 adsorbed to sediment grains during the elution stage of each experiment water or aqueous phase edta was delivered to the flow cell to promote nacl or cdcl2 removal from the flow cell the initial ph of all injected water or solutions was adjusted to 5 6 by titration with nitric acid hno3 or sodium hydroxide naoh to maintain ph in the range of natural groundwater values harvey et al 2010 zhou et al 2015 during each experiment samples were collected from the effluent and side wall sampling ports and aqueous phase cd cl and or ph were quantified there were 16 sampling ports on the front wall and they were located in 4 columns and 4 rows fig s1 the longitudinal and horizontal spaces between each port were 4 cm and 9 cm respectively a conceptual diagram of the flow cell with dimensions is shown in fig s2 the experimental boundary and initial conditions for the five experiments are presented in table s3 and correspond to different cases in case i nacl was injected as a conservative solute during the breakthrough stage water served as the eluent during the elution stage and the flow cell contained coarse and fine quartz sands in the hpzs and lpzs respectively this case represents the control and is used to determine if hydrodynamic conditions in the flow cell behave as expected in case ii aqueous phase cd2 cdcl2 replaced nacl as the invading solute during the breakthrough stage and the eluent and flow cell media were the same as in case i in cases iii v the flow cell contained lpzs consisting primarily of montmorillonite and illite clays in case iii the breakthrough and elution conditions matched case ii in case iv the breakthrough conditions matched case ii but during the elution stage aqueous phase edta served as eluent in case v a mixture of cd and edta was delivered during the breakthrough stage and water was delivered during the elution stage 2 2 modflow rt3d model framework modflow and rt3d were used to simulate the flow cell experiments modflow is a numerical model used to simulate groundwater flow in two or three dimensional aquifers of varying heterogeneity mcdonald and harbaugh 2003 rt3d is a numerical model used to simulate the two or three dimensional reactive transport in similarly complex aquifers clement et al 1998 rt3d has a custom reaction module that allows reactions of almost any complexity to be considered the modeling framework for simulating the flow cell experiments is illustrated in fig 1 as shown saturated single phase flow was simulated using modflow and this was used as input for rt3d to simulate solute transport and reaction for modflow the inlet and outlet ports were assigned specified heads and the top and bottom boundaries were assigned as zero flux for rt3d the initial and boundary conditions were matched to the experiment and are presented in table s3 custom reactions were added to rt3d to simulate cd2 breakthrough and elution with and without edta and these are presented in table 1 these equations represent edta salt dissociation in solution reaction 1 hydrogen bonding between edta and hydroxyl functional groups yi oh on clay mineral surfaces reaction 2 coordination between cd2 and oxygen containing functional groups xi o on clay mineral surfaces reaction 3 i e chemically adsorbed cd2 on clay minerals physical adsorption of cd2 onto mineral surfaces reaction 4 chelation between free cd2 and edta in the liquid phase reaction 5 chelation reaction between adsorbed cd2 the total of chemically and physically adsorbed cd2 and edta at the solid liquid interface reaction 6 which will result in the same rate constant for all adsorbed cd2 reacting with edta the generalization via reaction 6 minimizes the complexity of parameter optimization and was shown to be reasonable in a previous study zhang and tsang 2013 the ph change in the system during the experiments varied from 5 6 to 7 0 and previous experiments showed that ph variation within this range had little effect on the cd adsorption to clay you et al 2020c therefore changes in ph were not considered in the model local equilibrium is assumed for adsorption reactions between solution and mineral surfaces i e reactions 2 3 4 bedekar et al 2016 associated equilibrium distribution coefficients i e k d values are presented with model input parameters in tables s7 s9 and are used to determine retardation factors in the advection dispersion reaction equation text s1 note that a single k d value is used to account for both chemical reaction 3 and physical reaction 4 cd adsorption because this k d value is obtained from batch adsorption experiments which represented the total adsorption and it appears to result in a reasonable match of the experimental data reactions 5 and 6 are expressed using second order kinetics steefel et al 2015 and the corresponding equations are presented in table 2 i e eqns 7 and 8 respectively reaction 1 edta dissociation is assumed to occur instantaneously and to completion relative to reactions 5 and 6 and is not explicitly considered in the model in table 2 cd 2 is the concentration of free cd2 in groundwater ml 3 cd 2 im is the total adsorbed concentration in equilibrium with cd 2 including both chemically and physically adsorbed cd2 edta and cd edta are the concentration of edta and cd edta 2 in groundwater ml 3 respectively k 1 is the rate constant for the reaction between free cd2 and edta in the liquid phase m 1l3t 1 k 2 is the rate constant for the reaction between adsorbed cd2 and edta at the solid liquid interface m 1l3t 1 θ is the porosity of the aquifer ρ b is the bulk density of media in the aquifer ml 3 t represents time t q is the reaction quotient k eq is equilibrium constant the complexation reaction eq 7 is reversible and there is an equilibrium state so a free energy term 1 q k eq is included in the kinetic expression to reflect the rate variation when the reaction moves toward or away from equilibrium steefel et al 2015 deng et al 2016 considering the reaction equations in tables 1 and 2 the governing equations for calculating the concentrations of free cd2 cd edta 2 and edta in groundwater are given based on the advection dispersion reaction equation and are presented in appendix a the corresponding rt3d user defined subroutine describing these equations is in table s4 and a result of the rt3d batch utility solution is presented in fig s3 the rt3d model domain matches the flow cell domain in fig s2 and a 1 3 cm grid spacing was used throughout solvers used in modflow and grid refinement analysis are in the supporting information text s2 the rt3d model is verified by simulating the experimental data from contaminant breakthrough curves btcs and spatial distribution profiles in cases i to v the numerical model is then used to simulate cd complexation and migration in a conceptual flow cell with more complex heterogeneous media distributions 3 model application 3 1 estimation of parameter values for simulating flow cell experiments for modflow the hydraulic conductivity and porosity values of the lpzs and hpzs were obtained from measured data the hydraulic conductivity was measured via a falling head permeability test using the darcy flow tube and the porosity was calculated both from conservative solute breakthrough profiles for each media type using column tests you et al 2020b and via calculation from grain density dry weight and sample volume measurements the hydraulic gradient in the model was set by assigning specific heads at the inlet and outlet points see fig s2b so that the hydraulic gradient is the same for lpzs and hpzs the permeability of lpzs is quite small in all cases and its change from case ii to case iii hardly affects the flow rate therefore the average hydraulic gradient is the same in all cases to simulate the inflow chamber which promotes uniform flow distribution into the aquifer cell we followed prior work hnatko et al 2020 and the numerical grid for the leftmost column was assigned a hydraulic conductivity 6 orders of magnitude greater than the hpzs and a porosity of 1 the rightmost column of the model is the outflow chamber and its porosity was also set to 1 its hydraulic conductivity was smaller than the leftmost column because filter paper was added at the outlet hole to prevent fine particles from flowing out it was set to 2 orders of magnitude greater than the hpz and this value was fit using the experimental effluent flow rate all modflow simulations were based on these hydrodynamic conditions and flow field results were used as input to rt3d for rt3d the bulk density ρ b was defined for the lpzs and hpzs regions respectively based on literature values carey et al 2015 initial dispersivity values α were set similarly to literature values chapman et al 2012 carey et al 2015 and then slightly adjusted to fit experimental data from case 1 values of 0 5 cm for the hpz and 0 01 cm for the lpz were determined solute dispersion also occurred in the inlet and outlet chambers and the dispersivity value for these was determined using taylor dispersion theory ng 2011 lin and shaqfeh 2019 as described in the si text s3 the effective molecular diffusion coefficients d e for cl in case i and cd2 in case ii v were calculated from their aqueous diffusivities multiplied by the tortuosity d e d τ the former was obtained from the wilke chang equation while the latter was set based on porosity yang and volesky 1999 chapman et al 2012 values of d e for edta and cd edta 2 were set to the same value as that of cd2 because diffusion cell experimental results indicate their values are within 25 furukawa et al 2007 the adsorption constants for cd2 in the lpz and hpz media were determined from batch adsorption experiments you et al 2020c the equilibrium constant k eq for the chelation reaction between free cd2 and edta was input based on a literature value karak et al 2016 the specific values for each parameter in each case can be found in text s3 and table s5 s9 in supporting information the rate constants k 1 k 2 for the chelation reaction between cd2 free adsorbed and edta are the only fitting parameters and were calibrated to make the simulated contaminant btcs and spatial distribution profiles match the experimental data due to the complexity of coupling rt3d with an optimization routine the fitting parameters were manually adjusted to minimize the root square error between the simulated and experimental values the goodness of fit fit n based on the normalized mean square error nmse was also calculated this was done using the goodnessoffit function in matlab that solves eq 9 9 fit n 1 0 i 1 n e i s i 2 i 1 n e i e 2 here n refers to the nth case namely case n e i represents the ith experimental value in the case s i is the ith simulated value e represents the average of experimental values n indicates the case containing n sets of data the statistic that measures fit n is the coefficient of determination r 2 and the range of the result is from negative infinity to 1 the closer to 1 the better the goodness of fit in this work the match between experimental and modeling results is considered adequate if r 2 values are 0 80 3 2 model extension to more complicated cases the model was extended beyond the experimental conditions to explore more complex scenarios with different high and low permeability structural distributions and these are illustrated in fig s4 in cases vi and vii the lpzs were divided into four parts with each part having dimensions of 45 cm length 2 cm height 7 cm width in cases vii and ix the lpzs were divided into 40 uniformly spaced blocks with each block having dimensions of 4 5 cm length 2 cm height 7 cm width the total volumes of lpzs and hpzs are respectively the same across all configurations as are water flow rates while interfacial areas between lpzs and hpzs increase with the greater number of lpzs cases vi and vii as well as cases vii and ix match the initial and boundary conditions used in cases iii and iv respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 consistency of simulated results and measured values 4 1 1 breakthrough curves of contaminants comparisons between simulated and measured effluent concentration profiles of contaminants cl cd for cases i to v during breakthrough and elution are presented in fig 2a e and the tailings in the btcs are highlighted in fig s6 via log linear graphs the r2 value for cl in case i is 0 89 and that for cd i e cd2 cd edta 2 breakthrough in cases ii to v are 0 87 0 96 0 97 and 0 95 respectively fitted model parameters are presented in appendix b along with comparisons to literature values the best fit rate constant for the reaction between free cd2 and edta in the liquid phase k 1 is 1 10 106 m 1 d 1 and values given in previous studies are about one order magnitude larger hering and morel 1988 zhang et al 2010 the best fit rate constant for the reaction between adsorbed cd2 and edta at the solid liquid interface k 2 is 1 20 102 m 1 d 1 and the value from a previous study tsang et al 2007 is also larger i e around 2 0 103 m 1 d 1 also k 1 k 2 because the latter accounts for kinetic limitations associated with adsorption and desorption reactions tsang et al 2007 higher k 1 and k 2 values in the literature are likely because those measurements were performed in well mixed batch systems not like the fix bed system in this study where small scale mass transfer limitations arise also the higher k 2 value in the literature may be because that measurement was performed at a lower ph i e 4 0 6 0 resulting in weaker cd adsorption on mineral surfaces and faster edta complexation with adsorbed cd2 overall there is good agreement between measured and simulated results during breakthrough and elution for the bulk of the cd2 mass in a system with some features and discrepancies e g especially long term tailing that warrant additional discussion case i is the most simple with the fine sand lpz and conservative tracer there is good agreement between experimental and simulated profiles up to 6 pv which indicates the hydrodynamic model i e modflow was adequately parameterized however after 6 pv when cl concentrations decrease to 0 1 their highest values and back diffusion controls cl release simulated profiles underpredict the data case ii uses cd instead of nacl again with fine sand lpz there is some disagreement between experimental and simulated cd2 concentrations between 2 0 and 4 0 pv during breakthrough and as with case i after 6 0 pv during elution when simulated profiles again underpredict the data the disagreement between 2 0 and 4 0 pv may be due to packing or adsorption heterogeneity that was not adequately captured by the model or possibly an unrecognized error in experimental measurement two possible reasons for underprediction after 6 pv in cases i and ii are that the tortuosity was set equal to the porosity and this value may be too large and some mixing of fine and coarse sands occurred at lpz hpz interfaces creating a low flow region at lpz fringes that contributed along with back diffusion to concentration tailing however we have no independent data to support these possible reasons so they are not further probed case iii represents cd2 breakthrough followed by elution with water for a clay lpz and simulated results match the data well except for a slightly delayed initial breakthrough and relatively small differences during the last one or two pv fig s6c due to sorption onto clay breakthrough does not go to completion and both experimental and model concentrations are lower than that in case ii case iv represents cd2 breakthrough followed by elution with edta for the clay lpz the simulated profile during breakthrough and elution matches the experimental data well except as with case iii for a slightly delayed initial breakthrough and small differences during the last few pv there is an interesting hump that appears during elution and this is captured by the model the hump is due to edta complexation with sorbed cd2 on the clay facilitating its more rapid back diffusion also interesting is a small concentration dip in the experimental profile before the hump a much smaller dip and hump are also present in case iii the simulated profiles do not capture these dips or the small hump for case iii suggesting there are likely processes not being captured by the model a possible reason for the slightly delayed initial breakthrough from the model simulations could be because montmorillonite in the lpz has a positive charge at the experimental ph i e ph 7 0 which promotes electrostatic repulsion of injected cd2 kosmulski 2011 delayed cd2 uptake into the lpz and early breakthrough a reason for model disagreement with the data during the last few pv is difficult to discern and one possible reason is errors in experimental measurement at low concentrations case v represents cd and edta breakthrough together and then elution with water also with the clay lpz the simulated profile matches the data well until after 7 pv fig s6e when the data is underpredicted before 7 pv the experimental and model profiles are similar to those in case i and this suggests that very little to no cd sorption occurs after 7 pv model disagreement is different than case i with greater divergence of the simulated and experimental profiles and a flatter concentration tail it s not clear if this flatter concentration tailing is due to some unaccounted for process in the model or possibly error in the experimental measurements at very low concentrations i e 0 05 the initial concentration 4 1 2 spatial distribution profiles spatial measurements of cd2 concentration from side ports on the flow cell for case ii are compared to model profiles at different times in fig 3 linear linear graphs and fig s7 log linear graphs values of r2 are mostly 0 80 table s10 indicating good agreement however there is consistently a discrepancy between experimental and simulated concentration values at the 8 cm row especially from day 5 forward this same discrepancy is shown as a function of pore volume for the 2nd column of ports in fig s8 with root mean square values provided in table s11 the 8 cm row is located in the center of the lpz where flow is the slowest during port sampling some preferential flow from the hpz to the fine sand lpz was likely induced and this resulted in erroneously high experimental concentration values at this location we note that it s unlikely this induced flow contributed to the aforementioned discrepancy between experimental and simulated effluent concentrations in btcs for case ii i e overprediction of cd2 concentrations between 2 0 and 4 0 pv and underprediction after 6 0 pv this is because only 4 ml of total sample were taken from the lpz side ports every 24 h while almost 770 ml of water passed through the hpz during this time spatial measurements of cd2 concentration from side ports on the flow cell for case iii are compared to model profiles at different times in fig 4 linear linear graphs and fig s9 log linear graphs values of r2 are mostly 0 80 indicating good agreement the simulated and experimental concentration values at the 8 cm row are similar and not practically different from zero this is attributed to the clay lpz which limits flow from being drawn from the hpzs into the lpz however now there is a greater discrepancy between simulated and experimental concentration values at the 0 cm row on day 7 which can also be observed in the btcs at sampling ports along the 4th column in case iii fig s10 this may be related to the change of the influent solution from aqueous cd2 to water that occurred at day 6 around 5 0 pv when the breakthrough stage ended and the elution stage began sampling occurred on day 7 at 5 6 pv when a sharp gradient of cd2 concentration was moving through the flow cell and small differences in experimental versus simulated breakthrough times could result in large errors 4 2 cd concentration characteristics for case i v simulations spatial and temporal concentrations of cd2 cd edta 2 and total cd for cases ii to v are presented in fig 5 for case ii with the fine sand lpz cd2 breakthrough occurs mainly in the hpzs with some lateral and transverse advection dispersion migration to the lpz fig 5a as a result after 14 days when cd2 has been mostly flushed from the hpzs during elution cd2 persists at the front and along the margins of the lpz in comparison to case i with nacl breakthrough and the same media in hpzs and lpz fig s11 cd2 does not advance into the lpz as deep as the migration of cl due to adsorption for case iii a similar pattern as case ii occurs fig 5a but there is negligible flow into the clay lpz cd2 migrates mainly via diffusion table s2 as a result cd2 remaining after 14 days is only along the outer margins of the lpz however cd2 sorption to clay is more favorable than to fine quartz sands so total cd residue in the system is always greater for case iii than for case ii after 2 0 pv fig 5c for case iv when edta is used during elution spatial profiles of cd2 are very similar to those for case ii fig 5a except that less cd2 is present around the outer margins of lpzs after 14 days however cd is also present as cd edta 2 along the margins of lpz fig 5b fig s12 and the use of edta during elution results in slightly less total cd remaining in the media once elution starts at the 6th day fig 5c this suggests that the type i e free complexed sorbed and concentration distribution of cd changes when edta is introduced into the system the cd edta 2 formed by the chelation of cd2 and edta is more mobile than cd2 tõnsuaadu et al 2008 and this enhances cd removal from the lpz relative to case ii for case v when cd2 and edta are delivered together during breakthrough they complex with each other and very little sorption occurs this results in the lowest amounts of cd remaining in the flow cell among cases ii v 4 3 cd concentration characteristics for more complex structural distributions of lpzs and hpzs 4 3 1 cd concentration characteristics in absence of edta spatial and temporal concentrations of cd2 and total cd for cases iii vi and vii are presented in fig 6 clean water is used during elution for all three cases and model parameters are the same except for the structural distribution of lpzs and hpzs the primary observations are that as the structural distribution of lpzs and hpzs becomes more complex less cadmium delivered during breakthrough flows out from the system fig 6a and more cadmium is retained in the system during elution fig 6b this makes sense because there is more interfacial area between the lpzs and hpzs fig 6c and d and correspondingly more area for cd2 mass transfer into the clay lpzs with higher adsorption capacity as a result cd remains along the outer margins of very low permeability sections after 14 days and the perimeter area of lpzs is greater for the more complex systems 4 3 2 cd concentration characteristics in the presence of edta spatial and temporal concentrations of cd2 cd edta 2 and total cd for cases iv vii and ix are presented in fig 7 edta is used during the eluent stage for the three cases and all parameters are the same except for the structural distribution of lpzs and hpzs the primary observations here are similar to those for cases vi and vii specifically as the structural distribution of lpzs and hpzs becomes more complex less cadmium flows out from the system during breakthrough fig 7a and more cadmium is retained in the system during breakthrough and elution fig 7b in contrast to cases vi and vii there is a rebound of the effluent concentrations during elution fig 7a in cases vii and ix and as a result a faster decrease in cd remaining in the porous media fig 7b this is due to the presence of edta that promotes cd desorption from the clay matrix we note that the extent of effluent concentration rebound during elution and the rate of decrease of cd residue in the matrix are both greater in the cases with more complex structural distributions of lpzs and hpzs this makes sense because there is more interfacial area between the lpzs and hpzs fig 7c and d fig s13 and correspondingly more area for edta to access sorbed cd and promote its desorption into solution this bodes well for complex sites as it suggests that the use of edta could be very beneficial to promote cd removal into flowing groundwater 5 conclusions in this study a 2d reactive transport model of cadmium migration in high and low permeability systems under the effects of edta was established by coupling modflow and rt3d with custom second order kinetics accounting for reactions between free or adsorbed forms of cd with edta model results generally fit the experiments containing a single lpz surrounded by hpzs with some deviations that could be due to experimental errors introduced when extracting samples from ports in the lpz or when taking cd measurements at relatively low concentrations analysis of experimental and simulated cd effluent concentration profiles shows that edta enhances cd removal from lpzs relative to water alone analysis of spatial and temporal distributions of both cd2 and cd edta 2 from model simulations indicates faster cd removal with edta is due to the complexation of the latter with adsorbed forms of the former in lpzs this enhances solubilization and subsequent back diffusion of cd and therefore its overall removal rate overall the results suggest that edta is an effective remediation agent to enhance cd removal from lpzs the model was extended to cases with more complex lpz distributions than the experiments but with the same total lpz volume simulations showed that with more complex lpz configurations which corresponded to more lpz hpz interfaces more cd was retained in lpzs over time they also showed that with more complex lpz configurations edta was more effective in enhancing cd removal relative to water alone again due to more lpz hpz interfaces which allowed greater edta access to adsorbed cd overall these model results highlight the importance of lpz distribution and complexity in affecting cd retention and how the use of edta to remediate cd becomes more effective with the increasing complexity of lpz distribution despite the promising model results indicating the benefits of using edta to enhance cd removal from lpzs there are model assumptions that require further evaluation to increase confidence in our interpretation first the model did not consider changes in ph or redox conditions that can occur when delivering edta to subsurface formations this could affect for example mineral surface charge cd adsorption and edta concentrations second the model did not consider microbial growth which could be promoted if edta is used as a substrate microbial growth can clog pores and change permeability as well as alter ph and redox potential steefel et al 2015 kessler et al 2019 third the model did not include other components in groundwater such as divalent cations ca2 mg2 fe2 mn2 and nom and they can compete for cd2 sorption sites and edta complexation evaluation of these factors is necessary before more definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the benefits of amending cd impacted groundwater with edta credit authorship contribution statement xueji you methodology software investigation data curation formal

1187,cadmium cd has impacted groundwater resources and can pose a serious threat to human health and the environment its fate in groundwater is complex and challenging to predict as it is affected by adsorption to sediments complexation with aqueous phase ligands and variations in hydraulic conductivity in this study a 2d reactive transport model based on modflow and rt3d is used to simulate published experimental results of cadmium migration without and with edta present in a flow cell containing high and low permeability zones i e hpzs and lpzs the model is then extended to conceptual flow cells with more complex lpz configurations simulation results generally match the experimental data well and analysis of experimental and simulated cd effluent concentration profiles shows that edta enhances cd removal from lpzs relative to water alone simulation results indicate that faster cd removal is due to edta complexation with adsorbed cd in lpzs which enhances its solubilization and subsequent back diffusion lastly simulation results show that with increasing lpz heterogeneity more cd is retained in flow cells and edta is more effective in enhancing cd removal relative to water alone these results are attributed to more lpz hpz interfaces that enhance cd mass transfer into lpzs during contamination and enhance edta mass transfer into lpzs to promote cleanup overall the results highlight the promise of using edta to remove cd from heterogeneous sites but caution is advised due to model simplicity and lack of consideration of changes in solution ph redox potential or competing cations graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords edta high and low permeability back diffusion modflow rt3d complexation cadmium data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heavy metals are widespread nondegradable and often toxic groundwater pollutants jensen et al 1999 chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 cadmium cd is the heavy metal of focus in this work it has impacted groundwater from industrial and sanitary wastewater discharges agricultural irrigation runoff etc kubier et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a cadmium poses a serious threat to human health and ecosystems accumulating in living organisms hou et al 2022 causing organ disorders liu and borst 2018 and increasing cancer risk anđelković et al 2021 cadmium fate in groundwater is complex and challenging to predict it is affected by adsorption to sediments complexation with aqueous phase ligands and variations in hydraulic conductivity of special concern is the accumulation of cadmium in low permeability zones where it strongly associates with high surface area clays and represents a long term source of contamination via back diffusion to adjacent high permeability sands prior efforts have been made to simulate cadmium transport in groundwater wikiniyadhanee et al 2015 chotpantarat and kiatvarangkul 2018 but validation of the underlying mechanisms controlling cadmium back diffusion and the impacts of complexing ligands is lacking groundwater environments are typically complicated often containing interspersed high and low permeability zones i e hpzs and lpzs respectively you et al 2020a ding and feng 2022 the latter consist of clays and or silts and can serve as reservoirs that initially retard pollutant migration in hpzs and later when pollutant concentrations in hpzs drop as source zones that slowly release pollutants to hpzs via back diffusion tatti et al 2018 yang et al 2018 mihajlov et al 2020 this can significantly enhance the difficulty and timeframe of groundwater remediation parker et al 2008 yang et al 2015 berns et al 2019 halloran and hunkeler 2020 cadmium back diffusion is strongly affected by adsorption to groundwater sediments adsorption reactions include 1 physical e g electrostatic van der waals adsorption between cd2 and sediment surfaces in aquifers which is reversible and 2 chemical adsorption between cd2 and specific functional groups on sediment surfaces e g oxygen containing functional groups on clay minerals which can coordinate with cd2 to form xi o cd e g si o cd al o cd zhang and tsang 2013 zhang et al 2016 which is less reversible these adsorption reactions depend on a number of factors including sediment surface area mineral composition and solution ph clays often have much greater adsorption capacities than sands for cd2 due to their larger surface areas mosai and tutu 2019 specific clays like montmorillonite kaolinite and illite have shown especially high cadmium adsorption capacities durrant et al 2018 and this has been attributed to their high cation exchange capacities cec and abundance of chemisorbing functional groups zhang and tsang 2013 tournassat et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 in acidic environments low ph functional groups on minerals will be protonated repo et al 2010 resulting in a less negatively charged surface and less favorable physical adsorption of positively charged cd2 aqueous phase ligands in groundwater can form complexes with cd2 and are expected to affect back diffusion natural ligands are common but generally at low concentrations in groundwater and occur within the diversity of natural organic matter nom moieties synthetic ligands are often introduced to groundwater either as co pollutants or intentionally to enhance heavy metal removal guo and brusseau 2017 gong et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b for example ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta has been added to groundwater to facilitate heavy metal extraction because it forms strong aqueous phase complexes with divalent metal cations such as cd2 via its four carboxylate and two amino groups ortega et al 2008 qiao et al 2017 the resulting complex is negatively charged i e cd edta 2 and the adsorption of free cd2 is greatly reduced because most mineral surfaces in groundwater are negatively charged at neutral ph may et al 2012 mosai and tutu 2019 also strong ligands like edta can form complexes with physically or chemically adsorbed cd2 and thereby enhance cd2 desorption to solution hering and morel 1988 kedziorek et al 1998 this may be especially important in lpzs where edta may complex with adsorbed cd2 facilitate back diffusion and reduce overall cleanup times numerous studies have focused on modeling pollutant back diffusion from low to high permeability zones to explore the underlying mechanisms time scales of mass transport and risks to potable groundwater resources singh and olson 2012 hnatko et al 2020 esfahani et al 2021 in some cases these models were developed or validated using observations from experimental datasets however there have been no prior efforts to model the effect of edta on cd2 back diffusion from lpzs our research group recently explored the effects of edta on cadmium back diffusion from an lpz in an experimental aquifer created in a quasi two dimensional 2d tank you et al 2020b the resulting dataset represents an excellent platform to extend modeling efforts to advance understanding of the mechanisms controlling edta promoted cd2 removal from complex groundwater environments the objectives of this study are to a develop a reactive transport model for cadmium removal via edta complexation from a heterogeneous groundwater aquifer b test the model assumptions against a published data set of cd mobilization in a quasi two dimensional bench top flow cell experiment c extend the model to more complex lpz hpz configurations to evaluate the effects of heterogeneity d demonstrate the mechanisms that limit cd removal from lpzs in the flow cell experiment you et al 2020b cd removal from an lpz was promoted by flushing the surrounding high permeability material with edta to promote cd desorption reactive transport of cd was simulated using modflow and rt3d second order reactions specific for cd and edta sorption to sediments grains and complexation of edta with cd were incorporated into the custom reaction module of rt3d and used to simulate the experimental results the ability of the model to match the experiment results the corresponding parameter values and model results for more complex lpz hpz configurations are used to interpret the mechanisms controlling cd removal 2 simulating edta and cd reactive transport in high and low permeability systems 2 1 experiment description the experiments were presented in an earlier publication you et al 2020b and are briefly described to justify the model setup in total 5 different experiments i e case i case v in table s1 were performed in the quasi two dimensional flow cell shown in fig s1 flow cell dimensions were 45 cm length 16 cm height 7 cm width and there was an inflow chamber 5 cm 16 cm 7 cm connected to the inlet on the left side which maintained a constant flow boundary both the bottom and upper layers were hpzs with dimensions of 45 cm length 4 cm height 7 cm width while the middle layer was an lpz with dimensions of 45 cm length 8 cm height 7 cm width during the breakthrough stage of each experiment aqueous phase nacl or cdcl2 or a mixture of cdcl2 and edta used in case v was initially delivered to the flow cell at a constant concentration and flow rate the nacl or cdcl2 advected through the hpzs diffused into the lpz see calculation in table s2 and for cd2 adsorbed to sediment grains during the elution stage of each experiment water or aqueous phase edta was delivered to the flow cell to promote nacl or cdcl2 removal from the flow cell the initial ph of all injected water or solutions was adjusted to 5 6 by titration with nitric acid hno3 or sodium hydroxide naoh to maintain ph in the range of natural groundwater values harvey et al 2010 zhou et al 2015 during each experiment samples were collected from the effluent and side wall sampling ports and aqueous phase cd cl and or ph were quantified there were 16 sampling ports on the front wall and they were located in 4 columns and 4 rows fig s1 the longitudinal and horizontal spaces between each port were 4 cm and 9 cm respectively a conceptual diagram of the flow cell with dimensions is shown in fig s2 the experimental boundary and initial conditions for the five experiments are presented in table s3 and correspond to different cases in case i nacl was injected as a conservative solute during the breakthrough stage water served as the eluent during the elution stage and the flow cell contained coarse and fine quartz sands in the hpzs and lpzs respectively this case represents the control and is used to determine if hydrodynamic conditions in the flow cell behave as expected in case ii aqueous phase cd2 cdcl2 replaced nacl as the invading solute during the breakthrough stage and the eluent and flow cell media were the same as in case i in cases iii v the flow cell contained lpzs consisting primarily of montmorillonite and illite clays in case iii the breakthrough and elution conditions matched case ii in case iv the breakthrough conditions matched case ii but during the elution stage aqueous phase edta served as eluent in case v a mixture of cd and edta was delivered during the breakthrough stage and water was delivered during the elution stage 2 2 modflow rt3d model framework modflow and rt3d were used to simulate the flow cell experiments modflow is a numerical model used to simulate groundwater flow in two or three dimensional aquifers of varying heterogeneity mcdonald and harbaugh 2003 rt3d is a numerical model used to simulate the two or three dimensional reactive transport in similarly complex aquifers clement et al 1998 rt3d has a custom reaction module that allows reactions of almost any complexity to be considered the modeling framework for simulating the flow cell experiments is illustrated in fig 1 as shown saturated single phase flow was simulated using modflow and this was used as input for rt3d to simulate solute transport and reaction for modflow the inlet and outlet ports were assigned specified heads and the top and bottom boundaries were assigned as zero flux for rt3d the initial and boundary conditions were matched to the experiment and are presented in table s3 custom reactions were added to rt3d to simulate cd2 breakthrough and elution with and without edta and these are presented in table 1 these equations represent edta salt dissociation in solution reaction 1 hydrogen bonding between edta and hydroxyl functional groups yi oh on clay mineral surfaces reaction 2 coordination between cd2 and oxygen containing functional groups xi o on clay mineral surfaces reaction 3 i e chemically adsorbed cd2 on clay minerals physical adsorption of cd2 onto mineral surfaces reaction 4 chelation between free cd2 and edta in the liquid phase reaction 5 chelation reaction between adsorbed cd2 the total of chemically and physically adsorbed cd2 and edta at the solid liquid interface reaction 6 which will result in the same rate constant for all adsorbed cd2 reacting with edta the generalization via reaction 6 minimizes the complexity of parameter optimization and was shown to be reasonable in a previous study zhang and tsang 2013 the ph change in the system during the experiments varied from 5 6 to 7 0 and previous experiments showed that ph variation within this range had little effect on the cd adsorption to clay you et al 2020c therefore changes in ph were not considered in the model local equilibrium is assumed for adsorption reactions between solution and mineral surfaces i e reactions 2 3 4 bedekar et al 2016 associated equilibrium distribution coefficients i e k d values are presented with model input parameters in tables s7 s9 and are used to determine retardation factors in the advection dispersion reaction equation text s1 note that a single k d value is used to account for both chemical reaction 3 and physical reaction 4 cd adsorption because this k d value is obtained from batch adsorption experiments which represented the total adsorption and it appears to result in a reasonable match of the experimental data reactions 5 and 6 are expressed using second order kinetics steefel et al 2015 and the corresponding equations are presented in table 2 i e eqns 7 and 8 respectively reaction 1 edta dissociation is assumed to occur instantaneously and to completion relative to reactions 5 and 6 and is not explicitly considered in the model in table 2 cd 2 is the concentration of free cd2 in groundwater ml 3 cd 2 im is the total adsorbed concentration in equilibrium with cd 2 including both chemically and physically adsorbed cd2 edta and cd edta are the concentration of edta and cd edta 2 in groundwater ml 3 respectively k 1 is the rate constant for the reaction between free cd2 and edta in the liquid phase m 1l3t 1 k 2 is the rate constant for the reaction between adsorbed cd2 and edta at the solid liquid interface m 1l3t 1 θ is the porosity of the aquifer ρ b is the bulk density of media in the aquifer ml 3 t represents time t q is the reaction quotient k eq is equilibrium constant the complexation reaction eq 7 is reversible and there is an equilibrium state so a free energy term 1 q k eq is included in the kinetic expression to reflect the rate variation when the reaction moves toward or away from equilibrium steefel et al 2015 deng et al 2016 considering the reaction equations in tables 1 and 2 the governing equations for calculating the concentrations of free cd2 cd edta 2 and edta in groundwater are given based on the advection dispersion reaction equation and are presented in appendix a the corresponding rt3d user defined subroutine describing these equations is in table s4 and a result of the rt3d batch utility solution is presented in fig s3 the rt3d model domain matches the flow cell domain in fig s2 and a 1 3 cm grid spacing was used throughout solvers used in modflow and grid refinement analysis are in the supporting information text s2 the rt3d model is verified by simulating the experimental data from contaminant breakthrough curves btcs and spatial distribution profiles in cases i to v the numerical model is then used to simulate cd complexation and migration in a conceptual flow cell with more complex heterogeneous media distributions 3 model application 3 1 estimation of parameter values for simulating flow cell experiments for modflow the hydraulic conductivity and porosity values of the lpzs and hpzs were obtained from measured data the hydraulic conductivity was measured via a falling head permeability test using the darcy flow tube and the porosity was calculated both from conservative solute breakthrough profiles for each media type using column tests you et al 2020b and via calculation from grain density dry weight and sample volume measurements the hydraulic gradient in the model was set by assigning specific heads at the inlet and outlet points see fig s2b so that the hydraulic gradient is the same for lpzs and hpzs the permeability of lpzs is quite small in all cases and its change from case ii to case iii hardly affects the flow rate therefore the average hydraulic gradient is the same in all cases to simulate the inflow chamber which promotes uniform flow distribution into the aquifer cell we followed prior work hnatko et al 2020 and the numerical grid for the leftmost column was assigned a hydraulic conductivity 6 orders of magnitude greater than the hpzs and a porosity of 1 the rightmost column of the model is the outflow chamber and its porosity was also set to 1 its hydraulic conductivity was smaller than the leftmost column because filter paper was added at the outlet hole to prevent fine particles from flowing out it was set to 2 orders of magnitude greater than the hpz and this value was fit using the experimental effluent flow rate all modflow simulations were based on these hydrodynamic conditions and flow field results were used as input to rt3d for rt3d the bulk density ρ b was defined for the lpzs and hpzs regions respectively based on literature values carey et al 2015 initial dispersivity values α were set similarly to literature values chapman et al 2012 carey et al 2015 and then slightly adjusted to fit experimental data from case 1 values of 0 5 cm for the hpz and 0 01 cm for the lpz were determined solute dispersion also occurred in the inlet and outlet chambers and the dispersivity value for these was determined using taylor dispersion theory ng 2011 lin and shaqfeh 2019 as described in the si text s3 the effective molecular diffusion coefficients d e for cl in case i and cd2 in case ii v were calculated from their aqueous diffusivities multiplied by the tortuosity d e d τ the former was obtained from the wilke chang equation while the latter was set based on porosity yang and volesky 1999 chapman et al 2012 values of d e for edta and cd edta 2 were set to the same value as that of cd2 because diffusion cell experimental results indicate their values are within 25 furukawa et al 2007 the adsorption constants for cd2 in the lpz and hpz media were determined from batch adsorption experiments you et al 2020c the equilibrium constant k eq for the chelation reaction between free cd2 and edta was input based on a literature value karak et al 2016 the specific values for each parameter in each case can be found in text s3 and table s5 s9 in supporting information the rate constants k 1 k 2 for the chelation reaction between cd2 free adsorbed and edta are the only fitting parameters and were calibrated to make the simulated contaminant btcs and spatial distribution profiles match the experimental data due to the complexity of coupling rt3d with an optimization routine the fitting parameters were manually adjusted to minimize the root square error between the simulated and experimental values the goodness of fit fit n based on the normalized mean square error nmse was also calculated this was done using the goodnessoffit function in matlab that solves eq 9 9 fit n 1 0 i 1 n e i s i 2 i 1 n e i e 2 here n refers to the nth case namely case n e i represents the ith experimental value in the case s i is the ith simulated value e represents the average of experimental values n indicates the case containing n sets of data the statistic that measures fit n is the coefficient of determination r 2 and the range of the result is from negative infinity to 1 the closer to 1 the better the goodness of fit in this work the match between experimental and modeling results is considered adequate if r 2 values are 0 80 3 2 model extension to more complicated cases the model was extended beyond the experimental conditions to explore more complex scenarios with different high and low permeability structural distributions and these are illustrated in fig s4 in cases vi and vii the lpzs were divided into four parts with each part having dimensions of 45 cm length 2 cm height 7 cm width in cases vii and ix the lpzs were divided into 40 uniformly spaced blocks with each block having dimensions of 4 5 cm length 2 cm height 7 cm width the total volumes of lpzs and hpzs are respectively the same across all configurations as are water flow rates while interfacial areas between lpzs and hpzs increase with the greater number of lpzs cases vi and vii as well as cases vii and ix match the initial and boundary conditions used in cases iii and iv respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 consistency of simulated results and measured values 4 1 1 breakthrough curves of contaminants comparisons between simulated and measured effluent concentration profiles of contaminants cl cd for cases i to v during breakthrough and elution are presented in fig 2a e and the tailings in the btcs are highlighted in fig s6 via log linear graphs the r2 value for cl in case i is 0 89 and that for cd i e cd2 cd edta 2 breakthrough in cases ii to v are 0 87 0 96 0 97 and 0 95 respectively fitted model parameters are presented in appendix b along with comparisons to literature values the best fit rate constant for the reaction between free cd2 and edta in the liquid phase k 1 is 1 10 106 m 1 d 1 and values given in previous studies are about one order magnitude larger hering and morel 1988 zhang et al 2010 the best fit rate constant for the reaction between adsorbed cd2 and edta at the solid liquid interface k 2 is 1 20 102 m 1 d 1 and the value from a previous study tsang et al 2007 is also larger i e around 2 0 103 m 1 d 1 also k 1 k 2 because the latter accounts for kinetic limitations associated with adsorption and desorption reactions tsang et al 2007 higher k 1 and k 2 values in the literature are likely because those measurements were performed in well mixed batch systems not like the fix bed system in this study where small scale mass transfer limitations arise also the higher k 2 value in the literature may be because that measurement was performed at a lower ph i e 4 0 6 0 resulting in weaker cd adsorption on mineral surfaces and faster edta complexation with adsorbed cd2 overall there is good agreement between measured and simulated results during breakthrough and elution for the bulk of the cd2 mass in a system with some features and discrepancies e g especially long term tailing that warrant additional discussion case i is the most simple with the fine sand lpz and conservative tracer there is good agreement between experimental and simulated profiles up to 6 pv which indicates the hydrodynamic model i e modflow was adequately parameterized however after 6 pv when cl concentrations decrease to 0 1 their highest values and back diffusion controls cl release simulated profiles underpredict the data case ii uses cd instead of nacl again with fine sand lpz there is some disagreement between experimental and simulated cd2 concentrations between 2 0 and 4 0 pv during breakthrough and as with case i after 6 0 pv during elution when simulated profiles again underpredict the data the disagreement between 2 0 and 4 0 pv may be due to packing or adsorption heterogeneity that was not adequately captured by the model or possibly an unrecognized error in experimental measurement two possible reasons for underprediction after 6 pv in cases i and ii are that the tortuosity was set equal to the porosity and this value may be too large and some mixing of fine and coarse sands occurred at lpz hpz interfaces creating a low flow region at lpz fringes that contributed along with back diffusion to concentration tailing however we have no independent data to support these possible reasons so they are not further probed case iii represents cd2 breakthrough followed by elution with water for a clay lpz and simulated results match the data well except for a slightly delayed initial breakthrough and relatively small differences during the last one or two pv fig s6c due to sorption onto clay breakthrough does not go to completion and both experimental and model concentrations are lower than that in case ii case iv represents cd2 breakthrough followed by elution with edta for the clay lpz the simulated profile during breakthrough and elution matches the experimental data well except as with case iii for a slightly delayed initial breakthrough and small differences during the last few pv there is an interesting hump that appears during elution and this is captured by the model the hump is due to edta complexation with sorbed cd2 on the clay facilitating its more rapid back diffusion also interesting is a small concentration dip in the experimental profile before the hump a much smaller dip and hump are also present in case iii the simulated profiles do not capture these dips or the small hump for case iii suggesting there are likely processes not being captured by the model a possible reason for the slightly delayed initial breakthrough from the model simulations could be because montmorillonite in the lpz has a positive charge at the experimental ph i e ph 7 0 which promotes electrostatic repulsion of injected cd2 kosmulski 2011 delayed cd2 uptake into the lpz and early breakthrough a reason for model disagreement with the data during the last few pv is difficult to discern and one possible reason is errors in experimental measurement at low concentrations case v represents cd and edta breakthrough together and then elution with water also with the clay lpz the simulated profile matches the data well until after 7 pv fig s6e when the data is underpredicted before 7 pv the experimental and model profiles are similar to those in case i and this suggests that very little to no cd sorption occurs after 7 pv model disagreement is different than case i with greater divergence of the simulated and experimental profiles and a flatter concentration tail it s not clear if this flatter concentration tailing is due to some unaccounted for process in the model or possibly error in the experimental measurements at very low concentrations i e 0 05 the initial concentration 4 1 2 spatial distribution profiles spatial measurements of cd2 concentration from side ports on the flow cell for case ii are compared to model profiles at different times in fig 3 linear linear graphs and fig s7 log linear graphs values of r2 are mostly 0 80 table s10 indicating good agreement however there is consistently a discrepancy between experimental and simulated concentration values at the 8 cm row especially from day 5 forward this same discrepancy is shown as a function of pore volume for the 2nd column of ports in fig s8 with root mean square values provided in table s11 the 8 cm row is located in the center of the lpz where flow is the slowest during port sampling some preferential flow from the hpz to the fine sand lpz was likely induced and this resulted in erroneously high experimental concentration values at this location we note that it s unlikely this induced flow contributed to the aforementioned discrepancy between experimental and simulated effluent concentrations in btcs for case ii i e overprediction of cd2 concentrations between 2 0 and 4 0 pv and underprediction after 6 0 pv this is because only 4 ml of total sample were taken from the lpz side ports every 24 h while almost 770 ml of water passed through the hpz during this time spatial measurements of cd2 concentration from side ports on the flow cell for case iii are compared to model profiles at different times in fig 4 linear linear graphs and fig s9 log linear graphs values of r2 are mostly 0 80 indicating good agreement the simulated and experimental concentration values at the 8 cm row are similar and not practically different from zero this is attributed to the clay lpz which limits flow from being drawn from the hpzs into the lpz however now there is a greater discrepancy between simulated and experimental concentration values at the 0 cm row on day 7 which can also be observed in the btcs at sampling ports along the 4th column in case iii fig s10 this may be related to the change of the influent solution from aqueous cd2 to water that occurred at day 6 around 5 0 pv when the breakthrough stage ended and the elution stage began sampling occurred on day 7 at 5 6 pv when a sharp gradient of cd2 concentration was moving through the flow cell and small differences in experimental versus simulated breakthrough times could result in large errors 4 2 cd concentration characteristics for case i v simulations spatial and temporal concentrations of cd2 cd edta 2 and total cd for cases ii to v are presented in fig 5 for case ii with the fine sand lpz cd2 breakthrough occurs mainly in the hpzs with some lateral and transverse advection dispersion migration to the lpz fig 5a as a result after 14 days when cd2 has been mostly flushed from the hpzs during elution cd2 persists at the front and along the margins of the lpz in comparison to case i with nacl breakthrough and the same media in hpzs and lpz fig s11 cd2 does not advance into the lpz as deep as the migration of cl due to adsorption for case iii a similar pattern as case ii occurs fig 5a but there is negligible flow into the clay lpz cd2 migrates mainly via diffusion table s2 as a result cd2 remaining after 14 days is only along the outer margins of the lpz however cd2 sorption to clay is more favorable than to fine quartz sands so total cd residue in the system is always greater for case iii than for case ii after 2 0 pv fig 5c for case iv when edta is used during elution spatial profiles of cd2 are very similar to those for case ii fig 5a except that less cd2 is present around the outer margins of lpzs after 14 days however cd is also present as cd edta 2 along the margins of lpz fig 5b fig s12 and the use of edta during elution results in slightly less total cd remaining in the media once elution starts at the 6th day fig 5c this suggests that the type i e free complexed sorbed and concentration distribution of cd changes when edta is introduced into the system the cd edta 2 formed by the chelation of cd2 and edta is more mobile than cd2 tõnsuaadu et al 2008 and this enhances cd removal from the lpz relative to case ii for case v when cd2 and edta are delivered together during breakthrough they complex with each other and very little sorption occurs this results in the lowest amounts of cd remaining in the flow cell among cases ii v 4 3 cd concentration characteristics for more complex structural distributions of lpzs and hpzs 4 3 1 cd concentration characteristics in absence of edta spatial and temporal concentrations of cd2 and total cd for cases iii vi and vii are presented in fig 6 clean water is used during elution for all three cases and model parameters are the same except for the structural distribution of lpzs and hpzs the primary observations are that as the structural distribution of lpzs and hpzs becomes more complex less cadmium delivered during breakthrough flows out from the system fig 6a and more cadmium is retained in the system during elution fig 6b this makes sense because there is more interfacial area between the lpzs and hpzs fig 6c and d and correspondingly more area for cd2 mass transfer into the clay lpzs with higher adsorption capacity as a result cd remains along the outer margins of very low permeability sections after 14 days and the perimeter area of lpzs is greater for the more complex systems 4 3 2 cd concentration characteristics in the presence of edta spatial and temporal concentrations of cd2 cd edta 2 and total cd for cases iv vii and ix are presented in fig 7 edta is used during the eluent stage for the three cases and all parameters are the same except for the structural distribution of lpzs and hpzs the primary observations here are similar to those for cases vi and vii specifically as the structural distribution of lpzs and hpzs becomes more complex less cadmium flows out from the system during breakthrough fig 7a and more cadmium is retained in the system during breakthrough and elution fig 7b in contrast to cases vi and vii there is a rebound of the effluent concentrations during elution fig 7a in cases vii and ix and as a result a faster decrease in cd remaining in the porous media fig 7b this is due to the presence of edta that promotes cd desorption from the clay matrix we note that the extent of effluent concentration rebound during elution and the rate of decrease of cd residue in the matrix are both greater in the cases with more complex structural distributions of lpzs and hpzs this makes sense because there is more interfacial area between the lpzs and hpzs fig 7c and d fig s13 and correspondingly more area for edta to access sorbed cd and promote its desorption into solution this bodes well for complex sites as it suggests that the use of edta could be very beneficial to promote cd removal into flowing groundwater 5 conclusions in this study a 2d reactive transport model of cadmium migration in high and low permeability systems under the effects of edta was established by coupling modflow and rt3d with custom second order kinetics accounting for reactions between free or adsorbed forms of cd with edta model results generally fit the experiments containing a single lpz surrounded by hpzs with some deviations that could be due to experimental errors introduced when extracting samples from ports in the lpz or when taking cd measurements at relatively low concentrations analysis of experimental and simulated cd effluent concentration profiles shows that edta enhances cd removal from lpzs relative to water alone analysis of spatial and temporal distributions of both cd2 and cd edta 2 from model simulations indicates faster cd removal with edta is due to the complexation of the latter with adsorbed forms of the former in lpzs this enhances solubilization and subsequent back diffusion of cd and therefore its overall removal rate overall the results suggest that edta is an effective remediation agent to enhance cd removal from lpzs the model was extended to cases with more complex lpz distributions than the experiments but with the same total lpz volume simulations showed that with more complex lpz configurations which corresponded to more lpz hpz interfaces more cd was retained in lpzs over time they also showed that with more complex lpz configurations edta was more effective in enhancing cd removal relative to water alone again due to more lpz hpz interfaces which allowed greater edta access to adsorbed cd overall these model results highlight the importance of lpz distribution and complexity in affecting cd retention and how the use of edta to remediate cd becomes more effective with the increasing complexity of lpz distribution despite the promising model results indicating the benefits of using edta to enhance cd removal from lpzs there are model assumptions that require further evaluation to increase confidence in our interpretation first the model did not consider changes in ph or redox conditions that can occur when delivering edta to subsurface formations this could affect for example mineral surface charge cd adsorption and edta concentrations second the model did not consider microbial growth which could be promoted if edta is used as a substrate microbial growth can clog pores and change permeability as well as alter ph and redox potential steefel et al 2015 kessler et al 2019 third the model did not include other components in groundwater such as divalent cations ca2 mg2 fe2 mn2 and nom and they can compete for cd2 sorption sites and edta complexation evaluation of these factors is necessary before more definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the benefits of amending cd impacted groundwater with edta credit authorship contribution statement xueji you methodology software investigation data curation formal

1188,transport models used for assessing the safety of radioactive waste repositories hosted in fractured bedrock typically do not consider fluxes of naturally occurring radionuclides in the rock and their further migration in flow bearing fractures a consistent model that simultaneously describes the transport of radionuclides from both natural and anthropogenic sources has been developed where decay chains and rock heterogeneity are accounted for the model accounts for advective flow in the fracture a decay chain of arbitrary length and diffusion into and out of the adjacent rock matrix composed of different geological layers the proposed solution has been verified against a previously published steady state case which considers a homogeneous rock matrix of infinite extent where porewater ingrowth is not accounted for the model is also applied to some different calculation examples for both transient and limiting steady state cases to represent typical applications of the model as well as to illustrate the effect of different parameters and processes on the transport of natural radionuclides in fractured rocks this study presents a novel and powerful tool to simulate migration of both anthropogenic and natural radionuclides in and from crystalline rocks to the biosphere the presented modelling is essential in safety and performance assessment of deep geological disposal of radioactive waste in fractured rocks the obtained analytical solution can be used to compare relative fluxes of natural and anthropogenic radionuclides which is useful for validation of the radionuclide transport parameters obtained from field and laboratory experiments keywords radionuclide transport model semi analytical solution naturally occurring radionuclides fractured media decay chain laplace transform data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction naturally occurring radionuclides including progeny of the uranium series decay chain have long been used to study transport phenomena in environmental systems key et al 1979 andrews et al 1982 broecker and peng 1983 osmond and cowart 2000 suksi et al 2006 porcelli 2008 krall et al 2020 diego feliu et al 2021 in the field of radiation protection they are also of great interest for understanding transport and retention processes of anthropogenically generated radionuclides unintentionally dispersed in the environment uranium and thorium ore bodies have also been extensively studied as natural analogues of geological repositories for permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and other nuclear wastes miller et al 2000 in sweden and finland the kbs 3 concept has been adopted for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel this concept entails the emplacement of spent nuclear fuel encapsulated in copper canisters in crystalline bedrock at a depth of 400 500 m and with multiple protective barriers such as copper canisters bentonite clay and the bedrock skb 2011 if the primary isolation function of the engineered barrier degrades over time due to expected corrosion or other processes e g earthquake related shear radionuclides in the spent fuel may dissolve and be transported by flowing water through a network of connected background fractures in the rock toward the ground surface it is therefore of great importance to develop methods and models for understanding the fundamental mechanisms governing radionuclide transport processes in fractured rocks over timescales as long as 1 ma in fractured crystalline rock dissolved radionuclides are mostly carried by water seeping through hydraulically conductive fractures although their transport is retarded by several physical and chemical mechanisms while advective flow is the primary mechanism for all long range transport through the rock the migration of dissolved radionuclides can be delayed either by sorption directly on fracture surfaces or diffusion into effectively stagnant water within partly open fractures dissolved radionuclides may also diffuse into the water filled porosity of the rock matrix and from there adsorb to mineral surfaces due to the large surface area of rock minerals that can potentially be accessed via the connected porosity of the rock matrix the retardation of radionuclide transport can be considerably larger than that achievable by adsorption on minerals exposed on external fracture surfaces alone neretnieks 1980 bear et al 1993 li and chiou 1993 gylling et al 1998 skb 2011 many laboratory and field scale experiments have studied the important mechanisms of solute transport in fractured rocks laboratory and field scale tracer experiments are usually limited by time and distance to a few years and some tens of meters whereas safety assessments of geological repositories are required to cover hundreds of thousands of years and span distances up to many tens of kilometres skb 2011 natural analogue studies however can give insight into migration processes over longer spatial and temporal scales than are directly accessible experimentally data obtained from natural analogues may also be used to demonstrate consistency with predictions of radiological risk made within safety assessment many mathematical models and analytical solutions have been developed to account for important mechanisms of solute transport and retardation in fractured rocks while earlier models considered mainly advection and diffusion into an infinite rock matrix increasingly sophisticated versions have incorporated hydrodynamic dispersion a finite

et al 2022 an overview of fundamental mechanisms and transport models for radionuclide transport in fractured rocks are given in bodin et al 2003a 2003b and more recently in zhang et al 2022 for multi scale fractured rocks most models used in safety assessment focus on anthropogenic releases of dissolved radionuclides in the form of pulse or a temporally variable boundary condition at a specified hypocentre corresponding to a leaking canister or other storage unit comprising an engineered barrier to the best knowledge of the authors none of the transport models typically deployed in safety assessment include natural sources of radionuclides in the rock matrix although the flux contribution of naturally occurring radionuclides in fracture minerals and the rock matrix is likely to be lower relative to hypothetical peak releases from the repository the inclusion of natural source terms can be a useful addition to the models used in safety assessment this serves multiple purposes firstly the modelled transport of natural radionuclides forms an internal standard that can be readily checked against measured groundwater levels of natural radionuclides in a specific landscape and climatic context and thus can function as a reality check on radiological risk metrics calculated in complex safety assessment settings secondly if used with care such models can also be used to interpret natural analogue data to show consistency or non consistency of model parameterisation and underlying assumptions with observations in field scale settings thirdly comparison of measured groundwater levels of natural radionuclide fluxes with modelling results might be used as a means of deriving key parameters that can then be compared with independent estimates obtained in laboratory investigations which may be subject to bias or otherwise be not fully representative of in situ conditions apart from safety assessment related applications one of the key motivations for carrying out the modelling described in this paper was to ascertain the impact of neglecting or including the extended decay chain in modelling of 222rn production in natural systems since most rn production and transport models described in the literature do not consider the extended decay chain we suspected that decay of precursor radionuclides dissolved within porewater might be underappreciated as a production mechanism for rn distinct from direct emission from mineral grains furthermore since relative ratios of different decay chain radionuclides are frequently invoked as a means of understanding the geochemistry and migration mechanisms of actinides we saw an unfulfilled need for a model containing a coherent generalised account of natural radionuclide production and transport encompassing entire decay chains 1 1 production of radionuclides in the rock matrix this section is focused on natural uranium and thorium in granitic rocks which are most relevant for spent nuclear fuel disposal concepts in sweden finland and a growing number of countries u and th are heterogeneously distributed throughout granitic rock and tend to concentrate in matrix accessory minerals such as zircon apatite and monazite eggeling et al 2013 uranium is also commonly present as uraninite or as solid solutions with thorite and thorianite inclusions in biotite locally high concentrations of secondary micro precipitates are also typically found along grain boundaries and microfractures uraninite urano thorite haiweeite uranophane and coffinite have all been identified in microfractures of forsmark rock samples krall et al 2015 descendant radionuclides resulting from decay of primordial 232th 238u and 235u are generally found alongside u and th mineralisation in this work we focus mainly on the uranium 4n 2 decay chain see supplementary material although the model developed is generalised to other decay chains this section is focused on natural uranium and thorium in granitic

alongside u and th mineralisation in this work we focus mainly on the uranium 4n 2 decay chain see supplementary material although the model developed is generalised to other decay chains alpha recoil is an important process for supplying progeny radionuclides to the matrix porewater when a radionuclide undergoes α decay an equal momentum is imparted to both the α particle 4he and the decay nucleus the bulk of the decay energy is transmitted to the α particle while only a small fraction is imparted to the much heavier descendant nuclide i e the recoil nucleus in the form of recoil energy sun and semkow 1998 when travelling through a medium such as a mineral crystal water or air the energy of the recoiling nucleus is dissipated by coulombic interactions with atoms in the medium the distance over which a recoil nucleus can travel is called the stopping distance while the range of a typical recoiling α particle in water is about 30 50 μm for the more massive decay products the range is no more than about 70 120 nm in a dense mineral such as uraninite the stopping distance of the recoil nucleus is typically 14 23 nm stopping distances for recoil nuclei in various materials can be readily calculated using for example the srim software package ziegler et al 2010 depending on the location of the decaying atom the recoil nucleus can be trapped in the originating source mineral be ejected into porewater at a grain boundary or implanted in adjacent minerals in the rock matrix the fraction of decay atoms that are ejected from a mineral grain into the porewater is referred to as the recoil capture fraction η recoiling nuclei that are only superficially implanted into pore adjacent minerals can also diffuse back into the porewater in a process referred to as indirect recoil if the decaying atom resides at a sufficient distance from the surface of the host mineral grain or non host mineral however then the decay nucleus is effectively trapped due to the very low solid state diffusivity of large atoms in mineral crystals only recoil nuclei originating from a distance within the outer rim of the host mineral equal to or less than the average stopping distance can escape to porewater in contact with the mineral grain several investigators have calculated the theoretical recoil capture fractions for recoil nuclei although the derived formulae are dependent on assumptions concerning grain size of the primary u containing minerals and geometrical attributes of the surrounding porosity flügge and zimens 1939 kigoshi 1971 key et al 1979 bossus 1984 semkow 1990 1991 liu and neretnieks 1994 lee et al 2010 stajic and nikezic 2014 most of the formulae found in the literature are not strictly relevant in the present context owing to heterogeneous distribution of host mineral grain sizes and locations relative to the narrow and sparsely distributed pore spaces typically found in granitic rocks in general the recoil capture fraction is a highly uncertain parameter that is best estimated by calibration against laboratory measurements for site specific materials under appropriate conditions this will however not be further discussed here as it falls out of the main objective of the present work which is mathematical model development an important fact that should be considered with modelling production and migration of multiple successive members of a decay chain is that a non negligible fraction of each descendant is lost from the outer layer of the primary host mineral with each successive α decay step the net rate of production of the descendant would be less in each generation due to loss from the primary source phase if we consider the full decay chain the loss for each descendant nuclide depends on the number of α decays between the descendant and the original parent nuclide this is accounted for in the model as shown in eqs 3 and 9 in the next section another complication is that radionuclides transported in the porewater which subsequently undergo α decay may also be lost by α recoil implantation in mineral pore boundaries i e the reverse process of the original recoil capture mechanism this is shown schematically in fig 1 for nuclides that are moderately to strongly sorbing each α decay may incur a loss of up to 50 since half of the recoil nuclei will be implanted into the adjacent mineral while at most half will be retained in the porewater for pore apertures less than the stopping distance the implantation loss associated with each decay step may be even higher since recoiling nuclei can traverse the pore space and be implanted in the mineral at the facing pore surface normally this process is neglected in radionuclide transport calculations while this might be a reasonable assumption for safety assessment it presents problems when one wishes to accurately account for the migration of natural radionuclides a further difficulty is that radionuclides that find themselves implanted superficially in rock matrix minerals may themselves also subsequently undergo α decay and either recoil deeper into the matrix mineral or recoil back into the porewater secondary emanation the principal radionuclide fluxes including all feasible primary and secondary α recoil processes are illustrated in fig 1 for the uranium decay chain assuming a pore aperture sufficiently large that all primary recoil emanations are initially captured in the porewater i e not directly lost to other pore adjoining minerals one approach to account for implantation is to incorporate a constant retention factor θ for each α decay step θ represents the loss of porewater descendent nuclides due to implantation in neighbouring matrix minerals neglecting the secondary emanation fluxes which return descendent nuclides to the porewater depending on the value of θ assumed in the calculation it is then possible to bracket the development of porewater activity between the limiting case of zero porewater loss to say 50 loss in each α decay step this of course results in a significant loss of precision since it is not possible to properly account for all the relevant α recoil processes another approach is to introduce an effective retention factor θ i that is theoretically calculated for each descendent nuclide i to approximately preserve the overall mass balance including secondary recoil fluxes without explicitly including them in the transport model while still not completely precise the approximation should be sufficiently accurate for most practical applications involving non steady state transport and should exactly match the steady state solution provided appropriate θ i values are chosen for the calculation 1 2 overview of models for radionuclide transport in fractured rock radionuclides ejected by α recoil to the porewater can further migrate within the connected water filled porosity of the rock matrix and diffuse from fracture surfaces to flowing water in fractures helium 4he as a stable element generated through α decay of u and th and their descendants has been used as a tracer to date groundwater age and calculate advective travel times of flowing water in fractured rock formations andrews 1985 bethke et al 2000 bethke and johnson 2008 neretnieks 2013 trinchero et al 2019 measurement data for 222rn 226ra and 4he from three sites in sweden and finland forsmark laxemar and olkiluoto have also previously been interpreted through a model developed by neretnieks 2013 the model describes how descendant nuclides generated by α recoil associated with uranium and thorium decay escape from primary source minerals into matrix porewater and diffuse further into the water flowing fractures the analytical solution described by neretnieks 2013 is derived for the steady state condition of a homogeneous rock matrix of infinite extent the model is simplified to account only for a single decaying nuclide and does not include an anthropogenic source term at the start of the flowpath more recently trinchero and iraola 2020 presented a transient model for natural production and transport of nuclides in fractured rocks their model as an extension to the work done by sudicky and frind 1982 1984 focuses on transport and retardation of a first order decaying nuclide where the rock matrix is assumed to be homogenous with finite extent a constant anthropogenic source is considered at the flow fracture inlet and a production term for naturally occurring nuclides is included only in the rock matrix while a mass balance model that considers a single decay chain member as done by trinchero and iraola 2020 can be a practical tool in groundwater hydrogeology care must be taken when defining an effective recoil capture fraction which implicitly includes the multiple transport processes discussed in the previous section it is often worthwhile to be able to model ratios of naturally occurring descendants to correctly interpret natural analogue data in such cases it is essential to have an accurate account of the release of each descendant nuclide and their coupling via decay and ingrowth the objective of the present paper is then to develop a mathematical model based on the model presented in mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 although modified to account for production and transport of radionuclide chains from natural sources in both the rock matrix and the fracture the novelty of this work is to present a consistent transient model that can consider simultaneous transport of anthropogenic and naturally occurring nuclides in fractured rock involving arbitrary length decay chains the mathematical model accounts for advective flow through a discrete flow channel diffusion into a heterogeneous layered rock matrix of limited extent adsorption and arbitrary length decay chains a temporally variable boundary condition is considered at the flowpath inlet as the anthropogenic source term it is anticipated that the derived transient model will find useful applications for interpreting groundwater systems such as the forsmark site investigation area in sweden where a recent study by krall et al 2020 suggests that non steady state 226ra activities are common in many of the younger or holocene groundwaters the paper is organized as follows section 2 is the main focus of the paper where the system is described conceptually formulated mathematically in the time domain and solved analytically in the laplace frequency domain for the main flow channel and adjacent rock matrix layers in section 3 multiple simulation cases are made to illustrate the main features of the model and importance of considering the entire decay chain when calculating the migration of naturally occurring radionuclides for both transient and steady state cases the paper finishes with concluding remarks and discussion of intended future work in section 4 2 model development 2 1 conceptual model the concept underlying the proposed model is shown schematically in fig 2 a system of parallel fractures with perfectly symmetric transport conditions into the rock matrix is considered as an idealization of a network of intersecting fractures it is similar to the conceptual model presented in mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 but further extended to account for production and transport of natural radionuclides in both the matrix and the fracture it is assumed that naturally existing grains of u and th enriched accessory minerals are evenly distributed in the matrix and lose descendant nuclides to the rock matrix porewater by way of α recoil moreover a variable anthropogenic source term e g leaking canister is considered at the flow channel inlet making it possible to study simultaneous transport of anthropogenic and naturally occurring nuclides in fractured rocks as illustrated in fig 2 the fracture is defined as rectangular channel through which water flows with a constant mean velocity of u the rock matrix is assumed to be geologically piecewise heterogeneous having an arbitrary number of layers with differing thicknesses and transport properties the geological structure of the rock matrix is simplified to have layers which may consist of for example fracture coatings as well as multiple tectonically or hydrothermally altered layers overlaying mostly unaltered wall rock tsang and doughty 2003 moreno and crawford 2009 mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 the model accounts for advection through the flow channel diffusion into the rock matrix layers linear equilibrium adsorption onto external fracture surfaces and within the rock matrix as well as arbitrary length decay chains the assumption of linear equilibrium adsorption implies that the range of concentrations should not vary so much that the sorption isotherm for migrating radionuclides exhibit non linear langmuir or freundlich like behaviour this suggests that care should be taken when applying the present model to systems characterized by strong geochemical gradients redox or ph or periodic flushing with groundwater of highly variable composition fickian diffusion is considered to be the main transport process in the rock matrix as the permeability of crystalline rock is sufficiently low that advective flow can be neglected complete mixing of solutes across the flow channel is considered thereby implying negligible transverse dispersion longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion is also ignored as it is commonly dominated by differences in advective travel times along multiple independent flowpaths in fractured media buckley and loyalka 1993 neretnieks 2002a cvetkovic et al 1999 and therefore is not strictly necessary to model on the level of individual migration paths a more detailed account of the reasoning behind the neglection of this mechanism is given in mahmoudzadeh et al 2016 for the interested reader the effect of a stagnant water zone on the fracture plane is not considered here although the solution can be easily extended to include this as previously demonstrated in mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 if it is furthermore assumed that matrix diffusion can be approximated as a 1 dimensional process normal to the fracture surface the nominally two dimensional system can be simplified to two coupled one dimensional systems these are formulated mathematically as independent although mutually coupled problems and solved analytically in the following sections the present model is simplified by considering only linear non branching decay processes although this is only strictly an issue for the anthropogenic source term which might include non negligible amounts of 242mam 238pu and 232u in safety assessment calculation codes that are subject to the same restriction this is typically handled by adding the molar quantity of faster decaying nuclide in the subordinate converging chain to the inventory of the slower decaying nuclide in the main chain without any loss of accuracy for the calculation of fluxes of the more long lived radionuclides see e g skb 2010 all other branching processes involving extremely short lived radionuclides are trivial and can be generally neglected furthermore we also restrict the scope of the modelling work to actinide decay chains involving α decay since this comprises a key mechanism for the in situ production and mobilisation of the natural analogue radionuclides that are of most interest to us 2 2 mathematical model a coupled one dimensional approach as adopted previously by hodgkinson and maul 1988 is used to describe the transport of each member in the decay chain the system shown in fig 2 can be considered as two subsystems the flow channel and the rock matrix layers for which the equations of continuity describing solute transport processes can be formulated individually the coupling between these two subsystems is provided by the requirement of concentration continuity at the interface and by introducing sink source terms in the governing equations which describe solute exchange at the interface the system accounts for the mass gain or loss of decaying nuclide which introduces an additional coupling in the equations the equations describing the solute transport in each subsystem is presented in the following sections 2 2 1 solute transport through the flow channel if we consider a radioactive nuclide decay chain the one dimensional transport equation for the aqueous concentration of the ith nuclide in the flow channel c f i can be expressed as i 1 2 n 1 r f i c f i t u c f i x d e i 1 b f c p i 1 z z 0 r f i λ i c f i r f i 1 θ f i 1 λ i 1 c f i 1 g i where instantaneous retardation due to sorption on the fracture surface as well as sorption on rock matrix micro surfaces is accounted for in eq 1 we use the subscripts f and i to indicate the flow channel and the radionuclide i respectively the superscript 1 signifies the first matrix layer adjacent to the flow channel a complete list of symbols and units is given in the notation section at the end of the paper the first term at the right hand side of eq 1 describes the advective transport through the flow channel while the second term specifies diffusive mass transfer at the interface between the flow channel and the adjacent rock matrix the third term represents the mass loss of member i by decay whereas the fourth term denotes the mass gain ingrowth of member i by radioactive disintegration of its immediate progenitor member i 1 we define λ 0 0 for decay rate of the first progenitor in the decay chain i e i 1 as it is not produced by ingrowth the last term g i represents effective rate of nuclide production from a primary source mineral residing in the fracture or directly from the fracture surface per unit water volume in the fracture and can be defined as 2 g i 0 i n α f g 0 i η f i n α f where n αf represents the number in the whole studied chain of the first descendant nuclide produced naturally by α recoil from the source mineral in the fracture g 0 i is the total rate of production of nuclide i from the minerals in the fracture and η f is the recoil capture fraction for primary nuclide emanation from fracture surfaces i e the fraction of produced nuclides that can directly escape from the u or th containing mineral grains to the water in the fracture if one assumes secular equilibrium amongst the descendants of the naturally occurring progenitor nuclide within the primary source mineral the activity of all descendants in the chain should be equal to that of the progenitor if depletion of the host phase by α recoil is neglected in such cases the total rate of production of each descendant i in the natural chain would be the same for each of the subsequent nuclides i e g 0 i g 0 n αf i n αf this means that it is sufficient to calculate only g 0 n αf which is the total rate of production of the first descendant nuclide in the naturally occurring chain from the activity of the immediately preceding progenitor in the present case 238u in the minerals residing in the fracture if however a non negligible fraction of descendant is lost from the solid phase with each successive α decay the total rate of production of each descendant would be less in each generation due to depletion of the solid phase and can be expressed as 3 g 0 i g 0 n α f μ i 1 1 η f k n α f i 1 μ k for i n α f where μ k takes on an integer value depending on whether the decay step k is an α decay process μ k 1 or not μ k 0 in this formulation it is implicitly assumed that the recoil capture fraction η f is identical for each radionuclide produced by α recoil in other words we assume in the present work a constant average recoil capture fraction due to the uncertainty of reported values in the literature which may not be fully consistent with the physical transport processes as conceptualised in this work future work will however focus on estimating consistent recoil capture fractions from laboratory measurement data in eq 1 r f i represents an equilibrium retardation factor for the ith nuclide due to sorption on fracture minerals in a flow channel with transport half aperture b f and is calculated as 4 r f i 1 b c b f ε c ρ c k dc i where k dc i is the linear sorption partitioning coefficient of nuclide i in the fracture coating of total thickness b c and ρ c and ε c are the bulk density and transport porosity of the fracture coating respectively in the present derivation the initial conditions in the fracture for eq 1 are defined as i 1 2 n 5 c f i x 0 c f 0 i where c f0 i is the initial concentration of the ith nuclide in the fracture the use of a constant concentration in eq 5 implies relatively old groundwater i e a few thousand years and thus is not strictly correct for say a recharge path where the steady state equilibrium concentration varies as a function of distance i e age of the recharge water in the present work as mentioned in the previous section it is assumed that the u and th containing host minerals are sufficiently old that they can be considered at isotopic equilibrium depletion of descendants in surface layers notwithstanding this assumption allows one to estimate the rate of primary radionuclide production via alpha recoil only knowing the abundance of the original progenitor nuclide in the rock i e 238u the initial equilibrium concentration could be calculated either by the obtained solution for steady state concentration in the next section or through the method explained in supplementary material section 1 in the present derivation the initial conditions in the fracture for eq 1 are defined as i 1 2 n 5 c f i x 0 c f 0 i where c f0 i is the initial concentration of the ith nuclide in the fracture the use of a constant concentration in eq 5 implies relatively old groundwater i e a few thousand years and thus is not strictly correct for say a

could be calculated either by the obtained solution for steady state concentration in the next section or through the method explained in supplementary material section 1 the boundary condition for eq 1 is i 1 2 n 6 c f i 0 t c in i t where c in i t is the ith nuclide concentration at the flow channel inlet 2 2 2 solute transport through the rock matrix accounting for diffusion and linear equilibrium sorption the one dimensional transport equation for the aqueous concentration of species i in the pore water of the jth layer of the rock matrix c p i j is given by i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 7 r p i j c p i j t d p i j 2 c p i j z 2 r p i j λ i c p i j r p i 1 j θ p i 1 j λ i 1 c p i 1 j q i j for z in j z z out j where we have defined z in j k 0 j 1 δ k z out j k 0 j δ k and δ 0 0 representing the interface between the fracture and the first adjacent matrix layer similarly to the mass balance for the flow channel θ p i j here is the α recoil porewater retention fraction for the ith nuclide in the jth layer of the rock matrix the subscripts in and out indicate the inner and outer boundaries of each matrix layer respectively relative to the coordinate system in eq 7 q i j represents the effective production rate of ith nuclide per unit volume of porewater in the jth matrix layer and can be defined as 8 q i j 0 i n α p q 0 i j η p j i n α p where n αp represents the number in the whole studied chain of the first daughter nuclide produced naturally by α recoil from the source mineral in the rock q 0 i j is the total rate of production of the ith nuclide per unit volume of porewater in the jth matrix layer and η p j is the fraction of the produced nuclides that can escape from the grains to the porewater in the jth matrix layer if one were to assume secular equilibrium within the primary source mineral and negligible depletion by recoil the total rate of production of each descendant nuclide i in the naturally occurring chain would be the same in each matrix layer and can be written as q 0 i j q 0 n α p j i n αp in this case we need only determine q 0 n α p j which is the total production rate of the first descendant nuclide in the naturally occurring chain from the activity of its progenitor in the source mineral in the jth layer of the rock if however the release fraction of descendant nuclides from the solid phase is not negligible with each successive α decay the total rate of production of each descendant can be defined as 9 q 0 i j q 0 n α p j μ i 1 1 η p j k n α p i 1 μ k for i n α p in eq 7 pore retardation factors r p i j for each nuclide i in matrix layer j are calculated as 10 r p i j 1 ρ p j k dp i j ε p j where k dp i j is the linear sorption partitioning coefficient of nuclide i in the matrix layer j while ρ p j and ε p j are the bulk density and transport porosity of the rock matrix layer j respectively the initial condition for eq 7 can be defined as i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 11 c p i j z 0 c p 0 i j for z in j z z out j where c p 0 i j is the initial concentration of the ith nuclide in the jth layer of the rock matrix the initial conditions for the case when the porewater and source mineral system is in isotopic equilibrium i e c p i j z 0 c p i j eq could be calculated either by the steady state concentration presented in the next section or through supplementary material section 1 the initial condition for eq 7 can be defined as i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 11 c p i j z 0 c p 0 i j for z in j z z out j where c p0 i j is the initial concentration of the ith nuclide in the jth layer of the rock matrix the initial

the laplace domain the governing partial differential equations given in the mathematical model section cannot be readily solved for a heterogeneous layered rock matrix and an arbitrary length decay

the special case where the rock matrix is comprised of a single homogeneous layer and for a single nuclide only it can be shown that θ 1 θ 1 1 and therefore the laplace transformed concentration through the flow channel is from eq 32 33 c f exp e f e p τ f c in v 1 v 1 where 34 v 1 e p β p β f e f e p 35 β f g 1 s r f 1 c f 0 1 36 e f r f 1 s λ 1 37 e p d e 1 1 b f α tanh α δ 1 in eq 33 we have introduced τ f the advective travel time through the flow channel as 38 τ f x u as can be seen from the definition of e f and e p they separately represent the effect of flow channel and rock matrix retardation on radionuclide transport as these two terms are independent functions of the transport properties of the flow channel and the rock matrix respectively the contribution of naturally occurring radionuclides in the fracture and in the rock matrix is characterized by the β f and β p terms respectively 2 3 2 2 steady state solution for an unlimited homogenous rock matrix in the limiting case where there is no anthropogenic boundary condition at the beginning of the transport path c f i 0 t 0 the single layer rock matrix is sufficiently thick to be considered as being of infinite extent δ 1 and retardation due to sorption on the fracture surface is deemed negligible r f 1 1 then eq 33 simplifies to 39 c f exp s λ 1 d e 1 1 b f α τ f 1 v 1 with 40 v 1 d e 1 1 b f α β p

solution in eq 39 by way of the final value theorem churchill 1972 this gives the steady state concentration through the flow channel as 41 c f ϑ q 1 1 r p 1 1 λ 1 g 1 ϑ λ 1 1 exp λ 1 ϑ τ f with 42 ϑ ε p 1 b f d p 1 1 r p 1 1 λ 1 which is identical to the solution given by neretnieks 2013 for the same steady state case the steady state concentration in the fracture has a strong relation with fracture aperture but it depends also on the rate of production in the rock the recoil capture fraction and the transport properties of the rock the sensitivity of the steady state concentration to the fracture aperture depends however on the denominator of eq 41 more specifically we can discriminate sensitivity of the steady state concentration to fracture transport aperture by way of the dimensionless variable ω defined as 43 ω ε p 1 b f d p 1 1 r p 1 1 λ 1 in situations where ω 1 the steady state concentration will be approximately inversely proportional to the fracture transport aperture if on the other hand ω 1 then we would expect the steady state concentration to be nearly independent of fracture transport aperture based on this observation it has been proposed previously that steady state concentrations of 222rn might potentially be used to estimate transport apertures in fractured rock flow systems e g andrews et al 1986 neretnieks 2002b 3 simulations and discussion in this section the transport model developed in the previous section is applied to some different calculation examples for both the transient and limiting steady state cases the aim here is to provide a series of examples which might be deemed representative of typical applications for which the model could be used as well as to illustrate the effect of different parameters and processes on the transport of natural analogue radionuclides in fractured rock the model is also compared to a previously developed model for the steady state case described in neretnieks 2013 which considers independent production of radionuclides without consideration of porewater ingrowth the first transient example is based on a hypothetical scenario of a long recharge flowpath with zero concentration inflow e g rainwater recharge the flowpath is then quickly flushed after which the return to steady state conditions is monitored due to production of uranium series 4n 2 decay chain nuclides in the rock matrix and accompanying matrix sorption diffusion processes although the model developed in the previous section is generalised to permit the simulation of a multilayer rock matrix with piecewise constant material properties a single rock matrix layer is assumed in the first simulation case to simplify understanding of mechanistic effects the second example is a steady state case which examines the stepwise impact of including additional decay chain members in the transport model relative to the simplified case of 222rn production only the aim of this case study is to demonstrate the impact of decay processes of one or more progenitor nuclides in the porewater as distinct from production by direct recoil capture from primary source minerals only this case considers a single layered rock matrix of finite extent with homogeneous material properties the third and fourth examples are similar to the first and second example although with the rock matrix conceptualised as being comprised of three layers with piecewise constant material properties featuring increased diffusive sorptive retention in layers closest to the fracture surface a final example is provided for a regular monte carlo application where stochastic parameters are assigned from pre defined uncertainty distributions and used to predict likely ranges of steady state 222rn and 226ra activities the predicted data are compared with measurement data from skb s site investigation area at forsmark and used to discuss the mechanistic impact of various key parameters central to the model in all cases it is implicitly assumed that the u enriched mineral grains in the rock matrix are sufficiently old that isotopic equilibrium can be reasonably assumed for estimation of the natural source term of 238u descendants after correction for α recoil depletion in the primary host mineral phases based on this assumption the production of each descendant in the decay chain is linearly related to the activity of the 238u progenitor contained in the host mineral grains furthermore although the developed mathematical model includes effective loss factors in both rock matrix and fracture we assume the limiting case of no porewater loss and neglect secondary emanation i e θ f i 1 and θ p i j 1 in the presented demonstration calculations since the inclusion of numerical values would require an entire paper on its own to justify 3 1 transient model example single layer rock matrix in the first example we consider a flowpath that is quickly flushed with untraced water and the return to steady state conditions is simulated using the transient solution the rock matrix is comprised of a homogeneous single layer of 12 5 m extent and the flowpath is assumed to be a groundwater recharge path meaning that the concentration at the channel inlet i e at ground surface can be set to zero i e c f i 0 t 0 for this simulation a transport aperture of 0 2 mm is assumed which together with the advective travel time of 100 y corresponds to a flow wetted surface to flow ratio f factor of 106 y m it is noted that the assumed maximum matrix penetration depth reflects the average half spacing of flow bearing fractures at repository depth at the forsmark site investigation area and is not related to any mechanistic limitation of rock matrix porous connectivity which is effectively infinite for the purposes of radionuclide transport calculations i e regarding the impact of limited diffusion depth of more than a few dm on the mathematical solution the radionuclide specific parameters for this example are given in table 1 two simulation variants are made for the transient model example the base case assumes sorption coefficient values k dp i 1 m3 kg taken from the sr site safety assessment skb 2011 whereas the other variant assumes less conservative k dp i 1 values for th and ra to give activities closer to measured groundwater levels at the forsmark site the effective diffusivity d e i 1 of the rock matrix is assumed to be roughly constant at 2 1 10 14 m2 s while the transport porosity ε p 1 of the rock matrix is 1 8 10 3 the average uranium content of the rock matrix in this example is assumed to be 4 mg kg ppm which is the site average for forsmark granitic rock in this example it is assumed that there is no source term associated with fracture minerals or sorptive retardation on external fracture surfaces i e g i 0 and r f i 1 the true recoil capture fraction is presently unknown for the rock matrix although for the purpose of the demonstration calculation presented here it is assumed to be η p 1 5 this value is arbitrary although based loosely on ranges of values reported in the literature as discussed in neretnieks 2013 the recoil capture fraction is perhaps the least well known although arguably the most important governing variable for transport modelling of naturally occurring radionuclides as the main objective of the current work is the model development the radionuclide specific k dp i 1 values for sorption are assumed to be approximately valid for the present calculation examples although it is acknowledged that there is some conservatism in the chosen values for the base case such that they may not be fully representative of the true natural analogue migration processes the time domain breakthrough curve results for the transient case were calculated using the numerical laplace inversion as described previously the calculation results for the base case and for the variant case are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively the solution to the transient problem indicates that 222rn quickly reaches its steady state value in 2 4 weeks while 226ra takes up to a year or more to reach steady state for the base case k dp i 1 parameterisation interestingly 234u and 230th each appear to reach their steady state levels relatively quickly 1 10 days while 210pb takes at least 50 y or more the main difference between the base case and variant case is the much lower steady state activity predicted for 226ra and 230th and consequently faster approach to steady state in the variant case the characteristic time to approach steady state for 210pb seems largely unaffected by the choice of k dp i 1 values for its predecessor nuclides 3 2 steady state model example single layer rock matrix in this example we compare the steady state solution obtained in the present study against the model developed by neretnieks 2013 in which the rock matrix is assumed to be comprised of a homogeneous layer of infinite extent considering a single decaying nuclide 226ra and 222rn calculated separately like the previous transient example the flowpath is assumed to be a groundwater recharge path with zero concentration inflow i e c f i 0 t 0 in this example we consider the stepwise impact of including additional decay chain members to demonstrate how this affects the calculated accumulation of 226ra and 222rn in the fracture water as a function of groundwater age for a given recoil capture fraction η p 1 to simplify the discussion only production of nuclides in the rock matrix is considered and any source term associated with fracture minerals or retardation due to sorption on external fracture surfaces is neglected i e g i 0 and r f i 1 the following cases with stepwise increasing complexity are calculated 1 222rn only primary production of 222rn without additional consideration of prior decay chain members 2 226ra 222rn primary production of both nuclides plus ingrowth of 222rn from porewater decay 3 230th 226ra 222rn primary production of all three nuclides plus porewater ingrowth of descendants 4 234u 230th 226ra 222rn primary production of all four nuclides plus porewater ingrowth of descendants 5 238u 234u 230th 226ra 222rn primary production of nuclides subsequent to 238u plus porewater ingrowth of descendants pre existing 238u mineral in the porespace dissolves to give a constant equilibrium concentration of 238u to study the effect of having a constant background concentration of dissolved u it is assumed in case study 5 that the 238u does not recoil but dissolves from the solid phase to maintain a hypothetically constant equilibrium concentration thereby exactly balancing the amount lost by decay in the aqueous phase in other words the dissolution rate of 238u would be equal to its loss by decay i e r p u 238 1 c p u 238 eq λ u 238 where the background concentration of 238u c p u 238 eq mol m3 is presumed to be held constant by an unspecified solubility controlling mineral to maintain internal consistency the same recoil production rate of each nuclide given in table 1 is used throughout the present calculations even in the cases where only a shortened subset of nuclides is considered in the transport calculations the material property parameters are the same as those previously assumed for the transient model base case using k dp i 1 values also given in table 1 the background level of dissolved 238u in groundwater varies significantly at the forsmark site from as little as 0 2 mbq l 6 8 10 11 mol l to as much as 1940 mbq l 6 6 10 7 mol l in the present demonstration calculation the background concentration in the matrix porewater is assumed to be 10 8 mol l which is about half the median of the site specific measurement data the results of the calculations are shown in fig 5 for 226ra and fig 6 for 222rn given in terms of specific dissolved activities bq l for cases 1 4 the steady state activity reaches a plateau after a few tens of years advective travel time for the modelled transport parameters the ratio of specific activities for dissolved 226ra and 222rn are shown in fig 7 it is interesting to note that the inclusion of additional members of the decay chain results in higher equilibrium concentrations of 226ra and 222rn due to ingrowth from previously mobilised precursor nuclides in the porewater the inclusion of the full decay chain although excluding the impact of dissolved 238u case 4 gives an approximately 4 5 times increase in specific activity at long times for 222rn relative to the case of rn release only case 1 thereby suggesting a relatively important role of porewater ingrowth relative to primary emanation of 222rn by α recoil although not shown in the figures the steady state specific activity of 226ra at long transport times is relatively insensitive to transport aperture whereas 222rn exhibits a strong sensitivity this is expected based on the single component analysis in section 2 3 see eq 43 it is interesting to note that a background 238u concentration of 10 8 mol l gives a slight increase in the steady state fracture concentrations of descendant nuclides for long advective travel times the assumed background concentration together with its equilibrium sorbed fraction is equivalent to roughly 0 13 mg kg rock which is roughly 32 times less than the bulk u content of the rock assumed in the calculations reducing the background concentration by an order of magnitude to 10 9 mol l very nearly erases the imprint of mobile 238u decay on the steady state concentrations rendering calculation cases 4 and 5 indistinguishable 3 3 transient model example three layer rock matrix in this example we make a demonstration of a 3 layer calculation case where the porosity effective diffusivity and sorptivity of the rock is assumed to increase in the proximity of the fracture surface although the details of this are less important for a demonstration calculation an increase in retardation potential near the fracture surface is deemed likely in site specific rock in the forsmark investigation area due to a combination of stress release and earlier hydrothermal alteration processes e g crawford and löfgren 2019 to simplify the parameterisation of the 3 layer model we use a sorption enhancement factor f p j to uniformly modify the k dp i j values for the different matrix layers expressed as 44 k dp i j f p j k dp i 0 where k dp i 0 represents a reference sorption coefficient value for radionuclide i in the present case k dp i 0 corresponds to the retardation factor values for the base case and the variant case used in previous examples the additional parameters required for the 3 layer model are given in table 2 and results of the calculation are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 the effect of inclusion of two additional layers with increased retention relative to the single layer case can be seen by comparison of fig 8 and fig 9 with fig 3 and fig 4 respectively although the 3 layer case considers only a 1 m maximum penetration depth as compared to 12 5 m for the single layer case the matrix depth may be considered effectively unlimited for all chain radionuclides subsequent to 238u the altered layers 1 and 2 play an important role decreasing the concentration of sorbing radionuclides at the channel outlet which shortens the time required to re establish equilibrium which is consistent with the findings from previous studies mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 2014 the increased retention of sorbing radionuclides in the altered layers results in an increased production of 222rn in the immediate vicinity of the fracture surface which is reflected in the breakthrough curves 3 4 steady state model example three layer rock matrix in this example the five case studies from the steady state example in section 3 2 for a single layer are extended to the 3 layer rock matrix representation based on the parameterisation given in table 2 assuming the base case retardation factor values from table 1 the 3 layer model with uniformly enhanced sorption diffusion properties in the two surface layers nearest the fracture surface gives a lower steady state 226ra activity although higher 222rn activity as might be expected due to the higher storage of ra near the fracture surface in the 3 layer case for groundwater of age greater than a few tens of years the 222rn 226ra activity ratio stabilises to a value that is about an order of magnitude higher than the single layer case assuming the base case parameterisation the results are shown in figs 10 12 3 5 monte carlo steady state calculation example single layer rock matrix in a previous work by crawford 2010 the simplified steady state model described in neretnieks 2013 was adapted for use in a regular monte carlo calculation where calculated 222ra 226ra ratios were compared with groundwater measurement data from the forsmark site investigation area the purpose of this was to assess whether the range of sorption coefficient values for ra recommended for use in the sr site safety assessment skb 2011 could be considered consistent with the measured natural analogue groundwater activities this cannot however be considered a validation in the customary sense owing to the multidimensional nature of this problem comprising many uncertain parameters that also vary stochastically in space the best estimate probability distribution for ra sorption coefficient that is consistent with the measurement data is therefore conditional on correctly represented uncertainty distributions for other parameters comprising the model it is also dependent on the appropriateness of the model for accurately simulating the coupled transport and retardation processes which is not possible to assess from groundwater measurement data alone in the calculation example presented in this section the monte carlo calculation is updated with more recent data for supporting parameters as well as the updated transport model assuming a single layer rock matrix for this calculation several assumptions need to be made concerning the uncertainty distributions of key variables and parameters the stochastic data are given in table 3 and are broadly similar to those used in the previous work by crawford 2010 apart from the updated transport model the main difference is that fracture mineral processes are more accurately accounted for in the present work based on some recent data described in crawford and löfgren 2019 where fracture mineral abundances are quantified furthermore a lognormal distribution for transport aperture is proposed in the present work whereas previously a uniform uncertainty distribution was assumed for this parameter in this work the uncertainty distribution of the sorption coefficient for ra is also adjusted upwards relative to the more conservative range previously recommended for use in the sr site safety assessment crawford 2010 skb 2011 the results of the steady state monte carlo calculation are shown in fig 13 assuming relatively old groundwater t w 100 y and neglecting any background concentration of 238u the 222rn 226ra ratio corresponding to the best estimate parameter combination is shown as a red orange circular marker while the underlying grey shaded cloud shows the bivariate probability distribution derived from the monte carlo calculation the impact of altering the sorption coefficient value for ra is indicated by the red curve where all other parameters are held constant increasing the sorption coefficient value drags the locus of the best estimate horizontally to the left in the figure while decreasing the sorption coefficient value moves the best estimate to the right the central sorption coefficient estimate of 0 01 m3 kg in the present calculation clearly is more consistent with the measurement data blue markers than the previous best estimate of 2 42 10 4 m3 kg which was recommended for use in sr site indicated by the red orange triangular marker the corresponding impacts of the most influential stochastic parameters are illustrated in fig 13 by different coloured trend lines passing through the central estimate see the inset key on right hand side of the figure for explanations as can be seen from the figure varying the sorption coefficient value for ra has a strong impact on 226ra activity although seemingly little effect on the 222rn activity level on the other hand alteration of the transport aperture has a strong proportional impact on the 222rn activity although almost no impact on the 226ra activity as was already anticipated by eq 43 the recoil capture fraction and matrix abundance of u have a very similar proportional impact on the 222rn 226ra activity as might be expected on the basis of eq 43 groundwater age advective travel time 100 y and increased fracture retardation have a non linear retrograde impact on the locus of 222rn 226ra activities although with a stronger impact on 226ra than 222rn increasing the abundance of u in fracture coating minerals m c u has a similar impact to alteration of matrix u abundance m p u 1 and η p 1 although appearing to follow a distinctly separate trendline in the present calculations the use of the updated model has very little overall impact on the results and the predicted ranges of 222rn and 226ra are very similar to those calculated using the simplified single radionuclide representation based on the model by neretnieks 2013 in this context the stochastic variation of the m p u 1 and η p 1 variables in the monte carlo calculation overwhelms any differences that can be reasonably attributed to the differing complexity of the underlying transport model the revised best estimate rock matrix sorption coefficient value and its associated uncertainty range for ra in the present work relative to the previous recommendation in crawford 2010 is largely due to the more accurate quantification of fracture retardation processes i e equilibrium sorption on fracture coatings in the present work 4 concluding remarks in this paper a mathematical model has been developed that can simulate simultaneous transport of anthropogenic and naturally occurring radionuclides in fractured rocks the model accounts for advective flow molecular diffusion and surface sorption of an arbitrary length decay chain in a single flow bearing fracture bounded by a geologically heterogeneous rock matrix comprised of an arbitrary number of layers featuring piecewise constant material properties radionuclides can diffuse within the connected porosity of the rock matrix and sorb on the large internal surface area of the rock consisting of mineral grain boundaries and microfractures the model is an extension of the work by mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 which only considers radionuclide release as a boundary condition at the flow channel inlet the main improvement is an additional account of the production and transport of naturally occurring radionuclides in both the flow channel and the rock matrix in fractured crystalline rocks an analytical solution is derived in the laplace domain for the radionuclide concentrations in the rock matrix layers and at the channel outlet while the laplace domain analytical solution is transformed numerically back to the time domain for the transient solution the corresponding steady state can be obtained directly using the final value theorem applied to the transient solution without requiring numerical inversion to the author s best knowledge the developed model is novel and includes a more detailed account of natural radionuclide production and migration processes than existing models described in the literature the transport processes and conditions considered in this work are realistic for modelling of radionuclide transport from repositories for radioactive waste to the biosphere which is crucial for safety and performance assessment of deep geological repositories hosted in fractured crystalline rocks the present modelling is also of considerable interest for interpretation of natural occurrences of radionuclides including although not limited to radium and radon in groundwater the obtained analytical solution can be used to compare relative fluxes of natural and anthropogenic radionuclides which is useful for verifying radionuclide transport calculations and corroboration of transport parameters obtained from independent field and laboratory experiments the derived model can be applied to streamtube flow channel or discrete fracture network model representations of transport in fractured rock and makes it possible to perform comparative safety assessment calculations including natural background fluxes of radionuclides using identical modelling assumptions both the steady state and transient versions of the solution are useful for interpreting tracer tests and ground water monitoring data and might also find application in improving understanding of paleo disturbances in the distribution of natural analogue radionuclides in groundwater systems and timescales associated with return to steady state conditions the model and its frequency domain analytical solution can be readily extended to include stagnant water zones on the fracture plane mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 and asymmetric matrix material properties on opposite flanking sides of flow bearing channels in addition the developed model can be applied to describe the nuclide transport in complex channel networks for rectangular or circular channels mahmoudzadeh et al 2016 with varying flow rates the presented mathematical modelling procedure could be of interest in other areas such as geological storage of carbon dioxide or geothermal heat extraction from hot dry rock where monitoring and interpretation of natural radionuclide tracer concentrations could prove useful the utility of the model has been demonstrated by five separate hypothetical calculation examples these are 1 a transient calculation example for a single layer rock matrix 2 a steady state calculation example for a single layer rock matrix 3 a transient calculation example for a 3 layer rock matrix 4 a steady state calculation example for a 3 layer rock matrix 5 a regular monte carlo calculation of expected steady state 222rn and 226ra activities with stochastically varied model parameters for a single layer rock matrix in example 2 the steady state model was also corroborated against the simplified steady state model by neretnieks 2013 where transport of single naturally occurring radionuclides are modelled in the simplified model the transport of 226ra and 222rn is considered separately in a single layer homogeneous rock matrix of infinite extent without explicit consideration of porewater ingrowth the results of the steady state simulations suggest that previous modelling based on the consideration of production of a single radionuclide e g 222rn might underestimate radionuclide fluxes by not considering ingrowth contributions from the full decay chain in the porewater this however must also be set in the context of how the porewater recoil capture fraction has been defined and its relation to empirical estimates of radionuclide emanation based on measurements using crushed materials or tablets the work also points to the possibility that additional attenuation mechanisms relating to recoil capture of radionuclides undergoing α decay in porewater and secondary emanation processes from superficially implanted radionuclides in rock matrix minerals might need to be considered in more detail to represent natural radionuclide transport processes more accurately in the modelling examples a constant background concentration of 10 8 mol l 238u is assumed as an additional source term for radionuclides in the porewater here it is implicitly assumed that the 238u concentration is constantly replenished by mineral dissolution at a rate matching its decay in the porewater it is relatively straightforward to show that the molar concentrations of descendant radionuclides produced by the decay of the background 238u and by α recoil processes in the model are generally much lower than reasonable solubilities of the descendant radionuclides the modelled porewater concentrations of 234th in the calculation cases for example are at least 3 6 orders of magnitude less than typical solubilities of th in natural groundwater duro et al 2006 grivé et al 2010 depending on the kd value used to describe sorption since the predicted porewater concentrations of th are low this leaves open the possibility that dissolution of pre existing th containing mineral phases might contribute to a greater 226ra production than that predicted by the model this should be relatively easy to address by modification of the source term definition for 226ra although we leave this for future work the steady state concentration depends on the abundance and distribution of u and th in rock and fracture minerals advective travel time fracture transport aperture diffusive sorptive properties of the possibly altered rock matrix and the porewater recoil capture fraction of these the recoil capture fraction is thought to be the most uncertain parameter for transport modelling and values reported in the literature may not be fully consistent with the physical transport processes as conceptualised in this work future work will focus on estimating consistent recoil capture

1188,transport models used for assessing the safety of radioactive waste repositories hosted in fractured bedrock typically do not consider fluxes of naturally occurring radionuclides in the rock and their further migration in flow bearing fractures a consistent model that simultaneously describes the transport of radionuclides from both natural and anthropogenic sources has been developed where decay chains and rock heterogeneity are accounted for the model accounts for advective flow in the fracture a decay chain of arbitrary length and diffusion into and out of the adjacent rock matrix composed of different geological layers the proposed solution has been verified against a previously published steady state case which considers a homogeneous rock matrix of infinite extent where porewater ingrowth is not accounted for the model is also applied to some different calculation examples for both transient and limiting steady state cases to represent typical applications of the model as well as to illustrate the effect of different parameters and processes on the transport of natural radionuclides in fractured rocks this study presents a novel and powerful tool to simulate migration of both anthropogenic and natural radionuclides in and from crystalline rocks to the biosphere the presented modelling is essential in safety and performance assessment of deep geological disposal of radioactive waste in fractured rocks the obtained analytical solution can be used to compare relative fluxes of natural and anthropogenic radionuclides which is useful for validation of the radionuclide transport parameters obtained from field and laboratory experiments keywords radionuclide transport model semi analytical solution naturally occurring radionuclides fractured media decay chain laplace transform data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction naturally occurring radionuclides including progeny of the uranium series decay chain have long been used to study transport phenomena in environmental systems key et al 1979 andrews et al 1982 broecker and peng 1983 osmond and cowart 2000 suksi et al 2006 porcelli 2008 krall et al 2020 diego feliu et al 2021 in the field of radiation protection they are also of great interest for understanding transport and retention processes of anthropogenically generated radionuclides unintentionally dispersed in the environment uranium and thorium ore bodies have also been extensively studied as natural analogues of geological repositories for permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and other nuclear wastes miller et al 2000 in sweden and finland the kbs 3 concept has been adopted for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel this concept entails the emplacement of spent nuclear fuel encapsulated in copper canisters in crystalline bedrock at a depth of 400 500 m and with multiple protective barriers such as copper canisters bentonite clay and the bedrock skb 2011 if the primary isolation function of the engineered barrier degrades over time due to expected corrosion or other processes e g earthquake related shear radionuclides in the spent fuel may dissolve and be transported by flowing water through a network of connected background fractures in the rock toward the ground surface it is therefore of great importance to develop methods and models for understanding the fundamental mechanisms governing radionuclide transport processes in fractured rocks over timescales as long as 1 ma in fractured crystalline rock dissolved radionuclides are mostly carried by water seeping through hydraulically conductive fractures although their transport is retarded by several physical and chemical mechanisms while advective flow is the primary mechanism for all long range transport through the rock the migration of dissolved radionuclides can be delayed either by sorption directly on fracture surfaces or diffusion into effectively stagnant water within partly open fractures dissolved radionuclides may also diffuse into the water filled porosity of the rock matrix and from there adsorb to mineral surfaces due to the large surface area of rock minerals that can potentially be accessed via the connected porosity of the rock matrix the retardation of radionuclide transport can be considerably larger than that achievable by adsorption on minerals exposed on external fracture surfaces alone neretnieks 1980 bear et al 1993 li and chiou 1993 gylling et al 1998 skb 2011 many laboratory and field scale experiments have studied the important mechanisms of solute transport in fractured rocks laboratory and field scale tracer experiments are usually limited by time and distance to a few years and some tens of meters whereas safety assessments of geological repositories are required to cover hundreds of thousands of years and span distances up to many tens of kilometres skb 2011 natural analogue studies however can give insight into migration processes over longer spatial and temporal scales than are directly accessible experimentally data obtained from natural analogues may also be used to demonstrate consistency with predictions of radiological risk made within safety assessment many mathematical models and analytical solutions have been developed to account for important mechanisms of solute transport and retardation in fractured rocks while earlier models considered mainly advection and diffusion into an infinite rock matrix increasingly sophisticated versions have incorporated hydrodynamic dispersion a finite extent of connected rock matrix porosity material property variation both along flowpaths and within the rock matrix orthogonal to the flowpath attenuation and ingrowth via decay chains and diffusion into stagnant water in fracture planes neretnieks 1980 tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 cvetkovic et al 1999 neretnieks 2006 cvetkovic 2010 mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 2014 shahkarami et al 2014 jia et al 2022 an overview of fundamental mechanisms and transport models for radionuclide transport in fractured rocks are given in bodin et al 2003a 2003b and more recently in zhang et al 2022 for multi scale fractured rocks most models used in safety assessment focus on anthropogenic releases of dissolved radionuclides in the form of pulse or a temporally variable boundary condition at a specified hypocentre corresponding to a leaking canister or other storage unit comprising an engineered barrier to the best knowledge of the authors none of the transport models typically deployed in safety assessment include natural sources of radionuclides in the rock matrix although the flux contribution of naturally occurring radionuclides in fracture minerals and the rock matrix is likely to be lower relative to hypothetical peak releases from the repository the inclusion of natural source terms can be a useful addition to the models used in safety assessment this serves multiple purposes firstly the modelled transport of natural radionuclides forms an internal standard that can be readily checked against measured groundwater levels of natural radionuclides in a specific landscape and climatic context and thus can function as a reality check on radiological risk metrics calculated in complex safety assessment settings secondly if used with care such models can also be used to interpret natural analogue data to show consistency or non consistency of model parameterisation and underlying assumptions with observations in field scale settings thirdly comparison of measured groundwater levels of natural radionuclide fluxes with modelling results might be used as a means of deriving key parameters that can then be compared with independent estimates obtained in laboratory investigations which may be subject to bias or otherwise be not fully representative of in situ conditions apart from safety assessment related applications one of the key motivations for carrying out the modelling described in this paper was to ascertain the impact of neglecting or including the extended decay chain in modelling of 222rn production in natural systems since most rn production and transport models described in the literature do not consider the extended decay chain we suspected that decay of precursor radionuclides dissolved within porewater might be underappreciated as a production mechanism for rn distinct from direct emission from mineral grains furthermore since relative ratios of different decay chain radionuclides are frequently invoked as a means of understanding the geochemistry and migration mechanisms of actinides we saw an unfulfilled need for a model containing a coherent generalised account of natural radionuclide production and transport encompassing entire decay chains 1 1 production of radionuclides in the rock matrix this section is focused on natural uranium and thorium in granitic rocks which are most relevant for spent nuclear fuel disposal concepts in sweden finland and a growing number of countries u and th are heterogeneously distributed throughout granitic rock and tend to concentrate in matrix accessory minerals such as zircon apatite and monazite eggeling et al 2013 uranium is also commonly present as uraninite or as solid solutions with thorite and thorianite inclusions in biotite locally high concentrations of secondary micro precipitates are also typically found along grain boundaries and microfractures uraninite urano thorite haiweeite uranophane and coffinite have all been identified in microfractures of forsmark rock samples krall et al 2015 descendant radionuclides resulting from decay of primordial 232th 238u and 235u are generally found alongside u and th mineralisation in this work we focus mainly on the uranium 4n 2 decay chain see supplementary material although the model developed is generalised to other decay chains this section is focused on natural uranium and thorium in granitic

alongside u and th mineralisation in this work we focus mainly on the uranium 4n 2 decay chain see supplementary material although the model developed is generalised to other decay chains alpha recoil is an important process for supplying progeny radionuclides to the matrix porewater when a radionuclide undergoes α decay an equal momentum is imparted to both the α particle 4he and the decay nucleus the bulk of the decay energy is transmitted to the α particle while only a small fraction is imparted to the much heavier descendant nuclide i e the recoil nucleus in the form of recoil energy sun and semkow 1998 when travelling through a medium such as a mineral crystal water or air the energy of the recoiling nucleus is dissipated by coulombic interactions with atoms in the medium the distance over which a recoil nucleus can travel is called the stopping distance while the range of a typical recoiling α particle in water is about 30 50 μm for the more massive decay products the range is no more than about 70 120 nm in a dense mineral such as uraninite the stopping distance of the recoil nucleus is typically 14 23 nm stopping distances for recoil nuclei in various materials can be readily calculated using for example the srim software package ziegler et al 2010 depending on the location of the decaying atom the recoil nucleus can be trapped in the originating source mineral be ejected into porewater at a grain boundary or implanted in adjacent minerals in the rock matrix the fraction of decay atoms that are ejected from a mineral grain into the porewater is referred to as the recoil capture fraction η recoiling nuclei that are only superficially implanted into pore adjacent minerals can also diffuse back into the porewater in a process referred to as indirect recoil if the decaying atom resides at a sufficient distance from the surface of the host mineral grain or non host mineral however then the decay nucleus is effectively trapped due to the very low solid state diffusivity of large atoms in mineral crystals only recoil nuclei originating from a distance within the outer rim of the host mineral equal to or less than the average stopping distance can escape to porewater in contact with the mineral grain several investigators have calculated the theoretical recoil capture fractions for recoil nuclei although the derived formulae are dependent on assumptions concerning grain size of the primary u containing minerals and geometrical attributes of the surrounding porosity flügge and zimens 1939 kigoshi 1971 key et al 1979 bossus 1984 semkow 1990 1991 liu and neretnieks 1994 lee et al 2010 stajic and nikezic 2014 most of the formulae found in the literature are not strictly relevant in the present context owing to heterogeneous distribution of host mineral grain sizes and locations relative to the narrow and sparsely distributed pore spaces typically found in granitic rocks in general the recoil capture fraction is a highly uncertain parameter that is best estimated by calibration against laboratory measurements for site specific materials under appropriate conditions this will however not be further discussed here as it falls out of the main objective of the present work which is mathematical model development an important fact that should be considered with modelling production and migration of multiple successive members of a decay chain is that a non negligible fraction of each descendant is lost from the outer layer of the primary host mineral with each successive α decay step the net rate of production of the descendant would be less in each generation due to loss from the primary source phase if we consider the full decay chain the loss for each descendant nuclide depends on the number of α decays between the descendant and the original parent nuclide this is accounted for in the model as shown in eqs 3 and 9 in the next section another complication is that radionuclides transported in the porewater which subsequently undergo α decay may also be lost by α recoil implantation in mineral pore boundaries i e the reverse process of the original recoil capture mechanism this is shown schematically in fig 1 for nuclides that are moderately to strongly sorbing each α decay may incur a loss of up to 50 since half of the recoil nuclei will be implanted into the adjacent mineral while at most half will be retained in the porewater for pore apertures less than the stopping distance the implantation loss associated with each decay step may be even higher since recoiling nuclei can traverse the pore space and be implanted in the mineral at the facing pore surface normally this process is neglected in radionuclide transport calculations while this might be a reasonable assumption for safety assessment it presents problems when one wishes to accurately account for the migration of natural radionuclides a further difficulty is that radionuclides that find themselves implanted superficially in rock matrix minerals may themselves also subsequently undergo α decay and either recoil deeper into the matrix mineral or recoil back into the porewater secondary emanation the principal radionuclide fluxes including all feasible primary and secondary α recoil processes are illustrated in fig 1 for the uranium decay chain assuming a pore aperture sufficiently large that all primary recoil emanations are initially captured in the porewater i e not directly lost to other pore adjoining minerals one approach to account for implantation is to incorporate a constant retention factor θ for each α decay step θ represents the loss of porewater descendent nuclides due to implantation in neighbouring matrix minerals neglecting the secondary emanation fluxes which return descendent nuclides to the porewater depending on the value of θ assumed in the calculation it is then possible to bracket the development of porewater activity between the limiting case of zero porewater loss to say 50 loss in each α decay step this of course results in a significant loss of precision since it is not possible to properly account for all the relevant α recoil processes another approach is to introduce an effective retention factor θ i that is theoretically calculated for each descendent nuclide i to approximately preserve the overall mass balance including secondary recoil fluxes without explicitly including them in the transport model while still not completely precise the approximation should be sufficiently accurate for most practical applications involving non steady state transport and should exactly match the steady state solution provided appropriate θ i values are chosen for the calculation 1 2 overview of models for radionuclide transport in fractured rock radionuclides ejected by α recoil to the porewater can further migrate within the connected water filled porosity of the rock matrix and diffuse from fracture surfaces to flowing water in fractures helium 4he as a stable element generated through α decay of u and th and their descendants has been used as a tracer to date groundwater age and calculate advective travel times of flowing water in fractured rock formations andrews 1985 bethke et al 2000 bethke and johnson 2008 neretnieks 2013 trinchero et al 2019 measurement data for 222rn 226ra and 4he from three sites in sweden and finland forsmark laxemar and olkiluoto have also previously been interpreted through a model developed by neretnieks 2013 the model describes how descendant nuclides generated by α recoil associated with uranium and thorium decay escape from primary source minerals into matrix porewater and diffuse further into the water flowing fractures the analytical solution described by neretnieks 2013 is derived for the steady state condition of a homogeneous rock matrix of infinite extent the model is simplified to account only for a single decaying nuclide and does not include an anthropogenic source term at the start of the flowpath more recently trinchero and iraola 2020 presented a transient model for natural production and transport of nuclides in fractured rocks their model as an extension to the work done by sudicky and frind 1982 1984 focuses on transport and retardation of a first order decaying nuclide where the rock matrix is assumed to be homogenous with finite extent a constant anthropogenic source is considered at the flow fracture inlet and a production term for naturally occurring nuclides is included only in the rock matrix while a mass balance model that considers a single decay chain member as done by trinchero and iraola 2020 can be a practical tool in groundwater hydrogeology care must be taken when defining an effective recoil capture fraction which implicitly includes the multiple transport processes discussed in the previous section it is often worthwhile to be able to model ratios of naturally occurring descendants to correctly interpret natural analogue data in such cases it is essential to have an accurate account of the release of each descendant nuclide and their coupling via decay and ingrowth the objective of the present paper is then to develop a mathematical model based on the model presented in mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 although modified to account for production and transport of radionuclide chains from natural sources in both the rock matrix and the fracture the novelty of this work is to present a consistent transient model that can consider simultaneous transport of anthropogenic and naturally occurring nuclides in fractured rock involving arbitrary length decay chains the mathematical model accounts for advective flow through a discrete flow channel diffusion into a heterogeneous layered rock matrix of limited extent adsorption and arbitrary length decay chains a temporally variable boundary condition is considered at the flowpath inlet as the anthropogenic source term it is anticipated that the derived transient model will find useful applications for interpreting groundwater systems such as the forsmark site investigation area in sweden where a recent study by krall et al 2020 suggests that non steady state 226ra activities are common in many of the younger or holocene groundwaters the paper is organized as follows section 2 is the main focus of the paper where the system is described conceptually formulated mathematically in the time domain and solved analytically in the laplace frequency domain for the main flow channel and adjacent rock matrix layers in section 3 multiple simulation cases are made to illustrate the main features of the model and importance of considering the entire decay chain when calculating the migration of naturally occurring radionuclides for both transient and steady state cases the paper finishes with concluding remarks and discussion of intended future work in section 4 2 model development 2 1 conceptual model the concept underlying the proposed model is shown schematically in fig 2 a system of parallel fractures with perfectly symmetric transport conditions into the rock matrix is considered as an idealization of a network of intersecting fractures it is similar to the conceptual model presented in mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 but further extended to account for production and transport of natural radionuclides in both the matrix and the fracture it is assumed that naturally existing grains of u and th enriched accessory minerals are evenly distributed in the matrix and lose descendant nuclides to the rock matrix porewater by way of α recoil moreover a variable anthropogenic source term e g leaking canister is considered at the flow channel inlet making it possible to study simultaneous transport of anthropogenic and naturally occurring nuclides in fractured rocks as illustrated in fig 2 the fracture is defined as rectangular channel through which water flows with a constant mean velocity of u the rock matrix is assumed to be geologically piecewise heterogeneous having an arbitrary number of layers with differing thicknesses and transport properties the geological structure of the rock matrix is simplified to have layers which may consist of for example fracture coatings as well as multiple tectonically or hydrothermally altered layers overlaying mostly unaltered wall rock tsang and doughty 2003 moreno and crawford 2009 mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 the model accounts for advection through the flow channel diffusion into the rock matrix layers linear equilibrium adsorption onto external fracture surfaces and within the rock matrix as well as arbitrary length decay chains the assumption of linear equilibrium adsorption implies that the range of concentrations should not vary so much that the sorption isotherm for migrating radionuclides exhibit non linear langmuir or freundlich like behaviour this suggests that care should be taken when applying the present model to systems characterized by strong geochemical gradients redox or ph or periodic flushing with groundwater of highly variable composition fickian diffusion is considered to be the main transport process in the rock matrix as the permeability of crystalline rock is sufficiently low that advective flow can be neglected complete mixing of solutes across the flow channel is considered thereby implying negligible transverse dispersion longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion is also ignored as it is commonly dominated by differences in advective travel times along multiple independent flowpaths in fractured media buckley and loyalka 1993 neretnieks 2002a cvetkovic et al 1999 and therefore is not strictly necessary to model on the level of individual migration paths a more detailed account of the reasoning behind the neglection of this mechanism is given in mahmoudzadeh et al 2016 for the interested reader the effect of a stagnant water zone on the fracture plane is not considered here although the solution can be easily extended to include this as previously demonstrated in mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 if it is furthermore assumed that matrix diffusion can be approximated as a 1 dimensional process normal to the fracture surface the nominally two dimensional system can be simplified to two coupled one dimensional systems these are formulated mathematically as independent although mutually coupled problems and solved analytically in the following sections the present model is simplified by considering only linear non branching decay processes although this is only strictly an issue for the anthropogenic source term which might include non negligible amounts of 242mam 238pu and 232u in safety assessment calculation codes that are subject to the same restriction this is typically handled by adding the molar quantity of faster decaying nuclide in the subordinate converging chain to the inventory of the slower decaying nuclide in the main chain without any loss of accuracy for the calculation of fluxes of the more long lived radionuclides see e g skb 2010 all other branching processes involving extremely short lived radionuclides are trivial and can be generally neglected furthermore we also restrict the scope of the modelling work to actinide decay chains involving α decay since this comprises a key mechanism for the in situ production and mobilisation of the natural analogue radionuclides that are of most interest to us 2 2 mathematical model a coupled one dimensional approach as adopted previously by hodgkinson and maul 1988 is used to describe the transport of each member in the decay chain the system shown in fig 2 can be considered as two subsystems the flow channel and the rock matrix layers for which the equations of continuity describing solute transport processes can be formulated individually the coupling between these two subsystems is provided by the requirement of concentration continuity at the interface and by introducing sink source terms in the governing equations which describe solute exchange at the interface the system accounts for the mass gain or loss of decaying nuclide which introduces an additional coupling in the equations the equations describing the solute transport in each subsystem is presented in the following sections 2 2 1 solute transport through the flow channel if we consider a radioactive nuclide decay chain the one dimensional transport equation for the aqueous concentration of the ith nuclide in the flow channel c f i can be expressed as i 1 2 n 1 r f i c f i t u c f i x d e i 1 b f c p i 1 z z 0 r f i λ i c f i r f i 1 θ f i 1 λ i 1 c f i 1 g i where instantaneous retardation due to sorption on the fracture surface as well as sorption on rock matrix micro surfaces is accounted for in eq 1 we use the subscripts f and i to indicate the flow channel and the radionuclide i respectively the superscript 1 signifies the first matrix layer adjacent to the flow channel a complete list of symbols and units is given in the notation section at the end of the paper the first term at the right hand side of eq 1 describes the advective transport through the flow channel while the second term specifies diffusive mass transfer at the interface between the flow channel and the adjacent rock matrix the third term represents the mass loss of member i by decay whereas the fourth term denotes the mass gain ingrowth of member i by radioactive disintegration of its immediate progenitor member i 1 we define λ 0 0 for decay rate of the first progenitor in the decay chain i e i 1 as it is not produced by ingrowth the last term g i represents effective rate of nuclide production from a primary source mineral residing in the fracture or directly from the fracture surface per unit water volume in the fracture and can be defined as 2 g i 0 i n α f g 0 i η f i n α f where n αf represents the number in the whole studied chain of the first descendant nuclide produced naturally by α recoil from the source mineral in the fracture g 0 i is the total rate of production of nuclide i from the minerals in the fracture and η f is the recoil capture fraction for primary nuclide emanation from fracture surfaces i e the fraction of produced nuclides that can directly escape from the u or th containing mineral grains to the water in the fracture if one assumes secular equilibrium amongst the descendants of the naturally occurring progenitor nuclide within the primary source mineral the activity of all descendants in the chain should be equal to that of the progenitor if depletion of the host phase by α recoil is neglected in such cases the total rate of production of each descendant i in the natural chain would be the same for each of the subsequent nuclides i e g 0 i g 0 n αf i n αf this means that it is sufficient to calculate only g 0 n αf which is the total rate of production of the first descendant nuclide in the naturally occurring chain from the activity of the immediately preceding progenitor in the present case 238u in the minerals residing in the fracture if however a non negligible fraction of descendant is lost from the solid phase with each successive α decay the total rate of production of each descendant would be less in each generation due to depletion of the solid phase and can be expressed as 3 g 0 i g 0 n α f μ i 1 1 η f k n α f i 1 μ k for i n α f where μ k takes on an integer value depending on whether the decay step k is an α decay process μ k 1 or not μ k 0 in this formulation it is implicitly assumed that the recoil capture fraction η f is identical for each radionuclide produced by α recoil in other words we assume in the present work a constant average recoil capture fraction due to the uncertainty of reported values in the literature which may not be fully consistent with the physical transport processes as conceptualised in this work future work will however focus on estimating consistent recoil capture fractions from laboratory measurement data in eq 1 r f i represents an equilibrium retardation factor for the ith nuclide due to sorption on fracture minerals in a flow channel with transport half aperture b f and is calculated as 4 r f i 1 b c b f ε c ρ c k dc i where k dc i is the linear sorption partitioning coefficient of nuclide i in the fracture coating of total thickness b c and ρ c and ε c are the bulk density and transport porosity of the fracture coating respectively in the present derivation the initial conditions in the fracture for eq 1 are defined as i 1 2 n 5 c f i x 0 c f 0 i where c f0 i is the initial concentration of the ith nuclide in the fracture the use of a constant concentration in eq 5 implies relatively old groundwater i e a few thousand years and thus is not strictly correct for say a recharge path where the steady state equilibrium concentration varies as a function of distance i e age of the recharge water in the present work as mentioned in the previous section it is assumed that the u and th containing host minerals are sufficiently old that they can be considered at isotopic equilibrium depletion of descendants in surface layers notwithstanding this assumption allows one to estimate the rate of primary radionuclide production via alpha recoil only knowing the abundance of the original progenitor nuclide in the rock i e 238u the initial equilibrium concentration could be calculated either by the obtained solution for steady state concentration in the next section or through the method explained in supplementary material section 1 in the present derivation the initial conditions in the fracture for eq 1 are defined as i 1 2 n 5 c f i x 0 c f 0 i where c f0 i is the initial concentration of the ith nuclide in the fracture the use of a constant concentration in eq 5 implies relatively old groundwater i e a few thousand years and thus is not strictly correct for say a recharge path where the steady state equilibrium concentration varies as a function of distance i e age of the recharge water in the present work as mentioned in the previous section it is assumed that the u and th containing host minerals are sufficiently old that they can be considered at isotopic equilibrium depletion of descendants in surface layers notwithstanding this assumption allows one to estimate the rate of primary radionuclide production via alpha recoil only knowing the abundance of the original progenitor nuclide in the rock i e 238u the initial equilibrium concentration could be calculated either by the obtained solution for steady state concentration in the next section or through the method explained in supplementary material section 1 the boundary condition for eq 1 is i 1 2 n 6 c f i 0 t c in i t where c in i t is the ith nuclide concentration at the flow channel inlet 2 2 2 solute transport through the rock matrix accounting for diffusion and linear equilibrium sorption the one dimensional transport equation for the aqueous concentration of species i in the pore water of the jth layer of the rock matrix c p i j is given by i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 7 r p i j c p i j t d p i j 2 c p i j z 2 r p i j λ i c p i j r p i 1 j θ p i 1 j λ i 1 c p i 1 j q i j for z in j z z out j where we have defined z in j k 0 j 1 δ k z out j k 0 j δ k and δ 0 0 representing the interface between the fracture and the first adjacent matrix layer similarly to the mass balance for the flow channel θ p i j here is the α recoil porewater retention fraction for the ith nuclide in the jth layer of the rock matrix the subscripts in and out indicate the inner and outer boundaries of each matrix layer respectively relative to the coordinate system in eq 7 q i j represents the effective production rate of ith nuclide per unit volume of porewater in the jth matrix layer and can be defined as 8 q i j 0 i n α p q 0 i j η p j i n α p where n αp represents the number in the whole studied chain of the first daughter nuclide produced naturally by α recoil from the source mineral in the rock q 0 i j is the total rate of production of the ith nuclide per unit volume of porewater in the jth matrix layer and η p j is the fraction of the produced nuclides that can escape from the grains to the porewater in the jth matrix layer if one were to assume secular equilibrium within the primary source mineral and negligible depletion by recoil the total rate of production of each descendant nuclide i in the naturally occurring chain would be the same in each matrix layer and can be written as q 0 i j q 0 n α p j i n αp in this case we need only determine q 0 n α p j which is the total production rate of the first descendant nuclide in the naturally occurring chain from the activity of its progenitor in the source mineral in the jth layer of the rock if however the release fraction of descendant nuclides from the solid phase is not negligible with each successive α decay the total rate of production of each descendant can be defined as 9 q 0 i j q 0 n α p j μ i 1 1 η p j k n α p i 1 μ k for i n α p in eq 7 pore retardation factors r p i j for each nuclide i in matrix layer j are calculated as 10 r p i j 1 ρ p j k dp i j ε p j where k dp i j is the linear sorption partitioning coefficient of nuclide i in the matrix layer j while ρ p j and ε p j are the bulk density and transport porosity of the rock matrix layer j respectively the initial condition for eq 7 can be defined as i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 11 c p i j z 0 c p 0 i j for z in j z z out j where c p 0 i j is the initial concentration of the ith nuclide in the jth layer of the rock matrix the initial conditions for the case when the porewater and source mineral system is in isotopic equilibrium i e c p i j z 0 c p i j eq could be calculated either by the steady state concentration presented in the next section or through supplementary material section 1 the initial condition for eq 7 can be defined as i 1 2 n j 1 2 m 11 c p i j z 0 c p 0 i j for z in j z z out j where c p0 i j is the initial concentration of the ith nuclide in the jth layer of the rock matrix the initial conditions for the case when the porewater and source mineral system is in isotopic equilibrium i e c p i j z 0 c p i j eq could be calculated either by the steady state concentration presented in the

j where we have defined c p i 0 c f i at the rock matrix fracture interface and and d e i m 1 0 i e a reflection boundary at the limit of assumed rock matrix pore space connectivity 2 3 solution in the laplace domain the governing partial differential equations given in the mathematical model section cannot be readily solved for a heterogeneous layered rock matrix and an arbitrary length decay chain they can however be solved by using the method of laplace transforms watson 1981 where the partial differential equations are transformed to a set of ordinary differential equations see supplementary material section 3 for governing equations in the laplace domain the ordinary differential equations are then decoupled and can be solved analytically by use of matrix similarity transformation see supplementary material section 2 since the aqueous concentration in the rock matrix can be defined independently of the concentration profiles within the flow channel we first present the laplace transformed solution for solute transport in the rock matrix layers and then continue with the solution in the flow channel to shorten the main text the final general solutions are presented in this section but the detailed mathematical steps and definitions of different matrices to get the concentration in the laplace domain are given in supplementary material section 4 the governing partial differential equations given in the mathematical model section cannot be readily solved for a heterogeneous layered rock matrix and an arbitrary length decay chain they can however be solved by using the method of laplace transforms watson 1981 where the partial differential equations are transformed to a set of ordinary differential equations see supplementary material section 3 for governing equations in the laplace domain the ordinary differential equations are then decoupled and can be solved analytically by use of matrix similarity transformation see supplementary material section 2 since the aqueous concentration in the rock matrix can be defined independently of the concentration profiles within the flow channel we first present the laplace transformed solution for solute transport in the rock matrix layers and then continue with the solution in the flow channel to shorten the main text the final general solutions are presented in this section but the detailed mathematical steps and definitions of different matrices to get the concentration in the laplace domain are given in supplementary material section 4 2 3 1 solution for the rock matrix

as 22 c 1 1 1 c f 1 β p and 23 c 2 1 1 tanh α δ 1 c 1 1 1 substituting these constants into eq 19 gives the concentration profile in the rock matrix as 24 c p 1 1 c f 1 β p cosh α z tanh α δ 1 sinh α

the solution given in eq 25 is the same solution as that given by sudicky and frind 1982 for the concentration in the rock matrix the concentration gradient at the fracture surface can be obtained either from eq 16 or directly from differentiation of eqs 24 or 25 as 26 z c p 1 1 z 0 c f 1 β p α tanh α δ 1 in the limiting case of a homogeneous rock matrix of infinite extent the hyperbolic

larger than the half life of the transported nuclide i e s λ 1 where s represents the laplace variable see supplementary material section 3 in this case the steady state solution can be obtained

processes in the flow channel the general solution for the laplace transformed concentration through the flow channel is calculated as 32 c f θ exp t θ 1 c in v θ v the detailed mathematical procedure and definition of different matrices in eq 32 is given in supplementary material section 4 the input boundary concentration to the flow channel can be formulated variously as a pulse release a constant concentration decaying concentration or a time dependant concentration eq 32 can be numerically transformed back to the time domain by use of a suitable laplace inversion routine in this work we have used the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 implemented in a widely used matlab function by hollenbeck 1998 that has been found to work well with this type of problem in previous work mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 2014 2016 the detailed mathematical procedure and definition of different matrices in eq 32 is given in supplementary material section 4 the input boundary concentration to the flow channel can be formulated variously as a pulse release a constant concentration decaying concentration or a time dependant concentration eq 32 can be numerically transformed back to the time domain by use of a suitable laplace inversion routine in this work we have used the de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 implemented in a widely used matlab function by hollenbeck 1998 that has been found to work well with this type of problem in previous work mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 2014 2016 2 3 2 1 solution for the simplified case of a single homogenous rock matrix layer of finite extent in the special case where the rock matrix is comprised of a single homogeneous layer and for a single nuclide only it can be shown that θ 1 θ 1 1 and therefore the laplace transformed concentration through the flow channel is from eq 32 33 c f exp e f e p τ f c in v 1 v 1 where 34 v 1 e p β p β f e f e p 35 β f g 1 s r f 1 c f 0 1 36 e f r f 1 s λ 1 37 e p d e 1 1 b f α tanh α δ 1 in eq 33 we have introduced τ f the advective travel time through the flow channel as 38 τ f x u as can be seen from the definition of e f and e p they separately represent the effect of flow channel and rock matrix retardation on radionuclide transport as these two terms are independent functions of the transport properties of the flow channel and the rock matrix respectively the contribution of naturally occurring radionuclides in the fracture and in the rock matrix is characterized by the β f and β p terms respectively 2 3 2 2 steady state solution for an unlimited homogenous rock matrix in the limiting case where there is no anthropogenic boundary condition at the beginning of the transport path c f i 0 t 0 the single layer rock matrix is sufficiently thick to be considered as being of infinite extent δ 1 and retardation due to sorption on the fracture surface is deemed negligible r f 1 1 then eq 33 simplifies to 39 c f exp s λ 1 d e 1 1 b f α τ f 1 v 1 with 40 v 1 d e 1 1 b f α β p β f s λ 1 d e 1 1 b f α in this case the steady state solution for times much larger than the half life of the single nuclide being transported s λ 1 can be directly obtained from laplace transformed solution in eq 39 by way of the final value theorem churchill 1972 this gives the steady state concentration through the flow channel as 41 c f ϑ q 1 1 r p 1 1 λ 1 g 1 ϑ λ 1 1 exp λ 1 ϑ τ f with 42 ϑ ε p 1 b f d p 1 1 r p 1 1 λ 1 which is identical to the solution given by neretnieks 2013 for the same steady state case the steady state concentration in the fracture has a strong relation with fracture aperture but it depends also on the rate of production in the rock the recoil capture fraction and the transport properties of the rock the sensitivity of the steady state concentration to the fracture aperture depends however on the denominator of eq 41 more specifically we can discriminate sensitivity of the steady state concentration to fracture transport aperture by way of the dimensionless variable ω defined as 43 ω ε p 1 b f d p 1 1 r p 1 1 λ 1 in situations where ω 1 the steady state concentration will be approximately inversely proportional to the fracture transport aperture if on the other hand ω 1 then we would expect the steady state concentration to be nearly independent of fracture transport aperture based on this observation it has been proposed previously that steady state concentrations of 222rn might potentially be used to estimate transport apertures in fractured rock flow systems e g andrews et al 1986 neretnieks 2002b 3 simulations and discussion in this section the transport model developed in the previous section is applied to some different calculation examples for both the transient and limiting steady state cases the aim here is to provide a series of examples which might be deemed representative of typical applications for which the model could be used as well as to illustrate the effect of different parameters and processes on the transport of natural analogue radionuclides in fractured rock the model is also compared to a previously developed model for the steady state case described in neretnieks 2013 which considers independent production of radionuclides without consideration of porewater ingrowth the first transient example is based on a hypothetical scenario of a long recharge flowpath with zero concentration inflow e g rainwater recharge the flowpath is then quickly flushed after which the return to steady state conditions is monitored due to production of uranium series 4n 2 decay chain nuclides in the rock matrix and accompanying matrix sorption diffusion processes although the model developed in the previous section is generalised to permit the simulation of a multilayer rock matrix with piecewise constant material properties a single rock matrix layer is assumed in the first simulation case to simplify understanding of mechanistic effects the second example is a steady state case which examines the stepwise impact of including additional decay chain members in the transport model relative to the simplified case of 222rn production only the aim of this case study is to demonstrate the impact of decay processes of one or more progenitor nuclides in the porewater as distinct from production by direct recoil capture from primary source minerals only this case considers a single layered rock matrix of finite extent with homogeneous material properties the third and fourth examples are similar to the first and second example although with the rock matrix conceptualised as being comprised of three layers with piecewise constant material properties featuring increased diffusive sorptive retention in layers closest to the fracture surface a final example is provided for a regular monte carlo application where stochastic parameters are assigned from pre defined uncertainty distributions and used to predict likely ranges of steady state 222rn and 226ra activities the predicted data are compared with measurement data from skb s site investigation area at forsmark and used to discuss the mechanistic impact of various key parameters central to the model in all cases it is implicitly assumed that the u enriched mineral grains in the rock matrix are sufficiently old that isotopic equilibrium can be reasonably assumed for estimation of the natural source term of 238u descendants after correction for α recoil depletion in the primary host mineral phases based on this assumption the production of each descendant in the decay chain is linearly related to the activity of the 238u progenitor contained in the host mineral grains furthermore although the developed mathematical model includes effective loss factors in both rock matrix and fracture we assume the limiting case of no porewater loss and neglect secondary emanation i e θ f i 1 and θ p i j 1 in the presented demonstration calculations since the inclusion of numerical values would require an entire paper on its own to justify 3 1 transient model example single layer rock matrix in the first example we consider a flowpath that is quickly flushed with untraced water and the return to steady state conditions is simulated using the transient solution the rock matrix is comprised of a homogeneous single layer of 12 5 m extent and the flowpath is assumed to be a groundwater recharge path meaning that the concentration at the channel inlet i e at ground surface can be set to zero i e c f i 0 t 0 for this simulation a transport aperture of 0 2 mm is assumed which together with the advective travel time of 100 y corresponds to a flow wetted surface to flow ratio f factor of 106 y m it is noted that the assumed maximum matrix penetration depth reflects the average half spacing of flow bearing fractures at repository depth at the forsmark site investigation area and is not related to any mechanistic limitation of rock matrix porous connectivity which is effectively infinite for the purposes of radionuclide transport calculations i e regarding the impact of limited diffusion depth of more than a few dm on the mathematical solution the radionuclide specific parameters for this example are given in table 1 two simulation variants are made for the transient model example the base case assumes sorption coefficient values k dp i 1 m3 kg taken from the sr site safety assessment skb 2011 whereas the other variant assumes less conservative k dp i 1 values for th and ra to give activities closer to measured groundwater levels at the forsmark site the effective diffusivity d e i 1 of the rock matrix is assumed to be roughly constant at 2 1 10 14 m2 s while the transport porosity ε p 1 of the rock matrix is 1 8 10 3 the average uranium content of the rock matrix in this example is assumed to be 4 mg kg ppm which is the site average for forsmark granitic rock in this example it is assumed that there is no source term associated with fracture minerals or sorptive retardation on external fracture surfaces i e g i 0 and r f i 1 the true recoil capture fraction is presently unknown for the rock matrix although for the purpose of the demonstration calculation presented here it is assumed to be η p 1 5 this value is arbitrary although based loosely on ranges of values reported in the literature as discussed in neretnieks 2013 the recoil capture fraction is perhaps the least well known although arguably the most important governing variable for transport modelling of naturally occurring radionuclides as the main objective of the current work is the model development the radionuclide specific k dp i 1 values for sorption are assumed to be approximately valid for the present calculation examples although it is acknowledged that there is some conservatism in the chosen values for the base case such that they may not be fully representative of the true natural analogue migration processes the time domain breakthrough curve results for the transient case were calculated using the numerical laplace inversion as described previously the calculation results for the base case and for the variant case are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively the solution to the transient problem indicates that 222rn quickly reaches its steady state value in 2 4 weeks while 226ra takes up to a year or more to reach steady state for the base case k dp i 1 parameterisation interestingly 234u and 230th each appear to reach their steady state levels relatively quickly 1 10 days while 210pb takes at least 50 y or more the main difference between the base case and variant case is the much lower steady state activity predicted for 226ra and 230th and consequently faster approach to steady state in the variant case the characteristic time to approach steady state for 210pb seems largely unaffected by the choice of k dp i 1 values for its predecessor nuclides 3 2 steady state model example single layer rock matrix in this example we compare the steady state solution obtained in the present study against the model developed by neretnieks 2013 in which the rock matrix is assumed to be comprised of a homogeneous layer of infinite extent considering a single decaying nuclide 226ra and 222rn calculated separately like the previous transient example the flowpath is assumed to be a groundwater recharge path with zero concentration inflow i e c f i 0 t 0 in this example we consider the stepwise impact of including additional decay chain members to demonstrate how this affects the calculated accumulation of 226ra and 222rn in the fracture water as a function of groundwater age for a given recoil capture fraction η p 1 to simplify the discussion only production of nuclides in the rock matrix is considered and any source term associated with fracture minerals or retardation due to sorption on external fracture surfaces is neglected i e g i 0 and r f i 1 the following cases with stepwise increasing complexity are calculated 1 222rn only primary production of 222rn without additional consideration of prior decay chain members 2 226ra 222rn primary production of both nuclides plus ingrowth of 222rn from porewater decay 3 230th 226ra 222rn primary production of all three nuclides plus porewater ingrowth of descendants 4 234u 230th 226ra 222rn primary production of all four nuclides plus porewater ingrowth of descendants 5 238u 234u 230th 226ra 222rn primary production of nuclides subsequent to 238u plus porewater ingrowth of descendants pre existing 238u mineral in the porespace dissolves to give a constant equilibrium concentration of 238u to study the effect of having a constant background concentration of dissolved u it is assumed in case study 5 that the 238u does not recoil but dissolves from the solid phase to maintain a hypothetically constant equilibrium concentration thereby exactly balancing the amount lost by decay in the aqueous phase in other words the dissolution rate of 238u would be equal to its loss by decay i e r p u 238 1 c p u 238 eq λ u 238 where the background concentration of 238u c p u 238 eq mol m3 is presumed to be held constant by an unspecified solubility controlling mineral to maintain internal consistency the same recoil production rate of each nuclide given in table 1 is used throughout the present calculations even in the cases where only a shortened subset of nuclides is considered in the transport calculations the material property parameters are the same as those previously assumed for the transient model base case using k dp i 1 values also given in table 1 the background level of dissolved 238u in groundwater varies significantly at the forsmark site from as little as 0 2 mbq l 6 8 10 11 mol l to as much as 1940 mbq l 6 6 10 7 mol l in the present demonstration calculation the background concentration in the matrix porewater is assumed to be 10 8 mol l which is about half the median of the site specific measurement data the results of the calculations are shown in fig 5 for 226ra and fig 6 for 222rn given in terms of specific dissolved activities bq l for cases 1 4 the steady state activity reaches a plateau after a few tens of years advective travel time for the modelled transport parameters the ratio of specific activities for dissolved 226ra and 222rn are shown in fig 7 it is interesting to note that the inclusion of additional members of the decay chain results in higher equilibrium concentrations of 226ra and 222rn due to ingrowth from previously mobilised precursor nuclides in the porewater the inclusion of the full decay chain although excluding the impact of dissolved 238u case 4 gives an approximately 4 5 times increase in specific activity at long times for 222rn relative to the case of rn release only case 1 thereby suggesting a relatively important role of porewater ingrowth relative to primary emanation of 222rn by α recoil although not shown in the figures the steady state specific activity of 226ra at long transport times is relatively insensitive to transport aperture whereas 222rn exhibits a strong sensitivity this is expected based on the single component analysis in section 2 3 see eq 43 it is interesting to note that a background 238u concentration of 10 8 mol l gives a slight increase in the steady state fracture concentrations of descendant nuclides for long advective travel times the assumed background concentration together with its equilibrium sorbed fraction is equivalent to roughly 0 13 mg kg rock which is roughly 32 times less than the bulk u content of the rock assumed in the calculations reducing the background concentration by an order of magnitude to 10 9 mol l very nearly erases the imprint of mobile 238u decay on the steady state concentrations rendering calculation cases 4 and 5 indistinguishable 3 3 transient model example three layer rock matrix in this example we make a demonstration of a 3 layer calculation case where the porosity effective diffusivity and sorptivity of the rock is assumed to increase in the proximity of the fracture surface although the details of this are less important for a demonstration calculation an increase in retardation potential near the fracture surface is deemed likely in site specific rock in the forsmark investigation area due to a combination of stress release and earlier hydrothermal alteration processes e g crawford and löfgren 2019 to simplify the parameterisation of the 3 layer model we use a sorption enhancement factor f p j to uniformly modify the k dp i j values for the different matrix layers expressed as 44 k dp i j f p j k dp i 0 where k dp i 0 represents a reference sorption coefficient value for radionuclide i in the present case k dp i 0 corresponds to the retardation factor values for the base case and the variant case used in previous examples the additional parameters required for the 3 layer model are given in table 2 and results of the calculation are shown in fig 8 and fig 9 the effect of inclusion of two additional layers with increased retention relative to the single layer case can be seen by comparison of fig 8 and fig 9 with fig 3 and fig 4 respectively although the 3 layer case considers only a 1 m maximum penetration depth as compared to 12 5 m for the single layer case the matrix depth may be considered effectively unlimited for all chain radionuclides subsequent to 238u the altered layers 1 and 2 play an important role decreasing the concentration of sorbing radionuclides at the channel outlet which shortens the time required to re establish equilibrium which is consistent with the findings from previous studies mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 2014 the increased retention of sorbing radionuclides in the altered layers results in an increased production of 222rn in the immediate vicinity of the fracture surface which is reflected in the breakthrough curves 3 4 steady state model example three layer rock matrix in this example the five case studies from the steady state example in section 3 2 for a single layer are extended to the 3 layer rock matrix representation based on the parameterisation given in table 2 assuming the base case retardation factor values from table 1 the 3 layer model with uniformly enhanced sorption diffusion properties in the two surface layers nearest the fracture surface gives a lower steady state 226ra activity although higher 222rn activity as might be expected due to the higher storage of ra near the fracture surface in the 3 layer case for groundwater of age greater than a few tens of years the 222rn 226ra activity ratio stabilises to a value that is about an order of magnitude higher than the single layer case assuming the base case parameterisation the results are shown in figs 10 12 3 5 monte carlo steady state calculation example single layer rock matrix in a previous work by crawford 2010 the simplified steady state model described in neretnieks 2013 was adapted for use in a regular monte carlo calculation where calculated 222ra 226ra ratios were compared with groundwater measurement data from the forsmark site investigation area the purpose of this was to assess whether the range of sorption coefficient values for ra recommended for use in the sr site safety assessment skb 2011 could be considered consistent with the measured natural analogue groundwater activities this cannot however be considered a validation in the customary sense owing to the multidimensional nature of this problem comprising many uncertain parameters that also vary stochastically in space the best estimate probability distribution for ra sorption coefficient that is consistent with the measurement data is therefore conditional on correctly represented uncertainty distributions for other parameters comprising the model it is also dependent on the appropriateness of the model for accurately simulating the coupled transport and retardation processes which is not possible to assess from groundwater measurement data alone in the calculation example presented in this section the monte carlo calculation is updated with more recent data for supporting parameters as well as the updated transport model assuming a single layer rock matrix for this calculation several assumptions need to be made concerning the uncertainty distributions of key variables and parameters the stochastic data are given in table 3 and are broadly similar to those used in the previous work by crawford 2010 apart from the updated transport model the main difference is that fracture mineral processes are more accurately accounted for in the present work based on some recent data described in crawford and löfgren 2019 where fracture mineral abundances are quantified furthermore a lognormal distribution for transport aperture is proposed in the present work whereas previously a uniform uncertainty distribution was assumed for this parameter in this work the uncertainty distribution of the sorption coefficient for ra is also adjusted upwards relative to the more conservative range previously recommended for use in the sr site safety assessment crawford 2010 skb 2011 the results of the steady state monte carlo calculation are shown in fig 13 assuming relatively old groundwater t w 100 y and neglecting any background concentration of 238u the 222rn 226ra ratio corresponding to the best estimate parameter combination is shown as a red orange circular marker while the underlying grey shaded cloud shows the bivariate probability distribution derived from the monte carlo calculation the impact of altering the sorption coefficient value for ra is indicated by the red curve where all other parameters are held constant increasing the sorption coefficient value drags the locus of the best estimate horizontally to the left in the figure while decreasing the sorption coefficient value moves the best estimate to the right the central sorption coefficient estimate of 0 01 m3 kg in the present calculation clearly is more consistent with the measurement data blue markers than the previous best estimate of 2 42 10 4 m3 kg which was recommended for use in sr site indicated by the red orange triangular marker the corresponding impacts of the most influential stochastic parameters are illustrated in fig 13 by different coloured trend lines passing through the central estimate see the inset key on right hand side of the figure for explanations as can be seen from the figure varying the sorption coefficient value for ra has a strong impact on 226ra activity although seemingly little effect on the 222rn activity level on the other hand alteration of the transport aperture has a strong proportional impact on the 222rn activity although almost no impact on the 226ra activity as was already anticipated by eq 43 the recoil capture fraction and matrix abundance of u have a very similar proportional impact on the 222rn 226ra activity as might be expected on the basis of eq 43 groundwater age advective travel time 100 y and increased fracture retardation have a non linear retrograde impact on the locus of 222rn 226ra activities although with a stronger impact on 226ra than 222rn increasing the abundance of u in fracture coating minerals m c u has a similar impact to alteration of matrix u abundance m p u 1 and η p 1 although appearing to follow a distinctly separate trendline in the present calculations the use of the updated model has very little overall impact on the results and the predicted ranges of 222rn and 226ra are very similar to those calculated using the simplified single radionuclide representation based on the model by neretnieks 2013 in this context the stochastic variation of the m p u 1 and η p 1 variables in the monte carlo calculation overwhelms any differences that can be reasonably attributed to the differing complexity of the underlying transport model the revised best estimate rock matrix sorption coefficient value and its associated uncertainty range for ra in the present work relative to the previous recommendation in crawford 2010 is largely due to the more accurate quantification of fracture retardation processes i e equilibrium sorption on fracture coatings in the present work 4 concluding remarks in this paper a mathematical model has been developed that can simulate simultaneous transport of anthropogenic and naturally occurring radionuclides in fractured rocks the model accounts for advective flow molecular diffusion and surface sorption of an arbitrary length decay chain in a single flow bearing fracture bounded by a geologically heterogeneous rock matrix comprised of an arbitrary number of layers featuring piecewise constant material properties radionuclides can diffuse within the connected porosity of the rock matrix and sorb on the large internal surface area of the rock consisting of mineral grain boundaries and microfractures the model is an extension of the work by mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 which only considers radionuclide release as a boundary condition at the flow channel inlet the main improvement is an additional account of the production and transport of naturally occurring radionuclides in both the flow channel and the rock matrix in fractured crystalline rocks an analytical solution is derived in the laplace domain for the radionuclide concentrations in the rock matrix layers and at the channel outlet while the laplace domain analytical solution is transformed numerically back to the time domain for the transient solution the corresponding steady state can be obtained directly using the final value theorem applied to the transient solution without requiring numerical inversion to the author s best knowledge the developed model is novel and includes a more detailed account of natural radionuclide production and migration processes than existing models described in the literature the transport processes and conditions considered in this work are realistic for modelling of radionuclide transport from repositories for radioactive waste to the biosphere which is crucial for safety and performance assessment of deep geological repositories hosted in fractured crystalline rocks the present modelling is also of considerable interest for interpretation of natural occurrences of radionuclides including although not limited to radium and radon in groundwater the obtained analytical solution can be used to compare relative fluxes of natural and anthropogenic radionuclides which is useful for verifying radionuclide transport calculations and corroboration of transport parameters obtained from independent field and laboratory experiments the derived model can be applied to streamtube flow channel or discrete fracture network model representations of transport in fractured rock and makes it possible to perform comparative safety assessment calculations including natural background fluxes of radionuclides using identical modelling assumptions both the steady state and transient versions of the solution are useful for interpreting tracer tests and ground water monitoring data and might also find application in improving understanding of paleo disturbances in the distribution of natural analogue radionuclides in groundwater systems and timescales associated with return to steady state conditions the model and its frequency domain analytical solution can be readily extended to include stagnant water zones on the fracture plane mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 and asymmetric matrix material properties on opposite flanking sides of flow bearing channels in addition the developed model can be applied to describe the nuclide transport in complex channel networks for rectangular or circular channels mahmoudzadeh et al 2016 with varying flow rates the presented mathematical modelling procedure could be of interest in other areas such as geological storage of carbon dioxide or geothermal heat extraction from hot dry rock where monitoring and interpretation of natural radionuclide tracer concentrations could prove useful the utility of the model has been demonstrated by five separate hypothetical calculation examples these are 1 a transient calculation example for a single layer rock matrix 2 a steady state calculation example for a single layer rock

226ra activities with stochastically varied model parameters for a single layer rock matrix in example 2 the steady state model was also corroborated against the simplified steady state model by neretnieks 2013 where transport of single naturally occurring radionuclides are modelled in the simplified model the transport of 226ra and 222rn is considered separately in a single layer homogeneous rock matrix of infinite extent without explicit consideration of porewater ingrowth the results of the steady state simulations suggest that previous modelling based on the consideration of production of a single radionuclide e g 222rn might underestimate radionuclide fluxes by not considering ingrowth contributions from the full decay chain in the porewater this however must also be set in the context of how the porewater recoil capture fraction has been defined and its relation to empirical estimates of radionuclide emanation based on measurements using crushed materials or tablets the work also points to the possibility that additional attenuation mechanisms relating to recoil capture of radionuclides undergoing α decay in porewater and secondary emanation processes from superficially implanted radionuclides in rock matrix minerals might need to be considered in more detail to represent natural radionuclide transport processes more accurately in the modelling examples a constant background concentration of 10 8 mol l 238u is assumed as an additional source term for radionuclides in the porewater here it is implicitly assumed that the 238u concentration is constantly replenished by mineral dissolution at a rate matching its decay in the porewater it is relatively straightforward to show that the molar concentrations of descendant radionuclides produced by the decay of the background 238u and by α recoil processes in the model are generally much lower than reasonable solubilities of the descendant radionuclides the modelled porewater concentrations of 234th in the calculation cases for example are at least 3 6 orders of magnitude less than typical solubilities of th in natural groundwater duro et al 2006 grivé et al 2010 depending on the kd value used to describe sorption since the predicted porewater concentrations of th are low this leaves open the possibility that dissolution of pre existing th containing mineral phases might contribute to a greater 226ra production than that predicted by the model this should be relatively easy to address by modification of the source term definition for 226ra although we leave this for future work the steady state concentration depends on the abundance and distribution of u and th in rock and fracture minerals advective travel time fracture transport aperture diffusive sorptive properties of the possibly altered rock matrix and the porewater recoil capture fraction of these the recoil capture fraction is thought to be the most uncertain parameter for transport modelling and

1189,this article focuses on modeling 90sr migration in strong nitrate solutions in aquifers used for radioactive waste disposal this type of radioactive waste disposal is typical only for the russian federation and is a unique object of study the calculations are based on the laboratory study of strontium sorption in nitrate solutions on sandy loamy and clayey rocks under biotic with natural microbial communities obtained from seversky repository and abiotic conditions to obtain a strontium sorption model first an ion exchange model in phreeqc software is fitted to the experimental data both manually and automatically using mouse software since real nitrate ion concentrations at radioactive waste injection sites can reach values of hundreds of grams per liter strontium kd values are predicted for high ionic strength for which no experimental study of strontium sorption efficiency has been carried out with phreeqc model the strontium transport models accounting for sorption and the nitrate reduction processes have been developed using two numerical software packages the gera 3d hydrogeological simulation code and the phreeqc reactive transport code reactive transport modeling under different conditions shows a high sensitivity to dispersion a significant effect of sorption of nitrate ion on sr sorption is shown and a relatively small contribution of microbial processes to strontium transport is noted for liquid radioactive waste injection sites graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords strontium nitrate and denitrification complexation ion exchange sorption modeling geochemical modeling data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the practice of liquid radioactive waste lrw injection in deep stagnant aquifers in russia dates back to 1963 rybal chenko et al 1998 at present radiochemical plants at the siberian chemical combine scc and mining and chemical combine mcc in siberia use deep aquifers at depths of 200 400 m isolated by confining layer to isolate highly saline liquid radioactive waste lrw the geological conditions of radioactive waste injection sites must ensure long term safety groundwater flow rates at such sites are usually low and do not exceed tens of meters per year safety assessment and safe operation of existing lrw repositories requires multifactor modeling of geochemical processes in the repository itself and in the neighboring area multifactor complex modeling of radionuclide migration requires the creation of new approaches taking into account the existing knowledge the sorption by mineral phases is generally the main process affecting the dynamics of migration of radioactive and other contaminants in geological media classic data driven migration models of the distribution coefficients kd reported in the literature for the radionuclides and rocks similar in mineral composition face a number of problems because kd can differ by orders of magnitude krupka et al 1999 thibault et al 1990 the development of adequate subsurface transport models requires the use of kd values that are obtained in the series of sorption experiments using solution composition specific for the particular site and rock samples obtained from the site itself or from the sites analogs with similar properties which is not always the case another problem in the scope of obtaining credible models is the lack of data for accurate model parametrization in addition to adsorption the contaminant transport can be influenced indirectly by the content of nitrate sulfate carbonate and acetate anionic macro components of the waste their concentrations are 3 9 orders of magnitude higher than metal concentrations the kd values may vary due to newly formed metal complexes with macro components and other processes meanwhile the behavior of macro components the main lrw macro component is nitrate ion whose concentration can vary from a few grams to 200 300 g per liter in contaminated subsurface aquifers depends on a number of parameters including microbial processes francis 1984 senko et al 2005 safonov et al 2022 yang et al 2007 jolley et al 2003 it has been found that due to the metabolic activity of the microflora nitrate and sulfate ions can be reduced to gaseous or low soluble compounds and low valent forms of a number of metals with variable oxidation degrees can be immobilized one of the major components of radioactive waste is 90sr it is one of the products of uranium fission it contributes a large part of waste activity for up to several hundred years and is highly radiotoxic in drinking water as it can substitute calcium in bone tissue therefore 90sr transport modeling is important for predicting long term safety during the operation and post closure periods of radioactive waste rw storage facilities it is known that the sr sorption by natural minerals is sensitive to the ion exchange the ionic strength of the solution krupka et al 1999 sr dominates over most alkaline and alkaline earth metals competing at the same time for the exchange positions sr 2 ca 2 mg 2 k nh4 na thibault et al 1990 high nitrate background is an important contributing factor for strontium migration under conditions specific to liquid radioactive waste disposal previously we assumed that the ionic strength of the aquifer waters attributed to the high concentrations of nitrate ions produces an essential effect on sr sorption by the rocks boldyrev et al 2016 sr 2 sorption reaction was augmented by its nitrate complex srno3 sorption it should be pointed out that the nitrate itself is usually assumed to have low sorption meisinger and randall 1991 birkinshaw and ewen 2000 shamrukh et al 2001 and a unit retardation factor hantush and mariño 2001 a series of articles abdelwaheb et al 2019 cahn et al 1992 black and waring 1979 sigg and stumm 1981 provide data on the sorption of nitrate on rocks and soils containing poorly crystallized oxide or hydroxide materials stumm et al 1992 katou et al 1996 the mechanism of no3 sorption is attributed to coulombic attraction of no3 and positively charged sites on clay minerals and protonated hydroxyl groups of aluminum and iron oxyhydroxides ottinger 2013 hahn et al 1942 singh and kanehiro 1969 at the same time sorption of nitrate ion derivative in soil is commonly observed fitzhugh et al 2003 davidson et al 2003 where it is assumed that nitrite reacts with the aromatic ring structures of dissolved organic matter to produce dissolved organic nitrogen compounds thus the mechanisms of nitrate ion sorption are presented in the literature in a very fragmentary and contradictory manner in addition to sorption the concentration of the nitrate ion in the system can be significantly affected by microbiological denitrification ashok and hait 2015 rivett et al 2008 which can be intensified under reservoir conditions by nitrate ingress in our previous works the output of the microbiological monitoring of the severny kosareva et al 2007 and the seversky nazina et al 2010a repositories has shown an active microbial community capable of reducing nitrate ions to molecular nitrogen genera thauera acidovorax hydrogenophaga pseudomonas and bacteria of iron and sulfur cycles were detected in water samples by 16s rrna gene analysis among the group of sulfur cycle organisms bacteria of the families desulfobacteriaceae and of the genera sulfuritalea and desulfovibrio were found various denitrifying bacteria in the reservoir zones with the different nitrate ion content was analyzed nazina et al 2010b safonov et al 2011 it was found that the zone with higher nitrate ion concentrations had the highest number of cells in comparison to distant background parts of the reservoir 350 1000 m away furthermore the microbial processes may affect the sr immobilization in aquifers due to biofilm formation safonov et al 2019a co precipitation with the biogenic minerals safonov et al 2022 safonov et al 2021 such as calcite or dolomite curti 1997 hodkin et al 2016 it is well known that nitrate reduction can cause alkalization due to the hco3 and oh ions formation and in this case sr sorption will be accompanied by solid solution formation safonov et al 2019b mitchell and ferris 2005 such alkalization and possible supersaturation with regard to carbonate mineral phases srco3 or caco3 and their solid solution in which radiostrontium can be precipitated fujita et al 2004 hence for a multifactorial model of strontium transport it is probably necessary to consider issues of sr2 sorption strontium nitrate complexes and the role of microbial factors under the conditions of injection of highly concentrated liquid radioactive waste based on sodium nitrate 2 materials and methods samples of loam l and sandy rocks s taken from the deep aquifer 385 m on the territory of liquid radioactive waste storage the seversky of the siberian chemical combine were used in the laboratory research work the clay sample с was taken from the kornilovskoe clay deposit located in the tomsk region the elemental and mineral composition of the samples is presented in table 1 the clay samples contained an equal mixture of kaolinite and montmorillonite 20 wt the loam samples contained 70 quartz and an equal mixture of kaolinite montmorillonite and illite 10 wt the sandy sample also contained clayey minerals kaolinite montmorillonite illite in equal proportions 1 3 wt the cec of native rocks was 2 16 mg eq per 100 g 2 mg eq for sandy rock s 13 7

radioactive waste dispersion and has technogenic no3 pollution up to 1760 mg l 2 1 the mineral composition the mineral composition of the samples was determined on a panalytical aeris powder x ray diffractometer at the shared use center institute of physical chemistry and electrochemistry russian academy of sciences using a cu kα anode at 40 kv and 15 ma the analysis was carried out in the 3 75 range on the 2θ scale with a step of 0 02 2 2 concentrations of the major and extrinsic elements concentrations of the major and extrinsic elements in the samples were determined by x ray spectral fluorescence analysis on axios max advanced sequential vacuum spectrometer with dispersion by the wavelength panalytical the netherlands standard samples from the us geological survey usgs were used as the controls the ion concentrations were measured on a capel 205 new generation capillary electrophoresis system identification and quantitation of the analyzed cations and anions were performed by indirect detection by measuring uv absorption at 254 nm electrophoresis was performed in untreated fused silica capillaries of 60 cm length effective length 50 cm and 75 μm internal diameter the capillar was held at 20 c and the applied voltage was 13 kv for cations or 17 kv for anions 2 3 kinetics of no3 microbiological consumption laboratory modeling of denitrification was carried out for a month at a temperature of 20 22 c by adding the formation fluid of the subsurface aquifer to the selected samples of nitrate and molecular hydrogen into the gas phase ph and eh values were determined using an anion ionomer novosibirsk russia with appropriate electrodes molecular nitrogen was analyzed by gas chromatography 2 4 sorption experiments sorption experiments were performed before and after the nitrate reduction process described above after nitrate reduction the rock samples were used in a wet state to preserve the biogenic mineral phases the dry matter was weighed after the end of the experiment nitrate sorption was performed in the batch mode in polyethylene vials at the rock solution ratio of 1 g 10 ml with intermittent stirring the initial nano3 concentration varied from 0 00 to 0 58 m ph 5 6 5 7 the no3 concentration was measured on a capel 205 new generation capillary electrophoresis system 2 5 strontium sorption 90sr sorption experiments on the geological samples before and after bioreduction were performed in batch mode in polyethylene vials at the rock to nitrate solution ratio of 1 g 10 ml with intermittent stirring an initial concentration of 90sr was 3 3 10 10 m 1 the 90sr activity in the initial solution after the 1 day contact and after the interaction completion was determined the 90sr activity was measured with a liquid scintillation analyzer tri carb 3180 sl spectrometric complex perkin elmer the distribution coefficient for no3 and 90sr was determined according to the formula kd a0 ap ap vp m c cm 3 g where a0 and ap are the initial and equilibrium activities of 90sr bq ml or no3 concentrations m 1 vp the volume of the liquid phase ml mc the mass of the rock g the cation exchange capacity cec of the rock sample was determined from sumner and miller 1996 as the sum of sodium potassium calcium and magnesium exchange ions 2 6 sorption modeling classical one site cation exchange equations do not accurately describe modeling data over a wide range of concentrations so we used the model assumption of the existence of strontium selective and non selective ion exchange sorption sites the ion exchange model traditionally used in modeling strontium sorption uses one type of sorption centers but the application of this approach to the systems under study did not lead to satisfactory results the use of sorption models with differentiated affinity to sorption has been widely applied to different materials for example iron hydroxides on which sorption sites on the planar surfaces and edges differ in different energy and consequently in different sorption affinity dzombak and morel 1991 another example of such systems with differentiated sorption affinity are the illite minerals on which the sorption of cesium is described by three different cation exchange sorption sites edge planar and frayed sites of clay particles bradbury and baeyens 2000 due to the scarce amounts of material we could not create more extensive experiments to find out more complete mechanisms of strontium fixation by these rocks for this reason we had to use such a simplified approach in our case we tried to apply this approach with different sorption affinity to describe sorption on the rocks under study sand loam and clay these rocks mainly differ in different content of clay particles the aim was the creation of a universal ion exchange sorption model suitable for describing the sorption of strontium by these rocks in highly concentrated nitrate solutions and then to assess the effect of nitrate reduction on strontium migration since nitrate ion concentrations in radioactive waste injection sites can reach values of hundreds of g l strontium kd values were predicted for high ionic strengths for which no experimental study of strontium sorption efficiency was carried out sit model specific ion interaction theory was used for the sr kd calculations for high ionic strengths of the solution the same ratio of selective and non selective strontium sites 25 12 of selective sites and 74 88 of noneselective sites was used for the manually calibrated model the ion exchange model was used for the description of sorption processes the model was developed on the assumption that ion sorption occurs at sr selective 25 12 of the total number and sr non selective ion exchange sites the llnl dat and sit dat databases of phreeqc v 2 18 were used for the model implementation the reactions included in the model are provided in table 2 llnl dat a database file derived from databases for eq3 6 and geochemist s workbench that uses thermodynamic data compiled by the lawrence livermore national laboratory sit dat a database implementing the specific ion interaction theory sit as described by grenthe and others grenthe and puigdomenech 1997 the formation of carbon species in an oxidation state other than 4 was excluded the calculated value of the saturation index si of calcite is 0 24 si

2 7 approach with automated parameter calibration the fitting of the model to the experimental data by adjusting the parameters represents a typical problem of mathematical optimization a search for the extremum of a function on a given domain in this case the objective function being minimized is a discrepancy between the model and the experiment it could be defined as the squared distance between experimental and simulation values f x k 1 n y exp k y mod k x where x is a vector of parameters y exp k is the kth experimental point y mod k is the corresponding modeling result obtained using x and n is the number of experimental points for the last few decades the best practice in solving complex optimization problems is to use heuristic algorithms the basic idea of heuristic methods is to reproduce the idealized quasi stochastic behavior of natural systems and communities for the purposes of mathematical optimization one of the well proven and widely used heuristic algorithms is particle swarm optimization pso shi and eberhart 1998 which emulates the swarm behavior of a bird flock searching for food it has a lot of versions and modifications and in this study we used its particular variant the inertia weight modification mpso linge et al 2020 implemented in mouse numerical code http en ibrae ac ru contents mouse the efficiency of the algorithm vastly depends on the balance of the local and global search which is controlled by values of the algorithm s hyperparameters in our study we used the following settings the cognitive and social factors equal to 2 05 as recommended in clerc and kennedy 2002 the swarm size equal 15 and the inertia factor equal 0 4 adjusted during numerical experiments to balance the local and the global search components for this particular problem the limit of 900 model runs was set on the basis of computational cost considerations 2 8 multidimensional reactive transport modeling three dimensional reactive transport in fact 2d augmented by z coordinate was simulated using the gera software kapyrin et al 2018 vassilevski et al 2020 gera is a general purpose 3d hydrogeological modeling software featuring unstructured grids and finite volume discretization schemes at present it has the abilities of simulating flow in variable saturation conditions including two phase flow temperature and density driven convection various transport processes including radioactive decay chains and dual porosity effects surface runoff novikov and kapyrin 2020 reactive transport modeling in gera may be performed using coupling with the phreeqcrm reaction module parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 grenthe and puigdomenech 1997 in this work we used the transport model with linear sorption governed by the henry isotherm but with the option to use variable distribution coefficient boldyrev et al 2016 3 results and discussions 3 1 nitrate sorption experimental data experimentally determined sorption parameters of nitrate ion on three types of rocks in distilled water are shown in fig 1 it was found that for all samples sorption reached equilibrium already on the first day of the experiment the maximum nitrate ion sorption was observed on the loam and the minimum on sandy rock the sorption of nitrate ion almost did not increase after 7 days compared to the first day after 8 days there was a drop in sorption of nitrate ion which can be explained by biogenic processes in particular microbial denitrification initially the experiment was carried out without adding electron donors but some iron and organic matter in the rock itself could lead to the development of microbial processes the observed effect of nitrate ion sorption reduction found on the 24th day of the experiment was unexpected requiring further careful study although the correlation between the kd no3 parameters and the cec values of the sample was established experimentally see fig 1 the migration model was developed under the assumption that the nitrate is sorbed only by the mechanism of complexation with alkaline earth metal ions the sorption of nitrate ion undoubtedly exists especially since the article clay et al 2004 states that bromide leached faster through the columns than no3 with due regard to any and all chemical interactions in the transport model the deceleration behavior of not only sr but also no3 and na is manifested at first glance the unexpected slowdown of the nitrate ion is due to the formation of its calcium and magnesium complexes and hence the sorption of these complexes moreover when no3 in the displacing water comes in contact with the sorbed species of divalent metals cax2 and mgx2 new ion exchange sites free for na sorption are thus formed no 3 ca mg x 2 cano 3 x x with increasing cation exchange capacity cec of the sample the increase in strontium sorption efficiency was observed clay loam has a higher strontium sorption efficiency than the clay and sandstone samples tested high mineralization of the solution impedes the sorption of strontium due to the competition of sodium with strontium ions also with increasing nitrate ion content strontium is in complex form even though the sorption of strontium is observed in the form of free ion sr 2 and in the nitrate complex srno3 an increase of the mineralization leads to a shift of strontium forms towards the complexes with higher content of nitrate ion sr no3 2 and sr no3 3 3 2 strontium sorption modeling the final parameterizations of the phreeqc based sr sorption model calibrated manually and using the algorithm mpso are both presented in table 2 the respective parameter selection process for exchange constant was carried out manually or using the mouse code the constant of formation of sr no3 3 is taken from our previous work black and waring 1979 figure 2 shows the change in the experimental and simulated kd sr values for the sr sorption on sandy clay rocks under conditions of increased salinity as the salinity of the solution increased the sorption efficiency on all rocks dropped dramatically there is a strong correlation between the experimental and calculated kd values for different nano3 concentrations in a solution for both the manual sorption parameter calibration approach and the automated sorption parameter calibration approach figure 3 shows the model curves for the dependence of kd on nitrate ion concentration within the simulation using the sit dat thermodynamic database developed for high ionic forces these data were further used in 3d modeling of sr transport in the gera software the difference in the numbers of sites none selective to the sorption of strontium is explained by the greater sorption of strontium on clay particles the proportion of which is higher in loams and clays the results of the experimental evaluation of strontium sorption on real rock samples after microbial nitrate reduction are shown in table 3 slight increase of strontium sorption after the nitrate reduction process can be connected with the absorption of strontium in the process of carbon mineralization for example in the form of co precipitation with calcite thus it is experimentally established that nitrate reduction leads to an increase of sr kd in laboratory experiments strontium sorption equilibrium before and after nitrate reduction is established quickly in 2 h which correlates with the results of mohsenipour et al 2015 sieczka et al 2018 frind et al 1990 hamdi et al 2013 the obtained results of increasing the sorption of strontium under conditions of nitrate reduction correspond to the results of the article thorpe et al 2012 in which the authors observed a similar effect bioreduction of nitrate caused reduced sr2 solubility due to an increase in ph during bioreduction and denitrification the increase of sr reduction in solution is explained by its co precipitation with biogenic carbonates so it is also clear that denitrification has a strong potential to impact sr transport in the subsurface and that understanding the nitrate reduction on behavior of redox inactive pollutants can be of high significance for the safety assessment of the nuclear waste isolation facilities and legacy sites 3 3 model of nitrate reduction microbial reduction of nitrate can influence strontium sorption in different ways decreasing competition on the one hand and increasing it on the other due to a combination of biosorption bioaccumulation and biomineralization formation of co2 calcite safonov et al 2021 in addition strontium sorption can also be affected by the alkalinity that accompanies nitrate reduction if the buffer capacity of the formation is not sufficient no 3 0 62 5ch 3 coo 1 62 5h 1 25 co 2 1 75 h 2 o ½ n 2 2no 3 5h 2 2h n 2 6h 2 о the intensity of microbial nitrate reduction is primarily limited by the concentration of nitrite as the product of its reduction at the first stage is the toxic nitrite ion according to the work linge et al 2020 the half life time of nitrate is 3 7 years and according to the paper http en ibrae ac ru contents mouse the half life time of nitrate is in the range of 1 2 3 years therefore to assess the effect of nitrate reduction on strontium transport in the subsurface the effect of nitrate concentration on this process was studied under laboratory conditions using the sample of the community obtained from the severny repository of the mining chemical combine krasnoyarsk region russia experimental data of n2 production during nitrate biodegradation are presented in fig 4 microorganisms inhabiting the severny repository are capable to live in solutions with nitrate ions concentration up to 8 g l i e on the waste dispersion tail and in the low activity radioactive waste repository area while the denitrification rate will be suppressed as nitrate ion concentration increases over 3 g l the data obtained were used as parameters for calculations the extrapolated rate of nitrate reduction is represented by this equation rate moln2 days 46 143 c no3 4 15 178 c no3 3 1 8703 c no3 2 0 0865 c no3 the constraints of biodegradation included in the model are the following if c no3 0 then rate 0 if c no3 0 125 then rate 0 3 4 sr transport in the model column using the phreeqc software for the calculation 4 cases were considered without nitrate reduction with nitrate reduction accompanied by an increase in ph with nitrate reduction accompanied by an increase in carbon dioxide and lastly with the formation of calcite as a product of nitrate reduction model distributions of strontium in the column under different conditions are studied simulations in phreeqc v 2 18 at c no3 0 05 and 0 15 m 1 at the end of 1 year simulation period 1 pore volume the flow velocity is 10 m a 1 are shown in fig 5 θ dispersivity as a result of the modeling it was found that under the column transport conditions the contribution of nitrate reduction and organic matter decomposition processes both with and without calcite formation is rather small since nitrate reduction limited by high nitrate concentrations is observed ahead of the strontium movement front at the nitrate ion front which in its turn is ahead of the strontium movement front the coprecipitation of strontium with calcite was excluded from the calculations the strontium transport front is only delayed and calcite is formed ahead of the strontium propagation front the calculations of nitrate reductions with calcite formation at an initial nitrate ion concentration with no biocidal activity have also been carried out at 2 different values of dispersivity and the results are shown in fig 6 flow velocity is 10 m a 1 it can be seen that due to the fact that nitrate reduction occurs at the dispersion front which precedes the strontium front the influence of nitrate reduction on strontium transport is small the composition of the injected solution is as follows t 25 celsius ph 7 na 0 05

concentration in the solution and the nitrate reduction process on the dynamics of 90sr propagation in different rocks the solution injection and further migration of the contamination halo in a 50 m thick homogeneous formation is simulated three types of rocks composing this layer are considered clay loam and sand in an unperturbed state with no injection a uniform regional groundwater flow exists in the reservoirs at velocities of 1 10 and 100 m year respectively for the clay loam and sand the model is implemented in a parallelepiped of 4000x4000x50 m the injection well is located in the center of the coordinates and its filter covers the entire thickness of the aquifer the side model boundaries are chosen to be 2000 m away from the well so that the flow disturbance introduced by injection into the well is negligible at these boundaries on the western and eastern boundaries of the model the dirichlet type boundary conditions fixed pressure are set to provide the required flow rate from left to right while on the northern and southern boundaries neumann type no flow condition is set homogeneous neumann type boundary conditions are set everywhere on the boundary for the transport problem assuming that the boundary is sufficiently far away from the well the initial conditions are stationary flow and zero concentrations of nitrate ion and 90sr the simulation period is 300 years injection into the well lasts for the first 50 years and is stopped afterwards during the injection period the flow rate of the well was 100 m3 day the porosity of 0 2 the longitudinal dispersion of 10 m and a transverse dispersion of 1 m a density of 1400 kg m3 are assumed for all rocks the specific activity of 90sr in the injected solution is 4 64 105 bq l which corresponds to its concentration of 1 10 9 m 1 three series of experiments are carried out reference model of 90sr migration with fixed distribution coefficient kd value see table 3 1 model of 90sr and nitrate ion migration taking into account the effect on rock sorption properties of the presence of dissolved nitrate ion see dependencies in fig 3 in the solution the concentration of nitrate ion in the injected solution is 100 g l the dependence of kd on sodium nitrate content was modeled using the sit model 2 model of 90sr and nitrate ion migration taking into account biodegradation from nitrate ion experimental data and subsequent change in sr distribution coefficient see table 3 for a concentration of 500 mg l the results of the modeling are presented in fig 7 8 the lines on these figures show the contamination halos corresponding to 0 1 1 and 10 reference contaminant level rcl 4 9 bq l for specific activity of 90sr in water in the first series of tests the solution is shown in the 100 100 100 100 square located in the center of the calculation area as the contamination does not move further than 50 m away from the borehole in the second series of tests for clay and loam the solution is shown in the area 150 200 200 200 for sand the region 100 1100 200 200 is chosen most of the contamination is concentrated in these areas the results of the 1st test series are quite consistent with the parameters of the materials the pollution halo has advanced the furthest in sand the least in loam which has the highest values of cation exchange capacity and consequently the distribution coefficient at the same time the influence of regional flow was inferior due to sufficiently high distribution coefficients in all materials over 300 years the halos have not advanced significantly in the direction of the flow comparing the results of calculations of the 1st and 2nd series of tests we can state a substantial increase of contamination halos due to weakening of sorption by the presence of nitrate ion in the solution the most significant advance of 90sr is observed in sand due to high flow rate in the 3rd series of numerical experiments 90sr transport was simulated with a fixed distribution coefficient in each variant in all experiments the 90sr propagation front lagged behind the nitrate ion propagation front i e for the entire time interval considered the 90sr halo was in the area where nitrate reduction had previously occurred and therefore the corresponding kd values could be used see table 3 the resulting 90sr halos are not shown as they are very similar to those in fig 7 as a result of the decrease in the distribution coefficients relative to the 1st series of experiments the 90sr halos slightly increased in size for all three rocks considered 5 conclusion in this work the influence of the biodegradation of nitrate ion and the influence of dispersion on the transport of strontium with groundwater were studied by means of experimental laboratory studies and geochemical transport modeling it has been found that the biodegradation of nitrate ion can significantly affect strontium transport in the case of relatively small nitrate ion concentrations nitrate ion sorption was experimentally observed as predicted further research into the process is required sr transport in the conditions of lrw injection sites where the concentration of nitrate ion is very high is insignificantly affected by nitrate reduction due to highly concentrated solutions the transport model taking into account biodegradation clearly showed the critical influence of dispersion intensity on the simulation results further studies of this process are required based on the experimental and model studies of the sorption of nitrate and sr ions as well as the process of nitrate reduction we may conclude that possible nitrate reduction and other biogenic processes have the potential to impact not only sr but other redox inactive contaminants mobility in aquatic systems also understanding the biogenic behavior of redox inactive radioactive contaminants as well as the boundaries of influence of the corresponding processes can be of significance for the safety assessment of nuclear facilities the results of this work can be used in assessing the safety of lrw injection sites as well as systems with high concentrations of the dissolved nitrate ion the

1189,this article focuses on modeling 90sr migration in strong nitrate solutions in aquifers used for radioactive waste disposal this type of radioactive waste disposal is typical only for the russian federation and is a unique object of study the calculations are based on the laboratory study of strontium sorption in nitrate solutions on sandy loamy and clayey rocks under biotic with natural microbial communities obtained from seversky repository and abiotic conditions to obtain a strontium sorption model first an ion exchange model in phreeqc software is fitted to the experimental data both manually and automatically using mouse software since real nitrate ion concentrations at radioactive waste injection sites can reach values of hundreds of grams per liter strontium kd values are predicted for high ionic strength for which no experimental study of strontium sorption efficiency has been carried out with phreeqc model the strontium transport models accounting for sorption and the nitrate reduction processes have been developed using two numerical software packages the gera 3d hydrogeological simulation code and the phreeqc reactive transport code reactive transport modeling under different conditions shows a high sensitivity to dispersion a significant effect of sorption of nitrate ion on sr sorption is shown and a relatively small contribution of microbial processes to strontium transport is noted for liquid radioactive waste injection sites graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords strontium nitrate and denitrification complexation ion exchange sorption modeling geochemical modeling data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the practice of liquid radioactive waste lrw injection in deep stagnant aquifers in russia dates back to 1963 rybal chenko et al 1998 at present radiochemical plants at the siberian chemical combine scc and mining and chemical combine mcc in siberia use deep aquifers at depths of 200 400 m isolated by confining layer to isolate highly saline liquid radioactive waste lrw the geological conditions of radioactive waste injection sites must ensure long term safety groundwater flow rates at such sites are usually low and do not exceed tens of meters per year safety assessment and safe operation of existing lrw repositories requires multifactor modeling of geochemical processes in the repository itself and in the neighboring area multifactor complex modeling of radionuclide migration requires the creation of new approaches taking into account the existing knowledge the sorption by mineral phases is generally the main process affecting the dynamics of migration of radioactive and other contaminants in geological media classic data driven migration models of the distribution coefficients kd reported in the literature for the radionuclides and rocks similar in mineral composition face a number of problems because kd can differ by orders of magnitude krupka et al 1999 thibault et al 1990 the development of adequate subsurface transport models requires the use of kd values that are obtained in the series of sorption experiments using solution composition specific for the particular site and rock samples obtained from the site itself or from the sites analogs with similar properties which is not always the case another problem in the scope of obtaining credible models is the lack of data for accurate model parametrization in addition to adsorption the contaminant transport can be influenced indirectly by the content of nitrate sulfate carbonate and acetate anionic macro components of the waste their concentrations are 3 9 orders of magnitude higher than metal concentrations the kd values may vary due to newly formed metal complexes with macro components and other processes meanwhile the behavior of macro components the main lrw macro component is nitrate ion whose concentration can vary from a few grams to 200 300 g per liter in contaminated subsurface aquifers depends on a number of parameters including microbial processes francis 1984 senko et al 2005 safonov et al 2022 yang et al 2007 jolley et al 2003 it has been found that due to the metabolic activity of the microflora nitrate and sulfate ions can be reduced to gaseous or low soluble compounds and low valent forms of a number of metals with variable oxidation degrees can be immobilized one of the major components of radioactive waste is 90sr it is one of the products of uranium fission it contributes a large part of waste activity for up to several hundred years and is highly radiotoxic in drinking water as it can substitute calcium in bone tissue therefore 90sr transport modeling is important for predicting long term safety during the operation and post closure periods of radioactive waste rw storage facilities it is known that the sr sorption by natural minerals is sensitive to the ion exchange the ionic strength of the solution krupka et al 1999 sr dominates over most alkaline and alkaline earth metals competing at the same time for the exchange positions sr 2 ca 2 mg 2 k nh4 na thibault et al 1990 high nitrate background is an important contributing factor for strontium migration under conditions specific to liquid radioactive waste disposal previously we assumed that the ionic strength of the aquifer waters attributed to the high concentrations of nitrate ions produces an essential effect on sr sorption by the rocks boldyrev et al 2016 sr 2 sorption reaction was augmented by its nitrate complex srno3 sorption it should be pointed out that the nitrate itself is usually assumed to have low sorption meisinger and randall 1991 birkinshaw and ewen 2000 shamrukh et al 2001 and a unit retardation factor hantush and mariño 2001 a series of articles abdelwaheb et al 2019 cahn et al 1992 black and waring 1979 sigg and stumm 1981 provide data on the sorption of nitrate on rocks and soils containing poorly crystallized oxide or hydroxide materials stumm et al 1992 katou et al 1996 the mechanism of no3 sorption is attributed to coulombic attraction of no3 and positively charged sites on clay minerals and protonated hydroxyl groups of aluminum and iron oxyhydroxides ottinger 2013 hahn et al 1942 singh and kanehiro 1969 at the same time sorption of nitrate ion derivative in soil is commonly observed fitzhugh et al 2003 davidson et al 2003 where it is assumed that nitrite reacts with the aromatic ring structures of dissolved organic matter to produce dissolved organic nitrogen compounds thus the mechanisms of nitrate ion sorption are presented in the literature in a very fragmentary and contradictory manner in addition to sorption the concentration of the nitrate ion in the system can be significantly affected by microbiological denitrification ashok and hait 2015 rivett et al 2008 which can be intensified under reservoir conditions by nitrate ingress in our previous works the output of the microbiological monitoring of the severny kosareva et al 2007 and the seversky nazina et al 2010a repositories has shown an active microbial community capable of reducing nitrate ions to molecular nitrogen genera thauera acidovorax hydrogenophaga pseudomonas and bacteria of iron and sulfur cycles were detected in water samples by 16s rrna gene analysis among the group of sulfur cycle organisms bacteria of the families desulfobacteriaceae and of the genera sulfuritalea and desulfovibrio were found various denitrifying bacteria in the reservoir zones with the different nitrate ion content was analyzed nazina et al 2010b safonov et al 2011 it was found that the zone with higher nitrate ion concentrations had the highest number of cells in comparison to distant background parts of the reservoir 350 1000 m away furthermore the microbial processes may affect the sr immobilization in aquifers due to biofilm formation safonov et al 2019a co precipitation with the biogenic minerals safonov et al 2022 safonov et al 2021 such as calcite or dolomite curti 1997 hodkin et al 2016 it is well known that nitrate reduction can cause alkalization due to the hco3 and oh ions formation and in this case sr sorption will be accompanied by solid solution formation safonov et al 2019b mitchell and ferris 2005 such alkalization and possible supersaturation with regard to carbonate mineral phases srco3 or caco3 and their solid solution in which radiostrontium can be precipitated fujita et al 2004 hence for a multifactorial model of strontium transport it is probably necessary to consider issues of sr2 sorption strontium nitrate complexes and the role of microbial factors under the conditions of injection of highly concentrated liquid radioactive waste based on sodium nitrate 2 materials and methods samples of loam l and sandy rocks s taken from the deep aquifer 385 m on the territory of liquid radioactive waste storage the seversky of the siberian chemical combine were used in the laboratory research work the clay sample с was taken from the kornilovskoe clay deposit located in the tomsk region the elemental and mineral composition of the samples is presented in table 1 the clay samples contained an equal mixture of kaolinite and montmorillonite 20 wt the loam samples contained 70 quartz and an equal mixture of kaolinite montmorillonite and illite 10 wt the sandy sample also contained clayey minerals kaolinite montmorillonite illite in equal proportions 1 3 wt the cec of native rocks was 2 16 mg eq per 100 g 2 mg eq for sandy rock s 13 7

radioactive waste dispersion and has technogenic no3 pollution up to 1760 mg l 2 1 the mineral composition the mineral composition of the samples was determined on a panalytical aeris powder x ray diffractometer at the shared use center institute of physical chemistry and electrochemistry russian academy of sciences using a cu kα anode at 40 kv and 15 ma the analysis was carried out in the 3 75 range on the 2θ scale with a step of 0 02 2 2 concentrations of the major and extrinsic elements concentrations of the major and extrinsic elements in the samples were determined by x ray spectral fluorescence analysis on axios max advanced sequential vacuum spectrometer with dispersion by the wavelength panalytical the netherlands standard samples from the us geological survey usgs were used as the controls the ion concentrations were measured on a capel 205 new generation capillary electrophoresis system identification and quantitation of the analyzed cations and anions were performed by indirect detection by measuring uv absorption at 254 nm electrophoresis was performed in untreated fused silica capillaries of 60 cm length effective length 50 cm and 75 μm internal diameter the capillar was held at 20 c and the applied voltage was 13 kv for cations or 17 kv for anions 2 3 kinetics of no3 microbiological consumption laboratory modeling of denitrification was carried out for a month at a temperature of 20 22 c by adding the formation fluid of the subsurface aquifer to the selected samples of nitrate and molecular hydrogen into the gas phase ph and eh values were determined using an anion ionomer novosibirsk russia with appropriate electrodes molecular nitrogen was analyzed by gas chromatography 2 4 sorption experiments sorption experiments were performed before and after the nitrate reduction process described above after nitrate reduction the rock samples were used in a wet state to preserve the biogenic mineral phases the dry matter was weighed after the end of the experiment nitrate sorption was performed in the batch mode in polyethylene vials at the rock solution ratio of 1 g 10 ml with intermittent stirring the initial nano3 concentration varied from 0 00 to 0 58 m ph 5 6 5 7 the no3 concentration was measured on a capel 205 new generation capillary electrophoresis system 2 5 strontium sorption 90sr sorption experiments on the geological samples before and after bioreduction were performed in batch mode in polyethylene vials at the rock to nitrate solution ratio of 1 g 10 ml with intermittent stirring an initial concentration of 90sr was 3 3 10 10 m 1 the 90sr activity in the initial solution after the 1 day contact and after the interaction completion was determined the 90sr activity was measured with a liquid scintillation analyzer tri carb 3180 sl spectrometric complex perkin elmer the distribution coefficient for no3 and 90sr was determined according to the formula kd a0 ap ap vp m c cm 3 g where a0 and ap are the initial and equilibrium activities of 90sr bq ml or no3 concentrations m 1 vp the volume of the liquid phase ml mc the mass of the rock g the cation exchange capacity cec of the rock sample was determined from sumner and miller 1996 as the sum of sodium potassium calcium and magnesium exchange ions 2 6 sorption modeling classical one site cation exchange equations do not accurately describe modeling data over a wide range of concentrations so we used the model assumption of the existence of strontium selective and non selective ion exchange sorption sites the ion exchange model traditionally used in modeling strontium sorption uses one type of sorption centers but the application of this approach to the systems under study did not lead to satisfactory results the use of sorption models with differentiated affinity to sorption has been widely applied to different materials for example iron hydroxides on which sorption sites on the planar surfaces and edges differ in different energy and consequently in different sorption affinity dzombak and morel 1991 another example of such systems with differentiated sorption affinity are the illite minerals on which the sorption of cesium is described by three different cation exchange sorption sites edge planar and frayed sites of clay particles bradbury and baeyens 2000 due to the scarce amounts of material we could not create more extensive experiments to find out more complete mechanisms of strontium fixation by these rocks for this reason we had to use such a simplified approach in our case we tried to apply this approach with different sorption affinity to describe sorption on the rocks under study sand loam and clay these rocks mainly differ in different content of clay particles the aim was the creation of a universal ion exchange sorption model suitable for describing the sorption of strontium by these rocks in highly concentrated nitrate solutions and then to assess the effect of nitrate reduction on strontium migration since nitrate ion concentrations in radioactive waste injection sites can reach values of hundreds of g l strontium kd values were predicted for high ionic strengths for which no experimental study of strontium sorption efficiency was carried out sit model specific ion interaction theory was used for the sr kd calculations for high ionic strengths of the solution the same ratio of selective and non selective strontium sites 25 12 of selective sites and 74 88 of noneselective sites was used for the manually calibrated model the ion exchange model was used for the description of sorption processes the model was developed on the assumption that ion sorption occurs at sr selective 25 12 of the total number and sr non selective ion exchange sites the llnl dat and sit dat databases of phreeqc v 2 18 were used for the model implementation the reactions included in the model are provided in table 2 llnl dat a database file derived from databases for eq3 6 and geochemist s workbench that uses thermodynamic data compiled by the lawrence livermore national laboratory sit dat a database implementing the specific ion interaction theory sit as described by grenthe and others grenthe and puigdomenech 1997 the formation of carbon species in an oxidation state other than 4 was excluded the calculated value of the saturation index si of calcite is 0 24 si

10 9 m 1 cec 13 7 meq 100 g media porosity is 0 3 two approaches were used in the sr sorption modeling a manual sorption parameter calibration approach and an automated parameter calibration approach 2 7 approach with automated parameter calibration the fitting of the model to the experimental data by adjusting the parameters represents a typical problem of mathematical optimization a search for the extremum of a function on a given domain in this case the objective function being minimized is a discrepancy between the model and the experiment it could be defined as the squared distance between experimental and simulation values f x k 1 n y exp k y mod k x where x is a vector of parameters y exp k is the kth experimental point y mod k is the corresponding modeling result obtained using x and n is the number of experimental points for the last few decades the best practice in solving complex optimization problems is to use heuristic algorithms the basic idea of heuristic methods is to reproduce the idealized quasi stochastic behavior of natural systems and communities for the purposes of mathematical optimization one of the well proven and widely used heuristic algorithms is particle swarm optimization pso shi and eberhart 1998 which emulates the swarm behavior of a bird flock searching for food it has a lot of versions and modifications and in this study we used its particular variant the inertia weight modification mpso linge et al 2020 implemented in mouse numerical code http en ibrae ac ru contents mouse the efficiency of the algorithm vastly depends on the balance of the local and global search which is controlled by values of the algorithm s hyperparameters in our study we used the following settings the cognitive and social factors equal to 2 05 as recommended in clerc and kennedy 2002 the swarm size equal 15 and the inertia factor equal 0 4 adjusted during numerical experiments to balance the local and the global search components for this particular problem the limit of 900 model runs was set on the basis of computational cost considerations 2 8 multidimensional reactive transport modeling three dimensional reactive transport in fact 2d augmented by z coordinate was simulated using the gera software kapyrin et al 2018 vassilevski et al 2020 gera is a general purpose 3d hydrogeological modeling software featuring unstructured grids and finite volume discretization schemes at present it has the abilities of simulating flow in variable saturation conditions including two phase flow temperature and density driven convection various transport processes including radioactive decay chains and dual porosity effects surface runoff novikov and kapyrin 2020 reactive transport modeling in gera may be performed using coupling with the phreeqcrm reaction module parkhurst and wissmeier 2015 grenthe and puigdomenech 1997 in this work we used the transport model with linear sorption governed by the henry isotherm but with the option to use variable distribution coefficient boldyrev et al 2016 3 results and discussions 3 1 nitrate sorption experimental data experimentally determined sorption parameters of nitrate ion on three types of rocks in distilled water are shown in fig 1 it was found that for all samples sorption reached equilibrium already on the first day of the experiment the maximum nitrate ion sorption was observed on the loam and the minimum on sandy rock the sorption of nitrate ion almost did not increase after 7 days compared to the first day after 8 days there was a drop in sorption of nitrate ion which can be explained by biogenic processes in particular microbial denitrification initially the experiment was carried out without adding electron donors but some iron and organic matter in the rock itself could lead to the development of microbial processes the observed effect of nitrate ion sorption reduction found on the 24th day of the experiment was unexpected requiring further careful study although the correlation between the kd no3 parameters and the cec values of the sample was established experimentally see fig 1 the migration model was developed under the assumption that the nitrate is sorbed only by the mechanism of complexation with alkaline earth metal ions the sorption of nitrate ion undoubtedly exists especially since the article clay et al 2004 states that bromide leached faster through the columns than no3 with due regard to any and all chemical interactions in the transport model the deceleration behavior of not only sr but also no3 and na is manifested at first glance the unexpected slowdown of the nitrate ion is due to the formation of its calcium and magnesium complexes and hence the sorption of these complexes moreover when no3 in the displacing water comes in contact with the sorbed species of divalent metals cax2 and mgx2 new ion exchange sites free for na sorption are thus formed no 3 ca mg x 2 cano 3 x x with increasing cation exchange capacity cec of the sample the increase in strontium sorption efficiency was observed clay loam has a higher strontium sorption efficiency than the clay and sandstone samples tested high mineralization of the solution impedes the sorption of strontium due to the competition of sodium with strontium ions also with increasing nitrate ion content strontium is in complex form even though the sorption of strontium is observed in the form of free ion sr 2 and in the nitrate complex srno3 an increase of the mineralization leads to a shift of strontium forms towards the complexes with higher content of nitrate ion sr no3 2 and sr no3 3 3 2 strontium sorption modeling the final parameterizations of the phreeqc based sr sorption model calibrated manually and using the algorithm mpso are both presented in table 2 the respective parameter selection process for exchange constant was carried out manually or using the mouse code the constant of formation of sr no3 3 is taken from our previous work black and waring 1979 figure 2 shows the change in the experimental and simulated kd sr values for the sr sorption on sandy clay rocks under conditions of increased salinity as the salinity of the solution increased the sorption efficiency on all rocks dropped dramatically there is a strong correlation between the experimental and calculated kd values for different nano3 concentrations in a solution for both the manual sorption parameter calibration approach and the automated sorption parameter calibration approach figure 3 shows the model curves for the dependence of kd on nitrate ion concentration within the simulation using the sit dat thermodynamic database developed for high ionic forces these data were further used in 3d modeling of sr transport in the gera software the difference in the numbers of sites none selective to the sorption of strontium is explained by the greater sorption of strontium on clay particles the proportion of which is higher in loams and clays the results of the experimental evaluation of strontium sorption on real rock samples after microbial nitrate reduction are shown in table 3 slight increase of strontium sorption after the nitrate reduction process can be connected with the absorption of strontium in the process of carbon mineralization for example in the form of co precipitation with calcite thus it is experimentally established that nitrate reduction leads to an increase of sr kd in laboratory experiments strontium sorption equilibrium before and after nitrate reduction is established quickly in 2 h which correlates with the results of mohsenipour et al 2015 sieczka et al 2018 frind et al 1990 hamdi et al 2013 the obtained results of increasing the sorption of strontium under conditions of nitrate reduction correspond to the results of the article thorpe et al 2012 in which the authors observed a similar effect bioreduction of nitrate caused reduced sr2 solubility due to an increase in ph during bioreduction and denitrification the increase of sr reduction in solution is explained by its co precipitation with biogenic carbonates so it is also clear that denitrification has a strong potential to impact sr transport in the subsurface and that understanding the nitrate reduction on behavior of redox inactive pollutants can be of high significance for the safety assessment of the nuclear waste isolation facilities and legacy sites 3 3 model of nitrate reduction microbial reduction of nitrate can influence strontium sorption in different ways decreasing competition on the one hand and increasing it on the other due to a combination of biosorption bioaccumulation and biomineralization formation of co2 calcite safonov et al 2021 in addition strontium sorption can also be affected by the alkalinity that accompanies nitrate reduction if the buffer capacity of the formation is not sufficient no 3 0 62 5ch 3 coo 1 62 5h 1 25 co 2 1 75 h 2 o ½ n 2 2no 3 5h 2 2h n 2 6h 2 о the intensity of microbial nitrate reduction is primarily limited by the concentration of nitrite as the product of its reduction at the first stage is the toxic nitrite ion according to the work linge et al 2020 the half life time of nitrate is 3 7 years and according to the paper http en ibrae ac ru contents mouse the half life time of nitrate is in the range of 1 2 3 years therefore to assess the effect of nitrate reduction on strontium transport in the subsurface the effect of nitrate concentration on this process was studied under laboratory conditions using the sample of the community obtained from the severny repository of the mining chemical combine krasnoyarsk region russia experimental data of n2 production during nitrate biodegradation are presented in fig 4 microorganisms inhabiting the severny repository are capable to live in solutions with nitrate ions concentration up to 8 g l i e on the waste dispersion tail and in the low activity radioactive waste repository area while the denitrification rate will be suppressed as nitrate ion concentration increases over 3 g l the data obtained were used as parameters for calculations the extrapolated rate of nitrate reduction is represented by this equation rate moln2 days 46 143 c no3 4 15 178 c no3 3 1 8703 c no3 2 0 0865 c no3 the constraints of biodegradation included in the model are the following if c no3 0 then rate 0 if c no3 0 125 then rate 0 3 4 sr transport in the model column using the phreeqc software for the calculation 4 cases were considered without nitrate reduction with nitrate reduction accompanied by an increase in ph with nitrate reduction accompanied by an increase in carbon dioxide and lastly with the formation of calcite as a product of nitrate reduction model distributions of strontium in the column under different conditions are studied simulations in phreeqc v 2 18 at c no3 0 05 and 0 15 m 1 at the end of 1 year simulation period 1 pore volume the flow velocity is 10 m a 1 are shown in fig 5 θ dispersivity as a result of the modeling it was found that under the column transport conditions the contribution of nitrate reduction and organic matter decomposition processes both with and without calcite formation is rather small since nitrate reduction limited by high nitrate concentrations is observed ahead of the strontium movement front at the nitrate ion front which in its turn is ahead of the strontium movement front the coprecipitation of strontium with calcite was excluded from the calculations the strontium transport front is only delayed and calcite is formed ahead of the strontium propagation front the calculations of nitrate reductions with calcite formation at an initial nitrate ion concentration with no biocidal activity have also been carried out at 2 different values of dispersivity and the results are shown in fig 6 flow velocity is 10 m a 1 it can be seen that due to the fact that nitrate reduction occurs at the dispersion front which precedes the strontium front the influence of nitrate reduction on strontium transport is small the composition of the injected solution is as follows t 25 celsius ph 7 na 0 05 m 1 nitrate 0 05 m 1 sr 3 3 10 9 m 1 4 modeling injection of 90sr in an aquifer in gera software the main purpose of the numerical experiments is to demonstrate the influence of the nitrate ion concentration in the solution and the nitrate reduction process on the dynamics of 90sr propagation in different rocks the solution injection and further migration of the contamination halo in a 50 m thick homogeneous formation is simulated three types of rocks composing this layer are considered clay loam and sand in an unperturbed state with no injection a uniform regional groundwater flow exists in the reservoirs at velocities of 1 10 and 100 m year respectively for the clay loam and sand the model is implemented in a parallelepiped of 4000x4000x50 m the injection well is located in the center of the coordinates and its filter covers the entire thickness of the aquifer the side model boundaries are chosen to be 2000 m away from the well so that the flow disturbance introduced by injection into the well is negligible at these boundaries on the western and eastern boundaries of the model the dirichlet type boundary conditions fixed pressure are set to provide the required flow rate from left to right while on the northern and southern boundaries neumann type no flow condition is set homogeneous neumann type boundary conditions are set everywhere on the boundary for the transport problem assuming that the boundary is sufficiently far away from the well the initial conditions are stationary flow and zero concentrations of nitrate ion and 90sr the simulation period is 300 years injection into the well lasts for the first 50 years and is stopped afterwards during the injection period the flow rate of the well was 100 m3 day the porosity of 0 2 the longitudinal dispersion of 10 m and a transverse dispersion of 1 m a density of 1400 kg m3 are assumed for all rocks the specific activity of 90sr in the injected solution is 4 64 105 bq l which corresponds to its concentration of 1 10 9 m 1 three series of experiments are carried out reference model of 90sr migration with fixed distribution coefficient kd value see table 3 1 model of 90sr and nitrate ion migration taking into account the effect on rock sorption properties of the presence of dissolved nitrate ion see dependencies in fig 3 in the solution the concentration of nitrate ion in the injected solution is 100 g l the dependence of kd on sodium nitrate content was modeled using the sit model 2 model of 90sr and nitrate ion migration taking into account biodegradation from nitrate ion experimental data and subsequent change in sr distribution coefficient see table 3 for a concentration of 500 mg l the results of the modeling are presented in fig 7 8 the lines on these figures show the contamination halos corresponding to 0 1 1 and 10 reference contaminant level rcl 4 9 bq l for specific activity of 90sr in water in the first series of tests the solution is shown in the 100 100 100 100 square located in the center of the calculation area as the contamination does not move further than 50 m away from the borehole in the second series of tests for clay and loam the solution is shown in the area 150 200 200 200 for sand the region 100 1100 200 200 is chosen most of the contamination is concentrated in these areas the results of the 1st test series are quite consistent with the parameters of the materials the pollution halo has advanced the furthest in sand the least in loam which has the highest values of cation exchange capacity and consequently the distribution coefficient at the same time the influence of regional flow was inferior due to sufficiently high distribution coefficients in all materials over 300 years the halos have not advanced significantly in the direction of the flow comparing the results of calculations of the 1st and 2nd series of tests we can state a substantial increase of contamination halos due to weakening of sorption by the presence of nitrate ion in the solution the most significant advance of 90sr is observed in sand due to high flow rate in the 3rd series of numerical experiments 90sr transport was simulated with a fixed distribution coefficient in each variant in all experiments the 90sr propagation front lagged behind the nitrate ion propagation front i e for the entire time interval considered the 90sr halo was in the area where nitrate reduction had previously occurred and therefore the corresponding kd values could be used see table 3 the resulting 90sr halos are not shown as they are very similar to those in fig 7 as a result of the decrease in the distribution coefficients relative to the 1st series of experiments the 90sr halos slightly increased in size for all three rocks considered 5 conclusion in this work the influence of the biodegradation of nitrate ion and the influence of dispersion on the transport of strontium with groundwater were studied by means of experimental laboratory studies and geochemical transport modeling it has been found that the biodegradation of nitrate ion can significantly affect strontium transport in the case of relatively small nitrate ion concentrations nitrate ion sorption was experimentally observed as predicted further research into the process is required sr transport in the conditions of lrw injection sites where the concentration of nitrate ion is very high is insignificantly affected by nitrate reduction due to highly concentrated solutions the transport model taking into account biodegradation clearly showed the critical influence of dispersion intensity on the simulation results further studies of this process are required based on the experimental and model studies of the sorption of nitrate and sr ions as well as the process of nitrate reduction we may conclude that possible nitrate reduction and other biogenic processes have the potential to impact not only sr but other redox inactive contaminants mobility in aquatic systems also understanding the biogenic behavior of redox inactive radioactive contaminants as well as the boundaries of influence of the corresponding processes can be of significance for the safety assessment of nuclear facilities the results of this work can be used in assessing the safety of lrw injection sites as well as systems with high concentrations of the dissolved nitrate ion the practice of treating the nitrate ion as a conservative non sorbable ion should be abolished credit authorship contribution statement k a boldyrev conceptualization writing original draft i v kapyrin
