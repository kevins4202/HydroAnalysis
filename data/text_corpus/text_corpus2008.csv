10040,classifying the influencing factor of benefit evaluation of water transfer project based on cost analysis and benefit analysis the benefit evaluation index system of east line of south to north water transfer project is established including six aspects of economic cost social cost environmental cost economic benefit social benefit ecological benefit totaling 16 indexes at the same time the standards of each index corresponding to different grades are determined in view of the single result in the process of benefit evaluation ignoring the randomness and fuzziness of index data a comprehensive evaluation method based on combination weight and trapezoid cloud model is adopted in this method the weight obtained by combination of g1 and improved critic weight method is combined with the index certainty obtained by trapezoid cloud model to realize the comprehensive evaluation of project benefits finally taking jiangsu section of phase i of east line of south to north water transfer project as an example the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed benefit evaluation system and method are verified by analyzing and comparing the evaluation results keywords south to north water transfer benefit evaluation index system improved critic weight method trapezoid cloud model 1 introduction water transfer project is a kind of water supply project in water conservancy project and its particularity lies in cross basin as an important infrastructure covering the design construction operation and other costs in china s investment and construction it undertakes the responsibility of water supply flood control waterlogging control ecology shipping and other benefits shen and speed 2009 sun et al 2021 because of its long period of project planning construction and efficiency large investment scale diverse water supply objectives and wide range of influence it is necessary to evaluate the cost consumption and efficiency of water transfer project in this way it not only supervises and improves the operation and management of the construction project itself but also plays a key role in formulating the investment plan and coordinating the investment proportion li et al 2017 the actual operation effect of water conservancy projects that have been completed and operated for a certain period of time shall be compared with the main contents in the feasibility study report and the gap and reason shall be analyzed to form a good decision cycle of the project liu et al 2013 ma and zheng 2010 therefore the coordination of comprehensive benefit and total cost should be considered in the benefit evaluation of water transfer project so as to provide scientific basis for further decision making of the project the benefit evaluation of water transfer project is a multi level and complex index system evaluation including qualitative and quantitative indexes nika et al 2020 from the content of benefit evaluation it can be divided into the following three directions 1 economic impact output per unit water and the proportion of water to resource inputs were proposed to evaluate economic benefits wu et al 2020 an evaluation framework for economic benefits evaluation of water diversion project was constructed and the water diversion in 2011 of the ytwtp was selected as the evaluation object wang et al 2019 2 social impact the social benefit post evaluation content of the agricultural water saving project was proposed including social impact post evaluation social risk post evaluation and social mutual adaptability post evaluation chunhong 2007 ryu et al 2019 investigated investment directions for water environment infrastructure facilities related to the supply of sewage treatment systems in rural areas through cost benefit analysis 3 ecological environment impact energy analysis is applied to quantify the benefits of ecological water supply by converting the input and output of the ecological producing system into a unified dimension huang et al 2019 by using market value and shadow engineering methods the economic benefits of water transfer to agricultural forest wetland and city greenbelt ecosystems have been calculated separately for the different phases of the eastern route of the south north water transfer project lu et al 2006 to sum up the benefit evaluation of water transfer project is mainly based on the engineering economy and gradually attaches importance to its impact on the society and ecological environment further research is needed on the combination of the breadth of index system determination and the depth of evaluation method selection from the method of benefit evaluation the benefit evaluation method of the feasibility study report of water transfer project is mainly cost benefit analysis an economic analysis of pilot systems were presented for greywater treatment from three case studies rodriguez et al 2020 a cost benefit analysis of three investment based leakage reduction methods and uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were conducted to determine the most relevant data for leakage analysis and policymaking on a national level ahopelto and vahala 2020 a novel simulation of water banking with recharge and recovery triggered by water trading prices using 11 years of data gave a benefit cost to estimate the potential for water banking in australia s murray darling basin gonzalez et al 2020 the cba of an existing reuse scheme in puglia in southern italy was presented to reclaim wastewater for irrigation from a coastal area with growing recreational beach related activities arena et al 2020 choice experiments and an extensive cost benefit analysis cba were used to investigate the feasibility of installing two advanced water treatments in cheongju waterworks in south korea gschwandtner et al 2020 although it is scientific its reflection on the overall cost and comprehensive benefit of water transfer project is not comprehensive enough and it is difficult to determine the advantages and disadvantages of the situation in comparison with the actual situation cloud model evaluation method has a good solution characteristic for the fuzzy random property in the evaluation index but the solution of the index certainty between adjacent grades is not accurate enough li et al 2009 at the same time in the process of weight determination it is necessary to consider the advantages of subjective and objective weight method as well as the characteristics of qualitative and quantitative indicators therefore this paper takes into account the fuzziness of the membership relationship of each index evaluation and the randomness of the transformation of quantitative and qualitative concepts in the actual operation of water transfer project according to the characteristics of the influencing factors of water transfer project benefit evaluation the evaluation index system of multi level and multi index is constructed based on the selection of qualitative index and quantitative index and the evaluation model is solved by trapezoidal cloud model evaluation method of combined weight finally jiangsu section of phase i of east line of south to north water transfer project is taken as an example to verify the applicability of the evaluation system and evaluation model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study cases the east route of south to north water transfer project is an important part of the overall layout of south to north water transfer project in china since the phase i of the project was put into operation in 2013 it has played a huge role in economic and social development the jiangsu section of the phase i of the project mainly utilizes and renovates the existing water transfer project from the yangtze river to the north and opens up a new water transmission line according to the planning requirements through more than 40 years of efforts 9 cascade hubs and 16 pumping stations have been gradually built including jiangdu huai an huaiyin siyang liulaojian zaohe liushan jietai and yanhu with a total installed capacity of 149000 kw a total pumping capacity of 1671 m3 s and a total lift of 40 m the engineering system has been initially formed and has strong representativeness the project provides a solid foundation for water supply flood control drainage drought resistance environmental protection and other related work in jiangsu province since the construction content of jiangsu section of phase i of east line is adjusted compared with the feasibility study stage other projects such as water conservancy and shipping have been implemented along the water transfer line the engineering conditions of river and water storage lakes have also changed and the social development of cities and counties along the project has also changed greatly and the social and economic benefits have also changed therefore it is necessary to further clarify the benefits of jiangsu section of phase i of east line and provide reference for the decision making level and investment benefit of the follow up project of south to north water transfer project the jiangsu section of phase i of east line of south to north water transfer project is an important strategic measure to solve the serious shortage of water resources in the north of china and it is also a super large infrastructure related to the sustainable development of china s economy and society since the project was successfully opened in 2013 according to the dispatching requirements of relevant national and provincial departments 10 times water transfer tasks to shandong have been completed with a total of 111700 operation hours 11 166 billion m3 of pumping water 1 698 billion m3 of pumping water and 1 994 billion m3 of water out of the province at the same time the project has participated in flood control flood drainage drought resistance and other related work in the province for many times with 27 900 operation hours and 2 941 billion m3 of pumping water the sketch map of the jiangsu section of phase i of the east line of the south to north water transfer project is shown in fig 1 province wrdoj 2017 2 2 benefit evaluation system and standard of water transfer project the existing benefit evaluation index system of water transfer project mainly starts from two aspects of economic social impact and ecological environment impact to a certain extent it focuses on the operation situation natural and human impact since the construction of water transfer project however it is difficult to compare and analyze the relationship between its own costs and benefits due to the lack of accurate reflection therefore from the perspective of cost and benefit this paper takes into account the order of the factors and simplifies them and constructs the network structure diagram as shown in fig 2 2 2 1 establishing index system according to the network structure chart of influencing factors for benefit evaluation of water transfer project constructed above and the characteristics of east line of south to north water transfer project the construction of its benefit evaluation system should start from the cost and benefit aspects respectively guan et al 2020 cost analysis and benefit analysis are all analyzed from the economic social and ecological perspectives among cost analysis economic cost is compared with the fixed investment operating cost circulating fund and other cost in the feasibility study report of water transfer project at the same time the construction of large scale water conservancy projects should consider the corresponding social costs and environmental costs the benefit analysis is still based on the economic benefit social benefit and ecological benefit of the traditional water transfer project in order to enhance the contrast this paper uses the relative measurement method actual value predicted value compares the actual cost and benefit of the water transfer project after running for a period of time with the cost and benefit in the feasibility study report summarizes each subdivision index and judges whether the engineering line meets the development expectation the contents and meanings of each index in the established evaluation index system are shown in table 1 2 2 2 establishing evaluation level and standard according to the relevant specifications and data of east line of south to north water transfer project benefit evaluation such as economic evaluation methods and parameters of construction project china mohaurdotpsro 2006 refer to the different influences of favorable and unfavorable aspects in the process of benefit evaluation the evaluation criteria are divided into five levels in this paper which are in turn more adverse adverse no impact favorable and more favorable the final evaluation level is represented by the above five levels considering that this benefit evaluation is compared with the parameters and indexes in the feasibility study report and the change degree of each index is not very characteristic therefore the relative measurement method actual value forecast value is adopted in this paper according to whether the operation of project meets the development expectation the reasonable deviation range of index evaluation value in feasibility study report is used to divide the index value range the grade and standard of the benefit evaluation system of east line of south to north water transfer project see table 2 in which the index units are dimensionless the numerical range corresponding to the evaluation grade of each index in table 1 is described in detail as follows the range of c1 is determined according to the forecast of price fluctuation and reserved investment adjustment the range of c2 and c7 can be reduced according to the actual operation of the management unit and determined by referring to the regulation for economic evaluation of water conservancy construction projects china mowrotpsro 2013 and the data of similar water diversion projects the range of c3 and c4 are refined and deepened on the basis of economic evaluation methods and parameters of construction projects the range of c5 is concluded by the relevant parameters in the specifications on land requisition and resettlement design for construction of water resources and hydropower project china mowrotpsro 2009 the range of c6 is determined by reference to the cost quota of construction projects in jiangsu province province dohaurdoj 2014 the range of c8 is determined by reference to the water resource fee in the regulations on administration of water intake permit and water resources fee collection china scotpsro 2017 and the land cost in the regulation for economic evaluation of water conservancy construction projects the range of c9 is determined by referring to the process of water supply benefit in the feasibility report the range of c10 c11 and c12 is determined according to the price of industrial agricultural and shipping water in the management measures for water supply price of water transfer project the range of c13 and c14 is obtained by multiplying the area ratio of flood control and waterlogging removal by the grain price the range of c15 is obtained by determination of different emergy conversion rates in reference energy analysis the range of c16 is determined by reference to the proportion of urban water consumption of different developed degrees along the project 2 3 benefit evaluation model of east line of south to north water transfer project 2 3 1 determination of index weight by combination weight method in the current comprehensive evaluation methods it is emphasized that the determination of weight should be jointly determined by subjective and objective weighting methods subjective weight method has strong subjectivity and is generally influenced by personal consciousness experience and other factors such as order relation analysis g1 analytic hierarchy process ahp etc objective weighting method deals with the weight of each index according to the interrelation of data but ignores the subjective initiative of human beings such as entropy weight method critic weight method etc considering that the determination of indicators in the indicator system needs expert evaluation and each expert is affected by multiple factors such as his own ability level familiarity personal preference etc at the same time the benefit evaluation of east line of south to north water transfer project is the result of multi level and multi index interaction however there are two problems in the traditional critic method 1 there are dimensions in the standard deviation due to the different dimensions and orders of magnitude of each evaluation index the standard deviation can not reflect the contrast strength of the evaluation index 2 by calculating i 1 n 1 ξ l j to reflect the conflict between indicators and the correlation coefficient between indicators may be negative the smaller the correlation coefficient is the greater the conflict of indicators will be at the same time the requirements of pearson correlation coefficient are continuous data normal distribution and linear relationship which may be difficult to meet the above conditions in the actual evaluation process qiu et al 2020 wang and gao 2017 zhao and tang 2019 therefore this paper first uses g1 method to determine the subjective weight of the indicators combined with the objective weight determined by the improved critical method considering the correlation and the amount of information to get the comprehensive weight of the indicators jian et al 2006 the specific steps are as follows 1 determination of subjective weight ω j by g1 1 ω j 1 1 k 2 n j k n r j 2 determination of objective weight ω j by improved critic weight method 1 this paper introduces gini coefficient to measure the contrast strength of indicators gini coefficient is defined according to the lorentz curve which is used to characterize the distribution differences of social wealth among members the larger gini coefficient is the more uneven the distribution of social wealth among members is in the problem of benefit evaluation it is the reflection of the comparative strength of indicators the gini coefficient is calculated as follows 2 ξ j i 1 m k 1 m x i j x k j 2 m i 1 m x i j where ξ j is the gini coefficient of the index u j ξ j 0 1 1 means that the contrast strength of the index is the largest and 0 means that the contrast strength of the index is the smallest 2 in view of the shortcomings of pearson correlation coefficient this paper introduces kendall coefficient to calculate the conflict between the evaluation indexes kendall coefficient is a kind of correlation coefficient used to measure the correlation degree of multiple rank variables its value does not depend on any assumption of data distribution and it is suitable for the complex situation of air combat for any two column variables l t and l j of the evaluation matrix where t j 1 2 suppose that o t p and o j p are the sort values of l t p and l j p in l t and l j respectively then the corresponding sort value variables of o t p and o j p can be combined to form variable pair set o then the p th variable pair of variable pair set o is o t p o j p therefore the kendall correlation coefficients of u t and u j are as follows 3 η t j n c c n d c d e 1 e e e e e e 1 2 d f 1 f f f f f f 1 2 where η t j is the kendall correlation coefficient of column variables l t and l j n c c and n d c are respectively the number of variable pairs with equal element ordering value and the number of variable pairs with unequal element ordering value in set o d m m 1 2 let the same elements in the column variables l t and l j form a small set pair e and f respectively ee and ff represent the number of small sets in the small set pair e and f respectively ee and ff represent the number of elements in the small set pair e and f respectively in order to avoid the influence of the positive and negative correlation coefficient on the index correlation the absolute value of kendall coefficient is taken 3 the objective weight formula of the improved critic method is as follow 4 ω j c j q 1 n c j ξ j l 1 n 1 η l j q 1 n ξ j l 1 n 1 η l j 3 calculate index combination weight ω i 5 ω i ω i ω i i 1 n ω i ω i 2 3 2 calculation of index certainty degree by trapezoid cloud model there are fuzziness and randomness in the corresponding relationship between the quantitative and qualitative index values and the classified grades in the benefit evaluation of east line of south to north water transfer project in view of this uncertain membership relationship cloud model can be well solved by qualitative and quantitative transformation however the traditional cloud model for the existence of multiple elements must belong to the description of conceptual characteristics is not reasonable chen and li 2016 according to the characteristics of the benefit evaluation of the east line of south to north water transfer project the points in a certain range must belong to the concept therefore in this paper the index uncertainty is calculated based on the trapezoidal cloud model theory the specific theory is as follows yu et al 2021 let u x be a quantitative set of precise numerical representation c be qualitative concept on u in a certain finite interval there exists any group of quantitative elements x and x has a random number μ x 0 1 in qualitative concept c with a stable tendency where 6 μ u 0 1 x u x μ x then the distribution x on the set u is called cloud and each point x μ x is called cloud drop the image distribution of cloud drop is similar to trapezoid so it is called trapezoid cloud the interval of x represents the expected interval of trapezoid cloud e x1 e x2 the essence of normal cloud is the special trapezoid cloud when e x1 e x2 trapezoidal cloud model is mainly composed of expectation interval e x1 e x2 e x1 e x2 entropy en and hyper entropy he fu et al 2011 expectation e x1 is the lower boundary position of qualitative concept expectation e x2 is the upper boundary position of qualitative concept entropy en is the cloud drop value range of qualitative concept description domain interval hyper entropy he is the uncertainty of entropy according to the concept of trapezoidal cloud model theory combined with the actual situation of benefit evaluation of the east line of south to north water transfer project through the single rule single condition trapezoid cloud generator composed of x cloud generator and y cloud generator as shown in fig 3 the cloud drop diagram corresponding to each level is calculated qu and yang 2015 when the index is in a certain subordinate state the benefit is in the expected interval which obeys the uniform distribution with the degree of certainty of 1 when the index is in the uncertain membership state that is the benefit is in the unexpected interval the calculation of its uncertainty meets the normal cloud distribution the specific calculation steps are as follows calculate three digital characteristics of trapezoid cloud model e x1 and e x2 are calculated and determined by formula 7 and formula 8 according to the upper and lower critical values of each index value in the benefit evaluation of water diversion project in which e x1 and e x2 of boundary level are equal to the boundary value e n and h e are determined by formula 9 and formula 11 song et al 2017 7 e x 1 i j c i j max 2 c i j min 3 8 e x 2 i j 2 c i j max c i j min 3 9 e n e x 2 i j e x 1 i j 6 10 h e k where c max and c min are the upper and lower limits of the j th evaluation grade corresponding to the i th evaluation index k is a constant given according to experience which can be adjusted according to the characteristics of the variable itself for the indexes with only one side boundary such as c min or c max the default boundary parameters or expected values can be determined according to the maximum upper or lower limits of the evaluation values in recent years and it is consistent with unilateral normal cloud distribution 2 calculate normal random number e n i j 11 e n i j randn 1 h e e n i j 3 calculate index certainty

3 determination of benefit evaluation grade of east line of south to north water transfer project the determination of benefit evaluation grade of east line of south to north water transfer project needs to be combined with the weight of index and the certainty degree of index on the one hand according to the trapezoid cloud model theory we can get the digital characteristics of cloud model under different evaluation levels read the values of each index and get the certainty degree of each index in the east line of south to north water transfer project that belongs to the evaluation level on the other hand according to the g1 method and the improved critic weight method the combination weight of each index is determined the comprehensive certainty degree of each index can be obtained and the benefit evaluation grade of east line of south to north water transfer project is determined by the maximum comprehensive certainty degree by eq 15 yang et al 2019 15 p i j 1 n μ i j x w j in formula p is the comprehensive certainty degree of indexes w j is the combination weight of j th index finally the evaluation value of east line of south to north water transfer project is determined by eq 16 the corresponding evaluation process is shown in fig 4 16 h j 1 n p j k j in formula h is the evaluation value of indexes p is the comprehensive certainty degree of each index k is the level characteristic value of each level more adverse level corresponds to 60 adverse level corresponds to 70 no impact level corresponds to 80 favorable level corresponds to 90 more favorable level corresponds to 100 3 results 3 1 determination of index weight 1 collect the opinions of 5 experts on the weight of each index and use g1 to get the subjective weight of index ω j according to eq 1 as shown in the table below table 3 table index c9 c10 c11 c12 c13 c14 c15 c16 subjective weight 0 0655 0 0643 0 0636 0 0617 0 0579 0 0598 0 0645 0 0627 2 collect the measured data corresponding to each index of jiangsu section of phase i of east line of south to north water transfer project from 2013 to 2017 combined with formula 2 4 the objective weight of indicators is obtained by using the improved critic weight method as shown in table 4 table index c9 c10 c11 c12 c13 c14 c15 c16 objective weight 0 0650 0 0633 0 0631 0 0619 0 0603 0 0609 0 0642 0 0613 3 finally the combination weight is calculated according to eq 5 as shown in table 5 table index c9 c10 c11 c12 c13 c14 c15 c16 combination weight 0 0681 0 0651 0 0642 0 0611 0 0559 0 0582 0 0663 0 0615 from the perspective of the optimized combination weight the economic cost and benefit are the focus of the project construction operation in the cost analysis the highest weight is the operating cost and environmental externalities cost and the lowest is other cost in benefit analysis the highest weight is domestic water supply benefit and the lowest weight is flood control benefit this is mainly because the operation cost and environmental external cost account for a large part of the operation cost of the project construction and the economic benefits of living water supply is the key to the water transfer project because the south to north water transfer project is a large public welfare project so the requirements of other costs are not particularly strict the social benefits are not particularly important compared with other benefits these are basically consistent with the attention paid to all aspects in the process of water transfer operation and management 3 2 calculation of index certainty degree on the basis of the benefit evaluation system of water transfer project determined in table 2 according to the principle of single rule single condition trapezoid cloud generator the certainty degree of each index for different evaluation levels is analyzed it should be noted that for variables with only one sided boundary the boundary parameters need to be determined according to the maximum upper limit or the minimum lower limit in the data according to the digital characteristics of trapezoidal cloud model of water transfer project benefit evaluation index calculated by formula 7 10 a single rule single condition trapezoidal cloud generator is run to generate a cloud drop diagram whose index belongs to the evaluation level as shown in fig 5 in the trapezoid cloud model the abscissa indicates the value of the index and the ordinate indicates that the index is subordinate to the certainty degree of the evaluation grade the order of the evaluation grade in the cloud chart shown in fig 5 1 8 is the same and the order from left to right is more favorable favorable no impact adverse more adverse the order of the evaluation grade in the cloud chart shown in fig 5 9 16 is the opposite from the cloud drop graph of each index in fig 5 it can be concluded that the value of the index belongs to the evaluation level and the data points have some cross phenomenon which not only reflects the large degree of cloud drop dispersion but also reflects the fuzziness and uncertainty when the index value is transformed into the evaluation certainty according to the actual value of each index corresponding to 2013 2017 and the predicted value in the feasibility study report the ratio of each index is obtained and the certainty degree of each level corresponding to the cost type index and benefit type index is calculated from eqs 11 14 in this paper the certainty degree of each index level in 2013 and 2017 is selected for comparison as shown in table 6 according to the calculation results of the level certainty degree of each index in the analysis table 6 since the start of water supply in 2013 most indexes in cost analysis are focused on the adverse and no impact level while most of the indexes in the benefit analysis focus on the adverse level in 2017 most of indexes in cost analysis focused on the adverse level while indexes in benefit analysis except for the main water supply benefits the other benefits tended to be no impact and favorable levels this is mainly due to the adjustment of the construction and operation stage compared with the planning period since phase i of water supply in jiangsu section resulting in a slight increase in the overall cost although the actual water transfer has been steadily improved there is still a certain gap from the planning and design water transfer the main water supply benefits are not ideal and the economic benefits are greatly affected in addition to the task of transferring water to the north the eastern route project ensures the water source for the navigation of the jining xuzhou section of the beijing hangzhou grand canal throughout the year consolidates and develops the two commodity grain bases in western shandong and northern jiangsu and increases the corresponding social benefits at the same time since the water supply in 2013 the water environment has been continuously improved and the water quality along the line is up to the standard and stable which promotes the ecological benefits 4 discussion according to the combination weight and certainty degree of indexes determined in tables 5 and 6 the benefit evaluation grade results of jiangsu section of phase i of east line of south to north water transfer project are calculated by eq 15 and compared with other weight methods and certainty degree calculation methods the calculation results are shown in table 7 it can be seen from table 7 that the benefit evaluation results of jiangsu section of phase i of east line of south to north water transfer project from 2013 to 2017 gradually meet the requirements of various indicators in the feasibility study report in 2013 the maximum comprehensive determination of adverse level is 0 44124 followed by the determination of no impact level is 0 38682 and the final evaluation result is adverse in 2017 the comprehensive certainty degree of no impact grade reached the maximum of 0 51409 and the evaluation result is no impact among them the comprehensive certainty degree of more adverse level decreased from 0 07270 to 0 00713 and adverse level decreased and other levels increased combined with the actual situation although the benefit of jiangsu section project has not yet reached the requirements of the feasibility study report with the continuous increase of the actual water transfer and the increasingly significant effect of comprehensive treatment of water environment along the line the positive trend is more obvious and the benefit of the project is steadily rising after a period of operation in order to reflect the applicability of the evaluation method for the benefit evaluation of the east route of south to north water transfer project the evaluation result of combined weight cloud model and ahp critic trapezoid cloud model are selected to compare with the evaluation result of this paper the specific evaluation results are shown in table 7 it can be seen that the improved critic method can accurately reflect the correlation coefficient between the contrast of evaluation index and the index and can better determine the objective weight of the index so as to avoid the situation that the overall evaluation level drops by one level trapezoidal cloud model has a good ability to determine the evaluation grade when the comprehensive certainty degree value of adverse and no impact are close in the evaluation process so as to avoid the situation that it is difficult to determine when the evaluation grades are close in order to directly reflect the relationship between project cost consumption and benefit exertion from 2013 to 2017 the evaluation value of cost analysis a1 and benefit analysis a2 in each year can be obtained according to eq 16 as shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the positive degree of each index in cost analysis a1 has been at a high level rising from 39 72 in 2013 41 32 in 2017 the positive degree of each index in the benefit analysis a2 is slightly lower than that in the cost analysis a1 but it is in a gradual upward trend from 35 46 in 2013 40 03 in 2017 combined with the actual situation the project cost control scheme design of jiangsu section is more reasonable and the cost investment situation in a period of operation is basically consistent with the design situation since the water supply in 2013 although the project efficiency has not reached the design level it has been in a state of growth and there is a trend that the project investment cost will be balanced and exceeded in the future this is basically according with the actual operation of the project from 2013 to 2017 5 conclusions as an important water resources allocation project to coordinate the contradictions among population productivity ecology and nature the east route of south to north water diversion project is restricted by multiple cost factors such as economy society and environment and is related to the economic social and ecological benefits therefore the benefit evaluation of the east route of south to north water transfer project is particularly important 1 from the perspective of evaluation system the evaluation system including 2 aspects of cost and benefit analysis 6 subsystems and 16 evaluation indexes is constructed the actual situation is compared with the predicted situation and 5 evaluation levels are divided which provides a certain reference for the study of benefit evaluation system of water transfer project 2 from the perspective of evaluation method this paper reasonably considers the influence of index contrast conflict human subjective judgment and other factors and uses g1 method and improved critic method to get the subjective and objective combination weight of the index which has a certain persuasion trapezoidal cloud model has a good performance in solving the problem that the change of index threshold is small and the judgment of the complete subordination of points within a certain range in the process of benefit evaluation at present there is no trapezoidal cloud model evaluation method applied to the benefit evaluation of south to north water transfer project however the theoretical guidance for the selection of digital eigenvalues of trapezoidal cloud model is less further research on digital characteristics is conducive to improving the accuracy of evaluation results 3 from the perspective of evaluation results the benefit of jiangsu section of the east route of south to north water transfer project have been gradually brought into play and the degree of membership to the advantageous level has increased year by year although the scale of the east route pumping station in phase i has met the design requirements there is still a certain gap between the water supply and the design water supply and there is room for further improvement in the future on the basis of reasonably increasing the water supply of the east route of the south to north water transfer project we should strengthen the project cost control ensure the ecological water level and ecological flow of rivers and lakes and maintain the project benefits credit authorship contribution statement conceptualization z y and x h methodology z y and x h software z y validation x h and c l formal

10040,classifying the influencing factor of benefit evaluation of water transfer project based on cost analysis and benefit analysis the benefit evaluation index system of east line of south to north water transfer project is established including six aspects of economic cost social cost environmental cost economic benefit social benefit ecological benefit totaling 16 indexes at the same time the standards of each index corresponding to different grades are determined in view of the single result in the process of benefit evaluation ignoring the randomness and fuzziness of index data a comprehensive evaluation method based on combination weight and trapezoid cloud model is adopted in this method the weight obtained by combination of g1 and improved critic weight method is combined with the index certainty obtained by trapezoid cloud model to realize the comprehensive evaluation of project benefits finally taking jiangsu section of phase i of east line of south to north water transfer project as an example the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed benefit evaluation system and method are verified by analyzing and comparing the evaluation results keywords south to north water transfer benefit evaluation index system improved critic weight method trapezoid cloud model 1 introduction water transfer project is a kind of water supply project in water conservancy project and its particularity lies in cross basin as an important infrastructure covering the design construction operation and other costs in china s investment and construction it undertakes the responsibility of water supply flood control waterlogging control ecology shipping and other benefits shen and speed 2009 sun et al 2021 because of its long period of project planning construction and efficiency large investment scale diverse water supply objectives and wide range of influence it is necessary to evaluate the cost consumption and efficiency of water transfer project in this way it not only supervises and improves the operation and management of the construction project itself but also plays a key role in formulating the investment plan and coordinating the investment proportion li et al 2017 the actual operation effect of water conservancy projects that have been completed and operated for a certain period of time shall be compared with the main contents in the feasibility study report and the gap and reason shall be analyzed to form a good decision cycle of the project liu et al 2013 ma and zheng 2010 therefore the coordination of comprehensive benefit and total cost should be considered in the benefit evaluation of water transfer project so as to provide scientific basis for further decision making of the project the benefit evaluation of water transfer project is a multi level and complex index system evaluation including qualitative and quantitative indexes nika et al 2020 from the content of benefit evaluation it can be divided into the following three directions 1 economic impact output per unit water and the proportion of water to resource inputs were proposed to evaluate economic benefits wu et al 2020 an evaluation framework for economic benefits evaluation of water diversion project was constructed and the water diversion in 2011 of the ytwtp was selected as the evaluation object wang et al 2019 2 social impact the social benefit post evaluation content of the agricultural water saving project was proposed including social impact post evaluation social risk post evaluation and social mutual adaptability post evaluation chunhong 2007 ryu et al 2019 investigated investment directions for water environment infrastructure facilities related to the supply of sewage treatment systems in rural areas through cost benefit analysis 3 ecological environment impact energy analysis is applied to quantify the benefits of ecological water supply by converting the input and output of the ecological producing system into a unified dimension huang et al 2019 by using market value and shadow engineering methods the economic benefits of water transfer to agricultural forest wetland and city greenbelt ecosystems have been calculated separately for the different phases of the eastern route of the south north water transfer project lu et al 2006 to sum up the benefit evaluation of water transfer project is mainly based on the engineering economy and gradually attaches importance to its impact on the society and ecological environment further research is needed on the combination of the breadth of index system determination and the depth of evaluation method selection from the method of benefit evaluation the benefit evaluation method of the feasibility study report of water transfer project is mainly cost benefit analysis an economic analysis of pilot systems were presented for greywater treatment from three case studies rodriguez et al 2020 a cost benefit analysis of three investment based leakage reduction methods and uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were conducted to determine the most relevant data for leakage analysis and policymaking on a national level ahopelto and vahala 2020 a novel simulation of water banking with recharge and recovery triggered by water trading prices using 11 years of data gave a benefit cost to estimate the potential for water banking in australia s murray darling basin gonzalez et al 2020 the cba of an existing reuse scheme in puglia in southern italy was presented to reclaim wastewater for irrigation from a coastal area with growing recreational beach related activities arena et al 2020 choice experiments and an extensive cost benefit analysis cba were used to investigate the feasibility of installing two advanced water treatments in cheongju waterworks in south korea gschwandtner et al 2020 although it is scientific its reflection on the overall cost and comprehensive benefit of water transfer project is not comprehensive enough and it is difficult to determine the advantages and disadvantages of the situation in comparison with the actual situation cloud model evaluation method has a good solution characteristic for the fuzzy random property in the evaluation index but the solution of the index certainty between adjacent grades is not accurate enough li et al 2009 at the same time in the process of weight determination it is necessary to consider the advantages of subjective and objective weight method as well as the characteristics of qualitative and quantitative indicators therefore this paper takes into account the fuzziness of the membership relationship of each index evaluation and the randomness of the transformation of quantitative and qualitative concepts in the actual operation of water transfer project according to the characteristics of the influencing factors of water transfer project benefit evaluation the evaluation index system of multi level and multi index is constructed based on the selection of qualitative index and quantitative index and the evaluation model is solved by trapezoidal cloud model evaluation method of combined weight finally jiangsu section of phase i of east line of south to north water transfer project is taken as an example to verify the applicability of the evaluation system and evaluation model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study cases the east route of south to north water transfer project is an important part of the overall layout of south to north water transfer project in china since the phase i of the project was put into operation in 2013 it has played a huge role in economic and social development the jiangsu section of the phase i of the project mainly utilizes and renovates the existing water transfer project from the yangtze river to the north and opens up a new water transmission line according to the planning requirements through more than 40 years of efforts 9 cascade hubs and 16 pumping stations have been gradually built including jiangdu huai an huaiyin siyang liulaojian zaohe liushan jietai and yanhu with a total installed capacity of 149000 kw a total pumping capacity of 1671 m3 s and a total lift of 40 m the engineering system has been initially formed and has strong representativeness the project provides a solid foundation for water supply flood control drainage drought resistance environmental protection and other related work in jiangsu province since the construction content of jiangsu section of phase i of east line is adjusted compared with the feasibility study stage other projects such as water conservancy and shipping have been implemented along the water transfer line the engineering conditions of river and water storage lakes have also changed and the social development of cities and counties along the project has also changed greatly and the social and economic benefits have also changed therefore it is necessary to further clarify the benefits of jiangsu section of phase i of east line and provide reference for the decision making level and investment benefit of the follow up project of south to north water transfer project the jiangsu section of phase i of east line of south to north water transfer project is an important strategic measure to solve the serious shortage of water resources in the north of china and it is also a super large infrastructure related to the sustainable development of china s economy and society since the project was successfully opened in 2013 according to the dispatching requirements of relevant national and provincial departments 10 times water transfer tasks to shandong have been completed with a total of 111700 operation hours 11 166 billion m3 of pumping water 1 698 billion m3 of pumping water and 1 994 billion m3 of water out of the province at the same time the project has participated in flood control flood drainage drought resistance and other related work in the province for many times with 27 900 operation hours and 2 941 billion m3 of pumping water the sketch map of the jiangsu section of phase i of the east line of the south to north water transfer project is shown in fig 1 province wrdoj 2017 2 2 benefit evaluation system and standard of water transfer project the existing benefit evaluation index system of water transfer project mainly starts from two aspects of economic social impact and ecological environment impact to a certain extent it focuses on the operation situation natural and human impact since the construction of water transfer project however it is difficult to compare and analyze the relationship between its own costs and benefits due to the lack of accurate reflection therefore from the perspective of cost and benefit this paper takes into account the order of the factors and simplifies them and constructs the network structure diagram as shown in fig 2 2 2 1 establishing index system according to the network structure chart of influencing factors for benefit evaluation of water transfer project constructed above and the characteristics of east line of south to north water transfer project the construction of its benefit evaluation system should start from the cost and benefit aspects respectively guan et al 2020 cost analysis and benefit analysis are all analyzed from the economic social and ecological perspectives among cost analysis economic cost is compared with the fixed investment operating cost circulating fund and other cost in the feasibility study report of water transfer project at the same time the construction of large scale water conservancy projects should consider the corresponding social costs and environmental costs the benefit analysis is still based on the economic benefit social benefit and ecological benefit of the traditional water transfer project in order to enhance the contrast this paper uses the relative measurement method actual value predicted value compares the actual cost and benefit of the water transfer project after running for a period of time with the cost and benefit in the feasibility study report summarizes each subdivision index and judges whether the engineering line meets the development expectation the contents and meanings of each index in the established evaluation index system are shown in table 1 2 2 2 establishing evaluation level and standard according to the relevant specifications and data of east line of south to north water transfer project benefit evaluation such as economic evaluation methods and parameters of construction project china mohaurdotpsro 2006 refer to the different influences of favorable and unfavorable aspects in the process of benefit evaluation the evaluation criteria are divided into five levels in this paper which are in turn more adverse adverse no impact favorable and more favorable the final evaluation level is represented by the above five levels considering that this benefit evaluation is compared with the parameters and indexes in the feasibility study report and the change degree of each index is not very characteristic therefore the relative measurement method actual value forecast value is adopted in this paper according to whether the operation of project meets the development expectation the reasonable deviation range of index evaluation value in feasibility study report is used to divide the index value range the grade and standard of the benefit evaluation system of east line of south to north water transfer project see table 2 in which the index units are dimensionless the numerical range corresponding to the evaluation grade of each index in table 1 is described in detail as follows the range of c1 is determined according to the forecast of price fluctuation and reserved investment adjustment the range of c2 and c7 can be reduced according to the actual operation of the management unit and determined by referring to the regulation for economic evaluation of water conservancy construction projects china mowrotpsro 2013 and the data of similar water diversion projects the range of c3 and c4 are refined and deepened on the basis of economic evaluation methods and parameters of construction projects the range of c5 is concluded by the relevant parameters in the specifications on land requisition and resettlement design for construction of water resources and hydropower project china mowrotpsro 2009 the range of c6 is determined by reference to the cost quota of construction projects in jiangsu province province dohaurdoj 2014 the range of c8 is determined by reference to the water resource fee in the regulations on administration of water intake permit and water resources fee collection china scotpsro 2017 and the land cost in the regulation for economic evaluation of water conservancy construction projects the range of c9 is determined by referring to the process of water supply benefit in the feasibility report the range of c10 c11 and c12 is determined according to the price of industrial agricultural and shipping water in the management measures for water supply price of water transfer project the range of c13 and c14 is obtained by multiplying the area ratio of flood control and waterlogging removal by the grain price the range of c15 is obtained by determination of different emergy conversion rates in reference energy analysis the range of c16 is determined by reference to the proportion of urban water consumption of different developed degrees along the project 2 3 benefit evaluation model of east line of south to north water transfer project 2 3 1 determination of index weight by combination weight method in the current comprehensive evaluation methods it is emphasized that the determination of weight should be jointly determined by subjective and objective weighting methods subjective weight method has strong subjectivity and is generally influenced by personal consciousness experience and other factors such as order relation analysis g1 analytic hierarchy process ahp etc objective weighting method deals with the weight of each index according to the interrelation of data but ignores the subjective initiative of human beings such as entropy weight method critic weight method etc considering that the determination of indicators in the indicator system needs expert evaluation and each expert is affected by multiple factors such as his own ability level familiarity personal preference etc at the same time the benefit evaluation of east line of south to north water transfer project is the result of multi level and multi index interaction however there are two problems in the traditional critic method 1 there are dimensions in the standard deviation due to the different dimensions and orders of magnitude of each evaluation index the standard deviation can not reflect the contrast strength of the evaluation index 2 by calculating i 1 n 1 ξ l j to reflect the conflict between indicators and the correlation coefficient between indicators may be negative the smaller the correlation coefficient is the greater the conflict of indicators will be at the same time the requirements of pearson correlation coefficient are continuous data normal distribution and linear relationship which may be difficult to meet the above conditions in the actual evaluation process qiu et al 2020 wang and gao 2017 zhao and tang 2019 therefore this paper first uses g1 method to determine the subjective weight of the indicators combined with the objective weight determined by the improved critical method considering the correlation and the amount of information to get the comprehensive weight of the indicators jian et al 2006 the specific steps are as follows 1 determination of subjective weight ω j by g1 1 ω j 1 1 k 2 n j k n r j 2 determination of objective weight ω j by improved critic weight method 1 this paper introduces gini coefficient to measure the contrast strength of indicators gini coefficient is defined according to the lorentz curve which is used to characterize the distribution differences of social wealth among members the larger gini coefficient is the more uneven the distribution of social wealth among members is in the problem of benefit evaluation it is the reflection of the comparative strength of indicators the gini coefficient is calculated as follows 2 ξ j i 1 m k 1 m x i j x k j 2 m i 1 m x i j where ξ j is the gini coefficient of the index u j ξ j 0 1 1 means that the contrast strength of the index is the largest and 0 means that the contrast strength of the index is the smallest 2 in view of the shortcomings of pearson correlation coefficient this paper introduces kendall coefficient to calculate the conflict between the evaluation indexes kendall coefficient is a kind of correlation coefficient used to measure the correlation degree of multiple rank variables its value does not depend on any assumption of data distribution and it is suitable for the complex situation of air combat for any two column variables l t and l j of the evaluation matrix where t j 1 2 suppose that o t p and o j p are the sort values of l t p and l j p in l t and l j respectively then the corresponding sort value variables of o t p and o j p can be combined to form variable pair set o then the p th variable pair of variable pair set o is o t p o j p therefore the kendall correlation coefficients of u t and u j are as follows 3 η t j n c c n d c d e 1 e e e e e e 1 2 d f 1 f f f f f f 1 2 where η t j is the kendall correlation coefficient of column variables l t and l j n c c and n d c are respectively the number of variable pairs with equal element ordering value and the number of variable pairs with unequal element ordering value in set o d m m 1 2 let the same elements in the column variables l t and l j form a small set pair e and f respectively ee and ff represent the number of small sets in the small set pair e and f respectively ee and ff represent the number of elements in the small set pair e and f respectively in order to avoid the influence of the positive and negative correlation coefficient on the index correlation the absolute value of kendall coefficient is taken 3 the objective weight formula of the improved critic method is as follow 4 ω j c j q 1 n c j ξ j l 1 n 1 η l j q 1 n ξ j l 1 n 1 η l j 3 calculate index combination weight ω i 5 ω i ω i ω i i 1 n ω i ω i 2 3 2 calculation of index certainty degree by trapezoid cloud model there are fuzziness and randomness in the corresponding relationship between the quantitative and qualitative index values and the classified grades in the benefit evaluation of east line of south to north water transfer project in view of this uncertain membership relationship cloud model can be well solved by qualitative and quantitative transformation however the traditional cloud model for the existence of multiple elements must belong to the description of conceptual characteristics is not reasonable chen and li 2016 according to the characteristics of the benefit evaluation of the east line of south to north water transfer project the points in a certain range must belong to the concept therefore in this paper the index uncertainty is calculated based on the trapezoidal cloud model theory the specific theory is as follows yu et al 2021 let u x be a quantitative set of precise numerical representation c be qualitative concept on u in a certain finite interval there exists any group of quantitative elements x and x has a random number μ x 0 1 in qualitative concept c with a stable tendency where 6 μ u 0 1 x u x μ x then the distribution x on the set u is called cloud and each point x μ x is called cloud drop the image distribution of cloud drop is similar to trapezoid so it is called trapezoid cloud the interval of x represents the expected interval of trapezoid cloud e x1 e x2 the essence of normal cloud is the special trapezoid cloud when e x1 e x2 trapezoidal cloud model is mainly composed of expectation interval e x1 e x2 e x1 e x2 entropy en and hyper entropy he fu et al 2011 expectation e x1 is the lower boundary position of qualitative concept expectation e x2 is the upper boundary position of qualitative concept entropy en is the cloud drop value range of qualitative concept description domain interval hyper entropy he is the uncertainty of entropy according to the concept of trapezoidal cloud model theory combined with the actual situation of benefit evaluation of the east line of south to north water transfer project through the single rule single condition trapezoid cloud generator composed of x cloud generator and y cloud generator as shown in fig 3 the cloud drop diagram corresponding to each level is calculated qu and yang 2015 when the index is in a certain subordinate state the benefit is in the expected interval which obeys the uniform distribution with the degree of certainty of 1 when the index is in the uncertain membership state that is the benefit is in the unexpected interval the calculation of its uncertainty meets the normal cloud distribution the specific calculation steps are as follows calculate three digital characteristics of trapezoid cloud model e x1 and e x2 are calculated and determined by formula 7 and formula 8 according to the upper and lower critical values of each index value in the benefit evaluation of water diversion project in which e x1 and e x2 of boundary level are equal to the boundary value e n and h e are determined by formula 9 and formula 11 song et al 2017 7 e x 1 i j c i j max 2 c i j min 3 8 e x 2 i j 2 c i j max c i j min 3 9 e n e x 2 i j e x 1 i j 6 10 h e k where c max and c min are the upper and lower limits of the j th evaluation grade corresponding to the i th evaluation index k is a constant given according to experience which can be adjusted according to the characteristics of the variable itself for the indexes with only one side boundary such as c min or c max the default boundary parameters or expected values can be determined according to the maximum upper or lower limits of the evaluation values in recent years and it is consistent with unilateral normal cloud distribution 2 calculate normal random number e n i j 11 e n i j randn 1 h e e n i j 3 calculate index certainty

3 determination of benefit evaluation grade of east line of south to north water transfer project the determination of benefit evaluation grade of east line of south to north water transfer project needs to be combined with the weight of index and the certainty degree of index on the one hand according to the trapezoid cloud model theory we can get the digital characteristics of cloud model under different evaluation levels read the values of each index and get the certainty degree of each index in the east line of south to north water transfer project that belongs to the evaluation level on the other hand according to the g1 method and the improved critic weight method the combination weight of each index is determined the comprehensive certainty degree of each index can be obtained and the benefit evaluation grade of east line of south to north water transfer project is determined by the maximum comprehensive certainty degree by eq 15 yang et al 2019 15 p i j 1 n μ i j x w j in formula p is the comprehensive certainty degree of indexes w j is the combination weight of j th index finally the evaluation value of east line of south to north water transfer project is determined by eq 16 the corresponding evaluation process is shown in fig 4 16 h j 1 n p j k j in formula h is the evaluation value of indexes p is the comprehensive certainty degree of each index k is the level characteristic value of each level more adverse level corresponds to 60 adverse level corresponds to 70 no impact level corresponds to 80 favorable level corresponds to 90 more favorable level corresponds to 100 3 results 3 1 determination of index weight 1 collect the opinions of 5 experts on the weight of each index and use g1 to get the subjective weight of index ω j according to eq 1 as shown in the table below table 3 table index c9 c10 c11 c12 c13 c14 c15 c16 subjective weight 0 0655 0 0643 0 0636 0 0617 0 0579 0 0598 0 0645 0 0627 2 collect the measured data corresponding to each index of jiangsu section of phase i of east line of south to north water transfer project from 2013 to 2017 combined with formula 2 4 the objective weight of indicators is obtained by using the improved critic weight method as shown in table 4 table index c9 c10 c11 c12 c13 c14 c15 c16 objective weight 0 0650 0 0633 0 0631 0 0619 0 0603 0 0609 0 0642 0 0613 3 finally the combination weight is calculated according to eq 5 as shown in table 5 table index c9 c10 c11 c12 c13 c14 c15 c16 combination weight 0 0681 0 0651 0 0642 0 0611 0 0559 0 0582 0 0663 0 0615 from the perspective of the optimized combination weight the economic cost and benefit are the focus of the project construction operation in the cost analysis the highest weight is the operating cost and environmental externalities cost and the lowest is other cost in benefit analysis the highest weight is domestic water supply benefit and the lowest weight is flood control benefit this is mainly because the operation cost and environmental external cost account for a large part of the operation cost of the project construction and the economic benefits of living water supply is the key to the water transfer project because the south to north water transfer project is a large public welfare project so the requirements of other costs are not particularly strict the social benefits are not particularly important compared with other benefits these are basically consistent with the attention paid to all aspects in the process of water transfer operation and management 3 2 calculation of index certainty degree on the basis of the benefit evaluation system of water transfer project determined in table 2 according to the principle of single rule single condition trapezoid cloud generator the certainty degree of each index for different evaluation levels is analyzed it should be noted that for variables with only one sided boundary the boundary parameters need to be determined according to the maximum upper limit or the minimum lower limit in the data according to the digital characteristics of trapezoidal cloud model of water transfer project benefit evaluation index calculated by formula 7 10 a single rule single condition trapezoidal cloud generator is run to generate a cloud drop diagram whose index belongs to the evaluation level as shown in fig 5 in the trapezoid cloud model the abscissa indicates the value of the index and the ordinate indicates that the index is subordinate to the certainty degree of the evaluation grade the order of the evaluation grade in the cloud chart shown in fig 5 1 8 is the same and the order from left to right is more favorable favorable no impact adverse more adverse the order of the evaluation grade in the cloud chart shown in fig 5 9 16 is the opposite from the cloud drop graph of each index in fig 5 it can be concluded that the value of the index belongs to the evaluation level and the data points have some cross phenomenon which not only reflects the large degree of cloud drop dispersion but also reflects the fuzziness and uncertainty when the index value is transformed into the evaluation certainty according to the actual value of each index corresponding to 2013 2017 and the predicted value in the feasibility study report the ratio of each index is obtained and the certainty degree of each level corresponding to the cost type index and benefit type index is calculated from eqs 11 14 in this paper the certainty degree of each index level in 2013 and 2017 is selected for comparison as shown in table 6 according to the calculation results of the level certainty degree of each index in the analysis table 6 since the start of water supply in 2013 most indexes in cost analysis are focused on the adverse and no impact level while most of the indexes in the benefit analysis focus on the adverse level in 2017 most of indexes in cost analysis focused on the adverse level while indexes in benefit analysis except for the main water supply benefits the other benefits tended to be no impact and favorable levels this is mainly due to the adjustment of the construction and operation stage compared with the planning period since phase i of water supply in jiangsu section resulting in a slight increase in the overall cost although the actual water transfer has been steadily improved there is still a certain gap from the planning and design water transfer the main water supply benefits are not ideal and the economic benefits are greatly affected in addition to the task of transferring water to the north the eastern route project ensures the water source for the navigation of the jining xuzhou section of the beijing hangzhou grand canal throughout the year consolidates and develops the two commodity grain bases in western shandong and northern jiangsu and increases the corresponding social benefits at the same time since the water supply in 2013 the water environment has been continuously improved and the water quality along the line is up to the standard and stable which promotes the ecological benefits 4 discussion according to the combination weight and certainty degree of indexes determined in tables 5 and 6 the benefit evaluation grade results of jiangsu section of phase i of east line of south to north water transfer project are calculated by eq 15 and compared with other weight methods and certainty degree calculation methods the calculation results are shown in table 7 it can be seen from table 7 that the benefit evaluation results of jiangsu section of phase i of east line of south to north water transfer project from 2013 to 2017 gradually meet the requirements of various indicators in the feasibility study report in 2013 the maximum comprehensive determination of adverse level is 0 44124 followed by the determination of no impact level is 0 38682 and the final evaluation result is adverse in 2017 the comprehensive certainty degree of no impact grade reached the maximum of 0 51409 and the evaluation result is no impact among them the comprehensive certainty degree of more adverse level decreased from 0 07270 to 0 00713 and adverse level decreased and other levels increased combined with the actual situation although the benefit of jiangsu section project has not yet reached the requirements of the feasibility study report with the continuous increase of the actual water transfer and the increasingly significant effect of comprehensive treatment of water environment along the line the positive trend is more obvious and the benefit of the project is steadily rising after a period of operation in order to reflect the applicability of the evaluation method for the benefit evaluation of the east route of south to north water transfer project the evaluation result of combined weight cloud model and ahp critic trapezoid cloud model are selected to compare with the evaluation result of this paper the specific evaluation results are shown in table 7 it can be seen that the improved critic method can accurately reflect the correlation coefficient between the contrast of evaluation index and the index and can better determine the objective weight of the index so as to avoid the situation that the overall evaluation level drops by one level trapezoidal cloud model has a good ability to determine the evaluation grade when the comprehensive certainty degree value of adverse and no impact are close in the evaluation process so as to avoid the situation that it is difficult to determine when the evaluation grades are close in order to directly reflect the relationship between project cost consumption and benefit exertion from 2013 to 2017 the evaluation value of cost analysis a1 and benefit analysis a2 in each year can be obtained according to eq 16 as shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the positive degree of each index in cost analysis a1 has been at a high level rising from 39 72 in 2013 41 32 in 2017 the positive degree of each index in the benefit analysis a2 is slightly lower than that in the cost analysis a1 but it is in a gradual upward trend from 35 46 in 2013 40 03 in 2017 combined with the actual situation the project cost control scheme design of jiangsu section is more reasonable and the cost investment situation in a period of operation is basically consistent with the design situation since the water supply in 2013 although the project efficiency has not reached the design level it has been in a state of growth and there is a trend that the project investment cost will be balanced and exceeded in the future this is basically according with the actual operation of the project from 2013 to 2017 5 conclusions as an important water resources allocation project to coordinate the contradictions among population productivity ecology and nature the east route of south to north water diversion project is restricted by multiple cost factors such as economy society and environment and is related to the economic social and ecological benefits therefore the benefit evaluation of the east route of south to north water transfer project is particularly important 1 from the perspective of evaluation system the evaluation system including 2 aspects of cost and benefit analysis 6 subsystems and 16 evaluation indexes is constructed the actual situation is compared with the predicted situation and 5 evaluation levels are divided which provides a certain reference for the study of benefit evaluation system of water transfer project 2 from the perspective of evaluation method this paper reasonably considers the influence of index contrast conflict human subjective judgment and other factors and uses g1 method and improved critic method to get the subjective and objective combination weight of the index which has a certain persuasion trapezoidal cloud model has a good performance in solving the problem that the change of index threshold is small and the judgment of the complete subordination of points within a certain range in the process of benefit evaluation at present there is no trapezoidal cloud model evaluation method applied to the benefit evaluation of south to north water transfer project however the theoretical guidance for the selection of digital eigenvalues of trapezoidal cloud model is less further research on digital characteristics is conducive to improving the accuracy of evaluation results 3 from the perspective of evaluation results the benefit of jiangsu section of the east route of south to north water transfer project have been gradually brought into play and the degree of membership to the advantageous level has increased year by year although the scale of the east route pumping station in phase i has met the design requirements there is still a certain gap between the water supply and the design water supply and there is room for further improvement in the future on the basis of reasonably increasing the water supply of the east route of the south to north water transfer project we should strengthen the project cost control ensure the ecological water level and ecological flow of rivers and lakes and maintain the project benefits credit authorship contribution statement conceptualization z y and x h methodology z y and x h software z y validation x h and c l formal

the decline of nutrient concentration in tomato fruit although it enhances the yield alternate partial root drying prd irrigation is a water saving irrigation strategy which may enhance tomato fruit quality including both organic and inorganic attributes yet it remains unknown whether prd could alleviate the negative impact of e co2 on the quality attributes of tomato fruit to investigate that two genotypes of tomato plants differing in their endogenous abscisic acid level i e ailsa craig wild type wt and its correspondent aba deficient mutant flacca were grown in ambient co2 a co2 400 ppm and e co2 800 ppm environment respectively and three irrigation regimes including full irrigation fi deficit irrigation di and prd were applied during anthesis to fruit ripping stages the results showed that e co2 increased net photosynthetic rate decreased stomatal conductance and transpiration rate tomato yield was more sensitive to irrigation regimes than co2 and the reduction of fruit yield caused by prd was attenuated under e co2 especially in flacca both e co2 and prd enhanced water use efficiency the concentration of total soluble solid total sugar and total acid as well as fruit firmness were improved in prd a negative effect of e co2 on fruit mineral nutrition was seen only in flacca and as expected such impact was attenuated by the reduced irrigation regimes di and prd collectively it is suggested that the responses of tomato fruit quality to e co2 and reduced irrigation regimes are genotypic dependent where the endogenous aba level of the plants plays an important role and this must be considered in climate management in greenhouse tomato cultivation keywords co2 elevation fruit quality reduced irrigation water use efficiency 1 introduction water scarcity is a major challenge in the global agricultural sector and in recent decades the problems with limited water resources have exacerbated due to climate change trenberth 2011 iglesias and garrote 2015 in addition to water restrictions rising atmospheric co2 levels alters crop production in terms of quantity and quality morison and morecroft 2007 ainsworth et al 2008 therefore it is essential to understand the plant response to limited water availability under elevated co2 concentrations to maximize crop yield and sustain quality under a changing climate alternate partial root drying irrigation prd is an efficient water saving irrigation strategy kang and zhang 2004 du et al 2008 the prd technique deliver the irrigation water in a spatial and temporal manner where parts of the root system exposure to alternate drying rewetting cycles dry et al 2000 a number of studies have shown that prd has positive effects on tomato growth compared to conventional deficit irrigation di given a similar irrigation volume jensen et al 2010 barrios masias and jackson 2016 pazzagli et al 2016 prd could largely sustain the photosynthetic rate an while substantially reducing stomatal conductance gs resulting in a higher water use efficiency wue liu et al 2006 furthermore it has been suggested that prd has positive effects on fruit quality parameters such as firmness concentrations of total soluble solid and total sugars davies et al 2000 likewise mineral nutrient concentrations in the fruits may also be positively influenced by prd sun et al 2014 wei et al 2018a co2 constitutes the main substrates participating in plant physiological processes and elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations e co2 often results in higher leaf photosynthetic rate an long et al 2004 ainsworth and rogers 2007 furthermore it is well documented that e co2 induces a reduction of the stomatal conductance which in turn restrict the water loss by transpiration and consequently increase the wue ainsworth and long 2005 leakey et al 2009 sun et al 2018 however e co2 induced stomatal closure and subsequent curtailed transpiration rate may likewise reduce the mass flow of mineral ions from the soil solution to the root surface and consequently decrease the nutritional value of crops aggravating the hidden hunger for human nutrition loladze 2014 2002 accordingly e co2 may profit tomato yield long et al 2004 mamatha et al 2014 wei et al 2018a though with negative consequences for the quality of tomato fruits by decreasing the concentrations of soluble solids soluble sugars lycopene helyes et al 2012 and mineral nutrients such as fe mg and zn khan et al 2013 until present most researchers have focused on the nutrient transport and uptake of tomato plants grown under e co2 li et al 2007 wei et al 2018b whereas the effects of e co2 on the tomato fruit quality has not been vastly studied furthermore to cope with the changing conditions for crop production due to climate change the interactive effect of prd and e co2 on the nutritional quality of tomato fruits needs to be researched it is well known that the abscisic acid aba play an essential role in regulating stomatal closure under soil drying liu et al 2005b and thus affecting the transpiration of the plant which could influence the uptake and transport of nutrients at the same time endogenous aba concentrations have pronounced effects on plant shoot development and root growth resulting in changes of the nutrients absorption by roots yang et al 2014 accordingly the fruit quality might be modulated by endogenous aba levels thus to gain insights into the mechanistic response of tomato plants with different endogenous aba concentrations to e co2 and prd two genotypes of tomato i e ailsa craig wild type wt and its correspondent aba deficient mutant flacca were investigated in this study the objective was to explore the interactive effects of prd with e co2 on leaf gas exchange wue and tomato fruit yield and quality characteristics we hypothesized that i e co2 will diminish the yield penalties caused by the prd induced water stress ii prd has the potential to ameliorate the negative influence on fruit quality induced by e co2 and iii endogenous aba level would influence the stomatal closure and shoot physiology under drought stress which would have effects on nutrients absorption and transport thereby affecting the response of tomato quality to prd under high e co2 conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and growth conditions the experiment was carried out in december 2019 to march 2020 in the climate controlled greenhouse at the experimental farm of the department of plant and environmental sciences university of copenhagen taastrup denmark two tomato genotypes including isogenic wild type wt cv ailsa craig tomato and aba deficient tomato mutant flacca were used in this study the aba of flacca is 20 times less than wt due to the impairment in the oxidation of aba aldehyde to aba taylor et al 1988 netting et al 2012 the tomato seeds were sown on 5th dec 2019 under either ambient co2 concentration a co2 400 ppm or elevated co2 concentration e co2 800 ppm respectively at day night air temperature of 23 16 2 c relative humidity of 60 and under 16 h of photosynthetic active radiation par 500 μmol m 2 s 1 sunlight plus led lamps conditions eighteen days after sowing tomato seedlings were transplanted into 10 liter pots 17 cm diameter and 50 cm depth filled with 6 1 kg peat the pots were divided into two identical sized compartments s1 and s2 separated by plastic sheets which were vertically arranged in the middle of each pot and glued to the wall using a silicon sealant hence there was no water exchange between the two compartments the peat used contained 95 organic material with a ph of 5 5 6 5 after transplanting the initial water content of each pot was adjusted to a volumetric soil water content ө of 35 four weeks after transplanting 1 5 g n as urea 1 2 g k and 0 95 g p as monopotassium phosphate were applied with the irrigation water to each pot provide sufficient nutrients for plant growth furthermore the peat surface was covered with perlite to reduce evaporation losses before the irrigation treatments were initiated 2 2 treatments tomato seedlings were grown in two greenhouse cells under a co2 and e co2 environment respectively the plants were well watered in the first three weeks i e at 35 ө and subsequently subjected to three irrigation regimes from anthesis to fruit ripping full irrigation fi the whole pot was irrigated to 35 ө deficit irrigation di whole pot was irrigated with 70 water volume used for fi and alternate prd irrigation prd where 70 water volume used for fi was applied to only one of the root compartments and the irrigation was alternately shifted between the two compartments every 4 7 days when the drying side had a ө of ca 7 10 the irrigation treatments lasted 48 days during which each soil compartment of the prd treatment had experienced five drying wetting cycles the ө in the pots were monitored daily before irrigation by a time domain reflectometry tdr trase soil moisture equipment corp ca usa with probes inserted in the middle of each compartment to a depth of 33 cm the daily water requirement for the fi treatment was calculated as wfi v 35 ɵ1 35 ɵ2 where wfi was the irrigation for fi v was the volume of each soil compartment 5 l ө1 and ө2 were the volumetric soil water content measured in each of the root compartments daily water supply for plants in the di and prd treatments was calculated according to the following formula wdi rrd 0 7 wfi the plants were watered daily manually with tap water 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 plant growth and development the plants were harvest two times during the experimental period the first harvest at the onset the irrigation treatment and the final harvest when the first truss fruits reached red maturity plant samples were divided into four parts leaf stem fruit and root and number of fruits fn and fruit fresh matter ffm were estimated average single fruit fresh matter sffm was calculated as the ratio between ffm and fn the dry matter dm of each plant part was obtained after drying the separate parts at 70 c in an oven to a constant weight total dry matter accumulation δdm during the irrigation treatment period was calculated as the difference of shoot dry matter between first harvest and final harvest 2 3 2 leaf gas exchange and water use efficiency during the irrigation treatment period the leaf gas exchange was measured every two weeks including photosynthetic rate an stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr using a portable photosynthetic system licor 6400xt li cor ne usa measurements were conducted from 9 00 am to 12 00 am with a photosynthetic active radiation par of 1200 μmol m 2 s 1 with a leaf temperature of 23 c and reference co2 of 400 ppm for a co2 and 800 ppm for e co2 treatments respectively intrinsic water use efficiency wuei μmol mol 1 was calculated as the ratio of an μmol m 2 s 1 to gs mol m 2 s 1 and instantaneous water use efficiency wueleaf μmol mmol 1 was calculated as the ratio of an μmol m 2 s 1 to tr mmol m 2 s 1 water use efficiency wuep kg m 3 of the whole plant was computed as the ratio between total dry matter accumulation δdm and plant water use wu in final harvest 2 3 3 fruit quality parameters at the final harvest red matured fruits were collected from the first truss for quality measurement all measurements were performed with four replicates for each irrigation treatment initially fruit firmness fm was determined by a ftx fruit tester wagner instruments greenwich ct united states subsequently half the fruit was cut into small pieces and mashed thoroughly using a fruit blender the homogenate was centrifuged at 4 000g for 5 min and the supernatant was filtered through a syringe filter 0 22 mm acetate cameo osmonics minnetonka mn usa sun et al 2014 wei et al 2018a tss concentration of the juice was determined with a digital refractometer with automatic temperature compensation rfm 90 struers ltd catcliffe rotherham uk and expressed in brix fruit juice concentrations of fructose glucose sucrose citric acid malic acid succinic acid nh4 k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and po4

scientific cambridge uk the elemental concentration of p k ca mg s fe mn zn cu and b in the fruit was measured after digestion with 70 hno3 and 15 h2o2 using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent 5100 agilent technologies manchester uk the fruit c n p k ca mg s fe mn zn cu and b contents were calculated as the fruit elemental concentration multiplies by fruit dry matter 2 4 statistical analysis all data is expressed as mean standard error two way analysis of variance anova was performed for the independent variables co2 concentration co2 and irrigation regime ir using the spss statistics software version 18 0 ibm electronics the differences between treatments were compared by least significant difference lsd test at level of 95 p 0 05 one way anova and lsd test at the 5 confidence level was further executed if there are significant interactions between the independent variables to test for significant differences between treatments in each tomato genotype before analysis of variance anova the data was examined for the homogeneity of variance by levene s test and the shapiro wilks test was used for ensuring the data comply with the normal distribution principle component analysis pca of tomato fruit quality parameters including fm fdm tss tsc tac sar juice quality na nh4 k ca2 mg2 cl po4 3 so4 2 and total mineral nutrients and c

differences between the two genotypes pca were performed in r version 4 0 2 using the devtools wickham et al 2020 and factoextra kassambara and mundt 2020 packages 3 results 3 1 soil water content changes of daily average volumetric soil water content in the pots are illustrated in fig 1 the soil water content showed similar trends for wt and flacca under the same ir treatment in both a co2 and e co2 growth environments in fi soil water contents remained at an average value of ca 30 7 during the 48 days after onset of the irrigation treatment dat in both wt and flacca under a co2 fig 1a while wt plants exposed to e co2 under fi had higher soil water contents than flacca plants fig 1c regardless of co2 environment di caused a drastic reduction of soil water contents in the first 20 dat yet became stable at 10 during the last 28 days in wt and flacca fig 1a c in prd plants soil water contents declined gradually in both soil compartments and reached 15 in the irrigated soil compartment at the end of the treatment fig 1b d 3 2 leaf gas exchange wt had generally lower an tr and gs compared to flacca at both co2 concentrations fig 2a b c e co2 increased an fig 2a while abated gs and tr of both genotypes fig 2b c accordingly the wuei and wueleaf for both genotypes at e co2 were higher than those grown at a co2 fig 2d e still wt plants had higher wuei and wueleaf grown under both co2 concentrations relative to flacca plants fig 2d e ir had significant effect on an gs tr wuei and wueleaf in flacca plants fig 2 while this was not the case in wt moreover there was a significant interaction between co2 and ir on an gs and tr in flacca plants fig 2a b c however for wt the interaction of co2 and ir merely affected tr fig 2c table 1 3 3 plant water use wu plant dry matter accumulation dm and plant water use efficiency wuep the water use wu dry matter accumulation dm and water use efficiency wuep of plant at the final harvest and the output of the two way anova are presented in table 2 for wt the wu and wuep were significantly affected by co2 and ir the wuep was on average 18 9 lower at a co2 compared to e co2 as expected the wu under reduced irrigation was less than under fi furthermore dm was evidently affected by ir and higher dm was found in prd as compared with fi and di irrespective of co2 as for flacca co2 had significant effects on wu dm and wuep while ir only affected wu the dm and wuep of flacca plants under e co2 were greater than those under a co2 surprisingly plants grown at e co2 had higher wu as compared with plants under a co2 generally the wu was decreased by di and by prd treatment there was no interaction effect between co2 and ir on wu dm or wuep in either genotypes table 2 3 4 fruit yield parameters in wt co2 ir and the interaction between these two factors had no impact on fruit number fn and single fruit fresh matter sffm fig 3a b however fruit fresh matter ffm and fruit dry matter fdm for each plant were solely affected by co2 fig 3c d and e co2 decreased ffm and fdm in the case of flacca fn was not affected by any factors fig 3a whereas sffm ffm and fdm were increased by e co2 but were reduced by reduced irrigation regimes fig 3b c d furthermore the interaction between co2 and ir had no effect on fruit yield 3 5 fruit fm tss tsc tac and sar according to the output of the two way anova the fm tss tsc and tac of wt tomato was only affected by ir fig 4 and plants with reduced irrigation had higher fm and tss in both co2 environments fig 4a b greater tsc and tac were recorded in fruits from di treatment compared with fi and prd treatments fig 4c d in regard to the fm and tss in flacca it was shown that both e co2 and reduced irrigation regimes promoted an increase of fm and tss fig 4a b apart from that co2 ir and co2 ir significantly influenced the tac in flacca tomato fig 4d under e co2 fruits of flacca had lower tac than those grown under a co2 fig 4d while co2 did not affect fruit tsc fig 4c resulting in a significant increase in fruit sar when under e co2 table 2 in addition reduced irrigation regimes prominently enhanced the tsc and tac in fruits harvested from e co2 environment fig 4c d across the co2 and ir flacca had higher fm but lower tss and tsc than wt tomato while there was no difference in tac between the two genotypes table 6 3 6 ion concentrations in fruit juice the output of the anova for the ion concentrations in fruit juice is presented in table 3 in wt plants co2 and co2 ir only had significant effects on the concentration of na where e co2 increased the na concentration in the fruit juice of plants from the fi treatment however the nh4 k and mg2 concentrations were greater in di compared to fi and prd treatments whereas the ca2 concentrations in the fruit juice of fruits grown under reduced irrigation were lower than those from the fi treatment in flacca the concentrations of ca2 and po4 3 in the fruit juice were affected by co2 level where the ca2 concentration was lower and po4 3 concentration was higher under e co2 compared to a co2 ir significantly affected the nh4 cl and so4 2 concentrations in the fruit juice where plants grown under reduced irrigation had higher nh4 and so4 2 concentrations but lower cl concentrations as compared to those under fi treatment regardless of co2 furthermore there was no interactions between co2 and ir on all other dissolved ions in the flacca fruit juice compared to wt tomato greater k ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 were found in flacca fruit however na nh4 and po4 3 was unaffected by genotypes table 6 3 7 c and n content and accumulation in fruit dry matter the c and n contents as well as the ratio of c to n c n in fruit are listed in table 2 in wt plants the content of c and n and the c n ratio were not affected by any factors whereas the c accumulation and n uptake were decreased under e co2 as for flacca plants e co2 decreased the c and n contents while increased the c accumulation and c n in fruit in regard to the ir treatments fi lowered the n content and elevated the c accumulation the c content and n uptake were not influenced by ir furthermore the interaction of co2 and ir affected the n content as well and fruits from the plants subjected to di treatment at a co2 condition had highest n content also n content was higher in flacca than in wt table 6 3 8 mineral nutrient concentrations and total uptake in tomato fruits the mineral nutrient concentrations and total uptake in tomato fruits and the output of the two way anova are presented in table 4 and table 5 respectively generally e co2 significantly enhanced the concentration of p ca and b in the wt fruits table 4 however the total uptake of p ca and b in the fruits was not impacted by co2 in wt table 5 e co2 lowered the total fruit uptake of k fe and cu table 5 ir and co2 ir did not significantly affect the mineral nutrient concentrations and the total fruit mineral uptake in wt fruit tables 4 5 in flacca the concentrations of p ca zn and cu were unaffected by co2 ir and the interaction co2 ir however e co2 decreased the fruit concentrations of k mg s fe and mn regardless of the ir treatments though a marked increase in s and fe was observed in fruit under reduced irrigation table 4 furthermore co2 ir had a significant effect on the concentrations of mg s fe mn and b in which the mg s fe and mn concentrations were evidently higher in a co2 di compared to the other treatments while the greatest b concentration was found in e co2 fi table 4 in addition e co2 increased the p ca cu and b uptake in flacca fruit compared to those under a co2 regardless of ir table 5 moreover fi increased the uptake of k ca mg and b of flacca fruit yet the uptake of fe was reduced by fi treatment table 5 besides a significant interaction between co2 and ir were observed on mn and b uptake in flacca fruit and the one way anova revealed that fi increased the uptake of mn and b evidently under e co2 table 5 when referring to the response of nutrients concentration and uptake to the genotypes the output of one way anova for two genotypes table 6 showed that the concentration of p k s and zn in flacca was greater than in wt tomato nevertheless the opposite results was found for ca mg mn and b in addition compared to wt flacca possessed lower uptake of all mineral nutrients except for k and zn 3 9 pca analysis of fruit quality pca plots of tomato fruit quality attributes including fm and quality parameters tss tsc tac sar juice ion concentrations and total nutrient concentrations for the two genotypes are depicted in fig 5 overall the clustering of the different ir and co2 treatments were more distinct for flacca than for wt accordingly pc1 and pc2 combined explained 46 9 and 55 2 of the variation for wt and flacca parameters respectively for wt fig 5a the di treatments under both a co2 and e co2 were somewhat clustered towards the bottom left corner in the same direction as the vectors for the following parameters related to fruit juice quality so4 2 po4 3 k mg2 nh4 and fm tss tac and tsc furthermore the di treatments were opposed by the vectors for fdm sar and dissolved ca2 surprisingly the pca plot for wt further indicated that the general concentration of nutrients were higher in the fi treatment under e co2 as these observations clustered more to the right on the pca plot in the same direction as the vectors for the different nutrient concentrations however as the general clustering of treatments were relatively indistinct also for the 800 fi treatment it is difficult to draw any general trends from the pca plot for the fi and prd treatments conversely the clustering in the pca plot for the flacca fig 5b was more distinct as the a co2 and e co2 treatments separated on each side of the plot a co2 treatment clustered more to the right towards higher total nutrient concentrations whereas e co2 treatment clustered more to the left on the plot in the same direction as fdm sar and c n the clustering of the 400 di treatment indicated higher total nutrient concentrations whereas the clustering of the 800 di treatment indicated higher tss tsc and fm the prd treatment was clustered mainly in the top part of the plot indicating higher fruit juice quality the fi treatments were opposed by most of the fruit juice quality parameters whereas especially a high total content of ca affected the clustering of these observations pca plots of tomato fruit quality variables for the two genotypes are depicted in fig 6 the two genotypes clearly separate on the plot where flacca observations cluster towards the top left corner and wt cluster towards the bottom right corner of the plot wt is clustered towards the same direction as the vectors for fdm sar c n mn c b and mg whereas flacca is clustered towards higher dissolved nutrients in the fruit juice red vectors and higher fm k n s p cu and fe 4 discussion water and co2 are the most essential factors for plant growth and ongoing climate change affects water availability and atmospheric co2 with immense impact on crop growth in the present study we investigated how the water saving irrigation technique prd affected the leaf gas exchange water use efficiency and quality of tomatoes grown under elevated co2 4 1 prd effects on leaf gas exchange and water use efficiency under elevated co2 in accordance with our observations for both wt and flacca plants fig 2 many researchers have recognized that e co2 increase an while decreasing gs and tr ainsworth and rogers 2007 vega mas et al 2015 furthermore we observed that the effect of e co2 on the leaf gas exchange parameters lead to the accession of wuei and wueleaf in both wt and flacca plants fig 2 consistent with the findings of earlier works pazzagli et al 2016 robredo et al 2007 however we only found that there was a significant interaction between ir and co2 treatments in regards to the gas leaf exchange parameters in flacca plants accordingly prd had no significant effect on the leaf gas exchange parameters in wt plants still consistent with previous studies leakey et al 2009 wt plants exposed to prd obtained higher wuep compared to wt plants grown under fi we ascribe this effect to the increased dm and decreased wu in the prd treatment in contrast we found that the water restriction under prd decreased gs and tr fig 1b c in flacca plants when grown under a co2 however no clear effects of prd were observed on dm and wuep of flacca plants table 2 the differences in the response between the two genotypes could be related to the effect of endogenous aba where in wt plants a high aba concentration would cause partial closure of stomata resulting in lower water loss by transpiration which further leads to the increase in wuep fang et al 2019 accordingly gs and tr were at a much lower level in wt plants compared to flacca plants fig 2 4 2 prd effects on fruit yield parameters under elevated co2 tomato is a water demanding crop thus sensitive to water stress chen et al 2013 consequently reduced irrigation regimes consistently negatively affect the fruit yield and biomass jensen et al 2010 wang et al 2015 in contrast e co2 may have positive effects on fruit yield and biomass pazzagli et al 2016 in the present work we observed that the reduced water supply under prd lowered sffm ffm and fdm of tomato fruits from flacca plants while no such differences between irrigation treatments were observed for wt fruits fig 3b c d moreover reduced irrigation and e co2 had no influence on fruit number fn on either genotype which was similar to the observations done by wei et al 2018a positive effects on ffm and fdm under e co2 of tomato fruits were only found in flacca fig 3c d furthermore no evidence was found in this study for the interaction between co2 and ir on fruit yield parameters on either of the two genotypes fig 3 4 3 prd effects on fm tss tsc and tac under elevated co2 previous studies have suggested that reduced irrigation could increase tomato fruit fm tss and tsc but decrease the tac wei et al 2018a consistent with this we found that plants in prd and di had higher fm than those in fi for both genotypes fig 4a which improves the storage and transportation potential of tomato fruits dorais et al 2010 higher fm under water deficit may be related to the decline of internal turgor which could tend to a lower pressure on the cell walls and then to a higher epidermal elasticity guichard et al 2001 likewise greater tss tsc as well as tac were found under reduced irrigation plants as compared to those in fi for both genotypes regardless of the co2 fig 4b c d chen et al 2013 suggested that the elevation of tss under reduced irrigation was associated with the reduction of water uptake in fruits which declined the dilution of solutes in tomato fruit besides sugar and acid are the essential compositions of tss kader 2008 thus the enhanced tsc and tac also contribute to the increase of tss furthermore no differences were found in sar between the different irrigation treatments due to the similar degree of increase in tsc and tac fig 4c d table 2 in this study the flacca plants grown at e co2 produced tomatoes with higher fm and tss fig 4a b this was in line with the findings by wei et al 2018a in contrast a lower tac content was found in flacca fruits under e co2 than under a co2 fig 4d yet no differences in tsc were observed between e co2 and a co2 fig 4c resulting in an enhanced sar in fruit harvested at e co2 table 2 indicating a higher sweetness of tomato fruit in flacca hou et al 2017 nevertheless the fm and all other quality parameters of wt tomato were unaffected by co2 fig 4 however there was a significant interaction between co2 and ir on tac for flacca fruits fig 4d where it was found that fruit under fi treatment and e co2 had the lowest tac tac is one of the components of tss kader 2008 the marked decrease in tac further resulted in a reduction of tss in flacca with fi treatment at e co2 fig 4b in addition evidence has suggested that endogenous aba promote the fruit ripening by improving the ethylene synthesis zhang et al 2009 which would result in a decrease in fruit fm moreover wt is expected to have higher aba in fruits than flacca this might have led to a lower average fm of wt fruit table 6 besides compared to flacca wt possessed greater tsc in the fruits possibly owing to the provoked invertase activity and enhanced hexose concentration induced by high aba ruan et al 2010 here no difference was achieved in tac between wt and flacca therefore greater tss was observed in wt fruit table 6 4 4 prd effects on nutrient quality of tomato fruits under elevated co2 the nutrient content in crops for human nutrition is vital for human health loladze 2002 reduced irrigation may affect the nutrient status in tomato fruit sun et al 2014 wang et al 2010a 2010b due to effects on the soil water dynamics and nutrient mineralization processes etc wang et al 2010a in wt plants di treatment enhanced the concentrations of nh4 k and mg2 and reduced the ca2 concentration in the fruit juice table 3 whereas e co2 only enhanced the na concentration in the fruit juice from wt fruits table 3 however the concentration and uptake of mineral nutrients in the fruits were unaffected by ir tables 4 5 whereas e co2 increased the concentration of p ca and b in tomato fruits table 4 however considering the total fruit uptake of nutrients e co2 negatively affected the total fruit uptake of n k fe and cu in wt plants table 5 this effect is linked to the various changes of fruit nutrient concentrations and fruit dry matter induced by e co2 since the fruit nutrient uptake is calculated as the nutrient concentration times the fruit dry weight in this study e co2 did not cause a significant reduction of n k fe and cu concentrations however the fruit dry matter of wt tomato decreased prominently under e co2 hence the reduced uptake of n k fe and cu in wt fruits under e co2 table 5 in flacca plants reduced irrigation increased the concentrations of nh4 and so4 2 and decreased the concentration of cl in the fruit juice reports have demonstrated that the drying and wetting cycles of the soil in prd enhance soil microbial biological activity and promote n mineralization wang et al 2010b and root growth improving the nitrogen status and assimilation of the plant shahnazari et al 2008 wang et al 2009 2010a in line with this increased n concentrations were found in the fruit dry matter in flacca fruits under reduced irrigation table 2 likewise reduced irrigation elevated the fe and s concentrations table 4 though in contrast the results showed that reduced irrigation negatively affected the uptake of k ca mg and b in flacca fruits table 5 which was assigned to the reduction of fruit dry matter induced by reduced irrigation fig 3d it has been reported that the e co2 may change the stoichiometry in plants because of the various effects on each nutrient baslam et al 2012 loladze 2002 loladze 2002 demonstrated that the nutrient content on average decreased in plants exposed to e co2 which was linked to the dilution induced by increased fruit yield combined with the decreased mass flow caused by reduced transpiration and stomatal conductance under e co2 houshmandfar et al 2015 mcgrath and lobell 2013 lower ca2 concentration were found in flacca fruit juice at e co2 compared with a co2 table 3 it is well known that ca2 moves and transports into the fruit mainly through the xylem hagassou et al 2019 thus the decreased ca2 in fruit juice could be due to the reduction of tr under e co2 thereby inhibiting the migration of ca2 with mass flow to the fruit similarly e co2 decreased k mg s fe and mn concentrations in flacca fruits table 4 however this did not cause a reduction in the total fruit uptake of these nutrients table 5 indicating that the depressed concentrations of k mg s fe and mn were caused by dilution due to the increased fruit dry matter accumulation under e co2 conroy 1992 moreover e co2 enriched the p cu and b uptake table 5 though the average concentration of p cu and b were decreased by e co2 not statistically significant table 4 which could be related to the increased fdm of flacca fruits exposed to e co2 as for the difference in fruit nutrient quality between wt and flacca table 6 fig 6 this study found that all ion concentrations in the fruit juice of flacca were greater than those of wt except for na and nh4 this also appeared for p k s and zn concentrations in fruit dry matter and could be assigned to the lower endogenous aba in flacca previously it was demonstrated that endogenous aba plays a crucial role in regulating the stomatal response to soil e co2 and water stress wei et al 2020 and high endogenous aba would induce stomatal closure and reduce tr liu et al 2005a wei et al 2020 leading to the reduction of mass flow mcgrath and lobell 2013 therefore wt plants with greater aba decreased the transport of nutrients with mass flow from root to fruit on the other hand the fdm of wt was higher than that of flacca increasing the dilution effect on the fruit nutrients which explain why wt obtained greater fruit nutrient uptake at final harvest however surprisingly the concentration of ca mg mn and b in flacca fruit was lower in the fruit dry matter compared to wt fruits the main reason behind this remains unknown which need to be further studied the global picture of fruit quality parameters are depicted in the three pca plots figs 5 and 6 the global pca analysis including both genotypes fig 6 indicate that the flacca fruit have generally higher concentration of nutrients in both the fruit and juice compared to wt fruit yet these results to some extend depend on the higher fdm of wt fruit as discussed above still the overall differences between the two genotypes in relation to fruit quality may well be related to the endogenous aba as this is the main factor differentiating the two genotypes as previously stated the endogenous aba regulates stomatal closure also affecting tr and an when environmental conditions such as the co2 and water accessibility changes accordingly with a low endogenous aba level an gs and tr were generally higher in flacca plants compared to wt plants fig 2 thus the differences in endogenous aba level could be the main driver affecting the fruit quality parameters and the responses to the treatments of ir and co2 between the two genotypes as indicated in the pca plots figs 5 and 6 this in turn highlights the importance of aba in regulating plant gas exchange growth as well as product quality in tomato under reduced irrigation regimes and elevated co2 environment the distinction of clusters between the different ir and co2 treatments differed between the two genotypes fig 5 a more clear distinction between treatment clusters in the flacca plot indicate that flacca plants generally responded more compared to the wt plants to both ir co2 and their interactions overall reduced irrigation resulted in a higher nutrient concentration in both fruit and juice of flacca fruits though there was a tendency towards reduced nutrient concentrations yet increased tss tsc and fm under e co2 in these treatments fig 5 furthermore it seemed that the prd treatments were less affected by co2 compared to di treatments as the prd treatments clustered closer together somewhat independent of co2 on the other hand the effects of the different treatments on the wt fruit quality were more devious and the global trend from the pca plot fig 5 indicated that ir affected the fruit quality parameters slightly more compared to the co2 in the wt plot the general trend was towards a higher fm tss tsc tac and nutrient concentration in the fruit juice except for dissolved ca2 in the treatments with reduced irrigation furthermore the di and fi treatments clustered indictable on each side of the wt plot whereas the prd treatments clustered somewhat in the middle of the plot indicating that the largest differences in the fruit quality was between fi and di 5 conclusions collectively the present study indicated that e co2 increased photosynthesis decreased stomatal conductance and transpiration rate significantly and had positive effects on fruit dry matter accumulation in both wt and flacca in flacca e co2 increased firmness total soluble solid content the ratio of sugar to acid and reduced total acid concentration this not only facilitated the improvement of the storage and transportation potential of tomato fruit but also improved the tomato flavor whereas the firmness the concentrations of total soluble solid total sugar and total acid of wt tomato were unaffected by co2 reduced irrigation di and prd had apparent effects on leaf gas exchange and tomato yield on flacca plants where declined stomatal conductance transpiration rate and fruit yield were observed in flacca tomato while those values in wt tomato were unaffected by ir moreover reduced irrigation enhanced firmness the content of total soluble solid total sugar and total acid in wt and flacca both e co2 and reduced irrigation treatment raised water use efficiency of tomato plant the interaction effects of co2 and ir on fruit quality particularly quality of fruit juice and the elemental nutrients in fruit dry matter were revealed by pca analysis the results indicated that most mineral nutrients were unaffected by prd combined with e co2 indicating that the prd strategy could attenuate the negative effects on tomato quality resulted from e co2 although this effects limited by the genotypes as well overall the effects of reduced irrigation regimes and e co2 on plant physiology and fruit quality attributes are genotypic dependent where endogenous aba level plays a crucial role in modulating leaf gas exchange water use efficiency total soluble solid total sugar total acid and mineral quality

the decline of nutrient concentration in tomato fruit although it enhances the yield alternate partial root drying prd irrigation is a water saving irrigation strategy which may enhance tomato fruit quality including both organic and inorganic attributes yet it remains unknown whether prd could alleviate the negative impact of e co2 on the quality attributes of tomato fruit to investigate that two genotypes of tomato plants differing in their endogenous abscisic acid level i e ailsa craig wild type wt and its correspondent aba deficient mutant flacca were grown in ambient co2 a co2 400 ppm and e co2 800 ppm environment respectively and three irrigation regimes including full irrigation fi deficit irrigation di and prd were applied during anthesis to fruit ripping stages the results showed that e co2 increased net photosynthetic rate decreased stomatal conductance and transpiration rate tomato yield was more sensitive to irrigation regimes than co2 and the reduction of fruit yield caused by prd was attenuated under e co2 especially in flacca both e co2 and prd enhanced water use efficiency the concentration of total soluble solid total sugar and total acid as well as fruit firmness were improved in prd a negative effect of e co2 on fruit mineral nutrition was seen only in flacca and as expected such impact was attenuated by the reduced irrigation regimes di and prd collectively it is suggested that the responses of tomato fruit quality to e co2 and reduced irrigation regimes are genotypic dependent where the endogenous aba level of the plants plays an important role and this must be considered in climate management in greenhouse tomato cultivation keywords co2 elevation fruit quality reduced irrigation water use efficiency 1 introduction water scarcity is a major challenge in the global agricultural sector and in recent decades the problems with limited water resources have exacerbated due to climate change trenberth 2011 iglesias and garrote 2015 in addition to water restrictions rising atmospheric co2 levels alters crop production in terms of quantity and quality morison and morecroft 2007 ainsworth et al 2008 therefore it is essential to understand the plant response to limited water availability under elevated co2 concentrations to maximize crop yield and sustain quality under a changing climate alternate partial root drying irrigation prd is an efficient water saving irrigation strategy kang and zhang 2004 du et al 2008 the prd technique deliver the irrigation water in a spatial and temporal manner where parts of the root system exposure to alternate drying rewetting cycles dry et al 2000 a number of studies have shown that prd has positive effects on tomato growth compared to conventional deficit irrigation di given a similar irrigation volume jensen et al 2010 barrios masias and jackson 2016 pazzagli et al 2016 prd could largely sustain the photosynthetic rate an while substantially reducing stomatal conductance gs resulting in a higher water use efficiency wue liu et al 2006 furthermore it has been suggested that prd has positive effects on fruit quality parameters such as firmness concentrations of total soluble solid and total sugars davies et al 2000 likewise mineral nutrient concentrations in the fruits may also be positively influenced by prd sun et al 2014 wei et al 2018a co2 constitutes the main substrates participating in plant physiological processes and elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations e co2 often results in higher leaf photosynthetic rate an long et al 2004 ainsworth and rogers 2007 furthermore it is well documented that e co2 induces a reduction of the stomatal conductance which in turn restrict the water loss by transpiration and consequently increase the wue ainsworth and long 2005 leakey et al 2009 sun et al 2018 however e co2 induced stomatal closure and subsequent curtailed transpiration rate may likewise reduce the mass flow of mineral ions from the soil solution to the root surface and consequently decrease the nutritional value of crops aggravating the hidden hunger for human nutrition loladze 2014 2002 accordingly e co2 may profit tomato yield long et al 2004 mamatha et al 2014 wei et al 2018a though with negative consequences for the quality of tomato fruits by decreasing the concentrations of soluble solids soluble sugars lycopene helyes et al 2012 and mineral nutrients such as fe mg and zn khan et al 2013 until present most researchers have focused on the nutrient transport and uptake of tomato plants grown under e co2 li et al 2007 wei et al 2018b whereas the effects of e co2 on the tomato fruit quality has not been vastly studied furthermore to cope with the changing conditions for crop production due to climate change the interactive effect of prd and e co2 on the nutritional quality of tomato fruits needs to be researched it is well known that the abscisic acid aba play an essential role in regulating stomatal closure under soil drying liu et al 2005b and thus affecting the transpiration of the plant which could influence the uptake and transport of nutrients at the same time endogenous aba concentrations have pronounced effects on plant shoot development and root growth resulting in changes of the nutrients absorption by roots yang et al 2014 accordingly the fruit quality might be modulated by endogenous aba levels thus to gain insights into the mechanistic response of tomato plants with different endogenous aba concentrations to e co2 and prd two genotypes of tomato i e ailsa craig wild type wt and its correspondent aba deficient mutant flacca were investigated in this study the objective was to explore the interactive effects of prd with e co2 on leaf gas exchange wue and tomato fruit yield and quality characteristics we hypothesized that i e co2 will diminish the yield penalties caused by the prd induced water stress ii prd has the potential to ameliorate the negative influence on fruit quality induced by e co2 and iii endogenous aba level would influence the stomatal closure and shoot physiology under drought stress which would have effects on nutrients absorption and transport thereby affecting the response of tomato quality to prd under high e co2 conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and growth conditions the experiment was carried out in december 2019 to march 2020 in the climate controlled greenhouse at the experimental farm of the department of plant and environmental sciences university of copenhagen taastrup denmark two tomato genotypes including isogenic wild type wt cv ailsa craig tomato and aba deficient tomato mutant flacca were used in this study the aba of flacca is 20 times less than wt due to the impairment in the oxidation of aba aldehyde to aba taylor et al 1988 netting et al 2012 the tomato seeds were sown on 5th dec 2019 under either ambient co2 concentration a co2 400 ppm or elevated co2 concentration e co2 800 ppm respectively at day night air temperature of 23 16 2 c relative humidity of 60 and under 16 h of photosynthetic active radiation par 500 μmol m 2 s 1 sunlight plus led lamps conditions eighteen days after sowing tomato seedlings were transplanted into 10 liter pots 17 cm diameter and 50 cm depth filled with 6 1 kg peat the pots were divided into two identical sized compartments s1 and s2 separated by plastic sheets which were vertically arranged in the middle of each pot and glued to the wall using a silicon sealant hence there was no water exchange between the two compartments the peat used contained 95 organic material with a ph of 5 5 6 5 after transplanting the initial water content of each pot was adjusted to a volumetric soil water content ө of 35 four weeks after transplanting 1 5 g n as urea 1 2 g k and 0 95 g p as monopotassium phosphate were applied with the irrigation water to each pot provide sufficient nutrients for plant growth furthermore the peat surface was covered with perlite to reduce evaporation losses before the irrigation treatments were initiated 2 2 treatments tomato seedlings were grown in two greenhouse cells under a co2 and e co2 environment respectively the plants were well watered in the first three weeks i e at 35 ө and subsequently subjected to three irrigation regimes from anthesis to fruit ripping full irrigation fi the whole pot was irrigated to 35 ө deficit irrigation di whole pot was irrigated with 70 water volume used for fi and alternate prd irrigation prd where 70 water volume used for fi was applied to only one of the root compartments and the irrigation was alternately shifted between the two compartments every 4 7 days when the drying side had a ө of ca 7 10 the irrigation treatments lasted 48 days during which each soil compartment of the prd treatment had experienced five drying wetting cycles the ө in the pots were monitored daily before irrigation by a time domain reflectometry tdr trase soil moisture equipment corp ca usa with probes inserted in the middle of each compartment to a depth of 33 cm the daily water requirement for the fi treatment was calculated as wfi v 35 ɵ1 35 ɵ2 where wfi was the irrigation for fi v was the volume of each soil compartment 5 l ө1 and ө2 were the volumetric soil water content measured in each of the root compartments daily water supply for plants in the di and prd treatments was calculated according to the following formula wdi rrd 0 7 wfi the plants were watered daily manually with tap water 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 plant growth and development the plants were harvest two times during the experimental period the first harvest at the onset the irrigation treatment and the final harvest when the first truss fruits reached red

the ratio between ffm and fn the dry matter dm of each plant part was obtained after drying the separate parts at 70 c in an oven to a constant weight total dry matter accumulation δdm during the irrigation treatment period was calculated as the difference of shoot dry matter between first harvest and final harvest 2 3 2 leaf gas exchange and water use efficiency during the irrigation treatment period the leaf gas exchange was measured every two weeks including photosynthetic rate an stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr using a portable photosynthetic system licor 6400xt li cor ne usa measurements were conducted from 9 00 am to 12 00 am with a photosynthetic active radiation par of 1200 μmol m 2 s 1 with a leaf temperature of 23 c and reference co2 of 400 ppm for a co2 and 800 ppm for e co2 treatments respectively intrinsic water use efficiency wuei μmol mol 1 was calculated as the ratio of an μmol m 2 s 1 to gs mol m 2 s 1 and instantaneous water use efficiency wueleaf μmol mmol 1 was calculated as the ratio of an μmol m 2 s 1 to tr mmol m 2 s 1 water use efficiency wuep kg m 3 of the whole plant was computed as the ratio between total dry matter

measurements were performed with four replicates for each irrigation treatment initially fruit firmness fm was determined by a ftx fruit tester wagner instruments greenwich ct united states subsequently half the fruit was cut into small pieces and mashed thoroughly using a fruit blender the homogenate was centrifuged at 4 000g for 5 min and the supernatant was filtered through a syringe filter 0 22 mm acetate cameo osmonics minnetonka mn usa sun et al 2014 wei et al 2018a tss concentration of the juice was determined with a digital refractometer with automatic temperature

changes of daily average volumetric soil water content in the pots are illustrated in fig 1 the soil water content showed similar trends for wt and flacca under the same ir treatment in both a co2 and e co2 growth environments in fi soil water contents remained at an average value of ca 30 7 during the 48 days after onset of the irrigation treatment dat in both wt and flacca under a co2 fig 1a while wt plants exposed to e co2 under fi had higher soil water contents than flacca plants fig 1c regardless of co2 environment di caused a drastic reduction of soil water contents in the first 20 dat yet became stable at 10 during the last 28 days in wt and flacca fig 1a c in prd plants soil water contents declined gradually in both soil compartments and reached 15 in the irrigated soil compartment at the end of the treatment fig 1b d 3 2 leaf gas exchange wt had generally lower an tr and gs compared to flacca at both co2 concentrations fig 2a b c e co2 increased an fig 2a while abated gs and tr of both genotypes fig 2b c accordingly the wuei and wueleaf for both genotypes at e co2 were higher than those grown at a co2 fig 2d e still wt plants had higher wuei and wueleaf grown under both co2 concentrations relative to flacca plants fig 2d e ir had significant effect on an gs tr wuei and wueleaf in flacca plants fig 2 while this was not the case in wt moreover there was a significant interaction between co2 and ir on an gs and tr in flacca plants fig 2a b c however for wt the interaction of co2 and ir merely affected tr fig 2c table 1 3 3 plant water use wu plant dry matter accumulation dm and plant water use efficiency wuep the water use wu dry matter accumulation dm and water use efficiency wuep of plant at the final harvest and the output of the two way anova are presented in table 2 for wt the wu and wuep were significantly affected by co2 and ir the wuep was on average 18 9 lower at a co2 compared to e co2 as expected the wu under reduced irrigation was less than under fi furthermore dm was evidently affected by ir and higher dm was found in prd as compared with fi and di irrespective of co2 as for flacca co2 had significant effects on wu dm and wuep while ir only affected wu the dm and wuep of flacca plants under e co2 were greater than those under a co2 surprisingly plants grown at e co2 had higher wu as compared with plants under a co2 generally the wu was decreased by di and by prd treatment there was no interaction effect between co2 and ir on wu dm or wuep in either genotypes table 2 3 4 fruit yield parameters in wt co2 ir and the interaction between these two factors had no impact on fruit number fn and single fruit fresh matter sffm fig 3a b however fruit fresh matter ffm and fruit dry matter fdm for each plant were solely affected by co2 fig 3c d and e co2 decreased ffm and fdm in the case of flacca fn was not affected by any factors fig 3a whereas sffm ffm and fdm were increased by e co2 but were reduced by reduced irrigation regimes fig 3b c d furthermore the interaction between co2 and ir had no effect on fruit yield 3 5 fruit fm tss tsc tac and sar according to the output of the two way anova the fm tss tsc and tac of wt tomato was only affected by ir fig 4 and plants with reduced irrigation had higher fm and tss in both co2 environments fig 4a b greater tsc and tac were recorded in fruits from di treatment compared with fi and prd treatments fig 4c d in regard to the fm and tss in flacca it was shown that both e co2 and reduced irrigation regimes promoted an increase of fm and tss fig 4a b apart from that co2 ir and co2 ir significantly influenced the tac in flacca tomato fig 4d under e co2 fruits of flacca had lower tac than those grown under a co2 fig 4d while co2 did not affect fruit tsc fig 4c resulting in a significant increase in fruit sar when under e co2 table 2 in addition reduced irrigation regimes prominently enhanced the tsc and tac in fruits harvested from e co2 environment fig 4c d across the co2 and ir flacca had higher fm but lower tss and tsc than wt tomato while there was no difference in tac between the two genotypes table 6 3 6 ion concentrations in fruit juice the output of the anova for the ion concentrations in fruit juice is presented in table 3 in wt plants co2 and co2 ir only had significant effects on the concentration of na where e co2 increased the na concentration in the fruit juice of plants from the fi treatment however the nh4 k and mg2 concentrations were greater in di compared to fi and prd treatments whereas the ca2 concentrations in the fruit juice of fruits grown under reduced irrigation were lower than those from the fi treatment in flacca the concentrations of ca2 and po4 3 in the fruit juice were affected by co2 level where the ca2 concentration was lower and po4 3 concentration was higher under e co2 compared to a co2 ir significantly affected the nh4 cl and so4 2 concentrations in the fruit juice where plants grown under reduced irrigation had higher nh4 and so4 2 concentrations but lower cl concentrations as compared to those under fi treatment regardless of co2 furthermore there was no interactions between co2 and ir on all other dissolved ions in the flacca fruit juice compared to wt tomato greater k ca2 mg2 cl and so4 2 were found in flacca fruit however na nh4 and po4 3 was unaffected by genotypes table 6 3 7 c and n content and accumulation in fruit dry matter the c and n contents as well as the ratio of c to n c n in fruit are listed in table 2 in wt plants the content of c and n and the c n ratio were not affected by any factors whereas the c accumulation and n uptake were decreased under e co2 as for flacca plants e co2 decreased the c and n contents while increased the c accumulation and c n in fruit in regard to the ir treatments fi lowered the n content and elevated the c accumulation the c content and n uptake were not influenced by ir furthermore the interaction of co2 and ir affected the n content as well and fruits from the plants subjected to di treatment at a co2 condition had highest n content also n content was higher in flacca than in wt table 6 3 8 mineral nutrient concentrations and total uptake in tomato fruits the mineral nutrient concentrations and total uptake in tomato fruits and the output of the two way anova are presented in table 4 and table 5 respectively generally e co2 significantly enhanced the concentration of p ca and b in the wt fruits table 4 however the total uptake of p ca and b in the fruits was not impacted by co2 in wt table 5 e co2 lowered the total fruit uptake of k fe and cu table 5 ir and co2 ir did not significantly affect the mineral nutrient concentrations and the total fruit mineral uptake in wt fruit tables 4 5 in flacca the concentrations of p ca zn and cu were unaffected by co2 ir and the interaction co2 ir however e co2 decreased the fruit concentrations of k mg s fe and mn regardless of the ir treatments though a marked increase in s and fe was observed in fruit under reduced irrigation table 4 furthermore co2 ir had a significant effect on the concentrations of mg s fe mn and b in which the mg s fe and mn concentrations were evidently higher in a co2 di compared to the other treatments while the greatest b concentration was found in e co2 fi table 4 in addition e co2 increased the p ca cu and b uptake in flacca fruit compared to those under a co2 regardless of ir table 5 moreover fi increased the uptake of k ca mg and b of flacca fruit yet the uptake of fe was reduced by fi treatment table 5 besides a significant interaction between co2 and ir were observed on mn and b uptake in flacca fruit and the one way anova revealed that fi increased the uptake of mn and b evidently under e co2 table 5 when referring to the response of nutrients concentration and uptake to the genotypes the output of one way anova for two genotypes table 6 showed that the concentration of p k s and zn in flacca was greater than in wt tomato nevertheless the opposite results was found for ca mg mn and b in addition compared to wt flacca possessed lower uptake of all mineral nutrients except for k and zn 3 9 pca analysis of fruit quality pca plots of tomato fruit quality attributes including fm and quality parameters tss tsc tac sar juice ion concentrations and total nutrient concentrations for the two genotypes are depicted in fig 5 overall the clustering of the different ir and co2 treatments were more distinct for flacca than for wt accordingly pc1 and pc2 combined explained 46 9 and 55 2 of the variation for wt and flacca parameters respectively for wt fig 5a the di treatments under both a co2 and e co2 were somewhat clustered towards the bottom left corner in the same direction as the vectors for the following parameters related to fruit juice quality so4 2 po4 3 k mg2 nh4 and fm tss tac and tsc furthermore the di treatments were opposed by the vectors for fdm sar and dissolved ca2 surprisingly the pca plot for wt further indicated that the general concentration of nutrients were higher in the fi treatment under e co2 as these observations clustered more to the right on the pca plot in the same direction as the vectors for the different nutrient concentrations however as the general clustering of treatments were relatively indistinct also for the 800 fi treatment it is difficult to draw any general trends from the pca plot for the fi and prd treatments conversely the clustering in the pca plot for the flacca fig 5b was more distinct as the a co2 and e co2 treatments separated on each side of the plot a co2 treatment clustered more to the right towards higher total nutrient concentrations whereas e co2 treatment clustered more to the left on the plot in the same direction as fdm sar and c n the clustering of the 400 di treatment indicated higher total nutrient concentrations whereas the clustering of the 800 di treatment indicated higher tss tsc and fm the prd treatment was clustered mainly in the top part of the plot indicating higher fruit juice quality the fi treatments were opposed by most of the fruit juice quality parameters whereas especially a high total content of ca affected the clustering of these observations pca plots of tomato fruit quality variables for the two genotypes are depicted in fig 6 the two genotypes clearly separate on the plot where flacca observations cluster towards the top left corner and wt cluster towards the bottom right corner of the plot wt is clustered towards the same direction as the vectors for fdm sar c n mn c b and mg whereas flacca is clustered towards higher dissolved nutrients in the fruit juice red vectors and higher fm k n s p cu and fe 4 discussion water and co2 are the most essential factors for plant growth and ongoing climate change affects water availability and atmospheric co2 with immense impact on crop growth in the present study we investigated how the water saving irrigation technique prd affected the leaf gas exchange water use efficiency and quality of tomatoes grown under elevated co2 4 1 prd effects on leaf gas exchange and water use efficiency under elevated co2 in accordance with our observations for both wt and flacca plants fig 2 many researchers have recognized that e co2 increase an while decreasing gs and tr ainsworth and rogers 2007 vega mas et al 2015 furthermore we observed that the effect of e co2 on the leaf gas exchange parameters lead to the accession of wuei and wueleaf in both wt and flacca plants fig 2 consistent with the findings of earlier works pazzagli et al 2016 robredo et al 2007 however we only found that there was a significant interaction between ir and co2 treatments in regards to the gas leaf exchange parameters in flacca plants accordingly prd had no significant effect on the leaf gas exchange parameters in wt plants still consistent with previous studies leakey et al 2009 wt plants exposed to prd obtained higher wuep compared to wt plants grown under fi we ascribe this effect to the increased dm and decreased wu in the prd treatment in contrast we found that the water restriction under prd decreased gs and tr fig 1b c in flacca plants when grown under a co2 however no clear effects of prd were observed on dm and wuep of flacca plants table 2 the differences in the response between the two genotypes could be related to the effect of endogenous aba where in wt plants a high aba concentration would cause partial closure of stomata resulting in lower water loss by transpiration which further leads to the increase in wuep fang et al 2019 accordingly gs and tr were at a much lower level in wt plants compared to flacca plants fig 2 4 2 prd effects on fruit yield parameters under elevated co2 tomato is a water demanding crop thus sensitive to water stress chen et al 2013 consequently reduced irrigation regimes consistently negatively affect the fruit yield and biomass jensen et al 2010 wang et al 2015 in contrast e co2 may have positive effects on fruit yield and biomass pazzagli et al 2016 in the present work we observed that the reduced water supply under prd lowered sffm ffm and fdm of tomato fruits from flacca plants while no such differences between irrigation treatments were observed for wt fruits fig 3b c d moreover reduced irrigation and e co2 had no influence on fruit number fn on either genotype which was similar to the observations done by wei et al 2018a positive effects on ffm and fdm under e co2 of tomato fruits were only found in flacca fig 3c d furthermore no evidence was found in this study for the interaction between co2 and ir on fruit yield parameters on either of the two genotypes fig 3 4 3 prd effects on fm tss tsc and tac under elevated co2 previous studies have suggested that reduced irrigation could increase tomato fruit fm tss and tsc but decrease the tac wei et al 2018a consistent with this we found that plants in prd and di had higher fm than those in fi for both genotypes fig 4a which improves the storage and transportation potential of tomato fruits dorais et al 2010 higher fm under water deficit may be related to the decline of internal turgor which could tend to a lower pressure on the cell walls and then to a higher epidermal elasticity guichard et al 2001 likewise greater tss tsc as well as tac were found under reduced irrigation plants as compared to those in fi for both genotypes regardless of the co2 fig 4b c d chen et al 2013 suggested that the elevation of tss under reduced irrigation was associated with the reduction of water uptake in fruits which declined the dilution of solutes in tomato fruit besides sugar and acid are the essential compositions of tss kader 2008 thus the enhanced tsc and tac also contribute to the increase of tss furthermore no differences were found in sar between the different irrigation treatments due to the similar degree of increase in tsc and tac fig 4c d table 2 in this study the flacca plants grown at e co2 produced tomatoes with higher fm and tss fig 4a b this was in line with the findings by wei et al 2018a in contrast a lower tac content was found in flacca fruits under e co2 than under a co2 fig 4d yet no differences in tsc were observed between e co2 and a co2 fig 4c resulting in an enhanced sar in fruit harvested at e co2 table 2 indicating a higher sweetness of tomato fruit in flacca hou et al 2017 nevertheless the fm and all other quality parameters of wt tomato were unaffected by co2 fig 4 however there was a significant interaction between co2 and ir on tac for flacca fruits fig 4d where it was found that fruit under fi treatment and e co2 had the lowest tac tac is one of the components of tss kader 2008 the marked decrease in tac further resulted in a reduction of tss in flacca with fi treatment at e co2 fig 4b in addition evidence has suggested that endogenous aba promote the fruit ripening by improving the ethylene synthesis zhang et al 2009 which would result in a decrease in fruit fm moreover wt is expected to have higher aba in fruits than flacca this might have led to a lower average fm of wt fruit table 6 besides compared to flacca wt possessed greater tsc in the fruits possibly owing to the provoked invertase activity and enhanced hexose concentration induced by high aba ruan et al 2010 here no difference was achieved in tac between wt and flacca therefore greater tss was observed in wt fruit table 6 4 4 prd effects on nutrient quality of tomato fruits under elevated co2 the nutrient content in crops for human nutrition is vital for human health loladze 2002 reduced irrigation may affect the nutrient status in tomato fruit sun et al 2014 wang et al 2010a 2010b due to effects on the soil water dynamics and nutrient mineralization processes etc wang et al 2010a in wt plants di treatment enhanced the concentrations of nh4 k and mg2 and reduced the ca2 concentration in the fruit juice table 3 whereas e co2 only enhanced the na concentration in the fruit juice from wt fruits table 3 however the concentration and uptake of mineral nutrients in the fruits were unaffected by ir tables 4 5 whereas e co2 increased the concentration of p ca and b in tomato fruits table 4 however considering the total fruit uptake of nutrients e co2 negatively affected the total fruit uptake of n k fe and cu in wt plants table 5 this effect is linked to the various changes of fruit nutrient concentrations and fruit dry matter induced by e co2 since the fruit nutrient uptake is calculated as the nutrient concentration times the fruit dry weight in this study e co2 did not cause a significant reduction of n k fe and cu concentrations however the fruit dry matter of wt tomato decreased prominently under e co2 hence the reduced uptake of n k fe and cu in wt fruits under e co2 table 5 in flacca plants reduced irrigation increased the concentrations of nh4 and so4 2 and decreased the concentration of cl in the fruit juice reports have demonstrated that the drying and wetting cycles of the soil in prd enhance soil microbial biological activity and promote n mineralization wang et al 2010b and root growth improving the nitrogen status and assimilation of the plant shahnazari et al 2008 wang et al 2009 2010a in line with this increased n concentrations were found in the fruit dry matter in flacca fruits under reduced irrigation table 2 likewise reduced irrigation elevated the fe and s concentrations table 4 though in contrast the results showed that reduced irrigation negatively affected the uptake of k ca mg and b in flacca fruits table 5 which was assigned to the reduction of fruit dry matter induced by reduced irrigation fig 3d it has been reported that the e co2 may change the stoichiometry in plants because of the various effects on each nutrient baslam et al 2012 loladze 2002 loladze 2002 demonstrated that the nutrient content on average decreased in plants exposed to e co2 which was linked to the dilution induced by increased fruit yield combined with the decreased mass flow caused by reduced transpiration and stomatal conductance under e co2 houshmandfar et al 2015 mcgrath and lobell 2013 lower ca2 concentration were found in flacca fruit juice at e co2 compared with a co2 table 3 it is well known that ca2 moves and transports into the fruit mainly through the xylem hagassou et al 2019 thus the decreased ca2 in fruit juice could be due to the reduction of tr under e co2 thereby inhibiting the migration of ca2 with mass flow to the fruit similarly e co2 decreased k mg s fe and mn concentrations in flacca fruits table 4 however this did not cause a reduction in the total fruit uptake of these nutrients table 5 indicating that the depressed concentrations of k mg s fe and mn were caused by dilution due to the increased fruit dry matter accumulation under e co2 conroy 1992 moreover e co2 enriched the p cu and b uptake table 5 though the average concentration of p cu and b were decreased by e co2 not statistically significant table 4 which could be related to the increased fdm of flacca fruits exposed to e co2 as for the difference in fruit nutrient quality between wt and flacca table 6 fig 6 this study found that all ion concentrations in the fruit juice of flacca were greater than those of wt except for na and nh4 this also appeared for p k s and zn concentrations in fruit dry matter and could be assigned to the lower endogenous aba in flacca previously it was demonstrated that endogenous aba plays a crucial role in regulating the stomatal response to soil e co2 and water stress wei et al 2020 and high endogenous aba would induce stomatal closure and reduce tr liu et al 2005a wei et al 2020 leading to the reduction of mass flow mcgrath and lobell 2013 therefore wt plants with greater aba decreased the transport of nutrients with mass flow from root to fruit on the other hand the fdm of wt was higher than that of flacca increasing the dilution effect on the fruit nutrients which explain why wt obtained greater fruit nutrient uptake at final harvest however surprisingly the concentration of ca mg mn and b in flacca fruit was lower in the fruit dry matter compared to wt fruits the main reason behind this remains unknown which need to be further studied the global picture of fruit quality parameters are depicted in the three pca plots figs 5 and 6 the global pca analysis including both genotypes fig 6 indicate that the flacca fruit have generally higher concentration of nutrients in both the fruit and juice compared to wt fruit yet these results to some extend depend on the higher fdm of wt fruit as discussed above still the overall differences between the two genotypes in relation to fruit quality may well be related to the endogenous aba as this is the main factor differentiating the two genotypes as previously stated the endogenous aba regulates stomatal closure also affecting tr and an when environmental conditions such as the co2 and water accessibility changes accordingly with a low endogenous aba level an gs and tr were generally higher in flacca plants compared to wt plants fig 2 thus the differences in endogenous aba level could be the main driver affecting the fruit quality parameters and the responses to the treatments of ir and co2 between the two genotypes as indicated in the pca plots figs 5 and 6 this in turn highlights the importance of aba in regulating plant gas exchange growth as well as product quality in tomato under reduced irrigation regimes and elevated co2 environment the distinction of clusters between the different ir and co2 treatments differed between the two genotypes fig 5 a more clear distinction between treatment clusters in the flacca plot indicate that flacca plants generally responded more compared to the wt plants to both ir co2 and their interactions overall reduced irrigation resulted in a higher nutrient concentration in both fruit and juice of flacca fruits though there was a tendency towards reduced nutrient concentrations yet increased tss tsc and fm under e co2 in these treatments fig 5 furthermore it seemed that the prd treatments were less affected by co2 compared to di treatments as the prd treatments clustered closer together somewhat independent of co2 on the other hand the effects of the different treatments on the wt fruit quality were more devious and the global trend from the pca plot fig 5 indicated that ir affected the fruit quality parameters slightly more compared to the co2 in the wt plot the general trend was towards a higher fm tss tsc tac and nutrient concentration in the fruit juice except for dissolved ca2 in the treatments with reduced irrigation furthermore the di and fi treatments clustered indictable on each side of the wt plot whereas the prd treatments clustered somewhat in the middle of the plot indicating that the largest differences in the fruit quality was between fi and di 5 conclusions collectively the present study indicated that e co2 increased photosynthesis decreased stomatal conductance and transpiration rate significantly and had positive effects on fruit dry matter accumulation in both wt and flacca in flacca e co2 increased firmness total soluble solid content the ratio of sugar to acid and reduced total acid concentration this not only facilitated the improvement of the storage and transportation potential of tomato fruit but also improved the tomato flavor whereas the firmness the concentrations of total soluble solid total sugar and total acid of wt tomato were unaffected by co2 reduced irrigation di and prd had apparent effects on leaf gas exchange and tomato yield on flacca plants where declined stomatal conductance transpiration rate and fruit yield were observed in flacca tomato while those values in wt tomato were unaffected by ir moreover reduced irrigation enhanced firmness the content of total soluble solid total sugar and total acid in wt and flacca both e co2 and reduced irrigation treatment raised water use efficiency of tomato plant the interaction effects of co2 and ir on fruit quality particularly quality of fruit juice and the elemental nutrients in fruit dry matter were revealed by pca analysis the results indicated that most mineral nutrients were unaffected by prd combined with e co2 indicating that the prd strategy could attenuate the negative effects on tomato quality resulted from e co2 although this effects limited by the genotypes as well overall the effects of reduced irrigation regimes and e co2 on plant physiology and fruit quality attributes are genotypic dependent where endogenous aba level plays a crucial role in modulating leaf gas exchange water use efficiency total soluble solid total sugar total acid and mineral quality

10042,the use of technology is spreading rapidly in modern agriculture with remote sensing and sensor technologies becoming more important the objective of this study is to investigate the possibilities of determining the water stress level and irrigation time in peppers using leaf pressure probes based on turgor pressure and thermography techniques an experiment consisting of four different irrigation treatments 100 75 50 and 25 was conducted in canakkale province turkey in the 2017 2018 summer growing seasons during this seasons leaf turgor pressure pp and soil moisture levels were recorded in real time by a remote monitoring system thermographic measurements were taken before each irrigation data were analyzed using the analysis of variance and regression tree methods results show that both pp and thermal data significantly differed according to water stress pp values decreased partially after irrigation and increased until the next irrigation however it was observed that it is not enough to decide the irrigation time using results obtained from graphical readings only models including meteorological features strengthen the decision making models according to the classification and regression tree analysis it was revealed that there is a potential to separate the treatments especially in models including thermal indices leaf turgor pressure data and thermal indices which are plant based monitoring techniques have the potential to be used in determining irrigation time and distinguishing water stress in the pepper plant however there is a need for more studies especially in laboratory conditions to understand the mechanisms in plants and how environmental conditions affect the responses of pp probes keywords water stress turgor pressure probe thermal index pepper data availability requests for data and materials should be addressed to gokhan camoglu 1 introduction the necessity for proper irrigation in arid and semi arid regions where water supply is scarce has encouraged researchers to develop new technologies as a result it has been revealed that plant based methods have important potential in irrigation programming it has been stated that measuring change in leaf water potential crown temperature sap flow and stem diameter for example can be used for precise irrigation planning fernandez and cuevas 2010 although these show the water status of the leaf correctly there are disadvantages to such measurements such as damage to the plant more labor high cost not being able to follow the water situation instantly and incompatibility with automation some such measurements e g with a leaf psychrometer are appropriate for automation to determine the irrigation program however they have not found widespread use because they do not give accurate results dixon and tyree 1984 the disadvantages of many other tools used in plant based observations have also been noted by jones 2004 for this reason methods that can be used more effectively in monitoring leaf water status have been the subject of recent research and focused on systems sensitive to leaf turgor pressure when the turgor pressure starts to decrease the stress phenomenon becomes visible in the plants therefore it can be said that turgor status is the main element in the water potential of plants under water stress conditions kaçar et al 2009 this has led to the development of leaf pressure probes that allow instant and continuous monitoring based on turgor pressure zimmermann et al 2008 various studies have reported that monitoring the water status of plants with these probes is more successful than measurements based on sap flow stem diameter leaf water potential and soil moisture ehrenberger et al 2012 rodriguez dominguez et al 2012 kant et al 2014 marino et al 2021 plant based methods in irrigation programming provide reliable results compared to other techniques because they better reflect the integrated effects of the soil water and atmospheric environment one of these methods the crop water stress index cwsi has been used extensively in irrigation programming in the last 20 years with the spread of portable infrared thermometers the surface temperature can be determined quickly and accurately yazar et al 2007 however today the use of thermal cameras for this purpose has become widespread because the temperature values obtained with infrared thermometers are at leaf level and measurement point only they do not give information about the whole area whereas the temperature of all items entering the image can be determined individually in images taken with thermal cameras this gives important data about the spatial distribution of the temperature and thus the temperature of the desired item can be separated from the images in this way the temperature of items other than plants can be removed and more accurate results can be obtained çamoğlu and genç 2013 unlike the cwsi defined by idso et al 1981 there have been changes in the calculation of cwsi from thermal images leading to the emergence of the modified cwsi jones 1999 the researcher used dry and wet reference surfaces to determine the upper and lower baseline under conditions of zero and maximum transpiration in similar environments while petroleum gel was used for dry reference and water for wet reference numerous studies have been carried out to date to determine the response of peppers to water deficit in these studies subjects such as yield and quality khan et al 2005 sezen et al 2006 demirel et al 2014 rashad et al 2021 physiological characteristics yıldırım et al 2017 camoglu et al 2018 fan et al 2020 water use efficiency karam et al 2009 yıldırım et al 2012 wang et al 2020 were generally investigated since no research has yet been carried out on determining the water stress of pepper using the leaf turgor pressure pp probe and thermography technique among other plant based monitoring methods the need to fill this deficiency became apparent therefore the aims of the study are i to investigate the changes in pp values and thermal indices in different irrigation treatments ii to determine the relationships between meteorological variables and pp values and iii to evaluate the possibilities of determining the water stress level and irrigation time using plant based monitoring methods in pepper 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material study site and experimental design the experiment was carried out at the crop production research station 40 04 28 north latitude and 26 21 51 east longitude of canakkale onsekiz mart university canakkale turkey in 2017 and 2018 the experimental area has a sandy loam soil texture field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp and available water capacity awc in the root zone 0 60 m of the soil which is has sandy loam soil texture were 206 4 mm 125 0 mm and 81 4 mm respectively saturated soil samples were subjected to 1 3 atm and 15 atm pressure until equilibrated in pressure membrane and pressure plate to determine the fc and the pwp respectively the difference between the fc and the pwp was taken to determine the awc cassel and nielsen 1986 bulk density values in the 0 0 3 m and 0 3 0 6 m soil layers are 1 49 g cm 3 and 1 53 g cm 3 respectively mean air temperatures and total rainfall in the growing season may to october were 22 3 c and 143 mm for 2017 and 22 7 c and 187 mm for 2018 based on meteorological data they are 21 1 c and 152 2 mm for long term 1950 2017 aristocrat f1 pepper capsicum annuum l cv california wonder was used in the study the pepper seedlings were planted on 26 05 2017 in the first year and 25 05 2018 in the second year plant densities of the seedlings were settled as 0 70 0 33 m and the size of each plot was 3 5 6 6 m there was a 2 1 m gap between each plot and block to prevent water movement between treatments for the advection that may occur in this gap area not to adversely affect the plants and especially the thermal measurements the peppers were also planted in gap area the field experiment consisted of four different irrigation treatments table 1 with three replicates in a randomized block design after planting the plants were irrigated by a drip irrigation system until soil moisture had reached field capacity to promote adequate development of root and leaf area after this period scheduled irrigation was started at the 45th day after planting dap45 in 2017 and dap47 in 2018 and after that plants were irrigated according to the treatments when 40 5 of the available water capacity in the effective root zone was consumed in s100 in irrigation of the plants between the plots the irrigation treatments of the adjacent plots were taken into account according to the soil analysis results the first fertilization 20 kg ha 1 of 20 20 20 npk trace elements was made together with the planting the second fertilization was carried out at the beginning second irrigation in 2017 and third irrigation in 2018 of flowering 4 l ha 1 of humic acid and 4 kg ha 1 12 8 13 npk 3 mgo trace elements other fertilization processes were carried out during fruit formation 2 kg ha 1 map 12 61 0 and 4 l ha 1 humic acid twice 0 6 l ha 1 16 ca the fertilization process was implemented with the venturi fertilization system in a drip irrigation system 2 2 monitoring of soil moisture and microclimate total 36 soil moisture sensors gs1 model decagon devices inc wa usa for monitoring soil moisture were placed in the soil at a depth of 0 30 cm 30 60 cm and 60 90 cm for each plot about two months before planting to ensure stable readings soil moisture was regularly monitored from the same layers by the gravimetric method from these data obtained calibration was obtained by performing linear regression analysis between the moisture values obtained gravimetrically in response to the sensor values read data on the soil moisture sensors were monitored instantly with a remote monitoring system devint informatics izmir turkey from the internet temperature relative humidity wind speed and precipitation values were recorded on an hourly basis with the assistance of the climate station placed in the experimental area for use in thermal measurements and leaf pressures 2 3 measurement of leaf turgor pressure leaf turgor pressure was monitored in real time by leaf patch clamp pressure lpcp probes yara zim plant technology gmbh hennigsdorf germany the outputs of lpcp are patch pressure pp the probes measure the difference in pressure between the magnets pclamp and the leaf turgor therefore it provides information about the relative change of leaf turgor pressure more detailed principles of this probe are explained by zimmermann et al 2008 the probes of lpcp were mounted on a fully developed leaf of three plants in each plot at the dap41 in the first year and dap46 in the second year fig 1 the zim clamping device was used for assembly and pclamp pressure was kept at a constant value between 20 and 30 kpa care was taken to ensure that the area where the probes were placed on the leaves was not veined dusty or wet the pressure probes were connected to transmitters data from the transmitters were transferred to the base station from which it was transmitted to the server via gprs 2 4 thermal measurements and thermal indices plant canopy temperatures required for the calculation of thermal indices were determined from the images obtained with the help of thermal cameras fluke ti27 model fluke usa thermal measurements were made in each plot of four irrigation treatments between 11 00 and 14 00 before irrigation on days when the weather was sunny and wind speed was less than 2 m s 1 the plants in which the probes of lpcp were connected were selected from the thermal image to determine the average canopy temperatures of each plot the emissivity value of the camera was taken as 0 98 the measurements were carried out with a wide angle lens to see an area of 5 9 m2 from a height of about 3 5 m aluminum foil was used to determine the background temperature in captured thermal images the modified crop water stress index cwsi and stomatal conductance index ig were calculated using the mean canopy and reference temperatures by means of eqs 1 and 2 respectively jones 1999 petroleum jelly and water were used to calculate the wet and dry reference temperature jones et al 2002 therefore these indices were defined as cwsip and igp çamoğlu and genç 2013 the procedure on image processing was followed as described by the same researchers 1 cwsi t canopy t wet t dry t wet 2 i g t dry t canopy t canopy t wet where tcanopy was the canopy temperature obtained from the thermal image and twet and tdry were the temperatures of the wet and dry reference surfaces within same image respectively thermal measurements started at the beginning of flowering in both years and continued during the harvest period measurements were made before irrigations and were taken for 13 times july 4 times august 6 times september 3 times in the first year start date dap49 and finish date dap117 and 11 times july 4 times august 5 times september 2 times in the second year start date dap52 and finish date dap105 2 5 statistical analysis data obtained from the two year field experiments were subjected to variance analysis duncan s multiple comparison test was applied to compare differences between mean values the relationship between thermal indices and environmental variables was investigated using pearson correlation test sas statistical program sas institute 1999 was used for these analyses classification and regression tree crt method was used to determine the classification potential of irrigation treatments by using leaf turgor pressure and meteorological characteristics and thermal indices breiman et al 1984 in this method irrigation treatments were assigned as dependent variables while leaf turgor pressure meteorological characteristics and thermal indices were assigned as independent variables in the statistical analysis of leaf turgor pressure measurements and meteorological characteristics the days corresponding to the thermal measurements were taken into account classification and regression tree was carried out using the r 2 13 package program r development core team 2012 with the rattle package williams 2011 and the graph outputs were obtained interpretations of the crt results were made according to the classification order in crt graphs and the limit values determined for independent variables were attained thus classification potentials of the irrigation treatments were evaluated via data from leaf turgor pressure and meteorological characteristics and thermal indices 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in pp values in this section changes in the pp values of non stress pepper plants the s100 treatment over time were discussed fig 2 blue arrows in the graphs show where there is a decrease after day or night peaks after irrigation red arrows in the graphs show no reaction after irrigation the expected situation is that the pp values decrease at any time of the days days after each irrigation and then rise again until the next irrigation when evaluated from this point of view pp values did not decrease after one irrigation the 18th in probe 2 and two irrigations 4th and 18th in probe 3 of s100 in 2017 it is seen that not all probes give the same response in every irrigation for example in the 4th irrigation only the sensor in the third repetition did not react while the other two sensors did react another instance was in the 4th irrigation where probe 1 and probe 2 responded to irrigation while probe 3 did not in the 18th irrigation only the value of probe 1 decreased after irrigation the deviations of the pp values between the 5th and 6th irrigations show that these probes have been reassembled when the changes after precipitation are analyzed only the values of probe 3 on the dap53 where precipitation occurred tended to fall at night on some days without irrigation e g dap88 and dap100 pp values changed this is related to air temperature and relative humidity with an increase in air temperature and decrease in relative humidity the turgor pressure decreases and accordingly pp values start to increase or vice versa in fact the values obtained from all probes on dap88 marked and probes 1 and 2 on dap100 marked overlap with this information when the values of the s100 treatment in 2018 fig 2 are examined it is seen that irrigation was carried out 15 times in total and there was no decrease in the pp values in any time period of the day after two irrigations in probe 1 one irrigation in probe 2 and four irrigations in probe 3 data was not able to be received due to a malfunction until dap61 which includes the first four irrigations indicated by an orange arrow in probe 2 it is noteworthy that there is no expected trend in some pp values in the graphs for example although probe 3 was reassembled in dap70 it is seen that the graph does not continue with the expected trend until dap101 when the effect of precipitation is analyzed only the value of probe 1 decreased with the first precipitation towards the end of the experiment it is noticeable that there was an unexpected trend in pp values when heavy rains started in general it is difficult to determine the irrigation time or presence of water stress by interpreting only the graphical outputs of pp because meteorological conditions such as temperature and relative humidity have an important effect on the pp values in question indeed li et al 2018 stated that changes in pp were closely related to environmental factors in their study on olives padilla díaz et al 2016 reported that the decision to irrigate by monitoring could only be made by graphics fernandes et al 2017 also created classification models to automatically determine the appropriate irrigation program for olives similar to the study of fernandes et al 2017 martínez gimeno et al 2017 reported in their study on persimmon that the water status of the trees could be monitored with probes but more research was needed for irrigation programming in the current study sudden increases in pp values were sometimes observed such situations may be caused by sudden warming of the side of a leaf that is exposed to the sun while in the shade due to the wind depending on the direction the leaf is facing indeed rüger et al 2010 reported that pp values were significantly affected by leaf direction 3 1 1 proportional change of pp values after irrigation the proportional changes in pp values according to the irrigation treatment in different time periods after irrigation are given in table 2 these values were found by measuring the difference between pre and post irrigation applied every three hours and by dividing the difference according to the pre irrigation value thus based on the time interval it turned out that the turgor state improved according to the table the highest decline was observed in s100 s75 and s50 in both years between 09 05 12 00 h in other words the turgor situation improved more in this period compared to other times the plants passed to a turgor situation in this period due to decreased stomata activity as for s25 this recovery process shifted to later hours and an improvement occurred between the hours of 18 05 21 00 in 2017 and 12 05 15 00 in 2018 it is thought this may be due to excessive stress in the s25 treatment some negative values in the table indicate there was no improvement in that time interval and on the contrary the turgor situation decreased while this circumstance was less in 2017 it was more prevalent in 2018 considering the similar trend of all treatments it is seen that there was no such improvement in the 21 05 00 00 time interval in 2017 and from 00 00 to 09 00 except s75 in the 03 05 06 00 time interval in 2018 when looking at the averages and time intervals broadly it is understood that the decrease in pp values of s50 treatment was higher than the others this shows that the plants in this treatment stored the given water faster in their leaves in other words since s100 and s75 did not have as much stress as the other treatments the differences between turgor states pre and post irrigation are less than s50 the small amount of water given in s25 increased the turgor status less than s50 due to excessive water stress in studies conducted on different plants it was reported that pp values decreased after a certain period of irrigation zimmermann et al 2008 fernandes et al 2017 martínez gimeno et al 2017 marino et al 2021 3 1 2 relationship between pp and meteorological properties according to the correlation analysis to determine the relationship between the proportional decrease of pp after irrigation and weather conditions it was observed that these values were also affected by meteorological conditions in addition to the amount of irrigation water table 3 however the level of influence of the treatments varied according to the time of day and meteorological characteristics in general the correlation coefficients for the temperature values were high in other words the effect of temperature was found to be higher than relative humidity and wind speed li et al 2018 obtained similar results in populus tomentosa plant in our study relative humidity is less related to the proportional decrease in pp compared to other meteorological features in both years and this is generally statistically insignificant the treatment of s50 was less affected by wind speed and temperature and especially relative humidity for example the relationship between relative humidity and proportional decrease in pp was not significant at any time in both years overall the proportional decrease in s50 was more affected by irrigation the reason for which was explained previously in both years the proportional decrease in pp of all treatments was not affected by temperature and relative humidity in the 12 05 15 00 time periods in other words it is considered that the proportional decrease in pp for all treatments in this period is caused by irrigation water 3 2 thermal indices 3 2 1 crop water stress index average cwsip values per month were between 0 39 and 0 86 in 2017 and 0 29 0 74 in 2018 table 4 changes according to the treatments were found statistically significant in each month when the changes of treatments by month are examined it is seen that all treatments had a higher value in september except for s25 in the first year in other words stress increased in this month this did not happen in the second year of the experiment in september 2018 cwsip values were lower than the previous year this can be explained by the fact that precipitation started significantly at the beginning of september in 2018 and thus the stress of the plants decreased the average cwsip values for all measurements were between 0 43 and 0 79 2017 and 0 33 and 0 73 2018 by year according to these values all treatments are statistically separate from each other this shows that cwsip is successful in distinguishing water stress camoglu et al 2018 found average cwsip values of between 0 53 and 0 83 depending on the level of irrigation in their study on the demre pepper variety and reported that all treatments were separate from each other in previous studies it was emphasized that cwsi calculated from thermal images for different plant species can distinguish water stress cohen et al 2005 stated that the cwsi values calculated from thermal images in cotton varied between 0 10 and 0 58 and the index value increased depending on the increase in stress çamoğlu and genç 2013 found the cwsip to be between 0 42 100 and 0 64 25 in the green bean plant reporting that mild stress could not be discriminated with this index however in the findings obtained in the present study it is seen that s100 is statistically different from s75 where mild stress is applied this shows that the discrimination ability of this index may change according to the plant species 3 2 2 stomatal conductance index average igp values by month were obtained as 0 19 1 75 and 0 36 3 02 in the first and second years respectively table 5 the average of all measurements was between 0 31 and 1 48 and 0 40 and 2 44 by year respectively the lowest value of the stomatal conductivity index was 0 and the closeness to this value indicates that the plant was under stress as the degree of stress decreases the value of this index increases jones 1999 in fact the lowest values were obtained from s25 and the highest values were obtained from s100 treatment and they were statistically included in different groups in the first year as in the cwsip the change of igp according to the month except for s25 was significant in the second year no difference was observed this was caused by the precipitation that occurred in september 2018 jones 1999 stated that the ig could be considered as a good indicator in determining the transpiration of plants in our study this index also increased due to the increase in the transpiration of plants padhi et al 2012 reported that the ig calculated empirically in cotton decreased due to the increase in water stress and this decrease was statistically significant çamoğlu and genç 2013 reported in their study on green beans that the igp value dropped from 1 54 to 0 61 due to the increase in water stress the results obtained agree with this study 3 3 decision of water stress in pepper 3 3 1 decision of water stress by pp measurements and meteorological data the results of the classification and regression tree crt created to understand whether irrigation treatments can be distinguished by using meteorological data and pp are presented in fig 3 and the results of the classification matrix are presented in table 6 there were 11 nodes in the classification model it is seen that plants with a pp value over 50 kpa are classified as s25 at the first level in the data wind is also seen as an effective variable in distinguishing plants belonging to the s75 treatment when the wind speed is below 4 5 m s 1 if the pp value of the plants is between 50 kpa and 67 kpa it is classified as s75 based on all these classification results it can be said that plants subjected to different irrigation practices can be distinguished at a certain level by using pp data and meteorological characteristics when the classification matrix of the crt model was examined the average classification error of the model was found to be 36 5 table 6 in other words the classification success of the model is 64 s100 has the highest classification success in the model followed by s25 it is understood that the data of the s75 treatment which has the highest error rate can be related to both s100 and s50 plants in the s50 and s75 treatments were generally grouped outside of their own class this caused an increase in the rate of misclassification in s50 and s75 on the other hand s50 and s75 can be distinguished from plants in other treatments with an acceptable level of success by using the pp data and meteorological characteristics in s25 and s100 3 3 2 decision of water stress by thermal indices in the classification model constructed for thermal indices a total of 26 nodes were formed fig 4 in this model all treatments are classified into two sub nodes except s100 it is understood that both thermal indices affect the classification result of the model the model revealed that the calculated cwsip value is equal to or above 0 64 4th node to distinguish the s25 treatment from the others and if it is below this value the igp value should be considered if the cwsip value is between 0 64 and 0 75 5th node and the igp value is above 0 46 it is seen that the s50 can be distinguished from other treatments it was determined that there are three different classes 6th node 13th node and 24th node to distinguish s75 from other treatments when the cwsip value is 0 64 and the igp value is below 1 2 it is classified as s75 6th node it may be observed that among the plants classified under the sixth node those with a cwsip value above 0 5 13th node are grouped in s75 in the continuation of the sixth node if the cwsip is equal to or higher than 0 5 and the igp is below 0 79 it is classified as 24th node s75 in addition it was concluded that the cwsip value should be below 0 64 and the igp value should be higher than 1 2 in order to distinguish s100 from the other treatments these results revealed that thermal indices can be used for decision on the irrigation management and key parameters were cwsip and igp respectively pepper plants required the water when cwsip reach to 0 64 and igp reach to 0 46 values irrigation can be performed until cwsip values reach under the limit of 0 64 the lowest error 8 3 was obtained with the s25 treatment in the model created according to thermal indices this irrigation treatment was followed by s100 and the classification success was found to be approximately 83 table 7 in the model the classification success of plants in s50 and s75 was found to be relatively low 3 3 3 decision of water stress by pp values and thermal indices according to the regression and decision tree obtained it is seen that the leading variable affecting the classification is the cwsip followed by igp and pp fig 5 when the cwsip value is above 0 64 it is classified under the treatment of s25 2nd node and if this index is equal to or higher than 0 75 it is clearly s25 if the cwsip is equal to or higher than 0 75 it is clearly identified as the s25 treatment when the cwsip value is between 0 64 and 0 75 it is classified as s50 but if the pp is above 72 kpa it is classified as s25 10th node and below it as s50 11th node it is understood that if the cwsip value is below 0 64 and the igp value is above 1 2 it is classified as s100 it can be seen that if the igp value is below 1 2 and the pp is above 65 kpa it is s75 and if the pp is below 65 kpa it is s50 in case of using both thermal and turgor pressure measurement irrigation management can be performed by the limits of cwsip and pp values in crt analysis the limits of key parameters for decision on water stressed plants were 0 64 and 72 for cwsip and pp respectively to supply required amount of water to pepper plants irrigation can be made until decreasing cwsip value under 0 64 and pp value 72 kpa according to the classification matrix results in table 8 it is understood that there is a significant increase in the classification success when the pp and thermal indices are used together the decrease in the classification error of the s75 treatment is especially noteworthy based on these results it can be stated that the combination of pp and thermal indices can contribute to the elimination of complexities in the separation of different irrigation treatments 4 conclusions values of the turgor pressure probe an alternative plant based monitoring technique generally tended to decrease after irrigation and these decreases differed according to the time of day and irrigation levels the greatest decrease recovery in turgor state in pp values after irrigation was generally between 09 00 and 12 00 meteorological factors also exerted an influence the effect of temperature was seen to be greater than other meteorological features for this reason climatic variables should also be monitored in order to evaluate pp values crt models created with thermal indices and by using leaf pressure meteorological features gave successful results in distinguishing water stress considering error rates according to the classification matrix thermal indices gave more satisfactory results for distinguishing water stress in the pepper plant the combination of leaf pressure meteorological characteristics and thermal indices data gave more successful results for distinguishing water stress compared to models where the predictive variables were used alone based on these results it can be suggested that both techniques be used together to differentiate the level of water stress more specifically the results revealed that use of plant based monitoring systems had key parameters for irrigation management in water stressed peppers the key parameters were found as values obtained from cwsip and pp measurements as a result of the study it was seen that pp and thermal data which are plant based monitoring techniques have the potential to determine water stress in peppers however more studies are needed especially in laboratory conditions to distinguish more clearly between irrigation levels and to make the models more accurate for this purpose it is recommended that research focuses on understanding the responses of pp probes to the mechanisms in plants and different environmental conditions also development of a newsletter for farmers may be useful in practical use of plant based monitoring systems declaration of competing interest there is not any conflict of interest acknowledgment this study was funded by the scientific and technological research council of turkey under research project no 116o264 
10042,the use of technology is spreading rapidly in modern agriculture with remote sensing and sensor technologies becoming more important the objective of this study is to investigate the possibilities of determining the water stress level and irrigation time in peppers using leaf pressure probes based on turgor pressure and thermography techniques an experiment consisting of four different irrigation treatments 100 75 50 and 25 was conducted in canakkale province turkey in the 2017 2018 summer growing seasons during this seasons leaf turgor pressure pp and soil moisture levels were recorded in real time by a remote monitoring system thermographic measurements were taken before each irrigation data were analyzed using the analysis of variance and regression tree methods results show that both pp and thermal data significantly differed according to water stress pp values decreased partially after irrigation and increased until the next irrigation however it was observed that it is not enough to decide the irrigation time using results obtained from graphical readings only models including meteorological features strengthen the decision making models according to the classification and regression tree analysis it was revealed that there is a potential to separate the treatments especially in models including thermal indices leaf turgor pressure data and thermal indices which are plant based monitoring techniques have the potential to be used in determining irrigation time and distinguishing water stress in the pepper plant however there is a need for more studies especially in laboratory conditions to understand the mechanisms in plants and how environmental conditions affect the responses of pp probes keywords water stress turgor pressure probe thermal index pepper data availability requests for data and materials should be addressed to gokhan camoglu 1 introduction the necessity for proper irrigation in arid and semi arid regions where water supply is scarce has encouraged researchers to develop new technologies as a result it has been revealed that plant based methods have important potential in irrigation programming it has been stated that measuring change in leaf water potential crown temperature sap flow and stem diameter for example can be used for precise irrigation planning fernandez and cuevas 2010 although these show the water status of the leaf correctly there are disadvantages to such measurements such as damage to the plant more labor high cost not being able to follow the water situation instantly and incompatibility with automation some such measurements e g with a leaf psychrometer are appropriate for automation to determine the irrigation program however they have not found widespread use because they do not give accurate results dixon and tyree 1984 the disadvantages of many other tools used in plant based observations have also been noted by jones 2004 for this reason methods that can be used more effectively in monitoring leaf water status have been the subject of recent research and focused on systems sensitive to leaf turgor pressure when the turgor pressure starts to decrease the stress phenomenon becomes visible in the plants therefore it can be said that turgor status is the main element in the water potential of plants under water stress conditions kaçar et al 2009 this has led to the development of leaf pressure probes that allow instant and continuous monitoring based on turgor pressure zimmermann et al 2008 various studies have reported that monitoring the water status of plants with these probes is more successful than measurements based on sap flow stem diameter leaf water potential and soil moisture ehrenberger et al 2012 rodriguez dominguez et al 2012 kant et al 2014 marino et al 2021 plant based methods in irrigation programming provide reliable results compared to other techniques because they better reflect the integrated effects of the soil water and atmospheric environment one of these methods the crop water stress index cwsi has been used extensively in irrigation programming in the last 20 years with the spread of portable infrared thermometers the surface temperature can be determined quickly and accurately yazar et al 2007 however today the use of thermal cameras for this purpose has become widespread because the temperature values obtained with infrared thermometers are at leaf level and measurement point only they do not give information about the whole area whereas the temperature of all items entering the image can be determined individually in images taken with thermal cameras this gives important data about the spatial distribution of the temperature and thus the temperature of the desired item can be separated from the images in this way the temperature of items other than plants can be removed and more accurate results can be obtained çamoğlu and genç 2013 unlike the cwsi defined by idso et al 1981 there have been changes in the calculation of cwsi from thermal images leading to the emergence of the modified cwsi jones 1999 the researcher used dry and wet reference surfaces to determine the upper and lower baseline under conditions of zero and maximum transpiration in similar environments while petroleum gel was used for dry reference and water for wet reference numerous studies have been carried out to date to determine the response of peppers to water deficit in these studies subjects such as yield and quality khan et al 2005 sezen et al 2006 demirel et al 2014 rashad et al 2021 physiological characteristics yıldırım et al 2017 camoglu et al 2018 fan et al 2020 water use efficiency karam et al 2009 yıldırım et al 2012 wang et al 2020 were generally investigated since no research has yet been carried out on determining the water stress of pepper using the leaf turgor pressure pp probe and thermography technique among other plant based monitoring methods the need to fill this deficiency became apparent therefore the aims of the study are i to investigate the changes in pp values and thermal indices in different irrigation treatments ii to determine the relationships between meteorological variables and pp values and iii to evaluate the possibilities of determining the water stress level and irrigation time using plant based monitoring methods in pepper 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material study site and experimental design the experiment was carried out at the crop production research station 40 04 28 north latitude and 26 21 51 east longitude of canakkale onsekiz mart university canakkale turkey in 2017 and 2018 the experimental area has a sandy loam soil texture field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp and available water capacity awc in the root zone 0 60 m of the soil which is has sandy loam soil texture were 206 4 mm 125 0 mm and 81 4 mm respectively saturated soil samples were subjected to 1 3 atm and 15 atm pressure until equilibrated in pressure membrane and pressure plate to determine the fc and the pwp respectively the difference between the fc and the pwp was taken to determine the awc cassel and nielsen 1986 bulk density values in the 0 0 3 m and 0 3 0 6 m soil layers are 1 49 g cm 3 and 1 53 g cm 3 respectively mean air temperatures and total rainfall in the growing season may to october were 22 3 c and 143 mm for 2017 and 22 7 c and 187 mm for 2018 based on meteorological data they are 21 1 c and 152 2 mm for long term 1950 2017 aristocrat f1 pepper capsicum annuum l cv california wonder was used in the study the pepper seedlings were planted on 26 05 2017 in the first year and 25 05 2018 in the second year plant densities of the seedlings were settled as 0 70 0 33 m and the size of each plot was 3 5 6 6 m there was a 2 1 m gap between each plot and block to prevent water movement between treatments for the advection that may occur in this gap area not to adversely affect the plants and especially the thermal measurements the peppers were also planted in gap area the field experiment consisted of four different irrigation treatments table 1 with three replicates in a randomized block design after planting the plants were irrigated by a drip irrigation system until soil moisture had reached field capacity to promote adequate development of root and leaf area after this period scheduled irrigation was started at the 45th day after planting dap45 in 2017 and dap47 in 2018 and after that plants were irrigated according to the treatments when 40 5 of the available water capacity in the effective root zone was consumed in s100 in irrigation of the plants between the plots the irrigation treatments of the adjacent plots were taken into account according to the soil analysis results the first fertilization 20 kg ha 1 of 20 20 20 npk trace elements was made together with the planting the second fertilization was carried out at the beginning second irrigation in 2017 and third irrigation in 2018 of flowering 4 l ha 1 of humic acid and 4 kg ha 1 12 8 13 npk 3 mgo trace elements other fertilization processes were carried out during fruit formation 2 kg ha 1 map 12 61 0 and 4 l ha 1 humic acid twice 0 6 l ha 1 16 ca the fertilization process was implemented with the venturi fertilization system in a drip irrigation system 2 2 monitoring of soil moisture and microclimate total 36 soil moisture sensors gs1 model decagon devices inc wa usa for monitoring soil moisture were placed in the soil at a depth of 0 30 cm 30 60 cm and 60 90 cm for each plot about two months before planting to ensure stable readings soil moisture was regularly monitored from the same layers by the gravimetric method from these data obtained calibration was obtained by performing linear regression analysis between the moisture values obtained gravimetrically in response to the sensor values read data on the soil moisture sensors were monitored instantly with a remote monitoring system devint informatics izmir turkey from the internet temperature relative humidity wind speed and precipitation values were recorded on an hourly basis with the assistance of the climate station placed in the experimental area for use in thermal measurements and leaf pressures 2 3 measurement of leaf turgor pressure leaf turgor pressure was monitored in real time by leaf patch clamp pressure lpcp probes yara zim plant technology gmbh hennigsdorf germany the outputs of lpcp are patch pressure pp the probes measure the difference in pressure between the magnets pclamp and the leaf turgor therefore it provides information about the relative change of leaf turgor pressure more detailed principles of this probe are explained by zimmermann et al 2008 the probes of lpcp were mounted on a fully developed leaf of three plants in each plot at the dap41 in the first year and dap46 in the second year fig 1 the zim clamping device was used for assembly and pclamp pressure was kept at a constant value between 20 and 30 kpa care was taken to ensure that the area where the probes were placed on the leaves was not veined dusty or wet the pressure probes were connected to transmitters data from the transmitters were transferred to the base station from which it was transmitted to the server via gprs 2 4 thermal measurements and thermal indices plant canopy temperatures required for the calculation of thermal indices were determined from the images obtained with the help of thermal cameras fluke ti27 model fluke usa thermal measurements were made in each plot of four irrigation treatments between 11 00 and 14 00 before irrigation on days when the weather was sunny and wind speed was less than 2 m s 1 the plants in which the probes of lpcp were connected were selected from the thermal image to determine the average canopy temperatures of each plot the emissivity value of the camera was taken as 0 98 the measurements were carried out with a wide angle lens to see an area of 5 9 m2 from a height of about 3 5 m aluminum foil was used to determine the background temperature in captured thermal images the modified crop water stress index cwsi and stomatal conductance index ig were calculated using the mean canopy and reference temperatures by means of eqs 1 and 2 respectively jones 1999 petroleum jelly and water were used to calculate the wet and dry reference temperature jones et al 2002 therefore these indices were defined as cwsip and igp çamoğlu and genç 2013 the procedure on image processing was followed as described by the same researchers 1 cwsi t canopy t wet t dry t wet 2 i g t dry t canopy t canopy t wet where tcanopy was the canopy temperature obtained from the thermal image and twet and tdry were the temperatures of the wet and dry reference surfaces within same image respectively thermal measurements started at the beginning of flowering in both years and continued during the harvest period measurements were made before irrigations and were taken for 13 times july 4 times august 6 times september 3 times in the first year start date dap49 and finish date dap117 and 11 times july 4 times august 5 times september 2 times in the second year start date dap52 and finish date dap105 2 5 statistical analysis data obtained from the two year field experiments were subjected to variance analysis duncan s multiple comparison test was applied to compare differences between mean values the relationship between thermal indices and environmental variables was investigated using pearson correlation test sas statistical program sas institute 1999 was used for these analyses classification and regression tree crt method was used to determine the classification potential of irrigation treatments by using leaf turgor pressure and meteorological characteristics and thermal indices breiman et al 1984 in this method irrigation treatments were assigned as dependent variables while leaf turgor pressure meteorological characteristics and thermal indices were assigned as independent variables in the statistical analysis of leaf turgor pressure measurements and meteorological characteristics the days corresponding to the thermal measurements were taken into account classification and regression tree was carried out using the r 2 13 package program r development core team 2012 with the rattle package williams 2011 and the graph outputs were obtained interpretations of the crt results were made according to the classification order in crt graphs and the limit values determined for independent variables were attained thus classification potentials of the irrigation treatments were evaluated via data from leaf turgor pressure and meteorological characteristics and thermal indices 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in pp values in this section changes in the pp values of non stress pepper plants the s100 treatment over time were discussed fig 2 blue arrows in the graphs show where there is a decrease after day or night peaks after irrigation red arrows in the graphs show no reaction after irrigation the expected situation is that the pp values decrease at any time of the days days after each irrigation and then rise again until the next irrigation when evaluated from this point of view pp values did not decrease after one irrigation the 18th in probe 2 and two irrigations 4th and 18th in probe 3 of s100 in 2017 it is seen that not all probes give the same response in every irrigation for example in the 4th irrigation only the sensor in the third repetition did not react while the other two sensors did react another instance was in the 4th irrigation where probe 1 and probe 2 responded to irrigation while probe 3 did not in the 18th irrigation only the value of probe 1 decreased after irrigation the deviations of the pp values between the 5th and 6th irrigations show that these probes have been reassembled when the changes after precipitation are analyzed only the values of probe 3 on the dap53 where precipitation occurred tended to fall at night on some days without irrigation e g dap88 and dap100 pp values changed this is related to air temperature and relative humidity with an increase in air temperature and decrease in relative humidity the turgor pressure decreases and accordingly pp values start to increase or vice versa in fact the values obtained from all probes on dap88 marked and probes 1 and 2 on dap100 marked overlap with this information when the values of the s100 treatment in 2018 fig 2 are examined it is seen that irrigation was carried out 15 times in total and there was no decrease in the pp values in any time period of the day after two irrigations in probe 1 one irrigation in probe 2 and four irrigations in probe 3 data was not able to be received due to a malfunction until dap61 which includes the first four irrigations indicated by an orange arrow in probe 2 it is noteworthy that there is no expected trend in some pp values in the graphs for example although probe 3 was reassembled in dap70 it is seen that the graph does not continue with the expected trend until dap101 when the effect of precipitation is analyzed only the value of probe 1 decreased with the first precipitation towards the end of the experiment it is noticeable that there was an unexpected trend in pp values when heavy rains started in general it is difficult to determine the irrigation time or presence of water stress by interpreting only the graphical outputs of pp because meteorological conditions such as temperature and relative humidity have an important effect on the pp values in question indeed li et al 2018 stated that changes in pp were closely related to environmental factors in their study on olives padilla díaz et al 2016 reported that the decision to irrigate by monitoring could only be made by graphics fernandes et al 2017 also created classification models to automatically determine the appropriate irrigation program for olives similar to the study of fernandes et al 2017 martínez gimeno et al 2017 reported in their study on persimmon that the water status of the trees could be monitored with probes but more research was needed for irrigation programming in the current study sudden increases in pp values were sometimes observed such situations may be caused by sudden warming of the side of a leaf that is exposed to the sun while in the shade due to the wind depending on the direction the leaf is facing indeed rüger et al 2010 reported that pp values were significantly affected by leaf direction 3 1 1 proportional change of pp values after irrigation the proportional changes in pp values according to the irrigation treatment in different time periods after irrigation are given in table 2 these values were found by measuring the difference between pre and post irrigation applied every three hours and by dividing the difference according to the pre irrigation value thus based on the time interval it turned out that the turgor state improved according to the table the highest decline was observed in s100 s75 and s50 in both years between 09 05 12 00 h in other words the turgor situation improved more in this period compared to other times the plants passed to a turgor situation in this period due to decreased stomata activity as for s25 this recovery process shifted to later hours and an improvement occurred between the hours of 18 05 21 00 in 2017 and 12 05 15 00 in 2018 it is thought this may be due to excessive stress in the s25 treatment some negative values in the table indicate there was no improvement in that time interval and on the contrary the turgor situation decreased while this circumstance was less in 2017 it was more prevalent in 2018 considering the similar trend of all treatments it is seen that there was no such improvement in the 21 05 00 00 time interval in 2017 and from 00 00 to 09 00 except s75 in the 03 05 06 00 time interval in 2018 when looking at the averages and time intervals broadly it is understood that the decrease in pp values of s50 treatment was higher than the others this shows that the plants in this treatment stored the given water faster in their leaves in other words since s100 and s75 did not have as much stress as the other treatments the differences between turgor states pre and post irrigation are less than s50 the small amount of water given in s25 increased the turgor status less than s50 due to excessive water stress in studies conducted on different plants it was reported that pp values decreased after a certain period of irrigation zimmermann et al 2008 fernandes et al 2017 martínez gimeno et al 2017 marino et al 2021 3 1 2 relationship between pp and meteorological properties according to the correlation analysis to determine the relationship between the proportional decrease of pp after irrigation and weather conditions it was observed that these values were also affected by meteorological conditions in addition to the amount of irrigation water table 3 however the level of influence of the treatments varied according to the time of day and meteorological characteristics in general the correlation coefficients for the temperature values were high in other words the effect of temperature was found to be higher than relative humidity and wind speed li et al 2018 obtained similar results in populus tomentosa plant in our study relative humidity is less related to the proportional decrease in pp compared to other meteorological features in both years and this is generally statistically insignificant the treatment of s50 was less affected by wind speed and temperature and especially relative humidity for example the relationship between relative humidity and proportional decrease in pp was not significant at any time in both years overall the proportional decrease in s50 was more affected by irrigation the reason for which was explained previously in both years the proportional decrease in pp of all treatments was not affected by temperature and relative humidity in the 12 05 15 00 time periods in other words it is considered that the proportional decrease in pp for all treatments in this period is caused by irrigation water 3 2 thermal indices 3 2 1 crop water stress index average cwsip values per month were between 0 39 and 0 86 in 2017 and 0 29 0 74 in 2018 table 4 changes according to the treatments were found statistically significant in each month when the changes of treatments by month are examined it is seen that all treatments had a higher value in september except for s25 in the first year in other words stress increased in this month this did not happen in the second year of the experiment in september 2018 cwsip values were lower than the previous year this can be explained by the fact that precipitation started significantly at the beginning of september in 2018 and thus the stress of the plants decreased the average cwsip values for all measurements were between 0 43 and 0 79 2017 and 0 33 and 0 73 2018 by year according to these values all treatments are statistically separate from each other this shows that cwsip is successful in distinguishing water stress camoglu et al 2018 found average cwsip values of between 0 53 and 0 83 depending on the level of irrigation in their study on the demre pepper variety and reported that all treatments were separate from each other in previous studies it was emphasized that cwsi calculated from thermal images for different plant species can distinguish water stress cohen et al 2005 stated that the cwsi values calculated from thermal images in cotton varied between 0 10 and 0 58 and the index value increased depending on the increase in stress çamoğlu and genç 2013 found the cwsip to be between 0 42 100 and 0 64 25 in the green bean plant reporting that mild stress could not be discriminated with this index however in the findings obtained in the present study it is seen that s100 is statistically different from s75 where mild stress is applied this shows that the discrimination ability of this index may change according to the plant species 3 2 2 stomatal conductance index average igp values by month were obtained as 0 19 1 75 and 0 36 3 02 in the first and second years respectively table 5 the average of all measurements was between 0 31 and 1 48 and 0 40 and 2 44 by year respectively the lowest value of the stomatal conductivity index was 0 and the closeness to this value indicates that the plant was under stress as the degree of stress decreases the value of this index increases jones 1999 in fact the lowest values were obtained from s25 and the highest values were obtained from s100 treatment and they were statistically included in different groups in the first year as in the cwsip the change of igp according to the month except for s25 was significant in the second year no difference was observed this was caused by the precipitation that occurred in september 2018 jones 1999 stated that the ig could be considered as a good indicator in determining the transpiration of plants in our study this index also increased due to the increase in the transpiration of plants padhi et al 2012 reported that the ig calculated empirically in cotton decreased due to the increase in water stress and this decrease was statistically significant çamoğlu and genç 2013 reported in their study on green beans that the igp value dropped from 1 54 to 0 61 due to the increase in water stress the results obtained agree with this study 3 3 decision of water stress in pepper 3 3 1 decision of water stress by pp measurements and meteorological data the results of the classification and regression tree crt created to understand whether irrigation treatments can be distinguished by using meteorological data and pp are presented in fig 3 and the results of the classification matrix are presented in table 6 there were 11 nodes in the classification model it is seen that plants with a pp value over 50 kpa are classified as s25 at the first level in the data wind is also seen as an effective variable in distinguishing plants belonging to the s75 treatment when the wind speed is below 4 5 m s 1 if the pp value of the plants is between 50 kpa and 67 kpa it is classified as s75 based on all these classification results it can be said that plants subjected to different irrigation practices can be distinguished at a certain level by using pp data and meteorological characteristics when the classification matrix of the crt model was examined the average classification error of the model was found to be 36 5 table 6 in other words the classification success of the model is 64 s100 has the highest classification success in the model followed by s25 it is understood that the data of the s75 treatment which has the highest error rate can be related to both s100 and s50 plants in the s50 and s75 treatments were generally grouped outside of their own class this caused an increase in the rate of misclassification in s50 and s75 on the other hand s50 and s75 can be distinguished from plants in other treatments with an acceptable level of success by using the pp data and meteorological characteristics in s25 and s100 3 3 2 decision of water stress by thermal indices in the classification model constructed for thermal indices a total of 26 nodes were formed fig 4 in this model all treatments are classified into two sub nodes except s100 it is understood that both thermal indices affect the classification result of the model the model revealed that the calculated cwsip value is equal to or above 0 64 4th node to distinguish the s25 treatment from the others and if it is below this value the igp value should be considered if the cwsip value is between 0 64 and 0 75 5th node and the igp value is above 0 46 it is seen that the s50 can be distinguished from other treatments it was determined that there are three different classes 6th node 13th node and 24th node to distinguish s75 from other treatments when the cwsip value is 0 64 and the igp value is below 1 2 it is classified as s75 6th node it may be observed that among the plants classified under the sixth node those with a cwsip value above 0 5 13th node are grouped in s75 in the continuation of the sixth node if the cwsip is equal to or higher than 0 5 and the igp is below 0 79 it is classified as 24th node s75 in addition it was concluded that the cwsip value should be below 0 64 and the igp value should be higher than 1 2 in order to distinguish s100 from the other treatments these results revealed that thermal indices can be used for decision on the irrigation management and key parameters were cwsip and igp respectively pepper plants required the water when cwsip reach to 0 64 and igp reach to 0 46 values irrigation can be performed until cwsip values reach under the limit of 0 64 the lowest error 8 3 was obtained with the s25 treatment in the model created according to thermal indices this irrigation treatment was followed by s100 and the classification success was found to be approximately 83 table 7 in the model the classification success of plants in s50 and s75 was found to be relatively low 3 3 3 decision of water stress by pp values and thermal indices according to the regression and decision tree obtained it is seen that the leading variable affecting the classification is the cwsip followed by igp and pp fig 5 when the cwsip value is above 0 64 it is classified under the treatment of s25 2nd node and if this index is equal to or higher than 0 75 it is clearly s25 if the cwsip is equal to or higher than 0 75 it is clearly identified as the s25 treatment when the cwsip value is between 0 64 and 0 75 it is classified as s50 but if the pp is above 72 kpa it is classified as s25 10th node and below it as s50 11th node it is understood that if the cwsip value is below 0 64 and the igp value is above 1 2 it is classified as s100 it can be seen that if the igp value is below 1 2 and the pp is above 65 kpa it is s75 and if the pp is below 65 kpa it is s50 in case of using both thermal and turgor pressure measurement irrigation management can be performed by the limits of cwsip and pp values in crt analysis the limits of key parameters for decision on water stressed plants were 0 64 and 72 for cwsip and pp respectively to supply required amount of water to pepper plants irrigation can be made until decreasing cwsip value under 0 64 and pp value 72 kpa according to the classification matrix results in table 8 it is understood that there is a significant increase in the classification success when the pp and thermal indices are used together the decrease in the classification error of the s75 treatment is especially noteworthy based on these results it can be stated that the combination of pp and thermal indices can contribute to the elimination of complexities in the separation of different irrigation treatments 4 conclusions values of the turgor pressure probe an alternative plant based monitoring technique generally tended to decrease after irrigation and these decreases differed according to the time of day and irrigation levels the greatest decrease recovery in turgor state in pp values after irrigation was generally between 09 00 and 12 00 meteorological factors also exerted an influence the effect of temperature was seen to be greater than other meteorological features for this reason climatic variables should also be monitored in order to evaluate pp values crt models created with thermal indices and by using leaf pressure meteorological features gave successful results in distinguishing water stress considering error rates according to the classification matrix thermal indices gave more satisfactory results for distinguishing water stress in the pepper plant the combination of leaf pressure meteorological characteristics and thermal indices data gave more successful results for distinguishing water stress compared to models where the predictive variables were used alone based on these results it can be suggested that both techniques be used together to differentiate the level of water stress more specifically the results revealed that use of plant based monitoring systems had key parameters for irrigation management in water stressed peppers the key parameters were found as values obtained from cwsip and pp measurements as a result of the study it was seen that pp and thermal data which are plant based monitoring techniques have the potential to determine water stress in peppers however more studies are needed especially in laboratory conditions to distinguish more clearly between irrigation levels and to make the models more accurate for this purpose it is recommended that research focuses on understanding the responses of pp probes to the mechanisms in plants and different environmental conditions also development of a newsletter for farmers may be useful in practical use of plant based monitoring systems declaration of competing interest there is not any conflict of interest acknowledgment this study was funded by the scientific and technological research council of turkey under research project no 116o264

in the context of agricultural water planning and management first we summarize how a user can run a model simulation for a selected crop soil climate system next we demonstrate a number of important applications of the model including how a user can apply the model interactively to i evaluate crop water requirements for a number of irrigation management strategies ii identify optimal yield maximizing irrigation strategies given different water use constraints through linkage to python optimization libraries and iii assessing impacts of climate change scenarios on irrigation water demands and crop yields use cases are accompanied by a series of jupyter notebooks available at https github com thomasdkelly aquacrop containing more explicit tutorials on how to use the model to reproduce the analysis presented in this article the reader is encouraged to run these notebooks in combination with this article to better understand the application of acosp as a tool for irrigation management and policy these notebooks can also be used as a basis for development of further customized applications of the code to address local regional and global agricultural challenges 2 getting started running your first simulation with aquacrop ospy notebook 1 in order to setup and run a simulation using acosp the user must first define a range of parameters and inputs to characterize the cropping system being simulated these include daily weather time series along with parameters specifying the crop soil management practices and initial conditions for the simulation for the vast majority of crop simulation models these inputs and parameters are defined either interactively through graphical user interfaces guis or through externally modified input files foster et al 2017 jones et al 2003 raes et al 2009 ragab 2002 rodriguez 2019 however this approach makes it difficult for models to be integrated into larger code bases or optimization packages this approach also limits flexibility to conduct large batch simulations of field scale crop models where many different combinations of input files must be considered e g to reflect spatial heterogeneity in cropping practices across an agricultural landscape or changes in climate variability over time the approach for setting up and running simulations in acosp has been designed to overcome these issues and make it easier to simply and flexibly execute simulations for complex and heterogeneous agricultural production systems after importing acosp into a python editor or notebook the user is able to interactively define each of the main input types of the model climate soil crop management practices and initial soil water and groundwater conditions in each case defaults have been predefined such that the number of required user inputs are minimized but at the same time allowing any of them to be edited by the user as needed all of these component defaults are specified in the class definitions and can be inspected in the source code for notebook environments functions exist that enable the user to directly inspect the source code from the notebook further streamlining the experience for the user and enabling them to quickly customize simulations without the need for a gui interface that constrains wider model uses modifying each of these default components is done when creating the component object and full details are shown in notebook 1 as an example the user could create the default maize crop by running maize cropclass maize plantingdate 05 01 or create a maize crop with an adjusted canopy growth coefficient by running maize2 cropclass maize plantingdate 05 01 cgc 0 001 similarly for the other model components users are able to modify the default input classes and develop new customized classes fig 1 shows an example of the initial setup of crop and soil classes along with initial soil moisture conditions in notebook 1 the user is able to specify climate input data the other key requirement by aquacrop by either selecting one of the predefined inbuilt climate time series or by importing external data files using custom helper functions such as prepare weather fig 1 once the user has defined all input classes and data these components along with user specified start date and end date for the simulation are passed into the aquacropmodel object fig 1 the model is then initialized using model initialize following which the user can choose to execute the model to run forwards n days using model step n or until the end of the specified simulation period using model step till termination true these two options provide flexibility to users allowing planting harvesting or irrigation decisions to be made dynamically based on either internal model variables or external data as an example irrigation decisions can be made on each day from a separate code base which could include groundwater information weather forecasts or machine learning models adeyemi et al 2018 linker and sylaios 2016 sun et al 2017 this feature enables users to define their own custom irrigation strategies incorporating any external code or data or management rules which is either extremely difficult or impossible in other crop water models that incorporate only a fixed set of pre defined irrigation management heuristics once the simulation has finished four different output files will be produced comparable with outputs provided by the original aquacrop model the flux output shows daily water flux variables simulated by or inputted to the model such as total water storage in the crop root zone and precipitation the watercontent output file provides more granular information about the water storage in each compartment on each day of the simulation period the growth output reports daily simulated crop growth state variables such as canopy cover and rooting depth the final output lists the final yield and total irrigation applied for each simulated season full details on the output files can be found in notebook 1 which can also be further customized by users if additional outputs from the model are required 3 irrigation planning and management use cases 3 1 estimating irrigation water demands under different irrigation strategies notebook 2 a common use case for crop water models such as acosp is estimating irrigation water demands in order to support on farm and regional scale planning and allocation of limited freshwater resources araya et al 2017 jiang et al 2016 one of the main strengths of acosp is the ability to rapidly evaluate and compare both simple and complex irrigation strategies which the user can run as batch simulations specified interactively via the irrmngtclass during model setup acosp can be used to simulate a range of irrigation strategies such as soil moisture thresholds set time intervals pre defined calendars and net irrigation that are common to many other crop water models acosp also contains two features that enables arbitrarily complex irrigation strategies to be defined first the model can be run on a daily timestep and second any model variables can be extracted or edited before the next day is run this means that irrigation application decisions can be determined outside the model using information from weather forecasts water availability e g hydrological model or other external databases or models the chosen depth can then be passed back into the model and applied on the next day this ability to represent the complex rules heuristics and behavioral norms that are used by farmers in a given region is not typically available in other crop water models and is essential to the accurate estimation of plot level and regional irrigation water demands to support sustainable and efficient agricultural water management an example of this feature is shown in appendix a of notebook 2 which also showcases examples of more traditional irrigation strategies such as set time intervals and pre defined irrigation calendars to demonstrate the use of acosp in this context we apply the model to evaluate crop yields and irrigation water use over multiple irrigation scheduling strategies this analysis is done for a case study setup of maize production in western nebraska in the united states for the period 1982 2018 summarized in foster et al 2015 the strategies contrasted include seasonal soil moisture thresholds which determine the proportion of total soil water holding capacity at which irrigation is triggered ranging from 0 to 100 constant thresholds such as these are commonly used in modeling studies of irrigation management as part of irrigation advisories provided by soil moisture sensor manufacturers and by farmers themselves blonquist et al 2006 gutierrez et al 2014 this test therefore provides a realistic example of the capabilities of acosp to support evaluation of crop yield responses to variable irrigation management decisions the results show that in the absence of irrigation yields are highly variable and often fail completely fig 2 this dramatic impact of added irrigation illustrates why nebraska has the largest number of irrigated acres in the united states usda nass 2018 reflecting the significant drought risks experienced by many farmers within the state hoerling et al 2014 wilhelmi and wilhite 2002 however the relationship between soil moisture target strategy irrigation and crop yields is non linear demonstrating a typical pattern of diminishing returns to water beyond approximately a soil moisture target of 40 these results and those in appendix a of notebook 2 also show the significant differences in yield and total irrigation between strategies meaning that correctly specifying how farmers make irrigation decisions is essential for accurately estimating irrigation water demands a challenge given the lack of baseline data on water use in many farming regions worldwide closas and molle 2018 foster et al 2020 2019 montginoul et al 2016 3 2 developing and optimizing irrigation strategies notebook 3 in the previous section we demonstrated how acosp could be used to compare yields and water use for different pre specified irrigation thresholds however it is often the case that farmers and water managers lack information apriori about which irrigation strategy will produce the maximum yield for a given level of water use adeyemi et al 2017 determining these optimal strategies in practice would require considerable time and investment and so crop water models are often used in their place often this determination is done via brute force search over possible strategies or leveraging optimization algorithms which can be either time consuming or difficult when using a gui or input file based crop water models araya et al 2017 foster and brozović 2018 garcía vila and fereres 2012 jamal et al 2019 linker et al 2018 in this example use case we show how optimal irrigation schedules can be identified by linking acosp with one of the many optimization modules available in the python ecosystem specifically using the implementation of the model described in section 3 1 we show how acosp can be linked to the optimization library scipy optimize virtanen et al 2020 to identify optimal yield maximizing soil moisture target thresholds over three seasons 2016 2018 for different seasonal water supply constraints i e the maximum amount of water that can be applied in a given season the results highlight again the non linear relationships between crop yields and irrigation water use along with changes in the distribution of water use within seasons characterized by variations in the optimized soil moisture thresholds fig 3 in response to increasing water availability the optimal thresholds generally increase i e it becomes optimal to irrigate at lower levels of soil moisture depletion with water prioritized to mid and late season growth stages when overall supply is scarce as these are the most sensitive periods of crop development for maize the example crop used in this notebook it should be noted that these optimal thresholds have been found with a local optimizer and so re running the analysis in notebook 3 may produce slightly different results than those presented in fig 3 this example analysis shows how acosp can be used to support optimization of irrigation scheduling and water allocation in the context of rising constraints over freshwater availability facing farmers in many regions worldwide mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 for example outputs from this type of analysis can be used to provide advice to farmers about how to effectively optimize water use in the context of hydrologic technical or regulatory supply constraints including selection of efficient and profitable intraseasonal irrigation management rules and heuristics data can also be used to automate and simplify the development of crop water production functions such as shown in fig 3 which can be used by policymakers to evaluate expected crop yield responses to different levels of irrigation water supply and make decisions about efficient allocation of water within the agricultural sector and between agriculture and other water users foster and brozović 2018 igbadun et al 2007 martínez romero et al 2019 users could expand this analysis in a number of ways our example of acosp s optimization integration capabilities was performed for the simple case of a single cropped field with a uniform soil type and uniform weather however this does not reflect the reality for a farmer irrigating larger and more diverse farms and plots the example code provided in notebook 3 could be easily adapted by users to consider more complex optimization problems such as this treating each individual plot or sub plot if considering sub field level decision making as an individual instance of acosp and optimizing over all plot instances simultaneously moreover as the season unfolds there may be a desire to re optimize the irrigation thresholds for a given plot or location to better reflect the current climate condition this again can be implemented in acosp simply by saving the current state of the model at day d and optimizing yield starting from that point using historical data or forecasts this ability to customize irrigation scheduling rules to accurately reflect real world decisions as well as expand the space of potential optimal irrigation strategies is a key benefit of acosp compared to previous crop water models 3 3 irrigation demands under different climate change scenarios notebook 4 irrigation is used by farmers to buffer crops against drought and rainfall variability climate change is therefore likely to affect irrigation water demands in many regions and the ability to predict these changes is essential to support sustainable management of agricultural water use and crop production risks molden 2013 climate change impact assessments are a common use case for crop water models as they allow researchers and policy makers to estimate the potential vulnerabilities or future problems for a producing region dale et al 2017 lehmann et al 2013 rosenzweig et al 2014 semenov 2009 these can focus more directly on how climate changes will impact rainfed production as well as secondary effects such as water use changes for irrigated production these secondary factors will also impact wider issues such as groundwater depletion mcguire 2017 and so it is essential that policy makers and researchers can easily conduct climate change impact assessments using crop water models like acosp building on this need notebook 4 guides users through the process of applying acosp for a simple analysis of irrigation water demands and crop yields under a range of future climate change scenarios acosp includes inbuilt functionality to directly read and format weather time series for future climate scenarios generated externally using the lars wg stochastic weather generator https sites google com view lars wg a widely applied weather generator for agricultural climate impact assessments qian et al 2005 semenov 2009 sha et al 2019 conversion of weather data is achieved using the prepare lars weather function which includes functionality to calculate reference evapotranspiration inputs required by aquacrop important to note is that as long as the final weather dataframe passed into the aquacropmodel object is in the correct format the source of the generated data or the equations used to calculate reference evapotranspiration are arbitrary this flexibility allows users to generate weather time series offline using alternative weather generators to lars wg or other climate datasets models to demonstrate this model application we use acosp to simulate crop yields and irrigation water demands for the same case study of maize production in western nebraska considered in the previous notebooks our analysis uses weather time series generated by lars wg for different future climate time periods 2030 2050 2070 and emissions scenario rcp4 5 rcp8 5 from the ec earth climate model hazeleger et al 2012 this analysis assumes that farmers maintain to the same planting calendar and the same maize variety as well as a constant irrigation threshold of 70 total available water throughout all years these simplifications are made for illustrative purposes of batch climate runs with the model but could be easily relaxed to consider additional variations in management practices crop characteristics etc to support comprehensive analyses of climate impacts and adaptations on crop yields and irrigation water demands the results show that yields increase under these future climate scenarios as a result of higher co2 concentrations which translate into higher water productivity within acosp fig 4 irrigation water use decreases slightly in the climate change scenarios compared to the baseline years a result that can be explained by the predicted increase in seasonal i e summer precipitation in nebraska and the central united states under most future climate change scenarios notebook 4 users could extend this analysis in many ways for example by performing a batch analysis over a wide range of climate scenarios or running acosp over a gridded domain to capture spatial heterogeneities or uncertainties dale et al 2017 by linking these gridded model outputs directly to one of python s many geospatial visualization libraries e g cartopy geopandas regional to global climate change impacts on agricultural production and water use can now be easily performed inside a single jupyter notebook computation efficiency of such analysis can be further improved by parallelizing over multiple processers with users able to install and run acosp on any cloud computing service e g google colab an example of how acosp simulations can be run in parallel is shown in notebook 3 4 outlook aquacrop ospy acosp is a free and fully open source tool that allows researchers industry and policy makers to rapidly leverage crop water simulation to support irrigation planning and management at farm to regional scales the model features a user friendly interactive code design and provides an interface to platforms such as google colab to enable a user to quickly conduct simulations via their web browser and leverage cloud computing resources the extensive python ecosystem means acosp can be easily integrated with the latest machine learning web development statistical and data analysis libraries as well as any other python code base acosp also enables users to bypass the licensing and operating system constrains associated with previous widely used versions of aquacrop uptake of the model by users conducting applied research and teaching on agricultural water management and policy is supported through development of extensive documentation including a series of jupyter notebooks https github com thomasdkelly aquacrop containing tutorials for a range of common use cases of the model related to irrigation planning management and climate adaptation these notebooks are also accompanied by an online forum for users https forum aquacroposforum com which will provide a space for the user community to discuss bugs share example

nutrient cycle algorithms or novel applications of the model e g satellite data assimilation and automated parameter calibration that would be impossible to implement in a scalable or efficient manner

jones et al 2003 raes et al 2009 ragab 2002 rodriguez 2019 however this approach makes it difficult for models to be integrated into larger code bases or optimization packages this approach also limits flexibility to conduct large batch simulations of field scale crop models where many different combinations of input files must be considered e g to reflect spatial heterogeneity in cropping practices across an agricultural landscape or changes in climate variability over time the approach for setting up and running simulations in acosp has been designed to overcome these issues and make it easier to simply and flexibly execute simulations for complex and heterogeneous agricultural production systems after importing acosp into a python editor or notebook the user is able to interactively define each of the main input types of the model climate soil crop management practices and initial soil water and groundwater conditions in each case defaults have been predefined such that the number of required user inputs are minimized but at the same time allowing any of them to be edited by the user as needed all of these component defaults are specified in the class definitions and can be inspected in the source code for notebook environments functions exist that enable the user to directly inspect the source code from the notebook further streamlining the experience for the user and enabling them to quickly customize simulations without the need for a gui interface that constrains wider model uses modifying each of these default components is done when creating the component object and full details are shown in notebook 1 as an example the user could create the default maize crop by running maize cropclass maize plantingdate 05 01 or create a maize crop with an adjusted canopy growth coefficient by running maize2 cropclass maize plantingdate 05 01 cgc 0 001 similarly for the other model components users are able to modify the default input classes and develop new customized classes fig 1 shows an example of the initial setup of crop and soil classes along with initial soil moisture conditions in notebook 1 the user is able to specify climate input data the other key requirement by aquacrop by either selecting one of the predefined inbuilt climate time series or by importing external data files using custom helper functions such as prepare weather fig 1 once the user has defined all input classes and data these components along with user specified start date and end date for the simulation are passed into the aquacropmodel object fig 1 the model is then initialized using model initialize following which the user can choose to execute the model to run forwards n days using model step n or until the end of the specified simulation period using model step till termination true these two options provide flexibility to users allowing planting harvesting or irrigation decisions to be made dynamically based on either internal model variables or external data as an example irrigation decisions can be made on each day from a separate code base which could include groundwater information weather forecasts or machine learning models adeyemi et al 2018 linker and sylaios 2016 sun et al 2017 this feature enables users to define their own custom irrigation strategies incorporating any external code or data or management rules which is either extremely difficult or impossible in other crop water models that incorporate only a fixed set of pre defined irrigation management heuristics once the simulation has finished four different output files will be produced comparable with outputs provided by the original aquacrop model the flux output shows daily water flux variables simulated by or inputted to the model such as total water storage in the crop root zone and precipitation the watercontent output file provides more granular information about the water storage in each compartment on each day of the simulation period the growth output reports daily simulated crop growth state variables such as canopy cover and rooting depth the final output lists the final yield and total irrigation applied for each simulated season full details on the output files can be found in notebook 1 which can also be further customized by users if additional outputs from the model are required 3 irrigation planning and management use cases 3 1 estimating irrigation water demands under different irrigation strategies notebook 2 a common use case for crop water models such as acosp is estimating irrigation water demands in order to support on farm and regional scale planning and allocation of limited freshwater resources araya et al 2017 jiang et al 2016 one of the main strengths of acosp is the ability to rapidly evaluate and compare both simple and complex irrigation strategies which the user can run as batch simulations specified interactively via the irrmngtclass during model setup acosp can be used to simulate a range of irrigation strategies such as soil moisture thresholds set time intervals pre defined calendars and net irrigation that are common to many other crop water models acosp also contains two features that enables arbitrarily complex irrigation strategies to be defined first the model can be run on a daily timestep and second any model variables can be extracted or edited before the next day is run this means that irrigation application decisions can be determined outside the model using information from weather forecasts water availability e g hydrological model or other external databases or models the chosen depth can then be passed back into the model and applied on the next day this ability to represent the complex rules heuristics and behavioral norms that are used by farmers in a given region is not typically available in other crop water models and is essential to the accurate estimation of plot level and regional irrigation water demands to support sustainable and efficient agricultural water management an example of this feature is shown in appendix a of notebook 2 which also showcases examples of more traditional irrigation strategies such as set time intervals and pre defined irrigation calendars to demonstrate the use of acosp in this context we apply the model to evaluate crop yields and irrigation water use over multiple irrigation scheduling strategies this analysis is done for a case study setup of maize production in western nebraska in the united states for the period 1982 2018 summarized in foster et al 2015 the strategies contrasted include seasonal soil moisture thresholds which determine the proportion of total soil water holding capacity at which irrigation is triggered ranging from 0 to 100 constant thresholds such as these are commonly used in modeling studies of irrigation management as part of irrigation advisories provided by soil moisture sensor manufacturers and by farmers themselves blonquist et al 2006 gutierrez et al 2014 this test therefore provides a realistic example of the capabilities of acosp to support evaluation of crop yield responses to variable irrigation management decisions the results show that in the absence of irrigation yields are highly variable and often fail completely fig 2 this dramatic impact of added irrigation illustrates why nebraska has the largest number of irrigated acres in the united states usda nass 2018 reflecting the significant drought risks experienced by many farmers within the state hoerling et al 2014 wilhelmi and wilhite 2002 however the relationship between soil moisture target strategy irrigation and crop yields is non linear demonstrating a typical pattern of diminishing returns to water beyond approximately a soil moisture target of 40 these results and those in appendix a of notebook 2 also show the significant differences in yield and total irrigation between strategies meaning that correctly specifying how farmers make irrigation decisions is essential for accurately estimating irrigation water demands a challenge given the lack of baseline data on water use in many farming regions worldwide closas and molle 2018 foster et al 2020 2019 montginoul et al 2016 3 2 developing and optimizing irrigation strategies notebook 3 in the previous section we demonstrated how acosp could be used to compare yields and water use for different pre specified irrigation thresholds however it is often the case that farmers and water managers lack information apriori about which irrigation strategy will produce the maximum yield for a given level of water use adeyemi et al 2017 determining these optimal strategies in practice would require considerable time and investment and so crop water models are often used in their place often this determination is done via brute force search over possible strategies or leveraging optimization algorithms which can be either time consuming or difficult when using a gui or input file based crop water models araya et al 2017 foster and brozović 2018 garcía vila and fereres 2012 jamal et al 2019 linker et al 2018 in this example use case we show how optimal irrigation schedules can be identified by linking acosp with one of the many optimization modules available in the python ecosystem specifically using the implementation of the model described in section 3 1 we show how acosp can be linked to the optimization library scipy optimize virtanen et al 2020 to identify optimal yield maximizing soil moisture target thresholds over three seasons 2016 2018 for different seasonal water supply constraints i e the maximum amount of water that can be applied in a given season the results highlight again the non linear relationships between crop yields and irrigation water use along with changes in the distribution of water use within seasons characterized by variations in the optimized soil moisture thresholds fig 3 in response to increasing water availability the optimal thresholds generally increase i e it becomes optimal to irrigate at lower levels of soil moisture depletion with water prioritized to mid and late season growth stages when overall supply is scarce as these are the most sensitive periods of crop development for maize the example crop used in this notebook it should be noted that these optimal thresholds have been found with a local optimizer and so re running the analysis in notebook 3 may produce slightly different results than those presented in fig 3 this example analysis shows how acosp can be used to support optimization of irrigation scheduling and water allocation in the context of rising constraints over freshwater availability facing farmers in many regions worldwide mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 for example outputs from this type of analysis can be used to provide advice to farmers about how to effectively optimize water use in the context of hydrologic technical or regulatory supply constraints including selection of efficient and profitable intraseasonal irrigation management rules and heuristics data can also be used to automate and simplify the development of crop water production functions such as shown in fig 3 which can be used by policymakers to evaluate expected crop yield responses to different levels of irrigation water supply and make decisions about efficient allocation of water within the agricultural sector and between agriculture and other water users foster and brozović 2018 igbadun et al 2007 martínez romero et al 2019 users could expand this analysis in a number of ways our example of acosp s optimization integration capabilities was performed for the simple case of a single cropped field with a uniform soil type and uniform weather however this does not reflect the reality for a farmer irrigating larger and more diverse farms and plots the example code provided in notebook 3 could be easily adapted by users to consider more complex optimization problems such as this treating each individual plot or sub plot if considering sub field level decision making as an individual instance of acosp and optimizing over all plot instances simultaneously moreover as the season unfolds there may be a desire to re optimize the irrigation thresholds for a given plot or location to better reflect the current climate condition this again can be implemented in acosp simply by saving the current state of the model at day d and optimizing yield starting from that point using historical data or forecasts this ability to customize irrigation scheduling rules to accurately reflect real world decisions as well as expand the space of potential optimal irrigation strategies is a key benefit of acosp compared to previous crop water models 3 3 irrigation demands under different climate change scenarios notebook 4 irrigation is used by farmers to buffer crops against drought and rainfall variability climate change is therefore likely to affect irrigation water demands in many regions and the ability to predict these changes is essential to support sustainable management of agricultural water use and crop production risks molden 2013 climate change impact assessments are a common use case for crop water models as they allow researchers and policy makers to estimate the potential vulnerabilities or future problems for a producing region dale et al 2017 lehmann et al 2013 rosenzweig et al 2014 semenov 2009 these can focus more directly on how climate changes will impact rainfed production as well as secondary effects such as water use changes for irrigated production these secondary factors will also impact wider issues such as groundwater depletion mcguire 2017 and so it is essential that policy makers and researchers can easily conduct climate change impact assessments using crop water models like acosp building on this need notebook 4 guides users through the process of applying acosp for a simple analysis of irrigation water demands and crop yields under a range of future climate change scenarios acosp includes inbuilt functionality to directly read and format weather time series for future climate scenarios generated externally using the lars wg stochastic weather generator https sites google com view lars wg a widely applied weather generator for agricultural climate impact assessments qian et al 2005 semenov 2009 sha et al 2019 conversion of weather data is achieved using the prepare lars weather function which includes functionality to calculate reference evapotranspiration inputs required by aquacrop important to note is that as long as the final weather dataframe passed into the aquacropmodel object is in the correct format the source of the generated data or the equations used to calculate reference evapotranspiration are arbitrary this flexibility allows users to generate weather time series offline using alternative weather generators to lars wg or other climate datasets models to demonstrate this model application we use acosp to simulate crop yields and irrigation water demands for the same case study of maize production in western nebraska considered in the previous notebooks our analysis uses weather time series generated by lars wg for different future climate time periods 2030 2050 2070 and emissions scenario rcp4 5 rcp8 5 from the ec earth climate model hazeleger et al 2012 this analysis assumes that farmers maintain to the same planting calendar and the same maize variety as well as a constant irrigation threshold of 70 total available water throughout all years these simplifications are made for illustrative purposes of batch climate runs with the model but could be easily relaxed to consider additional variations in management practices crop characteristics etc to support comprehensive analyses of climate impacts and adaptations on crop yields and irrigation water demands the results show that yields increase under these future climate scenarios as a result of higher co2 concentrations which translate into higher water productivity within acosp fig 4 irrigation water use decreases slightly in the climate change scenarios compared to the baseline years a result that can be explained by the predicted increase in seasonal i e summer precipitation in nebraska and the central united states under most future climate change scenarios notebook 4 users could extend this analysis in many ways for example by performing a batch analysis over a wide range of climate scenarios or running acosp over a gridded domain to capture spatial heterogeneities or uncertainties dale et al 2017 by linking these gridded model outputs directly to one of python s many geospatial visualization libraries e g cartopy geopandas regional to global climate change impacts on agricultural production and water use can now be easily performed inside a single jupyter notebook computation efficiency of such analysis can be further improved by parallelizing over multiple processers with users able to install and run acosp on any cloud computing service e g google colab an example of how acosp simulations can be run in parallel is shown in notebook 3 4 outlook aquacrop ospy acosp is a free and fully open source tool that allows researchers industry and policy makers to rapidly leverage crop water simulation to support irrigation planning and management at farm to regional scales the model features a user friendly interactive code design and provides an interface to platforms such as google colab to enable a user to quickly conduct simulations via their web browser and leverage cloud computing resources the extensive python ecosystem means acosp can be easily integrated with the latest machine learning web development statistical and data analysis libraries as well as any other python code base acosp also enables users to bypass the licensing and operating system constrains associated with previous widely used versions of aquacrop uptake of the model by users conducting applied research and teaching on agricultural water management and policy is supported through development of extensive documentation including a series of jupyter notebooks https github com thomasdkelly aquacrop containing tutorials for a range of common use cases of the model related to irrigation planning management and climate adaptation these notebooks are also accompanied by an online forum for users https forum aquacroposforum com which will provide a space for the user community to discuss bugs share example applications and contribute to future development of aquacrop for example opportunity exists for users to contribute to refinement of internal model routines e g more advanced soil moisture flow or nutrient cycle algorithms or novel applications of the model e g satellite data assimilation and automated parameter calibration that would be impossible to implement in a scalable or efficient manner with closed source software through these innovations we expect that acosp will help address a number of the issues that have constrained the use of crop water models in both policy practise and applied research surrounding agricultural water management at field catchment and global scales future work will support the maintenance of core model source code in line with future aquacrop

10044,increasing occurrences of droughts across europe and elsewhere require landscape wide water retention assessments to evaluate water supply sustainabilities for local and regional use this article reports on the results of a study designed to digitally delineate connect and categorize recurring depression wetness across a rurally cultured morainal landscape at 1 m resolution to do this a digital terrain model dtm 1 m resolution was used to locate and characterize each terrain detectable depression by type depth area and volume together with their flow channel connections and upslope flow accumulation areas in addition historical 2008 2017 google earth images and a local daily weather report were used to index and verify weather and season induced changes in depression wetness based on ground coloration vegetation coverage and image date developing and applying these procedures by way of a case study revealed i that about 90 of the image indexed depression wetness variations could mostly be attributed to dtm determined depression type area and depth and ii that image recognized wetness variations were consistent with weather modelled soil moisture projections the results so obtained can be used to quantify potential drought resiliency in terms water retention volumes per depression since the procedures as described have a broad application potential they can be used globally for drought resiliency evaluations and agricultural water management graphical abstract ga1 keywords post glacial landscape digital elevation modelling depressions recurring wetness flow channels historical satellite images 1 introduction as there are many articles and reviews written about enhancing drought resiliency concerning changing climate conditions world meteorological organization wmo 2017 hanel et al 2018 hagenlocher et al 2019 zipper et al 2019 king okumu et al 2020 it is important to develop practical ways and means to retain water across crop producing lands brauman et al 2013 post glacial landscapes with rolling topographies and many depressions and wetlands are particularly well suited in this regard as summarized by e g horvath et al 2017 agricultural developments however have traditionally reduced the extent size and distribution of post glacial wetland features through ditching and subsoil drainage berezowski et al 2018 moomaw et al 2018 the challenge now is to restore at least some of the water retaining functions of these lands by way of small water retention areas and doing so without negative crop production impacts year after year while there are many good and economical suggestions to this effect bodner et al 2015 iglesias and garrote 2015 maroušek et al 2019 reichhuber et al 2019 it is practical to know how much water could potentially be stored in any particular depression and adjacent soils the goal of this article is to describe and evaluate 1 how the number extent depth area volume and type of depressions including their connecting flow paths can be delineated and quantified using a 1 m resolution digital terrain model dtm epting et al 2018 2 how recurring wetness within the depressions so delineated can be characterized using sufficiently resolved historical satellite images e g google earth as proxy information weil and brady 2016 3 how the extent to which this wetness characterization can be verified image by image by conforming to hydrologically derived soil moisture variations based on local precipitation and air temperature records jones et al 2014 for demonstration purposes this was done for a case study in poland where drought occurrences have become more frequent and more intense in recent years fig 1 ustrnul et al 2015 somorowska 2016 spinoni et

articulated in e g wmo 2017 the water so stored can then be used to meet local and regional water needs that may deal with e g crop selection and production łabędzki and bąk 2017 wetland restoration seppelt et al 2016 and drought resiliency preparations for farms and forests kowalewski 2008 wmo 2015 benalcazar et al 2019 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area 714 8 ha is located north east of tomaszkowo and south west of olsztyn latitude 53 71 longitude 20 42 fig 2 the terrain follows a morainal relief with elevation differences amounting to 33 m apart from residential developments and the lake surface at the southwest corner 14 2 ha the area is mostly comprised of farms wooded areas and roads historical google earth images from 2008 to 2017 revealed 1 how depressions and depression wetness varied by topography depression type and date 2 the extent to which a recent highway construction 2016 intersected these depressions 2 2 digital terrain modelling the digital terrain model available for this area was developed from lidar elevation point cloud data generated through airborne laser scanning point density of 4 points m2 isok 2014 lidar light detection and ranging this model was built using the last pulse returns for determining the terrain elevations at 1 m resolution with a general accuracy of 15 cm i e sufficiently detailed for systematic landform recognition and segmentation wang and liu 2006 the dtm so generated was verified by measuring transect elevations within the test area using the real time kinematic gps method as described by gołuch et al 2007 the digital hydro technical retracing of depressions their configurations extent locations connectedness and recurring wetness conditions was accomplished by 1 subtracting the depression filled from the non filled lidar derived dtm to locate depressions with 15 and 15 cm pour point elevation by depression depth area and volume the process of differentiating actual depressions from lidar dtm artifacts is further addressed and discussed by li et al 2011 2 ascertaining their flow channel connections and associated cartographic depth to water index dtw which refers to determining the minimum elevation change of any point in the landscape relative to the nearest open water location such as streams lakes or any image registered water pools murphy et al 2011 jones and arp 2017 this was done using arcmap procedures as outlined in fig 3 2 3 discerning depressions with 15 cm pour point elevation the fill procedure in arcmap see e g doctor and young 2013 by which all noise generated pits and each depression become flat wu and lane 2016 was used to delineate each depression up to their pour point elevation depressions with 15 cm elevation differences between the filled and non filled dtms were retained and polygonized depressions within depressions were located by breaching the higher order depressions at their pour points wu et al 2018 area depth and volume for all the depressions so recognized were quantified following raster to polygon conversion 2 4 depressions with 15 cm pour point elevation the topographic position index tpi de reu et al 2013 eq 1 was used to locate some of the water retaining depressions 15 cm deep this index determines the elevation difference between any dtm raster cell z and the average elevation z av of all cells r 50 m away i e 1 tpi z 0 z av r the resulting tpi delineations in combination with the dtm derived slope raster can be used to define six tpi categories table 1 with tpi 1 m categorized as valleys and depressions type 6 for similar landform ad soil characterizations by topographical attributes see e g weiss 2001 illés et al 2011 and liu et al 2011 2 5 flow accumulation and channel delineations the flow connections between valleys and depressions were revealed by applying the d8 flow direction and flow accumulation algorithm to the filled dtm tarboton 1997 and by transforming and overlaying the resulting flow accumulation pattern into flow channel polylines through setting minimum upslope flow accumulation thresholds for permanent 4 ha and ephemeral temporary 1 ha flow channels ogilvie 2018 hydro enforcing dtm breaching was required where the dtm generated flow channels did not conform to the image recognized flow patterns this breaching had an automated component for eliminating flow direction changes due to dtm artifacts lindsay 2016 and a manual component to enforce flow connections along hill shaded stream channels ditches and road stream crossings 2 6 dtw delineation the dtw delineations fig 4 inform about the extent of lowest elevations away from the dtw 0 source cells to all the other cells across the land murphy et al 2009a 2009b 2011 white et al 2013 such that eq 2 2 dtw dz i dx i a x c where dz i dx i is the slope of each cell i along the path to the object with the smallest dtw 0 elevation difference a equals 1 when the path intersects the cell parallel to its boundaries and equals 20 5 when it crosses the cell diagonally x c is cell size i e 1 m2 the dtw 0 condition refers to all open water locations lakes pools ponds permanent flow channels and ephemeral flow channels when wet end of summer soil drainage along permanent flow channels and depressions would generally vary from very poor to poor imperfect moderate and well drained as dtw transitions from 0 to 10 10 25 25 50 50 100 and 100 cm respectively murphy et al 2009a 2009b 2011 2 7 google earth images sixteen 2008 2017 google earth satellite images were used to code wetness recurrence within the dtm and image recognizable depressions this image by image coding by date was done by noting differences in coloration from depression surrounding areas as follows table 2 1 indistinguishable 0 2 marginal versus strong differences in coloration and upland versus wetland vegetation 1 and 2 respectively 3 water pooling always or almost always present 3 4 depression wetness in forested areas was categorized by vegetation cover height 0 for tall tree cover 1 for tall shrubs 2 for low shrubs 3 for swamps 5 also noted was the year when and where depression alterations took place not all of the inspected images however covered the entire study area 6 the images were also used to determine i which of the tpi depression areas needed to be polygonised in addition to the already delineated depressions with 15 cm elevated pour points the above image based depression wetness categorization was done across the entire study area in stages i test area ii expanding this to 97 locations at first and then to 245 locations to include many small depressions including ditches additional treed and non treed lagoons and depressions within larger depressions the survey also addressed changes brought about by the olsztyn by pass construction kil and siemiński 2015 kowalczyk et al 2019 as per the google earth images dated november 21st 2016 may 19th 2017 july 9th 2017 and september 30th 2017 2 8 soil moisture modelling daily variations in soil moisture were modelled from september 2006 to september 2018 using the forest hydrology model forhym jones et al 2014 2017 and daily total precipitation and mean daily air temperature records from the nearby weather station fig 2 as primary model inputs the results so obtained are presented in the appendix together with the corresponding model output for soil moisture content stream discharge soil temperature snowpack depth and soil frost depth 2 9 on site inspection the study area was visited in the summer of 2016 and the depression delineations for the test area were discussed with the local farmers in terms of i actual locations and related wetness assessments and ii how farming practices across the depressions would vary by degree of depression wetness 2 10 data compilation and analyses all identified depressions were quantified by date specific wetness code average and maximum depth below each depression pour point area volume and maximum flow accumulation additional shapefile entered attributes referred to depression type i e open field forest lagoon quarry excavation ditch canalized stream and wetland these were coded 1 when applicable and 0 when not data evaluations involved basic summary statistics overall and by type and subjecting the recurring depression wetness index to multivariate regression analysis this analysis was optimized by retaining the most significant wetness predictor variables p value 0 01 2 11 data visualizations the geospatial arrangement of the depressions was visualized through overlays using various background layers namely i symbolized elevation lidar dtm 5 transparent on the hillshaded dtm ii flow channels and the associated dtw 1 m network based on 1 and 4ha upslope flow accumulations iii local road network and iv outline of the olsztyn by pass construction area further visualizations involved i overlaying the image derived wetness index over the dtm derived dtw raster ii dtw line profiling along the center line of the olstyn bypass construction area 3 results 3 1 test area the results for the dtm tpi and dtw depression delineations and related wetness indexing for the test area are displayed in fig 5 here the tpi delineated depressions were nested i within the dtw 25 cm features away from nearest open water location pools and away from their nearest dtm derived flow channels and ii within the dtm derived depressions 15 cm deep not all dtm derived depressions however had dtw derived counterparts when based on the 4 ha upslope flow accumulation areas across the images water was always deemed to be present at locations 9 and 10 at least twice at locations 0 4 7 and 11 and just once at locations 3 6 and 8 as for the google earth image dated 15th april 2013 water pooled within each of the test area depressions table 2 fig 6 except at locations 2 and 12 these also did not show any soil wetness marks on any of the historical google earth images the effect of extensive depression wetness on diminished crop yields is illustrated in fig 7 by way of the june 2016 field images for locations 0 1 5 and 7 at that time weather conditions were dry and locations 1 and 5 started to develop cracks within the depression accumulated sediment crusts 3 2 entire study area the process of depression locating delineating and wetness indexing produced 245 small to large polygons across the study area the corresponding data for number area maximum depth below pour point volume average dtw and the image averaged wetness index are summarized in table 3 by depression type except for the lake and the major stream channel polygons labelled 32 33 92 depressions varied from 15 cm to 4 m in depth from 50 m2 to 3 ha in area and from 10 to 78 000 m3 in volume the combined depression volume so assessed would amount to 782 476 m3 of water which is equivalent to retaining 112 mm of rain or snowmelt across the 700 ha non lake portion of the study area by type depression areas increased as follows quarries road ditches excavations lagoons forested open fields ditch drained wetlands with the larger depressions generally recognized as wetlands by type depression wetness increased as follows road ditches excavations forested ditch drained open field quarries wetlands lagoons all of the delineated depressions are shown in fig 8 as polygons identified by number and overlaid on the dtm generated dtw index the wetness index per depression polygon was coloured brown generally dry through yellow and green towards blue generally wet the dtw index colour was varied from blue for shallow 0 1 m deep through green and yellow towards brown 20 m deep doing so revealed a general correspondence between the image and dtm derived wetness indices but exceptions also occurred table 4 in part these refer to i lagoons and flow blocked locations above roads generally wet ii dry locations due to culvert and ditch drainage along roads and iii dry locations likely due to high soil and subsoil permeability some of the wetness variations were due to depression specific drainage enhancements or blockages for example lagoons generally located near farmhouses and some further away were generally water filled wetness modifying drainage ditches were noted within the larger depressions labelled a b c and d in fig 9 and at locations 15 31 40 48 49 63 37 culverts would drain higher lying depressions along roads at e g locations 63 65 67 118 and 120 the ditch at location 15 kept this depression dry until blocked sometimes after september 2014 fig 10 the close ups in fig 11 show how the dtw delineation process located i depressions 15 cm and ii depth defined depression hierarchies within the larger depressions marked a b c and d as detailed in table 5 by number depth area and volume depressions with 15 cm depth below their pour points represented water saturated wetlands with no to little capacity to retain additional water at the lidar scanning time 3 3 regression analysis relating the image determined depression wetness index to depression area depth mean dtw per depression area and to depression type generated the following best fitted equation and corresponding best fitted scatterplot in fig 12 3 depression wetness index m a x 10 m i n 0 1 99 0 41 1 5 0 11 log 10 area m 2 0 84 0 15 log 10 d e p t h m 0 22 0 09 lo g 10 d t w 1 c m 8 60 0 24

min 0 constraints forces the best fitted results to stay within the set 0 10 index range adding this constraint affected the numerical evaluation of eq 3 only slightly note that the variations in depression wetness were logarithmically related to depression area dtw and depth this means that the depression wetness index increased linearly as these predictor variables double in size from e g 1 to 2 4 8 etc in terms of significance the above wetness predictor variables ranked as follows lagoons wetlands area depth dtw as judged by the eq 3 regression coefficient standard error ratios also known as t values hence image categorizing dtm delineated depressions as lagoons or wetlands where applicable were the most significant depression wetness predictors in part this accounts for the fact i that lagoons are in principle not related to depression area and depth and ii that the occurrence of persistent wetland producing water pooling is in part related to low substrate permeability excluding the data entries for the lagoons from the analysis reduced the overall predictability of the wetness variations from r2 0 877 0 847 this means that the results remained sufficiently robust even when the image categorized data entries for the lagoons were excluded however this did not remain true when only depression area depth and dtw were used as wetness predictors doing so rendered most of the lagoon and wetland locations to become outliers 3 4 relating depression wetness observation to changing weather conditions fig 13 shows how the historical google earth images at locations

affected by preceding harvesting or field preparation operations fig 13 for a farm field example with changing depression wetness see the images in fig 15 for july 2009 december 2012 june 2013 and september 2017 among the three depression delineation methods the dtm delineated 15 cm deep depressions matched most of the image recognized depressions that were prone to wetness variations and inundation flat depressions with dtm derived depths 15 cm such as those at locations 13 14 97 98 i e wetlands were filled up to their pour points at the time of lidar scanning and were best delineated using the dtw 0 25 m zonation along the depression connecting channel network with 4 ha upslope flow accumulation areas as illustrated in fig 11 panels a and b the extent to which most of depressions would be flow connected is in part shown in figs 9 and 11 by the dtm derived flow network with 1 ha upslope flow accumulation areas reducing this threshold to 0 25 and even 0 1 ha revealed further flow connections among the smaller and higher lying dtw depressions these are generally not connected by permanent streams but would conduct water through sub surface seepage during and following wet weather events once the field capacity of the upslope soils would be exceeded to sustain permanent surface flow streams would generally require upslope water contributing areas amounting to 4 ha murphy et al 2009a on average the wetness index for the depressions with 4 and 1 ha upslope flow accumulation areas amounted to 4 1 0 34 and 2 5 0 37 respectively p value 0 005 details not shown while there have been no opportunities to verify actual depression to depression wetness and flow connections within the study area evidence to that effect has been obtained for e g two study areas in canada one in new brunswick and one in alberta ogilvie 2018 typically gps tracked flow channels would fall within a 10 m dtm delineated uncertainty range eight times out of ten the same uncertainty range also applied to gps tracing and dtm delineating wetland borders even under forested conditions partial verification regarding the dtm based dtw derivation across the study area was found by way of bore hole depth to water testing along the olsztyn by pass route this testing confirmed near surface water tables at locations 5 21 48 83 85 gddkia unpublished road survey notes but also showed that the dtm modelled dtw variations from 0 to 5 6 m were in general agreement with the bore hole depth to water records along the route fig 16 4 2 drought resiliency considerations the ministry of the environment and the national fund for environmental protection and water management of the republic of poland proposed 13 potential water supply adaptation measures council of ministers of poland 2019 these are paraphrased as follows 1 reduce drought risk by restoring natural ground and basin water retention by delaying the flow of rainwater through fields farms forests and wetlands 2 reduce adverse flood effects through modernized hydrotechnical infrastructure aimed at controlling and redirecting the flow of water away from flood sensitive areas towards water retaining areas at least in part 3 reduce overall water loss through efficient residential industrial and farming water use practices the above techniques could find their use in realizing these adaptation measures through systematic delineation and prioritization of water retaining depressions across poland and elsewhere doing so would include the contouring of the dtm generated dtw patterns around all potentially water filling depressions as illustrated by way of the depression filled dtw 25 cm contour in fig 5 the extent of the areas so estimated could then in combination with storm based flow rate expectations be used to determine which depression filling draining and blocking operations need to put in place in order to improve local to regional resiliencies against droughts and flooding in a cost effective and timely manner to illustrate all dtm delineated depressions in fig 10 amounting to 74 5 ha in area would have had a combined volume for potential water retention of 782 476 m3 as summarized in table 3 table 4 this amounts to potentially retaining 112 mm of rain and or snowmelt across the 700 ha study area in addition the large depression areas marked a b c and d in fig 8 with a combined 37 1 ha area and an 818 137 m3 volume table 5 would essentially double the local water retention capacity to 1 6 million m3 or 229 mm of rain and or snowmelt across the study area the 16 4 ha by pass construction across the study area reduced this capacity somewhat by cutting across or touching 20 of the mapped depressions and crossing 11 flow channels with upslope flow accumulations 1 ha in detail depressions at locations 5 6 9 21 26 34 35 36 42 43 45 46 48 55 56 57 83 84 85 86 were either eliminated or their wetness status were visibly affected by changes in flow direction towards or away from the construction zone for example water pooling occurred during highway construction at locations 5 21 46 83 85 as per the google earth images from november 2016 to november 2017 the extent to which each of the depressions so delineated would be partially to fully inundated based on a single 100 mm discharge event is illustrated in fig 17 where the more prominent depressions are labelled by depression volume and by percent of volume filled these numbers were obtained by dividing the volume of each depression by the amount of water flowing into that depression from its upslope flow accumulation area note that the smaller depressions would generally fill up towards their water retention capacities while the larger depressions marked a b c and d would not 4 3 agricultural considerations the effectiveness of depressions on adjacent soils as a means to increase drought resilience needs to be weighed in reference to crop yield losses due to soil water logging to that effect carefully adjusted agronomic engineering and crop selective farming practices need to be developed and applied to avoid such losses adjacent to water retaining depressions as reviewed by manik et al 2019 such practices would be facilitated by e g seedbed raising via deep tillage subsoil manuring and or growing deep rooting plants biodrainage doing so would enhance deep seating soil organic matter accumulations and subsequent soil aggregation so that soil aeration and water retention would increase the same time this may include incorporating biochar into soils maroušek et al 2019 making drought resilient crop modifications for greater water use efficiency may also be needed drewry et al 2014 rey et al 2017 in reference to local soil properties and related water retention capacities see e g usowicz and lipiec 2017 kopacz et al 2018 another issue that relates to depression retaining water as possible refers to meeting local to regional and international expectations regarding continuous stream and river flow edwards et al 2012 adressing this issue requires reducing run off events through increased depression based water storage while maintaining groundwater seepage in reference to common field practices the farmers of the study area stated that 1 poorly draining areas are not used for cultivation because of low to no crop yields in addition these areas become too crusty when dry and not trafficable when wet 2 better draining depressions are treated as regular field components but these would restrict access and lead to partial crop failures during wet summers 3 drainage water is not yet used for irrigation purposes 4 most drainage channels are cleaned regularly to maintain current soil drainage regimes 5 blocking outflow from depressions may occur occasionally as was the case for location 15 possibly in response to the summer drought in 2015 fig 1 matters to consider in this regard refer to knowing the locations size permeability and flow connections of water and wetness sustaining depressions across farm and community operated fields and forests juszczak et al 2007 boczoń et al 2016 czerniak et al 2020 for specific agricultural water and wetland management purposes pierce et al 2012 iglesias and garrote 2015 mcinnes et al 2013 the above approach would facilitate 1 inferring poor to good soil specific crop suitabilities based on underlying dtw slope and soil properties across farmed and forested land 2 discerning how much upslope water would potentially accumulate and become remain potentially available in minor to major depressions and adjacent soils 3 determining how to use this information for general water allocation planning purposes including crop production and other water allocation needs 4 deciding which hydro technical structures and operations need to be put in place that would optimize sustainable water retention use and drainage in a cost effective and sustainable manner locally and across the region 4 4 suggestions for further developments while the above determinations are based on a visual ranking of depression wetness using historical google earth imagery further work could be done through field determined and remotely sensed depression wetness and moisture determinations the former could involve evaluating volumetric and or gravimetric soil moisture determinations that are transect centred across surface recognized depression at specific wetness differentiated times of the year the latter would entail generating computerized soil moisture classifications and interpretations of ortho rectified surface images generated through various means e g infrared optical radar or otherwise jackson 1993 engman and chauhan 1995 wang and qu 2009 bourgeau chavez et al 2016 remotely sensed moisture and inundation determinations are generally related to actual moisture variations along soil exposed areas see e g huang et al 2014 yang et al 2015 devries et al 2017 but remain unresolved under deep forest vegetation and litter cover njoku and entekhabi 1996 malik and shukla 2014 das and paul 2015 mahdavi et al 2017 ideally such research would involve on the ground soil moisture and depth to water table measurements especially within and near depressions in terms of potential applications dtm generated flow channel and depression delineations are already finding use in mapping trail and soil trafficabilities vega nieva et al 2009 verhoeven and setter 2010 campbell et al 2013 bock et al 2018 jones and arp 2019 for general land use wetland and community planning purposes the approach could assist with housing park and transportation lay out planning pringle 2003 from a biodiversity perspective habitat building vegetation communities develop in part according to their soil moisture regime preferences with presence or absence of vegetation types and species determined by local soil drainage conditions these can be dtw indexed from very poor to excessive and from hydric to xeric hiltz et al 2012 goguen and arp 2017 westwood et al 2019 while the above deals with delineating depressions drainage regimes and flow channels from lidar generated and breached dtms this process can be further automated and hydro enforced poppenga et al 2012 through using shapefiles that inform about culvert installations locations diameters slope type and the run of drainage structures ditches subsurface tiles extent of stream and river canalization these shapefiles may or may not be available for specific locations however using these would have been relevant in terms of systematically tracking water retention and flow changes before and after the olsztyn by pass construction across the study area for large depressions special hierarchical considerations and procedures need to be invoked in terms generating depression and channel emulating flow patterns within and across these areas as was done for the depression areas marked a b c d in fig 9 the praerie pothole case study by vanderhoof et al 2016 provides good background material on how this is done 5 conclusions the above dtm delineated depression wetness projections as affected by date weather and depression type conformed to field conditions as observed by inspecting historical image this being so the procedures used would serve to guide water management planning in terms of spatially addressing depression based water retention across the land at 1 m resolution for this purpose the procedures assisted in indexing and quantifying the water retention potentials and recurring wetness conditions across depressions from as little as 50 m2 to about up to 12 5 and 16 9 ha in detail the image determined depression wetness index correlated positively with increasing depression area but negatively with increasing depth and dtm derived depth to water while these results apply specifically to the study area the procedures so described can be used to project and evaluate temporal and spatial depression wetness variations and related water retention capacities and flow connections elsewhere this would especially apply to areas where high resolution dtms and

10044,increasing occurrences of droughts across europe and elsewhere require landscape wide water retention assessments to evaluate water supply sustainabilities for local and regional use this article reports on the results of a study designed to digitally delineate connect and categorize recurring depression wetness across a rurally cultured morainal landscape at 1 m resolution to do this a digital terrain model dtm 1 m resolution was used to locate and characterize each terrain detectable depression by type depth area and volume together with their flow channel connections and upslope flow accumulation areas in addition historical 2008 2017 google earth images and a local daily weather report were used to index and verify weather and season induced changes in depression wetness based on ground coloration vegetation coverage and image date developing and applying these procedures by way of a case study revealed i that about 90 of the image indexed depression wetness variations could mostly be attributed to dtm determined depression type area and depth and ii that image recognized wetness variations were consistent with weather modelled soil moisture projections the results so obtained can be used to quantify potential drought resiliency in terms water retention volumes per depression since the procedures as described have a broad application potential they can be used globally for drought resiliency evaluations and agricultural water management graphical abstract ga1 keywords post glacial landscape digital elevation modelling depressions recurring wetness flow channels historical satellite images 1 introduction as there are many articles and reviews written about enhancing drought resiliency concerning changing climate conditions world meteorological organization wmo 2017 hanel et al 2018 hagenlocher et al 2019 zipper et al 2019 king okumu et al 2020 it is important to develop practical ways and means to retain water across crop producing lands brauman et al 2013 post glacial landscapes with rolling topographies and many depressions and wetlands are particularly well suited in this regard as summarized by e g horvath et al 2017 agricultural developments however have traditionally reduced the extent size and distribution of post glacial wetland features through ditching and subsoil drainage berezowski et al 2018 moomaw et al 2018 the challenge now is to restore at least some of the water retaining functions of these lands by way of small water retention areas and doing so without negative crop production impacts year after year while there are many good and economical suggestions to this effect bodner et al 2015 iglesias and garrote 2015 maroušek et al 2019 reichhuber et al 2019 it is practical to know how much water could potentially be stored in any particular depression and adjacent soils the goal of this article is to describe and evaluate 1 how the number extent depth area volume and type of depressions including their connecting flow paths can be delineated and quantified using a 1 m resolution digital terrain model dtm epting et al 2018 2 how recurring wetness within the depressions so delineated can be characterized using sufficiently resolved historical satellite images e g google earth as proxy information weil and brady 2016 3 how the extent to which this wetness characterization can be verified image by image by conforming to hydrologically derived soil moisture variations based on local precipitation and air temperature records jones et al 2014 for

seppelt et al 2016 and drought resiliency preparations for farms and forests kowalewski 2008 wmo 2015 benalcazar et al 2019 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study area 714 8 ha is located north east of tomaszkowo and south west of olsztyn latitude 53 71 longitude 20 42 fig 2 the terrain follows a morainal relief with elevation differences amounting to 33 m apart from residential developments and the lake surface at the southwest corner 14 2 ha the area is mostly comprised of farms wooded areas and roads historical google earth images from 2008 to 2017 revealed 1 how depressions and depression wetness varied by topography depression type and date 2 the extent to which a recent highway construction 2016 intersected these depressions 2 2 digital terrain modelling the digital terrain model available for this area was developed from lidar elevation point cloud data generated through airborne laser scanning point density of 4 points m2 isok 2014 lidar light detection and ranging this model was built using the last pulse returns for determining the terrain elevations at 1 m resolution with a general accuracy of 15 cm i e sufficiently detailed for systematic landform recognition and segmentation wang and liu 2006 the dtm so generated was verified by measuring transect elevations within the test area using the real time kinematic gps method as described by gołuch et al 2007 the digital hydro technical retracing of depressions their configurations extent locations connectedness and recurring wetness conditions was accomplished by 1 subtracting the depression filled from the non filled lidar derived dtm to locate depressions with 15 and 15 cm pour point elevation by depression depth area and volume the process of differentiating actual depressions from lidar dtm artifacts is further addressed and discussed by li et al 2011 2 ascertaining their flow channel connections and associated cartographic depth to water index dtw which refers to determining the minimum elevation change of any point in the landscape relative to the nearest open water location such as streams lakes or any image registered water pools murphy et al 2011 jones and arp 2017 this was done using arcmap procedures as outlined in fig 3 2 3 discerning depressions with 15 cm pour point elevation the fill procedure in arcmap see e g doctor and young 2013 by which all noise generated pits and each depression become flat wu and lane 2016 was used to delineate each depression up to their pour point elevation depressions with 15 cm elevation differences between the filled and non filled dtms were retained and polygonized depressions within depressions were located by breaching the higher order depressions at their pour points wu et al 2018 area depth and volume for all the depressions so recognized were quantified following raster to polygon conversion 2 4 depressions with 15 cm pour point elevation the topographic position index tpi de reu et al 2013 eq 1 was used to locate some of the water retaining depressions 15 cm deep this index determines the elevation difference between any dtm raster cell z and the average elevation z av of all cells r 50 m away i e 1 tpi z 0 z av r the resulting tpi delineations in combination with the dtm derived slope raster can be used to define six tpi categories table 1 with tpi 1 m categorized as valleys and depressions type 6 for similar landform ad soil characterizations by topographical attributes see e g weiss 2001 illés et al 2011 and liu et al 2011 2 5 flow accumulation and channel delineations the flow connections between valleys and depressions were revealed by applying the d8 flow direction and flow accumulation algorithm to the filled dtm tarboton 1997 and by transforming and overlaying the resulting flow accumulation pattern into flow channel polylines through setting minimum upslope flow accumulation thresholds for permanent 4 ha and ephemeral temporary 1 ha flow channels ogilvie 2018 hydro enforcing dtm breaching was required where the dtm generated flow channels did not conform to the image recognized flow patterns this breaching had an automated component for eliminating flow direction changes due to dtm artifacts lindsay 2016 and a manual component to enforce flow connections along hill shaded stream channels ditches and road stream crossings 2 6 dtw delineation the dtw delineations fig 4 inform about the extent of lowest elevations away from the dtw 0 source cells to all the other cells across the land murphy et al 2009a 2009b 2011 white et al 2013 such that eq 2 2 dtw dz i dx i a x c where dz i dx i is the slope of each cell i along the path to the object with the smallest dtw 0 elevation difference a equals 1 when the path intersects the cell parallel to its boundaries and equals 20 5 when it crosses the cell diagonally x c is cell size i e 1 m2 the dtw 0 condition refers to all open water locations lakes pools ponds permanent flow channels and ephemeral flow channels when wet end of summer soil drainage along permanent flow channels and depressions would generally vary from very poor to poor imperfect moderate and well drained as dtw transitions from 0 to 10 10 25 25 50 50 100 and 100 cm respectively murphy et al 2009a 2009b 2011 2 7 google earth images sixteen 2008 2017 google earth satellite images were used to code wetness recurrence within the dtm and image recognizable depressions this image by image coding by date was done by noting differences in coloration from depression surrounding areas as follows table 2 1 indistinguishable 0 2 marginal versus strong differences in coloration and upland versus wetland vegetation 1 and 2 respectively 3 water pooling always or almost always present 3 4 depression wetness in forested areas was categorized by vegetation cover height 0 for tall tree cover 1 for tall shrubs 2 for low shrubs 3 for swamps 5 also noted was the year when and where depression alterations took place not all of the inspected images however covered the entire study area 6 the images were also used to determine i which of the tpi depression areas needed to be polygonised in addition to the already delineated depressions with 15 cm elevated pour points the above image based depression wetness categorization was done across the entire study area in stages i test area ii expanding this to 97 locations at first and then to 245 locations to include many small depressions including ditches additional treed and non treed lagoons and depressions within larger depressions the survey also addressed changes brought about by the olsztyn by pass construction kil and siemiński 2015 kowalczyk et al 2019 as per the google earth images dated november 21st 2016 may 19th 2017 july 9th 2017 and september 30th 2017 2 8 soil moisture modelling daily variations in soil moisture were modelled from september 2006 to september 2018 using the forest hydrology model forhym jones et al 2014 2017 and daily total precipitation and mean daily air temperature records from the nearby weather station fig 2 as primary model inputs the results so obtained are presented in the appendix together with the corresponding model output for soil moisture content stream discharge soil temperature snowpack depth and soil frost depth 2 9 on site inspection the study area was visited in the summer of 2016 and the depression delineations for the test area were discussed with the local farmers in terms of i actual locations and related wetness assessments and ii how farming practices across the depressions would vary by degree of depression wetness 2 10 data compilation and analyses all identified depressions were quantified by date specific wetness code average and maximum depth below each depression pour point area volume and maximum flow accumulation additional shapefile entered attributes referred to depression type i e open field forest lagoon quarry excavation ditch canalized stream and wetland these were coded 1 when applicable and 0 when not data evaluations involved basic summary statistics overall and by type and subjecting the recurring depression wetness index to multivariate regression analysis this analysis was optimized by retaining the most significant wetness predictor variables p value 0 01 2 11 data visualizations the geospatial arrangement of the depressions was visualized through overlays using various background layers namely i symbolized elevation lidar dtm 5 transparent on the hillshaded dtm ii flow channels and the associated dtw 1 m network based on 1 and 4ha upslope flow accumulations iii local road network and iv outline of the olsztyn by pass construction area further visualizations involved i overlaying the image derived wetness index over the dtm derived dtw raster ii dtw line profiling along the center line of the olstyn bypass construction area 3 results 3 1 test area the results for the dtm tpi and dtw depression delineations and related wetness indexing for the test area are displayed in fig 5 here the tpi delineated depressions were nested i within the dtw 25 cm features away from nearest open water location pools and away from their nearest dtm derived flow channels and ii within the dtm derived depressions 15 cm deep not all dtm derived depressions however had dtw derived counterparts when based on the 4 ha upslope flow accumulation areas across the images water was always deemed to be present at locations 9 and 10 at least twice at locations 0 4 7 and 11 and just once at locations 3 6 and 8 as for the google earth image dated 15th april 2013 water pooled within each of the test area depressions table 2 fig 6 except at locations 2 and 12 these also did not show any soil wetness marks on any of the historical google earth images the effect of extensive depression wetness on diminished crop yields is illustrated in fig 7 by way of the june 2016 field images for locations 0 1 5 and 7 at that time weather conditions were dry and locations 1 and 5 started to develop cracks within the depression accumulated sediment crusts 3 2 entire study area the process of depression locating delineating and wetness indexing produced 245 small to large polygons across the study area the corresponding data for number area maximum depth below pour point volume average dtw and the image averaged wetness index are summarized in table 3 by depression type except for the lake and the major stream channel polygons labelled 32 33 92 depressions varied from 15 cm to 4 m in depth from 50 m2 to 3 ha in area and from 10 to 78 000 m3 in volume the combined depression volume so assessed would amount to 782 476 m3 of water which is equivalent to retaining 112 mm of rain or snowmelt across the 700 ha non lake portion of the study area by type depression areas increased as follows quarries road ditches excavations lagoons forested open fields ditch drained wetlands with the larger depressions generally recognized as wetlands by type depression wetness increased as follows road ditches excavations forested ditch drained open field quarries wetlands lagoons all of the delineated depressions are shown in fig 8 as polygons identified by number and overlaid on the dtm generated dtw index the wetness index per depression polygon was coloured brown generally dry through yellow and green towards blue generally wet the dtw index colour was varied from blue for shallow 0 1 m deep through green and yellow towards brown 20 m deep doing so revealed a general correspondence between the image and dtm derived wetness indices but exceptions also occurred table 4 in part these refer to i lagoons and flow blocked locations above roads generally wet ii dry locations due to culvert and ditch drainage along roads and iii dry locations likely due to high soil and subsoil permeability some of the wetness variations were due to depression specific drainage enhancements or blockages for example lagoons generally located near farmhouses and some further away were generally water filled wetness modifying drainage ditches were noted within the larger depressions labelled a b c and d in fig 9 and at locations 15 31 40 48 49 63 37 culverts would drain higher lying depressions along roads at e g locations 63 65 67 118 and 120 the ditch at location 15 kept this depression dry until blocked sometimes after september 2014 fig 10 the close ups in fig 11 show how the dtw delineation process located i depressions 15 cm and ii depth defined depression hierarchies within the larger depressions marked a b c and d as detailed in table 5 by number depth area and volume depressions with 15 cm depth below their pour points represented water saturated wetlands with no to little capacity to retain additional water at the lidar scanning time 3 3 regression analysis relating the image determined depression wetness index to depression area depth mean dtw per depression area and to depression type generated the following best fitted equation and corresponding best fitted scatterplot in fig 12 3 depression wetness index m a x 10 m i n 0 1 99 0 41 1 5 0 11 log 10 area m 2 0 84 0 15 log 10 d e p t h m 0 22 0 09 lo g 10 d t w 1 c m 8 60 0 24

min 0 constraints forces the best fitted results to stay within the set 0 10 index range adding this constraint affected the numerical evaluation of eq 3 only slightly note that the variations in depression wetness were logarithmically related to depression area dtw and depth this means that the depression wetness index increased linearly as these predictor variables double in size from e g 1 to 2 4 8 etc in terms of significance the above wetness predictor variables ranked as follows lagoons wetlands area depth dtw as judged by the eq 3 regression coefficient standard error ratios also known as t values hence image categorizing dtm delineated depressions as lagoons or wetlands where applicable were the most significant depression wetness predictors in part this accounts for the fact i that lagoons are in principle not related to depression area and depth and ii that the occurrence of persistent wetland producing water pooling is in part related to low substrate permeability excluding the data entries for the lagoons from the analysis reduced the overall predictability of the wetness variations from r2 0 877 0 847 this means that the results remained sufficiently robust even when the image categorized data entries for the lagoons were excluded however this did not remain true when only depression area depth and dtw were used as wetness predictors doing so rendered most of the lagoon and wetland locations to become outliers 3 4 relating depression wetness observation to changing weather conditions fig 13 shows how the historical google earth images at locations

dry wet or water filled also depended on antecedent to current weather conditions at the time of imaging hence fields were generally greener following moist to wet weather and seasons as further affected by preceding harvesting or field preparation operations fig 13 for a farm field example with changing depression wetness see the images in fig 15 for july 2009 december 2012 june 2013 and september 2017 among the three depression delineation methods the dtm delineated 15 cm deep depressions matched most of the image recognized depressions that were prone to wetness variations and inundation flat depressions with dtm derived depths 15 cm such as those at locations 13 14 97 98 i e wetlands were filled up to their pour points at the time of lidar scanning and were best delineated using the dtw 0 25 m zonation along the depression connecting channel network with 4 ha upslope flow accumulation areas as illustrated in fig 11 panels a and b the extent to which most of depressions would be flow connected is in part shown in figs 9 and 11 by the dtm derived flow network with 1 ha upslope flow accumulation areas reducing this threshold to 0 25 and even 0 1 ha revealed further flow connections among the smaller and higher lying dtw depressions these are generally not connected by permanent streams but would conduct water through sub surface seepage during and following wet weather events once the field capacity of the upslope soils would be exceeded to sustain permanent surface flow streams would generally require upslope water contributing areas amounting to 4 ha murphy et al 2009a on average the wetness index for the depressions with 4 and 1 ha upslope flow accumulation areas amounted to 4 1 0 34 and 2 5 0 37 respectively p value 0 005 details not shown while there have been no opportunities to verify actual depression to depression wetness and flow connections within the study area evidence to that effect has been obtained for e g two study areas in canada one in new brunswick and one in alberta ogilvie 2018 typically gps tracked flow channels would fall within a 10 m dtm delineated uncertainty range eight times out of ten the same uncertainty range also applied to gps tracing and dtm delineating wetland borders even under forested conditions partial verification regarding the dtm based dtw derivation across the study area was found by way of bore hole depth to water testing along the olsztyn by pass route this testing confirmed near surface water tables at locations 5 21 48 83 85 gddkia unpublished road survey notes but also showed that the dtm modelled dtw variations from 0 to 5 6 m were in general agreement with the bore hole depth to water records along the route fig 16 4 2 drought resiliency considerations the ministry of the environment and the national fund for environmental protection and water management of the republic of poland proposed 13 potential water supply adaptation measures council of ministers of poland 2019 these are paraphrased as follows 1 reduce drought risk by restoring natural ground and basin water retention by delaying the flow of rainwater through fields farms forests and wetlands 2 reduce adverse flood effects through modernized hydrotechnical infrastructure aimed at controlling and redirecting the flow of water away from flood sensitive areas towards water retaining areas at least in part 3 reduce overall water loss through efficient residential industrial and farming water use practices the above techniques could find their use in realizing these adaptation measures through systematic delineation and prioritization of water retaining depressions across poland and elsewhere doing so would include the contouring of the dtm generated dtw patterns around all potentially water filling depressions as illustrated by way of the depression filled dtw 25 cm contour in fig 5 the extent of the areas so estimated could then in combination with storm based flow rate expectations be used to determine which depression filling draining and blocking operations need to put in place in order to improve local to regional resiliencies against droughts and flooding in a cost effective and timely manner to illustrate all dtm delineated depressions in fig 10 amounting to 74 5 ha in area would have had a combined volume for potential water retention of 782 476 m3 as summarized in table 3 table 4 this amounts to potentially retaining 112 mm of rain and or snowmelt across the 700 ha study area in addition the large depression areas marked a b c and d in fig 8 with a combined 37 1 ha area and an 818 137 m3 volume table 5 would essentially double the local water retention capacity to 1 6 million m3 or 229 mm of rain and or snowmelt across the study area the 16 4 ha by pass construction across the study area reduced this capacity somewhat by cutting across or touching 20 of the mapped depressions and crossing 11 flow channels with upslope flow accumulations 1 ha in detail depressions at locations 5 6 9 21 26 34 35 36 42 43 45 46 48 55 56 57 83 84 85 86 were either eliminated or their wetness status were visibly affected by changes in flow direction towards or away from the construction zone for example water pooling occurred during highway construction at locations 5 21 46 83 85 as per the google earth images from november 2016 to november 2017 the extent to which each of the depressions so delineated would be partially to fully inundated based on a single 100 mm discharge event is illustrated in fig 17 where the more prominent depressions are labelled by depression volume and by percent of volume filled these numbers were obtained by dividing the volume of each depression by the amount of water flowing into that depression from its upslope flow accumulation area note that the smaller depressions would generally fill up towards their water retention capacities while the larger depressions marked a b c and d would not 4 3 agricultural considerations the effectiveness of depressions on adjacent soils as a means to increase drought resilience needs to be weighed in reference to crop yield losses due to soil water logging to that effect carefully adjusted agronomic engineering and crop selective farming practices need to be developed and applied to avoid such losses adjacent to water retaining depressions as reviewed by manik et al 2019 such practices would be facilitated by e g seedbed raising via deep tillage subsoil manuring and or growing deep rooting plants biodrainage doing so would enhance deep seating soil organic matter accumulations and subsequent soil aggregation so that soil aeration and water retention would increase the same time this may include incorporating biochar into soils maroušek et al 2019 making drought resilient crop modifications for greater water use efficiency may also be needed drewry et al 2014 rey et al 2017 in reference to local soil properties and related water retention capacities see e g usowicz and lipiec 2017 kopacz et al 2018 another issue that relates to depression retaining water as possible refers to meeting local to regional and international expectations regarding continuous stream and river flow edwards et al 2012 adressing this issue requires reducing run off events through increased depression based water storage while maintaining groundwater seepage in reference to common field practices the farmers of the study area stated that 1 poorly draining areas are not used for cultivation because of low to no crop yields in addition these areas become too crusty when dry and not trafficable when wet 2 better draining depressions are treated as regular field components but these would restrict access and lead to partial crop failures during wet summers 3 drainage water is not yet used for irrigation purposes 4 most drainage channels are cleaned regularly to maintain current soil drainage regimes 5 blocking outflow from depressions may occur occasionally as was the case for location 15 possibly in response to the summer drought in 2015 fig 1 matters to consider in this regard refer to knowing the locations size permeability and flow connections of water and wetness sustaining depressions across farm and community operated fields and forests juszczak et al 2007 boczoń et al 2016 czerniak et al 2020 for specific agricultural water and wetland management purposes pierce et al 2012 iglesias and garrote 2015 mcinnes et al 2013 the above approach would facilitate 1 inferring poor to good soil specific crop suitabilities based on underlying dtw slope and soil properties across farmed and forested land 2 discerning how much upslope water would potentially accumulate and become remain potentially available in minor to major depressions and adjacent soils 3 determining how to use this information for general water allocation planning purposes including crop production and other water allocation needs 4 deciding which hydro technical structures and operations need to be put in place that would optimize sustainable water retention use and drainage in a cost effective and sustainable manner locally and across the region 4 4 suggestions for further developments while the above determinations are based on a visual ranking of depression wetness using historical google earth imagery further work could be done through field determined and remotely sensed depression wetness and moisture determinations the former could involve evaluating volumetric and or gravimetric soil moisture determinations that are transect centred across surface recognized depression at specific wetness differentiated times of the year the latter would entail generating computerized soil moisture classifications and interpretations of ortho rectified surface images generated through various means e g infrared optical radar or otherwise jackson 1993 engman and chauhan 1995 wang and qu 2009 bourgeau chavez et al 2016 remotely sensed moisture and inundation determinations are generally related to actual moisture variations along soil exposed areas see e g huang et al 2014 yang et al 2015 devries et al 2017 but remain unresolved under deep forest vegetation and litter cover njoku and entekhabi 1996 malik and shukla 2014 das and paul 2015 mahdavi et al 2017 ideally such research would involve on the ground soil moisture and depth to water table measurements especially within and near depressions in terms of potential applications dtm generated flow channel and depression delineations are already finding use in mapping trail and soil trafficabilities vega nieva et al 2009 verhoeven and setter 2010 campbell et al 2013 bock et al 2018 jones and arp 2019 for general land use wetland and community planning purposes the approach could assist with housing park and transportation lay out planning pringle 2003 from a biodiversity perspective habitat building vegetation communities develop in part according to their soil moisture regime preferences with presence or absence of vegetation types and species determined by local soil drainage conditions these can be dtw indexed from very poor to excessive and from hydric to xeric hiltz et al 2012 goguen and arp 2017 westwood et al 2019 while the above deals with delineating depressions drainage regimes and flow channels from lidar generated and breached dtms this process can be further automated and hydro enforced poppenga et al 2012 through using shapefiles that inform about culvert installations locations diameters slope type and the run of drainage structures ditches subsurface tiles extent of stream and river canalization these shapefiles may or may not be available for specific locations however using these would have been relevant in terms of systematically tracking water retention and flow changes before and after the olsztyn by pass construction across the study area for large depressions special hierarchical considerations and procedures need to be invoked in terms generating depression and channel emulating flow patterns within and across these areas as was done for the depression areas marked a b c d in fig 9 the praerie pothole case study by vanderhoof et al 2016 provides good background material on how this is done 5 conclusions the above dtm delineated depression wetness projections as affected by date weather and depression type conformed to field conditions as observed by inspecting historical image this being so the procedures used would serve to guide water management planning in terms of spatially addressing depression based water retention across the land at 1 m resolution for this purpose the procedures assisted in indexing and quantifying the water retention potentials and recurring wetness conditions across depressions from as little as 50 m2 to about up to 12 5 and 16 9 ha in detail the image determined depression wetness index correlated positively with increasing depression area but negatively with increasing depth and dtm derived depth to water while these results apply specifically to the study area the procedures so described can be used to project and evaluate temporal and spatial depression wetness variations and related water retention capacities and flow connections elsewhere this would especially apply to areas where high resolution dtms and
