19030,the assessment of water quality is crucial for safeguarding drinking water resources and ecosystem integrity to this end sample preparation and extraction is critically important especially when investigating emerging contaminants and the toxicity of water samples as extraction methods are rarely optimised for bioassays but rather adopted from chemical analysis this may result in a misrepresentation of the actual toxicity in this study surface water groundwater hospital and municipal wastewater were used to characterise the impacts of common sample preparation techniques acidification filtration and solid phase extraction spe on the outcomes of eleven in vitro bioassays the latter covered endocrine activity reporter gene assays for estrogen androgen aryl hydrocarbon

screen 1 introduction anthropogenic micropollutants typically occur at nanogram to microgram per litre concentrations in urban water cycles micropollutants may pose a risk to ecosystems as they have been associated with negative impacts on aquatic biota malaj et al 2014 prasse et al 2015 micropollutants are found amongst pharmaceuticals personal care products industrial chemicals pesticides and biocides kümmerer 2011 that are emitted from different anthropogenic sources these sources can be diffuse such as agricultural runoffs or point sources such as wastewater treatment plant wwtp discharges several studies have demonstrated an incomplete removal of micropollutants and relevant toxicity after conventional wastewater treatment using activated sludge prasse et al 2015 therefore advanced wastewater treatment technologies utilising chemical oxidation or adsorption are being developed to increase the removal of micropollutants and toxicity miklos et al 2018 rizzo 2011 in vitro bioassays play a crucial role for the ecotoxicological assessment of water and wastewater quality because they determine the joint toxicity caused by complex samples often regarding a specific mode of action escher et al 2014 2018 leusch et al 2017 bioassays are routinely used in monitoring campaigns and sufficiently advanced to be integrated into water and wastewater regulations brack et al 2017 escher et al 2018 environmental water and wastewater samples represent complex mixtures of known and unknown chemicals schwarzenbach et al 2006 and are characterised by a variable composition with respect to matrix parameters e g suspended solids or dissolved organic carbon doc the toxicity of the samples is mainly determined by the type and concentration of the active anthropogenic or natural compound s and their cumulative effects however the sample matrix can also affect the outcome of a bioassay janošek et al 2007 neale et al 2015 in addition samples can undergo physicochemical and biological processes that can transform or degrade the active compounds and may therefore modulate the biological effects under investigation because of their ability to reduce matrix effects to preserve and to concentrate dissolved organic chemicals in aqueous samples different extraction methods such as solid phase extraction spe are used in chemical and ecotoxicological studies prasse et al 2015 while sample preparation and extraction methods are commonly optimised for chemical analysis i e to maximise the recovery of specific target compounds this is rarely done in bioassay studies bistan et al 2012 neale et al 2018 schulze et al 2017 because the true toxicity to recover remains unknown thus standard extraction procedures adapted from chemical analysis are mainly used comparative studies have indicated that such chemical standard methods can be ineffective in extracting unknown active compounds from water samples hendriks et al 1994 wagner and oehlmann 2011 because this can lead to an underestimation or false negative results optimising sample preparation and extraction to recover a maximum of toxicity should be imperative for bioassay studies the aim of our study was to assess the impacts of common samples preparation methods on the detection of environmentally relevant endocrine activities genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in water and wastewater samples these samples originated from surface water groundwater hospital wastewater raw untreated conventionally treated and ozonated wastewater the samples consisted of grab as well as composite samples with low to high contamination degrees to allow for an optimal comparison of spe methods the toxicity of untreated aqueous samples and samples that were acidified 24 h at ph 2 0 or filtered 1 μm pore size was compared in eleven in vitro bioassays furthermore the effectiveness of six spe methods was compared by extracting samples with three spe sorbents at acidic and neutral sample ph 2 5 and 7 right before loading aqueous and extracted samples were analysed using bioassays for nine human hormone receptors the umu test and the ames fluctuation test the outcome of these bioassays was evaluated by a multivariate pareto optimisation to identify the most effective sample extraction method 2 material and methods 2 1 characterisation of sampling sites sampling locations were selected according to their relevance and representativeness regarding the water cycle in a model region in baden württemberg germany table 1 samples 1 14 see seitz and winzenbacher 2017 for details samples comprised

bottles with ptfe lids and analysed aqueous samples for acidification and filtration experiments or further processed comparison of spe methods within 48 h after sampling 2 3 sample preparation 2 3 1 acidification for testing aqueous samples one aliquot 40 ml of the aqueous waste water sample was kept at the original ph another aliquot 40 ml was acidified with sulphuric acid 5 mol l purity pro analysi to ph 2 0 directly after sampling after storage for 24 h at 4 c in the dark acidified samples were neutralised with sodium hydroxide 1 mol l purity pro analysi to ph 7 prior to analysing the aqueous samples in the bioassays in contrast to short term acidification for spe 2 3 3 2 3 2 filtration for testing aqueous samples one aliquot of the waste water sample remained unfiltered while another aliquot was filtered using glass fibre filters whatman gf6 pore size 1 μm to reduce tss selected filtered and unfiltered aqueous samples were tested as aqueous samples not spe extracts in the in vitro assays 2 4 the glass fibre filters containing the retentate were suspended in ultrapure water 10 min in an ultrasonic bath and the obtained aqueous suspensions were analysed for endocrine activity retained on the filters a filter control was run and analysed in parallel ultra pure water was filtered and an empty glass fibre filter was suspended as well additionally the influence of a microsieve mesh size 10 μm on endocrine and genotoxic activity of conventionally treated effluent after final sedimentation at wwtp 4 was investigated by taking wastewater samples before and after the microsieve a microsieve control was analysed as well data not shown fragments of the microsieve were incubated in ultra pure water and in methanol for 70 d and the resulting suspensions were tested in the in vitro bioassays 2 3 3 solid phase extraction three commonly used types of spe sorbents were tested for the recovery of endocrine genotoxic and mutagenic activities oasis hlb 200 mg kinesis telos c18 env 500 mg c18 200 mg env and supelco envi carb 200 mg prior to sample loading the cartridges were conditioned as follows oasis hlb and telos c18 env were conditioned consecutively with 1 2

methanol afterwards the columns were turned again loading direction and conditioned with 1 2 ml acetone 3 2 ml methanol and 4 2 ml ultrapure water for each sample 500 ml sample was extracted at two ph values neutral ph 7 and acidified with sulphuric acid 3 5 mol l to ph 2 5 spe was performed within 48 h after collection and directly after acidification the columns were dried under a stream of nitrogen and stored at 20 c samples extracted at neutral ph were eluted with 5 2 ml acidified methanol and 5 2 ml acetone each containing 0 2 formic acid acidified samples were consecutively eluted with 5 2 ml methanol and 5 2 ml acetone at neutral ph after adding 100 μl dimethyl sulfoxide dmso the combined methanol acetone extract was concentrated to 100 μl final volume under a gentle nitrogen stream the extracts 5000 fold concentrated compared to the aqueous sample were stored at 20 c until testing a spe blank was prepared in parallel to each sampling campaign to control for contamination by loading each column type with ultrapure water and extracting them with neutral and acidified methanol and acetone respectively 2 4 in vitro bioassays 2 4 1 recombinant yeast screens for endocrine

inoue et al 2009 we used yeast based assays rather than mammalian cell lines because they are robust in terms of cytotoxicity because they have been validated by iso iso 19040 1 2018 and to compare the results to our previous work all bioassays have the same principle the activation of the respective receptor by chemicals present in the sample triggers the expression of β galactosidase which cleaves the chromogenic substance chlorophenol red β d galactopyranoside cprg cas 99792 79 7 sigma aldrich germany the intensity of the colour change yellow to red is proportional to the agonistic

inhibition the limit of quantification loq was calculated for each bioassay and experiment using the mean activity of the negative control and adding threefold it s standard deviation as the loqs varied between bioassays and experiments they were not shown for the sake of clarity however in general only results above the loqs were considered in a few cases such as estrogenic activity lower

histidine biosynthesis as frameshift mutations ta98 and base pair substitutions ta100 to increase sensitivity the strains ta98 and ta100 have a mutation in the uvrb dna repair gene in the absence of mutagens the strains do not grow in histidine free medium and a reverse mutation in the marker genes enables histidine synthesis and thus growth this leads to a ph change in the assay medium that is determined photometrically at a wavelength of 414 nm the ames test was conducted as described by magdeburg et al 2014 in brief aqueous samples were tested after sterile filtration see 2 4 2 with a

data analysis in this study cytotoxicity was defined as a cell number in the sample of 80 compared to the negative control solvent control analysed in parallel in each experiment statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism version 5 03 graphpad software inc san diego california usa datasets were analysed using the d agostino and pearson omnibus normality test for gaussian distribution and the bartlett s test for homogeneity of variances in case of a normal distribution and equal variances significant differences between the datasets were determined using a one way anova with dunnett s post test if the datasets were not normally distributed the nonparametric kruskal wallis test with dunn s post test was used an unpaired t test was used to determine significant differences between neutral and acidified samples and unfiltered and filtered samples a p value 0 05 was considered significant the mathematical part of the methodological optimisation was carried out using a pareto strategy ehrgott 2000 further adapted for the multivariate optimisation similar to the use of colour coding in in silico toxicology durmaz et al 2015 the main optimisation criterion was to assess sample preparation methodologies that achieved the highest measured biological activity in six different parameters pareto thereby classified a preparation method as non optimal if another preparation method exists that delivers better values regarding all parameters yes yas etc and all tested samples non optimal preparation methods are excluded from the list leading to a ranked set of pareto optimal sample preparation methods the applied strategy also tackled scenarios with missing data 3 results and discussion 3 1 sample acidification for testing aqueous samples analytical chemists use acid as a standard method to stabilise aqueous samples and prevent the biodegradation of micro pollutants prasse et al 2015 stabilisation is thought to occur by deactivating microorganisms baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 us epa 2010 that may use target analytes as substrates therefore the procedure is often adopted in ecotoxicology for conserving the toxicity of samples but often without studying its effectiveness the present results show that sample acidification and storage over 24 h significantly affected the endocrine activities and mutagenicity of aqueous samples compared to the samples kept at neutral ph fig 1 full data sets in table s2 focusing on a change of the endocrine activities or mutagenicity of 10 untreated wastewater was most affected by acidification table s3 whereby 50 of the assays n 22 showed decreased activities between 13 and 94 in case of the influent and effluent of the filtration basin 32 of the bioassays n 22 indicated altered activities between 13 and 37 groundwater 9 n 33 ozonated wastewater 9 n 11 and surface water 3 n 33 were least affected table s3 regarding the different bioassays the activities in the yaes rxr and ames ta100 assays were most affected by acidification table s4 65 of the yaes experiments showed decreased 13 to 32 or increased 15 to 34 activities fig 1a the ames ta100 was affected in 24 of the experiments with decreasing 13 to 77 as well as increasing mutagenicity 17 compared to neutral samples fig 1c table s4 acidification caused the highest decrease of mutagenicity in the ames ta98 with 94 followed by the rar assay with 88 fig 1b in the remaining bioassays low endocrine or genotoxic activities were detected thus no conclusion of the influence of acidification on these endpoints was possible figure s7 table s2 in summary sample acidification led to a decrease 13 to 94 of activity in 81 and to an increase 10 to 34 of activity in 19 of the cases n 32 this indicates that sample acidification significantly affects the outcomes of bioassays two hypotheses may explain the changes in toxicity 1 in acidified samples acids may interfere with active chemicals or 2 in neutral samples microbial activity may degrade or transform the active chemicals basically the key question is whether the neutral hypothesis 1 or the acidified sample hypothesis 2 represent the true toxicity for chemical analysis there is consensus that acidification stabilises most compounds and prevents microbial degradation baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 vanderford et al 2011 us epa 2010 however our data implies that besides few exceptions the in vitro activity is lower at acidic compared to neutral ph fig 1 table s2 accordingly samples at a neutral ph may better represent the actual toxicity if this hypothesis holds true an acidification of samples would either reduce the concentration of active chemicals by increasing adsorption to suspended matter baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 or by increasing hydrolysis prasse et al 2015 alternatively it can be assumed that the higher activity in neutral samples is an artefact caused by a change in sample composition here continuous microbial activity may deconjugate compounds resulting in a higher biological activity this occurs during biological wastewater treatment andersen et al 2003 koh et al 2008 wu et al 2017 however an on going microbial degradation of active compounds would counteract this process giebner et al 2018 in reality the toxicity of an aqueous sample may change at either neutral or acidic ph as this depends on the chemical and biological composition of a sample it is difficult to generalise which condition best represents the actual toxicity based on the present data we argue that a neutral ph comes closest to reality as the sample is minimally processed in addition a higher biological activity will result in a more protective water quality assessment if one accepts that the risks of false positives outweighs the risk of false negatives 3 2 sample filtration for testing aqueous samples sample filtration is beneficial to stabilise compounds baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 to avoid clogging of spe cartridges to remove tss janex habibi et al 2009 and to sterilise samples gehrmann et al 2018 in the present study unfiltered and corresponding glass fibre filtered pore size 1 μm aqueous samples as well as aqueous suspension of the filter retentates were compared to investigate the impacts of filtration on the toxicity these comparisons further included a microsieve pore size 10 μm installed at one wwtp which had a minimal effect on the toxicity full data set in table s5 focusing on a change of the different endocrine activities or mutagenicity of 10 again the untreated wastewater was affected at most by filtration tables s5 and s6 here the toxicity was decreased by 20 and 54 and increased by 28 and 61 in 22 of the bioassays n 18 fig 2a and b for surface water activities were altered in 14 n 7 of the bioassays with one affected endpoint figure s8 conventionally treated wastewater and groundwater were less or not affected by filtration fig 2c and s8 table s6 filtration had the strongest impact on the yaes 50 of the assays n 8 table s7 followed by the yes and yaas 25 n 8 each and yds 13 n 8 the effects observed in the other bioassays were too low to evaluate the influence of filtration on these endpoints fig 2 and s8 table s5 the aqueous suspension of the filter retentates also showed relevant changes in endocrine activities 10 in 19 n 36 of the yeast based assays the retentates were anti estrogenic 57 n 7 and anti androgenic 43 n 7 with activities from 21 to 80 yaes and 30 45 yaas table s5 in two samples the endocrine activity in the filtered sample was significantly p 0 001 lower than in the unfiltered sample as the retentate was also active the activity was retained by filtration in two cases significantly higher p 0 001 activities were detected in the filtered compared to the unfiltered samples here the retentate was active as well in two yaes experiments the endocrine activities in the filtered and unfiltered samples were on a comparable high level 84 91 and the retentate was active as well 46 and 80 one sample was not anti androgenic as filtered and unfiltered water but as filter retentate 45 figure s8 table s5 in summary sample filtration led to a decrease 18 to 54 of activity in 33 and to an increase 13 to 61 of activity in 67 of the cases n 9 and thus has a significant impact on the bioassay results the retention of particle associated hormones and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs may explain this observation this is supported by the detection of significant endocrine activities in the filter retentates and previous observations dagnino et al 2010 routledge 2003 shieh et al 2016 interestingly few filtered samples had significantly higher endocrine activities than the corresponding unfiltered samples for the wwtp effluent filtered by a microsieve we detected an approximately 2 fold increase in anti estrogenic activity table s5 this may be the result of an altered ratio of agonistic and antagonistic activities ihara et al 2014 rao et al 2014 or the leaching of new compounds by the filter materials filter controls confirmed this was not the case in the present case dissimilar affinities towards filter materials and or suspended solids ng and cao 2015 wangmo et al 2018 could have resulted in a retention of antagonistic and thus increased agonistic activities in the filtrate and vice versa in conclusion the application of sample filtration should be well adjusted to the aims of a study the characteristics of investigated waste water samples and bioassay specificities as this is crucial to avoid misestimating the in vitro toxicity dagnino et al 2010 in the present study this was amongst others observed when evaluating the removal of anti estrogenic and dioxin like activities at wwtp 1 fig 2 depending on whether the filtered or unfiltered samples are considered one can conclude that the treatment in wwtp 1 either increases or decreases the toxicity 3 3 comparison of aqueous and extracted samples comparing the toxicity of aqueous samples and corresponding spe extracts is rarely done but has a number of advantages such as the possibility to calculate recovery rates and evaluate the environmental relevance of obtained results giebner et al 2018 muschket et al 2017 tousova et al 2017 wangmo et al 2018 in the present case most aqueous samples induced minimal estrogenic anti androgenic and retinoic acid like activities fig 3 tables s8 s9 s10 however anti estrogenic activities between 21 and 91 were detected in all aqueous samples fig 3b the activities were 19 in the other bioassays fig 3d and s9 table s8 in extracted samples the estrogenic activity 8 n 35 was generally as low as in the corresponding aqueous samples 13 n 8 figs 3 and 4 table s9 the minor estrogenic activity detected in most samples in this study is in line with other studies on biological jalova et al 2013 keiter et al 2006 metcalfe et al 2013 and advanced wastewater treatment ma et al 2005 maletz et al 2013 the anti estrogenic activity of the extracts was variable and depending on the spe method in parts very high 13 89 n 35 and comparable to the corresponding aqueous samples figs 3b and 4 this indicated that the causative compounds were either only partially recovered or that the anti estrogenicity of the aqueous samples is caused by the matrix neale et al 2015 interestingly the high anti estrogenic activities in the extracts point towards potential masking effects whereby receptor antagonists reduce the detection of agonistic activity in water sample this phenomenon has also been discussed by other authors giebner et al 2018 gehrmann et al 2018 ihara et al 2014 rao et al 2014 stalter et al 2011 in addition groundwater was significantly anti estrogenic fig 3b table s8 and s9 this calls for further clarification regarding the presence of edcs in groundwater in contrast the anti androgenic activity was low in most aqueous samples 5 n 7 but higher in the extracts 9 89 n 30 figs 3c and 4 table s9 indicating a successful extraction except for hospital wastewater which may contain anti androgenic pharmaceuticals sohoni and sumpter 1998 stalter et al 2011 the majority of aqueous samples exhibited only low androgenic and anti androgenic activities fig 3c and s9 table s8 the androgenic activities remained low in the corresponding extracts whereas anti androgenic activities were detected at moderate to high levels as in case of the anti estrogenic activity androgen receptor antagonists may mask the androgenic activity such interactions were described for wwtp effluents leusch et al 2017 rao et al 2014 and ozonated hospital wastewater gehrmann et al 2018 the high removal of these activities reported for activated sludge treatment rao et al 2014 and ozonation stalter et al 2011 were not observed in this study the highest rar activity was detected in aqueous hospital and untreated wastewater hos 93 inf 1 23 and corresponding extracts depending on the spe method hos 14 91 inf 1 0 54 figs 3e and 4 table s9 this implies that the active compounds were only partially extracted only hospital and untreated wastewater induced rar activities which was removed in the effluent fig 3e tables s8 and s9 rxr activities were detected in extracted wwtp effluent and ozonated effluent figure s9 table s8 so far only few studies reported rar and rxr activities in water inoue et al 2009 and wastewater allinson et al 2011 inoue et al 2011 in the experiments by sawada et al 2012 and cao et al 2009 these activities readily degraded during activated sludge treatment and lab scale ozonation respectively likewise only a few studies exist on vdr and tr like activities in waste water samples escher et al 2014 inoue et al 2011 kusk et al 2011 leusch et al 2017 in any case activity levels in the present aqueous extracted samples were negligible moderate dioxin like activities were detected in a number of extracted but none of the aqueous samples table s8 highest activities were observed in raw treated and hospital wastewater lowest activities were observed for ozonated wastewater and groundwater its removal during biological and advanced wastewater treatment has been observed in several allinson et al 2011 loos et al 2012 stalter et al 2011 but not all studies jia et al 2015 rao et al 2014 reungoat et al 2010 supporting its detection in the present wwtp effluents while none of the aqueous samples n 6 was active in the umu assay 33 n 27 of the extracts were potentially genotoxic fig 3f tables s8 and s9 low to moderate genotoxicity was detected in extracted hospital raw and treated wastewater but in none of the other samples other studies observed genotoxicity in extracted wwtp effluents macova et al 2011 keiter et al 2006 escher et al 2014 these potentials generally decreased upon ozonation cao et al 2009 misik et al 2011 3 4 identifying the optimal spe method similar to analytical chemistry baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 maruya et al 2016 polo et al 2005 spe of waste water samples is advantageous for in vitro bioassays extraction prevents the microbial degradation of untreated samples and improves the detection of toxicological effects caused by low micro pollutant concentrations escher et al 2005 janošek et al 2007 macova et al 2011 neale et al 2015 2018 spe can also minimise matrix interferences by reducing natural organic matter and excluding ions nutrients or acids neale and escher 2014 prasse et al 2015 escher et al 2018 in contrast to chemical analysis of target compounds the recovery of toxicity by spe cannot be evaluated because the causative chemicals and mixture effects remain unknown thus this study aimed at maximising the extraction of toxicity by comparing two mixed mode hydrophilic hydrophobic oasis hlb and supelco envi carb and one composite telos c18 env spe sorbents these spe sorbents enrich a broad and heterogeneous spectrum of chemicals köke et al 2018 leusch et al 2012 neale et al 2018 extracting both neutral and acidified samples six different spe methods were evaluated by a semi quantitative 3 4 1 3 4 4 approach followed by multivariate statistics 3 4 5 3 4 1 blanks in parallel to the extraction of the samples a spe blank was prepared to control for potential contaminants in reference waters and used materials kolkman et al 2013 neale et al 2018 schulze et al 2017 each cartridge type was loaded with ultrapure water and extracted as described in 2 3 3 the extracts of the 60 spe blanks were negative in all bioassays except in two cases 3 supelco envi carb at ph 7 and ph 2 5 in the yaas here the activities were 2 and 3 higher than the limit of quantification in addition a dmso sample was included in parallel to the spe extracts in each in vitro bioassay as a solvent control these solvent controls did not induce an effect in the bioassays 3 4 2 cytotoxicity cytotoxicity is often used as indicator of the reactive toxicity of environmental samples and their overall micro pollutant load it thus represents an important endpoint which is integrated into several water quality assessments escher et al 2014 2018 leusch et al 2014 välitalo et al 2017 however depending on the investigated endpoint cytotoxicity can also prevent or mask the detection of specific toxicity see 4 in the present study none of the aqueous samples induced cytotoxic effects fig 4 tables s8 and s9 cytotoxicity was however frequently detected in spe extracts fig 4 untreated wastewater induced cytotoxicity in 50 hos and 38 inf 1 of sample extracts n 60 each tested in ten in vitro bioassays table 2 for conventionally treated wastewater eff 1 eff 4 eff 4 ms n 54 60 cytotoxicity was observed in 25 of extracts table 2 the occurrence of cytotoxicity in extracted ozonated wastewater sample eff 4 ms o3 n 54 and groundwater sample gw 1 n 60 was 35 and 2 respectively table 2 the choice of the spe method had a substantial influence on the detection of cytotoxicity the extracts of the oasis hlb and the telos c18 env neutral ph were cytotoxic in 32 and 50 of the bioassays n 78 each table 2 at acidified ph these extracts induced similar cytotoxicity with 15 and 13 respectively n 78 each table 2 samples extracted with the supelco envi carb at neutral ph were more cytotoxic 12 compared to the corresponding samples that were extracted at acidified ph not cytotoxic effects n 78 each table 2 in general samples extracted at neutral ph induced higher cytotoxicity than acidified samples fig 4 and telos c18 env extracts were more cytotoxic than those of oasis hlb and supelco envi carb thus extraction at neutral ph with telos c18 env was the method where the highest cytotoxicity was detected fig 4 escher et al 2005 found an extraction at ph 3 using the oasis hlb to be more effective than ph 7 and ph 11 in a study on spiked urine samples stalter et al 2011 observed this for acidified biologically treated and ozonated wastewater both studies suggest that compounds with acidic moieties to be responsible for the recovered cytotoxicity this is in contrast to the present results which suggest that the cytotoxicity in a broad range of bioassays is extracted more effectively at neutral ph in a recent study by stalter et al 2016 the telos env without c18 sorbent followed by the oasis hlb recovered most cytotoxicity amongst nine other spe sorbents from disinfected drinking water acidified before extraction polar compounds adsorbed by the env as well as the hlb sorbent material were suspected as main causative agents although stalter et al 2016 did not compare an extraction at neutral ph the results support the effectivity of the telos c18 env and oasis hlb observed in the present study along the same line a multilayer spe based on oasis hlb induced more cytotoxicity than a single sorbent method in a study by neale et al 2018 conventional wastewater treatment decreased the occurrence of cytotoxicity from 38 of the extracts to 7 in case of wwtp 1 table 2 in contrast ozonation increased the number of cytotoxic extracts from 24 to 35 table 2 this observation supports earlier hypotheses on the formation of toxic transformation products tps during ozonation jia et al 2015 lundström et al 2010 magdeburg et al 2014 in contrast to the wwtp samples only 2 of groundwater extracts were cytotoxic this is in agreement with the high water quality monitored at gw sampling sites 1 3 seitz and winzenbacher 2017 as well as the rare detection of cytotoxicity in groundwater unless influenced by landfill leachates industrial or other contaminated sites baumstark khan et al 2005 baun et al 2000 3 4 3 endocrine endpoints pooling the results according to water sample type the highest mean estrogenic activity was found in conventionally treated wastewater eff 1 eff 4 eff 4 ms extracted with telos c18 env ph 2 5 with 5 n 4 relative activity and oasis hlb ph 2 5 with 5 n 4 relative activity table s11 figure s10 samples extracted at neutral ph with the same spe sorbents induced lower estrogenic activities 3 n 2 2 n 3 extracts produced with supelco envi carb showed low estrogenic activity regardless of the adjusted ph with regard to the anti estrogenic activity of conventionally treated eff and ozonated eff o3 wastewater as well as groundwater gw both sorbents oasis hlb and telos c18 env showed similar effectivity when samples were extracted at ph 2 5 fig 4 and s10 tables s8 and s11 for conventionally treated wastewater eff and groundwater gw extracted at neutral ph with the same sorbents the mean anti estrogenic activity was higher the highest mean anti estrogenic activity was found in samples extracted with supelco envi carb at neutral ph 62 87 n 1 2 in case of the anti androgenic activity of all sample types acidified samples extracted with oasis hlb and telos c18 env produced similar results again fig 4 and s11 because of high cytotoxicity the activities of neutrally extracted samples could not be analysed treated wastewater and groundwater extracted with supelco envi carb at both ph values induced lower anti androgenic activities than the other spe methods as the activity in the other bioassays was minor no comparison of the spe methods on these endpoints was possible figures s11 s14 based on the above results the telos c18 env sorbent followed by the oasis hlb recovered highest endocrine activities from the majority of waste water samples however the supelco envi carb sorbent was more effective in recovering androgenic activities this is in part reflected in previous studies in a study on bottled mineral water a c18 material recovered higher estrogenic activity compared to the oasis hlb and supelco envi carb wagner and oehlmann 2011 the authors argue that non polar chemicals are responsible for this effect in the present study most estrogenicity was recovered by the telos c18 env involving a similar c18 material while oasis hlb achieved comparable levels except for estrogenicity endocrine activities were more effectively recovered at ph 2 5 however the more frequent detection of cytotoxicity in ph 7 extracts might have masked the respective activities despite the effective extraction of endocrine activities it remained insufficient from some waste waters and endpoints fig 3 and s9 table s8 this includes the anti estrogenicity which was enriched from several but not all samples the difficulty in extracting anti estrogenic activity has been observed and discussed in previous studies giebner et al 2018 3 4 4 genotoxicity and mutagenicity the highest genotoxicity ir 4 37 was detected in the telos c18 env ph 2 5 extract of untreated hospital wastewater hos tables s8 and s9 figure s14 seven extracts 100 of the oasis hlb and telos c18 env sorbents at both ph 7 and 2 5 of the conventionally treated wastewater of the pilot wwtp 4 eff 4 and eff 4 ms were genotoxic with induction rates between 1 50 and 1 87 the extracts of a wwtp 1 inf 1 and eff 1 except one extract produced with oasis hlb ph 2 5 and groundwater gw 1 did not induce genotoxicity all extracts produced with supelco envi carb ph 7 and ph 2 5 were not active either genotoxicity was enriched from four out of six sampling sites figure s14 tables s8 and s9 but irs remained only moderately increased compared to the corresponding aqueous samples except for hospital wastewater one reason for this could be that genotoxicity of waste water samples is generally detected at higher sample enrichment factors e g 100 fold keiter et al 2006 schulze et al 2017 stalter et al 2016 or at contamination hotspots baumstark khan et al 2005 baun et al 2000 in line with the efficiency of the telos c18 env ph 2 5 method magdeburg et al 2014 extracted genotoxicity and mutagenicity from wastewater biological and advanced treatment using the oasis hlb at ph 2 although the authors did not compare different spe methods their results seem in agreement with the present results mutagenicity and cytotoxicity were also higher in biologically treated and ozonated wastewater extracted at ph 2 instead of ph 7 using a c18 sorbent misik et al 2011 for the other investigated in vitro endpoints no spe optimisation study was found in the literature 3 4 5 what is the best spe method regarding the results of five types of water samples tested with five in vitro bioassays the most effective spe method for the extraction of endocrine activities was telos c18 env ph 7 7x followed by telos c18 env ph 2 5 and supelco envi carb ph 7 each 5x oasis hlb ph 7 4x oasis hlb ph 2 5 2x and supelco envi carb ph 2 5 1x table 3 to statistically distinguish between optimal and non optimal spe methods a multivariate optimisation based on pareto was implemented durmaz et al 2015 ehrgott 2000 pareto computed sample type and bioassay specific pareto optimal methods the pareto results are exemplified for conventionally treated wastewater eff 4 in five in vitro bioassays whereby pareto is based on the activity percentiles table s12 for ranking the spe methods table s13 the best extraction methods pareto best were telos c18 env ph 7 followed by oasis hlb ph 7 and telos c18 env ph 2 5 see table s13 for detailed results the ranking of these methods was computed as follow instead of looking at the best extraction results within a certain matrix the worst results were classified as false negative responders the supelco envi carb method at ph 2 5 was three times pareto worst as it extracted the lowest activity in a maximal number of bioassays all other methods performed better when an extract was cytotoxic the result was marked with the label cytotoxic instead of providing a value the pareto algorithm is capable of evaluating data sets with a limited number of such results in case of an excessive degree of cytotoxicity hos and inf 1 the corresponding spe method was however not listed in the respective ranking matrix and the level of relevance decreases for this parameter this means that the ranking for this parameter is not reaching the worst class anymore this evaluation procedure was performed for all data sets referring to the different samples spe methods and in vitro bioassays to obtain the following overall ranking of pareto optimal spe methods regarding the five sample types the method telos c18 env at ph 7 was four times pareto best followed by oasis hlb ph 7 and ph 2 5 each 2x table 3 and s14 in terms of the five bioassays the methods telos c18 env at ph 2 5 and supelco envi carb at ph 7 were two times pareto best respectively details in table s14 accordingly the method telos c18 env at ph 7 was pareto best regarding the effectivity in extracting different types of water and wastewater samples with respect to the highest endocrine activities table 3 higher recoveries at neutral ph over acidic and basic ph were also observed by tousova et al 2017 for several endpoints also investigated in this study the authors however used other sorbents for large volume spe of surface waters summing up the results of the in vitro bioassays and pareto optimisation the methods telos c18 env ph 7 and oasis hlb ph 7 were optimal to enrich endocrine activities but also the highest cytotoxicity table 2 the corresponding methods at ph 2 5 showed good results as well as lower cytotoxicity table 2 and s14 the final recommendation for most effective recovery of in vitro toxicity from diverse waste waters is thus to use the telos c18 env method at a sample ph of 7 4 challenges in optimising sample preparation for bioassays despite the advantages of optimising the sample preparation for bioassay analyses muschket et al 2017 neale et al 2018 ternes et al 2017 a number of important challenges remain the first challenge is that the true toxicity of a sample at a given sampling site and time remains unknown the reason for this is that for complex environmental samples the causative compounds potential mixture effects and confounding factors e g matrix effects are largely unspecified accordingly each step of sampling and sample preparation and storage may change the chemical composition of a sample and its toxicity active compounds may be added via contaminated materials or removed via adsorption to materials during sampling added or removed during transport and storage via microbial activity and added or removed during sample preparation second the differentiation between toxicity caused by anthropogenic pollutants and naturally occurring compounds often referred to a matrix effects remains challenging for instance our approach in maximising the recovery of toxicities may come at the costs of also maximising matrix effects one such example is the co extraction of doc that may induce artefacts in bioassays for receptor antagonism neale and escher 2014 several confounding factors resulting in false positive or negative result need to be considered when interpreting bioassay data discussed in giebner et al 2018 however sample preparation may not be the appropriate tool to address these instead post extraction analysis such as effect directed analysis can be a way to separate the toxicity caused by anthropogenic and natural compounds the third challenge is the selectivity of sample extraction while spe methods with broad selectivity exist an extraction of chemicals is always selective resulting in a loss of compounds with low affinity to the sorbent köke et al 2018 neale et al 2018 niss et al 2018 stalter et al 2016 accordingly the toxicity of an extract will never fully represent the toxicity of the extracted sample thus the question is rather how much loss in toxicity during extraction is acceptable one way of addressing this is to compare the toxicity of extracts to aqueous samples dagnino et al 2010 another way is to optimise the recovery of toxicity both strategies were adopted in this study to identify the best extraction method the forth challenge arises from cytotoxicity masking the effect under investigation which is often the case at high concentration factors while cytotoxicity can be considered an important toxicological endpoint by itself outweighing the specific effect is masks it is most commonly rather regarded an obstacle that needs to be removed this can be achieved by diluting a sample to a non cytotoxic concentration inoue et al 2009 2011 leusch et al 2017 neale et al 2018 välitalo et al 2017 however this also dilutes the effect of interest alternative approaches such as minimising the dilution of aqueous samples niss et al 2018 or reducing exposure times in the bioassay as well as cleaning up the cytotoxicity e g by fractionation have so far not been widely adopted these challenges are connected to a range of spe parameters thus the sorbent chang et al 2009 escher et al 2005 stalter et al 2016 sample volumes macova et al 2011 schulze et al 2017 eluting solvents lu et al 2010 välitalo et al 2017 yang et al 2014 fractionation steps leusch et al 2017 välitalo et al 2017 and operating modes such as large volume or multilayer spe köke et al 2018 schulze et al 2017 can be optimised acknowledging that it is impractical to perform an optimisation for every sample and every bioassay a range of case studies for different matrices can be used to evaluate whether specific sample preparation methods perform generally better than others we have taken such approach in the present study and conclude that the telos c18 env method at neutral sample ph performs best in recovering multiple endocrine activities and cytotoxicity from aqueous samples 5 conclusions 1 acidification of aqueous waste water samples significantly alters a range of in vitro toxicities including anti estrogenic anti androgenic and retinoic acid like activities as well as mutagenicity sample filtration has a minor impact on the samples toxicity 2 compared to aqueous samples solid phase extraction enriches most in vitro toxicities however some activities e g anti estrogenicity remain poorly extractable 3 when comparing six spe methods the choice of the optimal method depends on the matrix as well as the in vitro endpoint 4 in general an extraction using telos c18 env at a sample ph of 7 was most effective in recovering in vitro toxicity from waste water samples however these methods also co extract a high cytotoxicity masking other endpoints using the same method at a sample ph of 2 5 reduced the extraction of cytotoxicity 5 sample preparation needs to be optimised when analysing the toxicity of water samples while this is a resource consuming task involving multiple methodological parameters water quality can only be accurately assessed when the recovery of the toxicity of a sample is maximal

19030,the assessment of water quality is crucial for safeguarding drinking water resources and ecosystem integrity to this end sample preparation and extraction is critically important especially when investigating emerging contaminants and the toxicity of water samples as extraction methods are rarely optimised for bioassays but rather adopted from chemical analysis this may result in a misrepresentation of the actual toxicity in this study surface water groundwater hospital and municipal wastewater were used to characterise the impacts of common sample preparation techniques acidification filtration and solid phase extraction spe on the outcomes of eleven in vitro bioassays the latter covered endocrine activity reporter gene assays for estrogen androgen aryl hydrocarbon retinoic acid retinoid x vitamin d thyroid receptor mutagenicity ames fluctuation test genotoxicity umu test and cytotoxicity water samples extracted using different spe sorbents oasis hlb supelco envi carb telos c18 env at acidic and neutral ph were compared for their performance in recovering biological effects acidification commonly used for stabilisation significantly altered the endocrine activity and toxicity of most waste water samples sample filtration did not affect the majority of endpoints but in certain cases affected the anti estrogenic and dioxin like activities spe extracts 10 4 final concentration including wwtp effluents induced significant endocrine effects that were not detected in aqueous samples 0 63 final concentration such as estrogenic anti androgenic and dioxin like activities when ranking the spe methods using multivariate pareto optimisation an extraction with telos c18 env at ph 7 was most effective in recovering toxicity at the same time these extracts were highly cytotoxic masking the endpoint under investigation compared to that extraction at ph 2 5 enriched less cytotoxicity in summary our study demonstrates that sample preparation and extraction critically affect the outcome of bioassays when assessing the toxicity of water samples depending on the water matrix and the bioassay these methods need to be optimised to accurately assess water

screen 1 introduction anthropogenic micropollutants typically occur at nanogram to microgram per litre concentrations in urban water cycles micropollutants may pose a risk to ecosystems as they have been associated with negative impacts on aquatic biota malaj et al 2014 prasse et al 2015 micropollutants are found amongst pharmaceuticals personal care products industrial chemicals pesticides and biocides kümmerer 2011 that are emitted from different anthropogenic sources these sources can be diffuse such as agricultural runoffs or point sources such as wastewater treatment plant wwtp discharges several studies have demonstrated an incomplete removal of micropollutants and relevant toxicity after conventional wastewater treatment using activated sludge prasse et al 2015 therefore advanced wastewater treatment technologies utilising chemical oxidation or adsorption are being developed to increase the removal of micropollutants and toxicity miklos et al 2018 rizzo 2011 in vitro bioassays play a crucial role for the ecotoxicological assessment of water and wastewater quality because they determine the joint toxicity caused by complex samples often regarding a specific mode of action escher et al 2014 2018 leusch et al 2017 bioassays are routinely used in monitoring campaigns and sufficiently advanced to be integrated into water and wastewater regulations brack et al 2017 escher et al 2018 environmental water and wastewater samples represent complex mixtures of known and unknown chemicals schwarzenbach et al 2006 and are characterised by a variable composition with respect to matrix parameters e g suspended solids or dissolved organic carbon doc the toxicity of the samples is mainly determined by the type and concentration of the active anthropogenic or natural compound s and their cumulative effects however the sample matrix can also affect the outcome of a bioassay janošek et al 2007 neale et al 2015 in addition samples can undergo physicochemical and biological processes that can transform or degrade the active compounds and may therefore modulate the biological effects under investigation because of their ability to reduce matrix effects to preserve and to concentrate dissolved organic chemicals in aqueous samples different extraction methods such as solid phase extraction spe are used in chemical and ecotoxicological studies prasse et al 2015 while sample preparation and extraction methods are commonly optimised for chemical analysis i e to maximise the recovery of specific target compounds this is rarely done in bioassay studies bistan et al 2012 neale et al 2018 schulze et al 2017 because the true toxicity to recover remains unknown thus standard extraction procedures adapted from chemical analysis are mainly used comparative studies have indicated that such chemical standard methods can be ineffective in extracting unknown active compounds from water samples hendriks et al 1994 wagner and oehlmann 2011 because this can lead to an underestimation or false negative results optimising sample preparation and extraction to recover a maximum of toxicity should be imperative for bioassay studies the aim of our study was to assess the impacts of common samples preparation methods on the detection of environmentally relevant endocrine activities genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in water and wastewater samples these samples originated from surface water groundwater hospital wastewater raw untreated conventionally treated and ozonated wastewater the samples consisted of grab as well as composite samples with low to high contamination degrees to allow for an optimal comparison of spe methods the toxicity of untreated aqueous samples and samples that were acidified 24 h at ph 2 0 or filtered 1 μm pore size was compared in eleven in vitro bioassays furthermore the effectiveness of six spe methods was compared by extracting samples with three spe sorbents at acidic and neutral sample ph 2 5 and 7 right before loading aqueous and extracted samples were analysed using bioassays for nine human hormone receptors the umu test and the ames fluctuation test the outcome of these bioassays was evaluated by a multivariate pareto optimisation to identify the most effective sample extraction method 2 material and methods 2 1 characterisation of sampling sites sampling locations were selected according to

activity retained on the filters a filter control was run and analysed in parallel ultra pure water was filtered and an empty glass fibre filter was suspended as well additionally the influence of a microsieve mesh size 10 μm on endocrine and genotoxic activity of conventionally treated effluent after final sedimentation at wwtp 4 was investigated by taking wastewater samples before and after the microsieve a microsieve control was analysed as well data not shown fragments of the microsieve were incubated in ultra pure water and in methanol for 70 d and the resulting suspensions were tested in the in vitro bioassays 2 3 3 solid phase extraction three commonly used types of spe sorbents were tested for the recovery of endocrine genotoxic and mutagenic activities oasis hlb 200 mg kinesis

histidine biosynthesis as frameshift mutations ta98 and base pair substitutions ta100 to increase sensitivity the strains ta98 and ta100 have a mutation in the uvrb dna repair gene in the absence of mutagens the strains do not grow in histidine free medium and a reverse mutation in the marker genes enables histidine synthesis and thus growth this leads to a ph change in the assay medium that is determined photometrically at a wavelength of 414 nm the ames test was conducted as described by magdeburg et al 2014 in brief aqueous samples were tested after sterile filtration see 2 4 2 with a

data analysis in this study cytotoxicity was defined as a cell number in the sample of 80 compared to the negative control solvent control analysed in parallel in each experiment statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism version 5 03 graphpad software inc san diego california usa datasets were analysed using the d agostino and pearson omnibus normality test for gaussian distribution and the bartlett s test for homogeneity of variances in case of a normal distribution and equal variances significant differences between the datasets were determined using a one way anova with dunnett s post test if the datasets were not normally distributed the nonparametric kruskal wallis test with dunn s post test was used an unpaired t test was used to determine significant differences between neutral and acidified samples and unfiltered and filtered samples a p value 0 05 was considered significant the mathematical part of the methodological optimisation was carried out using a pareto strategy ehrgott 2000 further adapted for the multivariate optimisation similar to the use of colour coding in in silico toxicology durmaz et al 2015 the main optimisation criterion was to assess sample preparation methodologies that achieved the highest measured biological activity in six different parameters pareto thereby classified a preparation method as non optimal if another preparation method exists that delivers better values regarding all parameters yes yas etc and all tested samples non optimal preparation methods are excluded from the list leading to a ranked set of pareto optimal sample preparation methods the applied strategy also tackled scenarios with missing data 3 results and discussion 3 1 sample acidification for testing aqueous samples analytical chemists use acid as a standard method to stabilise aqueous samples and prevent the biodegradation of micro pollutants prasse et al 2015 stabilisation is thought to occur by deactivating microorganisms baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 us epa 2010 that may use target analytes as substrates therefore the procedure is often adopted in ecotoxicology for conserving the toxicity of samples but often without studying its effectiveness the present results show that sample acidification and storage over 24 h significantly affected the endocrine activities and mutagenicity of aqueous samples compared to the samples kept at neutral ph fig 1 full data sets in table s2 focusing on a change of the endocrine activities or mutagenicity of 10 untreated wastewater was most affected by acidification table s3 whereby 50 of the assays n 22 showed decreased activities between 13 and 94 in case of the influent and effluent of the filtration basin 32 of the bioassays n 22 indicated altered activities between 13 and 37 groundwater 9 n 33 ozonated wastewater 9 n 11 and surface water 3 n 33 were least affected table s3 regarding the different bioassays the activities in the yaes rxr and ames ta100 assays were most affected by acidification table s4 65 of the yaes experiments showed decreased 13 to 32 or increased 15 to 34 activities fig 1a the ames ta100 was affected in 24 of the experiments with decreasing 13 to 77 as well as increasing mutagenicity 17 compared to neutral samples fig 1c table s4 acidification caused the highest decrease of mutagenicity in the ames ta98 with 94 followed by the rar assay with 88 fig 1b in the remaining bioassays low endocrine or genotoxic activities were detected thus no conclusion of the influence of acidification on these endpoints was possible figure s7 table s2 in summary sample acidification led to a decrease 13 to 94 of activity in 81 and to an increase 10 to 34 of activity in 19 of the cases n 32 this indicates that sample acidification significantly affects the outcomes of bioassays two hypotheses may explain the changes in toxicity 1 in acidified samples acids may interfere with active chemicals or 2 in neutral samples microbial activity may degrade or transform the active chemicals basically the key question is whether the neutral hypothesis 1 or the acidified sample hypothesis 2 represent the true toxicity for chemical analysis there is consensus that acidification stabilises most compounds and prevents microbial degradation baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 vanderford et al 2011 us epa 2010 however our data implies that besides few exceptions the in vitro activity is lower at acidic compared to neutral ph fig 1 table s2 accordingly samples at a neutral ph may better represent the actual toxicity if this hypothesis holds true an acidification of samples would either reduce the concentration of active chemicals by increasing adsorption to suspended matter baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 or by increasing hydrolysis prasse et al 2015 alternatively it can be assumed that the higher activity in neutral samples is an artefact caused by a change in sample composition here continuous microbial activity may deconjugate compounds resulting in a higher biological activity this occurs during biological wastewater treatment andersen et al 2003 koh et al 2008 wu et al 2017 however an on going microbial degradation of active compounds would counteract this process giebner et al 2018 in reality the toxicity of an aqueous sample may change at either neutral or acidic ph as this depends on the chemical and biological composition of a sample it is difficult to generalise which condition best represents the actual toxicity based on the present data we argue that a neutral ph comes closest to reality as the sample is minimally processed in addition a higher biological activity will result in a more protective water quality assessment if one accepts that the risks of false positives outweighs the risk of false negatives 3 2 sample filtration for testing aqueous samples sample filtration is beneficial to stabilise compounds baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 to avoid clogging of spe cartridges to remove tss janex habibi et al 2009 and to sterilise samples gehrmann et al 2018 in the present study unfiltered and corresponding glass fibre filtered pore size 1 μm aqueous samples as well as aqueous suspension of the filter retentates were compared to investigate the impacts of filtration on the toxicity these comparisons further included a microsieve pore size 10 μm installed at one wwtp which had a minimal effect on the toxicity full data set in table s5 focusing on a change of the different endocrine activities or mutagenicity of 10 again the untreated wastewater was affected at most by filtration tables s5 and s6 here the toxicity was decreased by 20 and 54 and increased by 28 and 61 in 22 of the bioassays n 18 fig 2a and b for surface water activities were altered in 14 n 7 of the bioassays with one affected endpoint figure s8 conventionally treated wastewater and groundwater were less or not affected by filtration fig 2c and s8 table s6 filtration had the strongest impact on the yaes 50 of the assays n 8 table s7 followed by the yes and yaas 25 n 8 each and yds 13 n 8 the effects observed in the other bioassays were too low to evaluate the influence of filtration on these endpoints fig 2 and s8 table s5 the aqueous suspension of the filter retentates also showed relevant changes in endocrine activities 10 in 19 n 36 of the yeast based assays the retentates were anti estrogenic 57 n 7 and anti androgenic 43 n 7 with activities from 21 to 80 yaes and 30 45 yaas table s5 in two samples the endocrine activity in the filtered sample was significantly p 0 001 lower than in the unfiltered sample as the retentate was also active the activity was retained by filtration in two cases significantly higher p 0 001 activities were detected in the filtered compared to the unfiltered samples here the retentate was active as well in two yaes experiments the endocrine activities in the filtered and unfiltered samples were on a comparable high level 84 91 and the retentate was active as well 46 and 80 one sample was not anti androgenic as filtered and unfiltered water but as filter retentate 45 figure s8 table s5 in summary sample filtration led to a decrease 18 to 54 of activity in 33 and to an increase 13 to 61 of activity in 67 of the cases n 9 and thus has a significant impact on the bioassay results the retention of particle associated hormones and endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs may explain this observation this is supported by the detection of significant endocrine activities in the filter retentates and previous observations dagnino et al 2010 routledge 2003 shieh et al 2016 interestingly few filtered samples had significantly higher endocrine activities than the corresponding unfiltered samples for the wwtp effluent filtered by a microsieve we detected an approximately 2 fold increase in anti estrogenic activity table s5 this may be the result of an altered ratio of agonistic and antagonistic activities ihara et al 2014 rao et al 2014 or the leaching of new compounds by the filter materials filter controls confirmed this was not the case in the present case dissimilar affinities towards filter materials and or suspended solids ng and cao 2015 wangmo et al 2018 could have resulted in a retention of antagonistic and thus increased agonistic activities in the filtrate and vice versa in conclusion the application of sample filtration should be well adjusted to the aims of a study the characteristics of investigated waste water samples and bioassay specificities as this is crucial to avoid misestimating the in vitro toxicity dagnino et al 2010 in the present study this was amongst others observed when evaluating the removal of anti estrogenic and dioxin like activities at wwtp 1 fig 2 depending on whether the filtered or unfiltered samples are considered one can conclude that the treatment in wwtp 1 either increases or decreases the toxicity 3 3 comparison of aqueous and extracted samples comparing the toxicity of aqueous samples and corresponding spe extracts is rarely done but has a number of advantages such as the possibility to calculate recovery rates and evaluate the environmental relevance of obtained results giebner et al 2018 muschket et al 2017 tousova et al 2017 wangmo et al 2018 in the present case most aqueous samples induced minimal estrogenic anti androgenic and retinoic acid like activities fig 3 tables s8 s9 s10 however anti estrogenic activities between 21 and 91 were detected in all aqueous samples fig 3b the activities were 19 in the other bioassays fig 3d and s9 table s8 in extracted samples the estrogenic activity 8 n 35 was generally as low as in the corresponding aqueous samples 13 n 8 figs 3 and 4 table s9 the minor estrogenic activity detected in most samples in this study is in line with other studies on biological jalova et al 2013 keiter et al 2006 metcalfe et al 2013 and advanced wastewater treatment ma et al 2005 maletz et al 2013 the anti estrogenic activity of the extracts was variable and depending on the spe method in parts very high 13 89 n 35 and comparable to the corresponding aqueous samples figs 3b and 4 this indicated that the causative compounds were either only partially recovered or that the anti estrogenicity of the aqueous samples is caused by the matrix neale et al 2015 interestingly the high anti estrogenic activities in the extracts point towards potential masking effects whereby receptor antagonists reduce the detection of agonistic activity in water sample this phenomenon has also been discussed by other authors giebner et al 2018 gehrmann et al 2018 ihara et al 2014 rao et al 2014 stalter et al 2011 in addition groundwater was significantly anti estrogenic fig 3b table s8 and s9 this calls for further clarification regarding the presence of edcs in groundwater in contrast the anti androgenic activity was low in most aqueous samples 5 n 7 but higher in the extracts 9 89 n 30 figs 3c and 4 table s9 indicating a successful extraction except for hospital wastewater which may contain anti androgenic pharmaceuticals sohoni and sumpter 1998 stalter et al 2011 the majority of aqueous samples exhibited only low androgenic and anti androgenic activities fig 3c and s9 table s8 the androgenic activities remained low in the corresponding extracts whereas anti androgenic activities were detected at moderate to high levels as in case of the anti estrogenic activity androgen receptor antagonists may mask the androgenic activity such interactions were described for wwtp effluents leusch et al 2017 rao et al 2014 and ozonated hospital wastewater gehrmann et al 2018 the high removal of these activities reported for activated sludge treatment rao et al 2014 and ozonation stalter et al 2011 were not observed in this study the highest rar activity was detected in aqueous hospital and untreated wastewater hos 93 inf 1 23 and corresponding extracts depending on the spe method hos 14 91 inf 1 0 54 figs 3e and 4 table s9 this implies that the active compounds were only partially extracted only hospital and untreated wastewater induced rar activities which was removed in the effluent fig 3e tables s8 and s9 rxr activities were detected in extracted wwtp effluent and ozonated effluent figure s9 table s8 so far only few studies reported rar and rxr activities in water inoue et al 2009 and wastewater allinson et al 2011 inoue et al 2011 in the experiments by sawada et al 2012 and cao et al 2009 these activities readily degraded during activated sludge treatment and lab scale ozonation respectively likewise only a few studies exist on vdr and tr like activities in waste water samples escher et al 2014 inoue et al 2011 kusk et al 2011 leusch et al 2017 in any case activity levels in the present aqueous extracted samples were negligible moderate dioxin like activities were detected in a number of extracted but none of the aqueous samples table s8 highest activities were observed in raw treated and hospital wastewater lowest activities were observed for ozonated wastewater and groundwater its removal during biological and advanced wastewater treatment has been observed in several allinson et al 2011 loos et al 2012 stalter et al 2011 but not all studies jia et al 2015 rao et al 2014 reungoat et al 2010 supporting its detection in the present wwtp effluents while none of the aqueous samples n 6 was active in the umu assay 33 n 27 of the extracts were potentially genotoxic fig 3f tables s8 and s9 low to moderate genotoxicity was detected in extracted hospital raw and treated wastewater but in none of the other samples other studies observed genotoxicity in extracted wwtp effluents macova et al 2011 keiter et al 2006 escher et al 2014 these potentials generally decreased upon ozonation cao et al 2009 misik et al 2011 3 4 identifying the optimal spe method similar to analytical chemistry baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 maruya et al 2016 polo et al 2005 spe of waste water samples is advantageous for in vitro bioassays extraction prevents the microbial degradation of untreated samples and improves the detection of toxicological effects caused by low micro pollutant concentrations escher et al 2005 janošek et al 2007 macova et al 2011 neale et al 2015 2018 spe can also minimise matrix interferences by reducing natural organic matter and excluding ions nutrients or acids neale and escher 2014 prasse et al 2015 escher et al 2018 in contrast to chemical analysis of target compounds the recovery of toxicity by spe cannot be evaluated because the causative chemicals and mixture effects remain unknown thus this study aimed at maximising the extraction of toxicity by comparing two mixed mode hydrophilic hydrophobic oasis hlb and supelco envi carb and one composite telos c18 env spe sorbents these spe sorbents enrich a broad and heterogeneous spectrum of chemicals köke et al 2018 leusch et al 2012 neale et al 2018 extracting both neutral and acidified samples six different spe methods were evaluated by a semi quantitative 3 4 1 3 4 4 approach followed by multivariate statistics 3 4 5 3 4 1 blanks in parallel to the extraction of the samples a spe blank was prepared to control for potential contaminants in reference waters and used materials kolkman et al 2013 neale et al 2018 schulze et al 2017 each cartridge type was loaded with ultrapure water and extracted as described in 2 3 3 the extracts of the 60 spe blanks were negative in all bioassays except in two cases 3 supelco envi carb at ph 7 and ph 2 5 in the yaas here the activities were 2 and 3 higher than the limit of quantification in addition a dmso sample was included in parallel to the spe extracts in each in vitro bioassay as a solvent control these solvent controls did not induce an effect in the bioassays 3 4 2 cytotoxicity cytotoxicity is often used as indicator of the reactive toxicity of environmental samples and their overall micro pollutant load it thus represents an important endpoint which is integrated into several water quality assessments escher et al 2014 2018 leusch et al 2014 välitalo et al 2017 however depending on the investigated endpoint cytotoxicity can also prevent or mask the detection of specific toxicity see 4 in the present study none of the aqueous samples induced cytotoxic effects fig 4 tables s8 and s9 cytotoxicity was however frequently detected in spe extracts fig 4 untreated wastewater induced cytotoxicity in 50 hos and 38 inf 1 of sample extracts n 60 each tested in ten in vitro bioassays table 2 for conventionally treated wastewater eff 1 eff 4 eff 4 ms n 54 60 cytotoxicity was observed in 25 of extracts table 2 the occurrence of cytotoxicity in extracted ozonated wastewater sample eff 4 ms o3 n 54 and groundwater sample gw 1 n 60 was 35 and 2 respectively table 2 the choice of the spe method had a substantial influence on the detection of cytotoxicity the extracts of the oasis hlb and the telos c18 env neutral ph were cytotoxic in 32 and 50 of the bioassays n 78 each table 2 at acidified ph these extracts induced similar cytotoxicity with 15 and 13 respectively n 78 each table 2 samples extracted with the supelco envi carb at neutral ph were more cytotoxic 12 compared to the corresponding samples that were extracted at acidified ph not cytotoxic effects n 78 each table 2 in general samples extracted at neutral ph induced higher cytotoxicity than acidified samples fig 4 and telos c18 env extracts were more cytotoxic than those of oasis hlb and supelco envi carb thus extraction at neutral ph with telos c18 env was the method where the highest cytotoxicity was detected fig 4 escher et al 2005 found an extraction at ph 3 using the oasis hlb to be more effective than ph 7 and ph 11 in a study on spiked urine samples stalter et al 2011 observed this for acidified biologically treated and ozonated wastewater both studies suggest that compounds with acidic moieties to be responsible for the recovered cytotoxicity this is in contrast to the present results which suggest that the cytotoxicity in a broad range of bioassays is extracted more effectively at neutral ph in a recent study by stalter et al 2016 the telos env without c18 sorbent followed by the oasis hlb recovered most cytotoxicity amongst nine other spe sorbents from disinfected drinking water acidified before extraction polar compounds adsorbed by the env as well as the hlb sorbent material were suspected as main causative agents although stalter et al 2016 did not compare an extraction at neutral ph the results support the effectivity of the telos c18 env and oasis hlb observed in the present study along the same line a multilayer spe based on oasis hlb induced more cytotoxicity than a single sorbent method in a study by neale et al 2018 conventional wastewater treatment decreased the occurrence of cytotoxicity from 38 of the extracts to 7 in case of wwtp 1 table 2 in contrast ozonation increased the number of cytotoxic extracts from 24 to 35 table 2 this observation supports earlier hypotheses on the formation of toxic transformation products tps during ozonation jia et al 2015 lundström et al 2010 magdeburg et al 2014 in contrast to the wwtp samples only 2 of groundwater extracts were cytotoxic this is in agreement with the high water quality monitored at gw sampling sites 1 3 seitz and winzenbacher 2017 as well as the rare detection of cytotoxicity in groundwater unless influenced by landfill leachates industrial or other contaminated sites baumstark khan et al 2005 baun et al 2000 3 4 3 endocrine endpoints pooling the results according to water sample type the highest mean estrogenic activity was found in conventionally treated wastewater eff 1 eff 4 eff 4 ms extracted with telos c18 env ph 2 5 with 5 n 4 relative activity and oasis hlb ph 2 5 with 5 n 4 relative activity table s11 figure s10 samples extracted at neutral ph with the same spe sorbents induced lower estrogenic activities 3 n 2 2 n 3 extracts produced with supelco envi carb showed low estrogenic activity regardless of the adjusted ph with regard to the anti estrogenic activity of conventionally treated eff and ozonated eff o3 wastewater as well as groundwater gw both sorbents oasis hlb and telos c18 env showed similar effectivity when samples were extracted at ph 2 5 fig 4 and s10 tables s8 and s11 for conventionally treated wastewater eff and groundwater gw extracted at neutral ph with the same sorbents the mean anti estrogenic activity was higher the highest mean anti estrogenic activity was found in samples extracted with supelco envi carb at neutral ph 62 87 n 1 2 in case of the anti androgenic activity of all sample types acidified samples extracted with oasis hlb and telos c18 env produced similar results again fig 4 and s11 because of high cytotoxicity the activities of neutrally extracted samples could not be analysed treated wastewater and groundwater extracted with supelco envi carb at both ph values induced lower anti androgenic activities than the other spe methods as the activity in the other bioassays was minor no comparison of the spe methods on these endpoints was possible figures s11 s14 based on the above results the telos c18 env sorbent followed by the oasis hlb recovered highest endocrine activities from the majority of waste water samples however the supelco envi carb sorbent was more effective in recovering androgenic activities this is in part reflected in previous studies in a study on bottled mineral water a c18 material recovered higher estrogenic activity compared to the oasis hlb and supelco envi carb wagner and oehlmann 2011 the authors argue that non polar chemicals are responsible for this effect in the present study most estrogenicity was recovered by the telos c18 env involving a similar c18 material while oasis hlb achieved comparable levels except for estrogenicity endocrine activities were more effectively recovered at ph 2 5 however the more frequent detection of cytotoxicity in ph 7 extracts might have masked the respective activities despite the effective extraction of endocrine activities it remained insufficient from some waste waters and endpoints fig 3 and s9 table s8 this includes the anti estrogenicity which was enriched from several but not all samples the difficulty in extracting anti estrogenic activity has been observed and discussed in previous studies giebner et al 2018 3 4 4 genotoxicity and mutagenicity the highest genotoxicity ir 4 37 was detected in the telos c18 env ph 2 5 extract of untreated hospital wastewater hos tables s8 and s9 figure s14 seven extracts 100 of the oasis hlb and telos c18 env sorbents at both ph 7 and 2 5 of the conventionally treated wastewater of the pilot wwtp 4 eff 4 and eff 4 ms were genotoxic with induction rates between 1 50 and 1 87 the extracts of a wwtp 1 inf 1 and eff 1 except one extract produced with oasis hlb ph 2 5 and groundwater gw 1 did not induce genotoxicity all extracts produced with supelco envi carb ph 7 and ph 2 5 were not active either genotoxicity was enriched from four out of six sampling sites figure s14 tables s8 and s9 but irs remained only moderately increased compared to the corresponding aqueous samples except for hospital wastewater one reason for this could be that genotoxicity of waste water samples is generally detected at higher sample enrichment factors e g 100 fold keiter et al 2006 schulze et al 2017 stalter et al 2016 or at contamination hotspots baumstark khan et al 2005 baun et al 2000 in line with the efficiency of the telos c18 env ph 2 5 method magdeburg et al 2014 extracted genotoxicity and mutagenicity from wastewater biological and advanced treatment using the oasis hlb at ph 2 although the authors did not compare different spe methods their results seem in agreement with the present results mutagenicity and cytotoxicity were also higher in biologically treated and ozonated wastewater extracted at ph 2 instead of ph 7 using a c18 sorbent misik et al 2011 for the other investigated in vitro endpoints no spe optimisation study was found in the literature 3 4 5 what is the best spe method regarding the results of five types of water samples tested with five in vitro bioassays the most effective spe method for the extraction of endocrine activities was telos c18 env ph 7 7x followed by telos c18 env ph 2 5 and supelco envi carb ph 7 each 5x oasis hlb ph 7 4x oasis hlb ph 2 5 2x and supelco envi carb ph 2 5 1x table 3 to statistically distinguish between optimal and non optimal spe methods a multivariate optimisation based on pareto was implemented durmaz et al 2015 ehrgott 2000 pareto computed sample type and bioassay specific pareto optimal methods the pareto results are exemplified for conventionally treated wastewater eff 4 in five in vitro bioassays whereby pareto is based on the activity percentiles table s12 for ranking the spe methods table s13 the best extraction methods pareto best were telos c18 env ph 7 followed by oasis hlb ph 7 and telos c18 env ph 2 5 see table s13 for detailed results the ranking of these methods was computed as follow instead of looking at the best extraction results within a certain matrix the worst results were classified as false negative responders the supelco envi carb method at ph 2 5 was three times pareto worst as it extracted the lowest activity in a maximal number of bioassays all other methods performed better when an extract was cytotoxic the result was marked with the label cytotoxic instead of providing a value the pareto algorithm is capable of evaluating data sets with a limited number of such results in case of an excessive degree of cytotoxicity hos and inf 1 the corresponding spe method was however not listed in the respective ranking matrix and the level of relevance decreases for this parameter this means that the ranking for this parameter is not reaching the worst class anymore this evaluation procedure was performed for all data sets referring to the different samples spe methods and in vitro bioassays to obtain the following overall ranking of pareto optimal spe methods regarding the five sample types the method telos c18 env at ph 7 was four times pareto best followed by oasis hlb ph 7 and ph 2 5 each 2x table 3 and s14 in terms of the five bioassays the methods telos c18 env at ph 2 5 and supelco envi carb at ph 7 were two times pareto best respectively details in table s14 accordingly the method telos c18 env at ph 7 was pareto best regarding the effectivity in extracting different types of water and wastewater samples with respect to the highest endocrine activities table 3 higher recoveries at neutral ph over acidic and basic ph were also observed by tousova et al 2017 for several endpoints also investigated in this study the authors however used other sorbents for large volume spe of surface waters summing up the results of the in vitro bioassays and pareto optimisation the methods telos c18 env ph 7 and oasis hlb ph 7 were optimal to enrich endocrine activities but also the highest cytotoxicity table 2 the corresponding methods at ph 2 5 showed good results as well as lower cytotoxicity table 2 and s14 the final recommendation for most effective recovery of in vitro toxicity from diverse waste waters is thus to use the telos c18 env method at a sample ph of 7 4 challenges in optimising sample preparation for bioassays despite the advantages of optimising the sample preparation for bioassay analyses muschket et al 2017 neale et al 2018 ternes et al 2017 a number of important challenges remain the first challenge is that the true toxicity of a sample at a given sampling site and time remains unknown the reason for this is that for complex environmental samples the causative compounds potential mixture effects and confounding factors e g matrix effects are largely unspecified accordingly each step of sampling and sample preparation and storage may change the chemical composition of a sample and its toxicity active compounds may be added via contaminated materials or removed via adsorption to materials during sampling added or removed during transport and storage via microbial activity and added or removed during sample preparation second the differentiation between toxicity caused by anthropogenic pollutants and naturally occurring compounds often referred to a matrix effects remains challenging for instance our approach in maximising the recovery of toxicities may come at the costs of also maximising matrix effects one such example is the co extraction of doc that may induce artefacts in bioassays for receptor antagonism neale and escher 2014 several confounding factors resulting in false positive or negative result need to be considered when interpreting bioassay data discussed in giebner et al 2018 however sample preparation may not be the appropriate tool to address these instead post extraction analysis such as effect directed analysis can be a way to separate the toxicity caused by anthropogenic and natural compounds the third challenge is the selectivity of sample extraction while spe methods with broad selectivity exist an extraction of chemicals is always selective resulting in a loss of compounds with low affinity to the sorbent köke et al 2018 neale et al 2018 niss et al 2018 stalter et al 2016 accordingly the toxicity of an extract will never fully represent the toxicity of the extracted sample thus the question is rather how much loss in toxicity during extraction is acceptable one way of addressing this is to compare the toxicity of extracts to aqueous samples dagnino et al 2010 another way is to optimise the recovery of toxicity both strategies were adopted in this study to identify the best extraction method the forth challenge arises from cytotoxicity masking the effect under investigation which is often the case at high concentration factors while cytotoxicity can be considered an important toxicological endpoint by itself outweighing the specific effect is masks it is most commonly rather regarded an obstacle that needs to be removed this can be achieved by diluting a sample to a non cytotoxic concentration inoue et al 2009 2011 leusch et al 2017 neale et al 2018 välitalo et al 2017 however this also dilutes the effect of interest alternative approaches such as minimising the dilution of aqueous samples niss et al 2018 or reducing exposure times in the bioassay as well as cleaning up the cytotoxicity e g by fractionation have so far not been widely adopted these challenges are connected to a range of spe

fractionation steps leusch et al 2017 välitalo et al 2017 and operating modes such as large volume or multilayer spe köke et al 2018 schulze et al 2017 can be optimised acknowledging that it is impractical to perform an optimisation for every sample and every bioassay a range of case studies for different matrices can be used to evaluate whether specific sample preparation methods perform generally better than others we have taken such approach in the present study and conclude that the telos c18 env method at neutral sample ph performs best in recovering multiple endocrine activities and cytotoxicity from aqueous samples 5 conclusions 1 acidification of aqueous waste water samples significantly alters a range of in vitro toxicities including anti estrogenic anti androgenic and retinoic acid like activities as well as mutagenicity sample filtration has a minor impact on the samples toxicity 2 compared to aqueous samples solid phase extraction enriches most in vitro toxicities however some activities e g anti estrogenicity remain poorly extractable 3 when comparing six spe methods the choice of the optimal method depends on the matrix as well as the in vitro endpoint 4 in general an extraction using telos c18 env at a sample ph of 7 was most effective in recovering in vitro toxicity from waste water samples however these methods also co extract a high cytotoxicity masking other endpoints using the same method at a sample ph of 2 5 reduced the extraction of cytotoxicity 5 sample preparation needs to be optimised when analysing the toxicity of water samples while this is a resource consuming task involving multiple methodological parameters water quality can only be accurately assessed when the recovery of the toxicity of a sample is maximal

19031,conditioning can drastically improve the dewaterability of sewage sludge and thus it is widely practiced in most wastewater treatment plants wwtps in wwtps various antibiotic resistance genes args present in sewage are concentrated in the sewage sludge but the effect of sludge conditioning on args in sewage sludge remains unclear here we evaluated and compared the effectiveness of four sludge conditioning methods namely chemical conditioning with polyacrylamide pam chemical conditioning with fe iii cao bioleaching conditioning and chemical acidification conditioning and an aerobic incubation control in removing 46 target args and inti1 from a municipal sewage sludge the damage of sludge microbial cells and the change in the sludge bacterial community during the various sludge conditioning treatments were also characterized the results suggested that the chemical conditioning with pam and aerobic incubation treatment did not remove args and inti1 from the sewage sludge the chemical acidification reduced the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 but increased their relative abundances however the chemical conditioning with fe iii cao and bioleaching conditioning reduced both the absolute and relative abundances of most args and removed a majority of extracellular args in the sludge during sludge conditioning treatments the sludge microbial cells were severely damaged to decrease the total bacterial biomass in sludge and accordingly the bacterial hosts carrying args and inti were effectively damaged to reduce the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 in addition the sludge bacterial community in conditioned sludge determined the relative abundances of residual args our findings suggest that sludge conditioning can be an important sludge treatment process in attenuating antibiotic resistance in sewage sludge and bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao can be employed as effective conditioning ways to reduce args in sewage sludge potentially limiting their release to the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords sludge conditioning antibiotic resistance genes removal bioleaching chemical conditioning with fe iii cao 1 introduction the escalating crisis of multidrug resistance conferred by a lot of antibiotic resistance genes args is raising fears of untreatable infections caused by bacterial superbugs harms et al 2016 xin et al 2018 and has been one of the major global public health issues levy 2002 vikesland et al 2017 wright et al 2007 zhu et al 2016 it is already recognized that urban wastewater treatment plants wwtps are hotspots for args spread into the environment hu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 munir et al 2011 rizzo et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 in conventional treatment processes various args present in sewage are concentrated and disseminated via mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmids and inti1 in the sewage sludge ju et al 2016 miller et al 2014 su et al 2015 yang et al 2013 land application of biosolids derived from the args containing sludge may increase the prevalence of args in soil environment fahrenfeld et al 2014 lau et al 2017 pepper et al 2018 xie et al 2016 thus it is urgent to critically evaluate the existing sewage sludge treatment processes of wwtps in the fate of args and mges and to develop effective ways to attenuate args in sewage sludge thus limiting their release to the environment the impacts of some sludge treatment technologies such as anaerobic digestion and composting on the changes of args in sludge have been extensively investigated diehl and lapara 2010 gao et al 2017 luo et al 2017 ma et al 2011 tian et al 2016 for instance anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge was found to be effective in attenuating some tetracycline macrolides and aminoglycosides resistance genes in municipal sewage sludge luo et al 2017 ma et al 2011 tian et al 2016 in addition shifting the condition of the anaerobic digestion from mesophilic to thermophilic could also effectively reduce the abundances of most arg subtypes except for aminoglycoside resistance genes luo et al 2017 tian et al 2016 gao et al 2017 found that although thermophilic anaerobic digestion with fe0 led to the attenuation of seven tetracycline resistance genes args with different resistance mechanisms behaved distinctly in anaerobic digesters in comparison su et al 2015 reported an increased diversity and abundances of args conferring resistance to major classes of antibiotics during conventional composting of sewage sludge and similar findings were also reported by zhang et al 2016 in summary thermophilic anaerobic digestion can attenuate some args in sludge while the conventional composting of sludge is ineffective in removing args in sludge because of the increased diversity and abundances of sludge bacterial communities during sludge composting although excess sewage sludge can be anaerobic digested for sludge reduction and the production of bioenergy in some cases other sludge disposal approaches including land application landfill drying and incineration are extensively applied christensen et al 2015 for instance many wwtps in china are not ready to adopt anaerobic digestion processes for treating sewage sludge feng et al 2015 jin et al 2014 and thus the sewage sludge is usually mechanically dewatered and then landfilled or composted hu et al 2015 sludge dewatering is generally indispensable for most sludge disposal processes because it can not only increase the dry solids content in sludge to satisfy the requirement of landfill drying or incineration chen et al 2004 christensen et al 2015 but also improve the efficiency of sludge composting lu et al 2017 mowla et al 2013 zheng et al 2016 however efficient mechanical dewatering of sewage sludge is often difficult to achieve due to their colloidal characteristics therefore sludge conditioning prior to the mechanical dewatering is very crucial for improving sludge dewaterability jin et al 2004 lu et al 2017 novak et al 2006 our previous studies revealed that sludge conditioning may result in serious lysis of sludge microbial cells to release the water entrapped in sludge floc matrix and as such the dryness of dewatered sludge cake can be improved lu et al 2017 2018 meanwhile synthetic organic polymers and metal ions are extensively used to coagulate the colloidal particles present in sludge to improve sludge filterability lu et al 2017 2018 qi et al 2011 interestingly previous studies found that microbial cell lysis exerted significant effect on the removal of args in wastewater czekalski et al 2016 hu et al 2016 for instance di cesare et al 2016 reported that the removal of a majority of bacteria and associated args from wastewater was achieved by uv or chlorine disinfection that aggressively destructed the bacterial cell structures in addition czekalski et al 2016 found that ozone at high doses inactivated the bacterial cell of escherichia coli and its plasmid encoded sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 in wastewater on the other hand some recent studies found that extracellular args are persistent in wastewater treatment processes zhang et al 2017 and the chlorine disinfection even increased the abundances of intracellular and extracellular args in treated wastewater liu et al 2018 therefore it would be interesting to test if the lysis of sludge microbial cells induced by sludge conditioning could effectively remove the various args including both extracellular and intracellular args and mges present in sludge furthermore it is meaningful to find sludge conditioning approaches that can effectively attenuate args and mges in sludge to potentially reduce the dissemination of antibiotic resistance to the environment in the present study we focus on two conventional sludge conditioning approaches chemical conditioning with polyacrylamide pam fu et al 2010 huang et al 2002 and chemical conditioning with fe iii and cao deneux mustin et al 2001 and two innovative sludge conditioning methods including bioleaching conditioning liu et al 2012 wong et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 and chemical acidification conditioning chen et al 2001 2004 lu et al 2017 the two conventional sludge conditioning approaches have been extensively used for many years in wwtps bioleaching of sludge driven by acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was recently developed as an efficient conditioning approach to improve sludge dewaterability wong et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 and the dewatered bioleached sludge can be easily composted with very low dosages of bulking agents hu et al 2015 because of the effectiveness in enhancing sludge dewaterability and the easiness of the composting of dewatered bioleached sludge more than 20 wwtps in china have already adopted the bioleaching conditioning approach to condition more than 5000 tons sludge per day hu et al 2015 in addition chemical acidification is a useful way to enhance the dryness of dewatered sludge cake chen et al 2001 2004 lu et al 2017 which can be combined with other conditioning approaches to improve sludge dewaterability the objectives of the present study are to 1 compare the effectiveness of these four sludge conditioning methods in removing inti1 and 46 target args conferring resistance to major classes of antibiotics in sludge by using real time quantitative pcr qpcr 2 study the impacts of sludge conditioning treatments on the damage of sludge microbial cells and the sludge bacterial community composition by using flow cytometry and illumine sequencing of bacterial 16s rrna genes czekalski et al 2016 guo et al 2014 thus revealing the mechanisms responsible for the possible attenuation of args and inti1 during sludge conditioning processes and 3 investigate the impacts of sludge conditioning treatments on the abundances of extracellular and intracellular args in conditioned sludge the findings of this study help understand the feasibility of removing antibiotic resistance in sludge by selecting appropriate sludge conditioning approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 municipal sewage sludge sample in the present study the municipal sewage sludge used was collected from the sludge thickening pond of the lucun wastewater treatment plant in wuxi city jiangsu province china the plant treats 3 105 m3 d of wastewater using an anaerobic anoxic oxic process the ph value 7 21 solid content 2 83 and organic matter content 61 2 were determined immediately after collection according to respective standard methods apha 2005 the specific resistance to filtration srf was determined using the buchner funnel test lu et al 2017 and the moisture content in dewatered sludge cake was determined using a lab filtration compression cell test lu et al 2017 2018 the detailed physical chemical properties of the municipal sewage sludge are shown in table s1 municipal sewage sludge was collected in sterile polyethylene containers and then stored on ice and transported to our laboratory the sludge conditioning treatments were performed within 24 h after the sampling 2 2 sludge conditioning treatment and the extraction of total genomic dna municipal sewage sludge was conditioned using chemical conditioning with pam chemical conditioning with fe iii cao bioleaching conditioning and chemical acidification conditioning meanwhile aerobic incubation of the sewage sludge was carried out as a control to reveal the impact of aerobic incubation on the args and inti1 in the sludge each conditioning treatment and the aerobic incubation control were performed in triplicate and all the sludge conditioning treatments were carried out at the same time the detailed procedures of sludge conditioning treatments are described as follows chemical conditioning with pam pam with an average molecular weight of 3 106 g mol was used to prepare a pam aqueous solution 2000 mg l the solution was allowed to stabilize for 24 h before use to ensure the full stretching of the acrylamide subunits fu et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 at dosages of 2 30 and 4 60 mg pam g ds 16 3 and 32 6 ml pam solution was respectively added to 500 ml of the raw sewage sludge placed in two sets of triplicate 1000 ml erlenmeyer flasks the sludge was mixed at 270 rpm for 1 min and then at 30 rpm for 9 min by using a magnetic stirrer device fu et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 chemical conditioning with fe iii cao at a dosage of 0 300 g cao g ds 4 25 g cao was added into triplicate 1000 ml erlenmeyer flasks each one containing 500 ml of raw sewage sludge all flasks were shaken for 30 min in a gyratory shaker at 28 c and 180 rpm to ensure the full reaction zhou et al 2018 subsequently 1 91 g fecl3 6h2o was added to the above sludge at a dosage of 0 028 g fe iii g ds and then shaken for 30 min in a gyratory shaker at 28 c and 180 rpm deneux mustin et al 2001 zhou et al 2018 meanwhile sludge conditioned with 0 350 g cao g ds and 0 034 g fe iii g ds was also prepared using the above method to study how the dosage of fe iii cao impacts the removal of args and inti1 in sludge bioleaching conditioning treatment a volume of 50 ml a ferrooxidans lx5 inoculum and 5 0 g feso4 7h2o were respectively added into triplicate 1000 ml erlenmeyer flasks each one containing 450 ml of raw sewage sludge zheng et al 2009 2016 zhou et al 2018 all flasks were incubated in a gyratory shaker at 28 c and 180 rpm for 36 h and the loss of water in each flask due to the evaporation was compensated by adding distilled water based on weight loss a volume of 75 ml sludge was collected from each flask at 12 24 and 36 h and the ph value of each corresponding sludge sample was 3 90 2 80 and 2 42 respectively chemical acidification conditioning the chemical acidification conditioning of sludge was conducted in a series of 1000 ml erlenmeyer flasks each one containing 500 ml of raw sewage sludge the ph value of sewage sludge was adjusted to around 3 90 2 80 and 2 42 which were close to the ph of the bioleached sludge recorded at 12 24 and 36 h respectively by adding 9 20 m sulfuric acid ar the sludge was then shaken in a gyratory shaker at 28 c and 180 rpm for 30 min lu et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 due to the strong buffering capacity of raw sewage sludge the above procedures were repeated three times to ensure the stability of adjusted sludge ph aerobic incubation of sludge control triplicate 1000 ml erlenmeyer flasks each one containing 500 ml of raw sewage sludge were incubated for 12 24 and 36 h respectively in a gyratory shaker at 28 c and 180 rpm our preliminary studies table s1 have revealed that bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao decreased both the sludge srf and the moisture content of dewatered sludge cake the chemical conditioning with pam decreased the sludge srf but did not reduced the moisture content of dewatered sludge cake the chemical acidification effectively reduced the moisture content of dewatered sludge cake but not the sludge srf because of the release of sludge extracellular polymeric substances and the deflocculation of sludge flocs lu et al 2017 obviously these four conditioning approaches were effective to improve sludge filterability and or the dryness of dewatered sludge cake both of which are crucial for enhancing sludge dewaterability lu et al 2018 after sludge conditioning treatments 50 ml of each conditioned sludge sample was frozen at 20 c and subsequently dried with a vacuum freeze dryer scientz n10 ningbo scientz biotechnology co ltd china meanwhile the damage of sludge microbial cells in the conditioned sludge samples sludge samples after conditioning was assessed using flow cytometry and the counts of intact cells and damaged cells were determined total genomic dna was extracted from 0 1 g freeze dried sludge sample using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio usa the total genomic dna was eluted with 50 μl of provided elution buffer 10 mm tris without edta ph 8 and stored at 20 c the dna concentration and purity were measured by using a nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific usa and the related information can be found in table s2 2 3 extraction of extracellular dna from conditioned sludge samples for the raw sludge sludge bioleached for 36 h sludge aerobically incubated for 36 h sludge chemically acidified to ph 2 42 and sludge chemically conditioned with pam 4 60 mg g ds or fe iii cao 0 350 g cao g ds and 0 034 g fe iii g ds the extracellular dna was extracted from sludge samples for the determination of the absolute abundances of extracellular args in sludge firstly a volume of 200 ml sludge samples were passed through filter papers whatman no 1 and then the obtained sludge filtrates were filtrated through 0 22 μm membranes to remove residual cells the final filtrates were used to collect extracellular dna with a precipitation method eichmiller et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 in details 242 ml of absolute ethanol and 11 ml of 3 m sodium acetate were added to 110 ml filtrate samples respectively and then the mixed solutions were stored at 20 c for overnight after that the mixed solutions were centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min to obtain the precipitates and precipitates was freeze dried and then used to extract extracellular dna with powersoil dna isolation kit mobio usa the measurement of extracellular dna concentration and purity followed the method mentioned above and the related information can be found in table s3 2 4 real time quantitative pcr qpcr for determining args and inti1 in this study inti1 and 46 arg subtypes were investigated in detail using the viia 7 real time pcr system applied biosystems inc usa with a high throughput quantitative reaction platform wcgene biotech shanghai china garner et al 2018 when quantifying 254 args in raw sludge and conditioned sludge samples by using high throughput quantitative real time pcr ht qpcr fig s1 su et al 2015 we found that these 46 target genes covered almost all detected args in raw sludge and conditioned sludge samples because the ht qpcr method is only semi quantitative the qpcr approach was utilized in the present study to precisely quantify the absolute abundances of 46 target genes and inti1 in sludge samples a total of a pair of bacterial universal 16s rrna gene primers inti1 primers and 46 validated arg primers table s4 were applied which included aminoglycoside beta lactamase fca sulfonamide macrolide lincosamide streptogramin b mlsb vancomycin and tetracycline resistance genes su et al 2015 zhu et al 2013 the plasmids containing these specific genes were manufactured by sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china which were used as standards in a 10 fold dilution to make qpcr standard curves pcr reaction mixtures 10 μl for each well consisted of 5 μl faststart universal sybr green master with rox roche applied sciences indianapolis in 3 μl nuclease free pcr grade water 1 μl each primer and 1 μl of standard plasmid or dna samples the reaction procedure of quantitative pcr mainly included the initial enzyme activation at 95 c for 10 min and 40 cycles of the following program used for amplification including denaturation at 95 c for 30 s and annealing at 60 c for 30s wang et al 2014 an automatic heating and melting curve was comprised in the program and each melting curve was checked the amplification efficiencies of different pcr reactions ranged from 90 to 110 and r2 values were higher than 0 99 for all standard curves table s5 each reaction was run in triplicate along with standard curves and the pcr reaction mixtures without dna samples were used as negative control the detection limits of specific target genes are shown in table s5 the absolute and relative abundances of target genes are presented as copy numbers per gram dry sludge and gene copy numbers per 16s rrna gene respectively liao et al 2018 the absolute abundances of extracellular target genes are presented as copy numbers per liter sludge sample zhang et al 2017 as the absolute abundances of total genes and extracellular genes were directly measured the absolute abundances of intracellular genes were calculated as the gene copy difference between the total genes and extracellular genes 2 5 16s rrna gene amplification sequencing and data processing the 16s rrna gene amplification sequencing and data processing were performed according to previous studies kuang et al 2013 xiong et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 and the details are described in supplementary material 2 6 measurement of the intact cells the membrane damaged cells and the damaged cells in conditioned sludge samples by flow cytometry conditioned sludge samples were fluorescently stained with an annexin v fitc apoptosis detection kit sigma aldrich usa and measured by a bd biosciences accuric6 flow cytometer becton dickinson immunocytometry systems san jose calif to reflect the damage of sludge bacterial cells induced by sludge conditioning treatments guo et al 2014 ziglio et al 2002 the detailed staining and detection procedures could be found in our recent publication zhou et al 2018 briefly approximate 1 ml of conditioned sludge sample was diluted using sterile water to reduce its solid content to around 0 005 in order to avoid the negative effects of inert particles on the related staining and measuring process subsequently 0 5 ml of diluted sludge sample was respectively stained by propidium iodide pi and fitc annexin v according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer sigma aldrich usa and then the stained sludge sample was measured by a bd biosciences accuric6 flow cytometer the annexin v fitc apoptosis detection kit contains membrane impermeable nucleic acid dye propidium iodide pi and fitc annexin v which has high affinity for the phospholipid phosphatidylserine ps in the inner layer of cell membrane fitc annexin v staining can identify the membrane damaged cell via binding with ps that is exposed to the external cellular environment meanwhile pi can identify the damaged cell because only the cellular membranes of dead and damaged cells are permeable to pi czekalski et al 2016 di cesare et al 2016 thus sludge microbial cells can be distinguished from fitc annexin v and pi negative the intact cells fitc annexin v positive and pi negative the membrane damaged cells and fitc annexin v negative positive and pi positive the damaged cells for each sludge sample data were collected from 10 000 cells and calculations of the proportion of different cells were carried out with the flowjo v10 software treestar 2 7 statistical analysis spearman correlation analysis and significance tests were performed by using spss v24 0 ibm usa the impacts of sludge conditioning treatments on the damage of sludge microbial cells and the absolute abundances of total args inti1 16s rrna gene copies in sludge were analyzed by one way anova and post hoc comparisons of the means were performed by a student newman keuls snk test heatmaps of args and bacterial community principal component analysis pca based on bray curtis distance one way analysis of similarities anosim to compare profile differences across groups of samples garner et al 2018 and procrustes analysis to determine the correlation between the sludge bacterial community based on otu abundances and the relative abundances of args were performed in r3 4 0 environment with vegan 2 4 3 and a pheatmap package luo et al 2017 su et al 2015 cluster analysis of the sludge bacterial community composition was performed by using a upgma unweighted pair group method with arithmetic means method to interpret the distance matrix using average linkage and was conducted by using upgma cluster py script http qiime org scripts upgma cluster html in qiime software network analysis based on the spearman correlation analysis between args and bacterial taxa was conducted using the gephi platform ju et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 a significance cutoff of α 0 05 was used for all analyses 3 results 3 1 effects of sludge conditioning treatments on the absolute abundances of args and inti1 in the raw sludge the absolute abundances of the detected 46 args and inti1 were approximately 1 05 1010 and 2 95 109 gene copies per gram dry sludge fig 1 respectively among these arg subtypes the top 15 most abundant args included one sulfonamide sul2 ten aminoglycoside aada5 01 aada1 strb aada2 03 aada2 02 aada2 01 aada 02 aada 01 aac 6 ii and aac 6 ib 03 one mlsb mexf one chloramphenicol catb3 one beta lactamase blaveb and one tetracycline tetg 01 accounting for 85 9 of the absolute abundance of the total args the absolute abundance of the total args in the aerobically incubated sludge 12 h 24 h or 36 h and sludge conditioned with pam 2 30 or 4 60 mg pam g ds was not significantly different to that of the raw sludge p 0 071 the absolute abundance of the total args in the sludge conditioned with bioleaching or chemical acidification conditioning were significantly reduced with an extension of bioleaching period from 12 h to 36 h p 0 05 or with a decline of sludge ph from 3 90 to 2 42 by chemical acidification p 0 05 however no significant difference in the absolute abundance of the total args was found between the sludge conditioned with two different dosages of fe iii cao p 0 162 overall bioleaching for 36 h chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao and chemical acidification to sludge ph 2 42 all led to significant reduction p 0 05 in the absolute abundance of total args and inti1 in sludge by 2 16 2 38 and 3 27 3 79 log units respectively these approaches were much more effective than the other conditioning treatments and distinctly altered the overall pattern of args profile in sludge anosim r 0 9598 p 0 0002 in particular only 16 15 and 13 arg subtypes were detected in sludge being bioleached for 36 h and sludge chemically conditioned with two dosages of fe iii cao fig 1b most arg subtypes in the raw sludge however could still be detected after the raw sludge was chemically acidified to ph 2 42 the absolute abundances of residual args except for vanc 03 tet 34 and tetm 01 were reduced by 1 63 4 96 log units for bioleaching for 36 h 1 71 4 13 log units for chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao and 1 58 3 83 log units for chemical acidification to sludge ph 2 42 respectively fig 1b and table s6 3 2 effects of sludge conditioning treatments on the damage of sludge microbial cells and the reduction of total bacterial biomass the intact cell and damaged cell counts were 87 5 and 11 3 respectively in the raw sludge as shown in fig 2 a the chemical conditioning with two dosages of pam and aerobic incubation with duration of 12 36 h did not significantly change either the intact cell count p 0 350 or the damaged cell count in sludge p 0 141 however the bioleaching conditioning chemical conditioning with fe iii cao and chemical acidification all significantly decreased the intact cell count to 48 8 66 3 p 0 05 and correspondingly increased the damaged cell count to 26 6 48 6 p 0 05 the bioleaching conditioning chemical conditioning with fe iii cao and chemical acidification significantly reduced 16s rrna gene copies a proxy for total bacterial cells in sludge by 2 73 3 79 log units p 0 05 while chemical conditioning with pam and aerobic incubation did not significantly change the 16s rrna gene copies in sludge p 0 146 fig 2b the 16s rrna gene copies positively correlated with the intact cell counts in conditioned sludge samples spearman ρ 0 770 p 0 01 and negatively correlated with the damaged cell counts in conditioned sludge samples ρ 0 783 p 0 01 significant positive relationships were recorded between the 16s rrna gene copies and the absolute abundance of inti1 ρ 0 938 p 0 01 or most args except for vanc 03 and tet 34 ρ 0 752 0 996 p 0 01 table s7 in detail the absolute abundance of inti1 was reduced by 1 01 log unit with a reduction of one log 16s rrna gene copy in sludge the absolute abundances of aminoglycoside beta lactamase sulfonamide fca and mlsb resistance genes were reduced by 0 79 0 90 log unit with a reduction of one log 16s rrna gene copy in sludge the absolute abundances of tetracycline and vancomycin resistance genes however were reduced by only 0 36 0 49 log unit with a reduction of one log 16s rrna gene copy in sludge fig 3 3 3 effects of sludge conditioning treatments on the relative abundances of args and inti1 the distances and variations between raw and conditioned sludge samples were visualized by principal components analysis pca based on the relative abundances normalizing to 16s rrna genes of arg subtypes fig s2 the raw sludge aerobically incubated sludge 12 h 24 h or 36 h and sludge conditioned with 2 30 or 4 60 mg pam g ds clustered apart from the other conditioned sludge samples the relative abundances of most args however were greatly increased by chemical acidification and bioleaching conditioning for 12 or 24 h fig 4 both the bioleaching conditioning for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao led to the relative abundance reduction of mlsb resistance genes by 61 4 75 4 and beta lactamase resistance genes by approximately 100 respectively for the aminoglycoside resistance genes the bioleaching conditioning for 36 h reduced their relative abundances by 80 6 but chemical conditioning with the two dosages of fe iii cao only decreased their relative abundances by 8 35 15 4 due to the low removal of aada5 01 although either bioleaching for 36 h or chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao reduced the relative abundances of most fca vancomycin and tetracycline resistance genes in the conditioned sludge the relative abundances of flor vanc 03 tetm 01 and tet 34 were drastically increased in addition the bioleaching for 36 h resulted in a reduction of inti1 relative abundance from 0 0155 gene copy per 16s rrna gene in raw sludge to as low as 0 0051 gene copy per 16s rrna gene which was not attained by other conditioning treatments fig 4c 3 4 impacts of sludge conditionings on the sludge bacterial community and its correlation with the relative abundance profiles of args according to the results of pca and upgma clustering analysis based on the bacterial relative abundances in sludge samples fig s3 and s4 the raw sludge aerobically incubated sludge 12 h 24 h or 36 h and sludge conditioned with 2 30 or 4 60 mg pam g ds clustered apart from the other conditioned sludge samples in addition the bioleaching for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao decreased the richness of the sludge bacterial community chao1 and otus in the raw sludge more than other conditioning treatments and the bioleaching for 36 h resulted in the lowest diversity of the sludge bacterial community shannon and simpson table s8 procrustes analysis was used to link the arg profiles the relative abundances of args with the bacterial community composition bacterial 16s rrna gene otus data and a significant correlation sum of squares m2 0 5777 ρ 0 660 p 0 001 was found by considering all of the conditioned sludge samples fig 5 a the co occurrence between arg subtypes and microbial taxa was revealed by a network analysis to illustrate the detailed relationships between specific arg subtypes and microbial taxa fig 5b it can be found that 66 bacterial taxa at genus level table s9 significantly correlated with the detected 46 arg subtypes in sludge spearman ρ 0 70 p 0 01 the relative abundances of 66 arg associated bacteria in raw and conditioned sludge samples were further compared fig 6 the results of cluster analysis reflected that the chemical conditioning with pam and the aerobic incubation exerted marginal impacts on the community composition of arg associated bacteria in sludge while the bioleaching chemical acidification and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao induced more notable changes in the community composition of arg associated bacteria in sludge it is worthy to note that bioleaching for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao selected for distinct communities of the arg associated bacteria in sludge anosim r 0 8848 p 0 0033 the total relative abundance of arg associated bacteria was reduced from 25 5 in raw sludge to 10 3 13 6 by the bioleaching for 36 h or chemical conditioning with two dosage of fe iii cao however the bioleaching for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosage of fe iii cao increased the relative abundance of clostridium genus from 0 34 to 0 45 0 60 and also increased the relative abundances of microbacterium and prevotella genus by 2 85 15 0 and 19 2 66 5 folds respectively in addition the relative abundances of the genus corynebacterium and staphylococcus were increased by the chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao 3 5 impacts of sludge conditioning treatments on the extracellular args in conditioned sludge abundant extracellular args were detected in the raw sludge which included 11 aminoglycoside 1 53 106 4 38 107 gene copies per liter sample 12 tetracycline 4 99 105 1 43 107 gene copies per liter sample 8 mlsb 2 93 103 1 05 107 gene copies per liter sample 4 beta lactamase 8 78 105 2 17 107 gene copies per liter sample 3 vancomycin 8 51 104 3 94 105 gene copies per liter sample 3 fca 1 51 105 1 21 107 gene copies per liter sample and 1 sulfonamide 1 00 108 gene copies per liter sample resistance genes fig 7 compared to the intracellular args in each sludge sample fig s5 the extracellular part only accounted for less than 0 122 of the total args in the sludge the chemical conditioning with 4 60 mg pam g ds had no noticeable impact on either the diversity of extracellular arg subtypes or the absolute abundances of individual extracellular arg subtypes however both the diversity of extracellular arg subtypes and the absolute abundances of most extracellular args in raw sludge were reduced by the bioleaching for 36 h aerobic incubation for 36 h chemical conditioning with fe iii cao 0 350 g cao g ds and 0 034 g fe iii g ds and chemical acidification to sludge ph 2 42 only 3 extracellular args i e aada2 03 sul2 and tet 34 and 4 extracellular args i e aada2 03 aada5 01 sul2 and tet 34 remained in the bioleached sludge and sludge chemically conditioned with fe iii cao respectively these two conditioning approaches were also superior over the other approaches to remove the intracellular args in sludge fig s5 4 discussion 4 1 sludge conditioning treatments reduced the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 in sludge via severely damaging the sludge microbial cells previous studies reported that args in sludge cannot be effectively attenuated during the conventional composting of sewage sludge su et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 we found in the present study that the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 can be effectively reduced by chemical acidification bioleaching or chemical conditioning with fe iii cao but not by chemical conditioning with pam or aerobic incubation i e aerobic digestion of sludge during the bioleaching or chemical acidification of sewage sludge most args and inti1 were gradually attenuated with the decline in sludge ph to around 2 42 when the raw sludge was bioleached for 36 h chemically conditioned with two dosages of fe iii cao or chemically acidified to ph 2 42 the absolute abundances of the total args and inti1 in sludge were reduced by 2 16 2 38 and 3 27 3 79 log units respectively it was reported in previous studies that the alkaline fermentation of sewage sludge in anaerobic reactors only reduced the absolute abundances of sulfonamides and tetracycline resistance genes by 0 42 1 36 log units huang et al 2017 the hyperthermophilic composting of sewage sludge reduced the absolute abundances of total args and mges by 1 04 and 0 92 log units respectively liao et al 2018 and the absolute abundance of total args were even increased during the conventional composting of sewage sludge su et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 obviously the sludge conditioning processes can be more effective than composting aerobic digestion or anaerobic digestion to reduce the absolute abundances of args and inti1 in sewage sludge which may be a very important step in wwtps to control antibiotic resistance therefore the chemical acidification bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao cannot only improve the sludge filterability and or the dryness of dewatered sludge cake but are also useful to reduce the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 in sewage sludge the chemical conditioning with pam and aerobic incubation did not damage sludge microbial cells but the other three conditioning approaches induced the drastic damage of sludge microbial cells flow cytometry data in fact several recent studies highlighted the importance of the destruction of bacterial cell structures in removing args from wastewater czekalski et al 2016 di cesare et al 2016 hu et al 2016 for instance it was reported by czekalski et al 2016 that the membrane integrity and dna stability of escherichia coli cells in wastewater can be destroyed by ozone at high doses to degrade plasmid encoded sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 in escherichia coli in the present study the correlation between 16s rrna gene copies and the damaged cell count negative in sludge suggests that the chemical acidification bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao severely damaged sludge microbial cells to reduce the total bacterial biomass in the conditioned sludge the positive relationships between the 16s rrna gene copies and the absolute abundances of inti1 and most args table s7 suggest that the cells of most hosts carrying args and inti1 were damaged along with the reduction of the total bacterial biomass in sludge consequently removing most args and inti1 from sewage sludge thus the main underlying mechanism for arg removal by sludge conditioning treatments is likely that the sludge microbial cells were severely damaged by sludge conditioning to decrease the total bacterial biomass in sludge and accordingly the bacterial hosts carrying args and inti were effectively damaged to attenuate most args and inti1 in sludge although bioleaching for 36 h chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao and chemical acidification to sludge ph 2 42 resulted in similar reduction extents of total args and 16s rrna gene copies in sludge the residual arg profiles in the conditioned sludge were totally different most arg subtypes that were initially detected in the raw sludge including 10 12 of the top 15 most abundant args were below their respective detection limits after the bioleaching for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao which was not attained by chemical acidification to sludge ph 2 42 on the other hand individual arg subtypes responded differently to the sludge conditioning treatments which was also found in the thermophilic anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge tian et al 2016 for instance the removal of aminoglycoside beta lactamase sulfonamide fca and mlsb resistance genes with a reduction of one log 16s rrna gene copy in sludge was much higher than that of tetracycline and vancomycin resistance genes fig 3 among tetracycline and vancomycin resistance genes tetm 01 was only slightly attenuated by bioleaching for 36 h chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao and chemical acidification to sludge ph 2 42 but vanc 03 and tet 34 were even enriched by these three conditioning treatments suggesting that their hosts may be very resistant to these conditioning treatments 4 2 the sludge bacterial community determined the relative abundances of residual args in conditioned sludge since the chemical conditioning with pam and aerobic incubation changed neither the absolute abundances of args and inti1 nor the 16s rrna gene copies in sludge they marginally impacted the relative abundances of args and inti1 in sludge fig s2 and fig 4 the increases of the relative abundances of most args and inti1 induced by chemical acidification and bioleaching conditioning for 12 or 24 h resulted from the fact that the reduction extent of total bacterial biomass 16s rrna gene copies was much higher than that of args or inti1 absolute abundance in sludge only the bioleaching conditioning for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao reduced the relative abundances of most args however they led to the increases in the relative abundances of vanc 03 tetm 01 and tet 34 because of the very slight removal of tetm 01 and no removal of vanc 03 and tet 34 in conditioned sludge thus bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao were effective to reduce the relative abundances of most args in sludge which was not attained by chemical acidification conditioning the aerobic incubation and chemical conditioning with pam almost had no apparent effect on the bacterial community composition in raw sludge but chemical acidification bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao remarkably changed the sludge bacterial community composition based on the result of procrustes analysis it can be found that arg profiles relative abundance were significantly correlated with the bacterial community composition bacterial 16s rrna gene otus data in conditioned sludge indeed previous studies have revealed that the changes in the microbial community composition contributed to the profiles of args during sludge composting or anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge luo et al 2017 su et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 in addition it is worthy to note that the genus of acidithiobacillus did not significantly correlate with any arg subtype implying that the a ferrooxidans lx5 which was inoculated into the sludge for the bioleaching conditioning was unlikely a potential host of the detected args although both the bioleaching for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao reduced the relative abundances of most args in sludge they led to distinct communities of the arg associated bacteria in sludge these two conditioning treatments effectively killed the potential hosts carrying most aminoglycoside mlsb and beta lactamase resistance genes fig 6 which included the genus of dechloromonas azovibrio blvii28 crenothrix sulfuritalea thauera epulopiscium coprococcus candidatus accumulibacter crocinitomix nostocoida epulopiscium coprococcus and thermacetogenium probably because they are sensitive to the change of sludge ph as a consequence the relative abundances of most aminoglycoside mlsb and beta lactamase resistance genes in sludge were effectively reduced by both the bioleaching for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao given that the genus of clostridium microbacterium and prevotella mainly are the potential hosts of flor vanc 03 tet 34 and tetm 01 bioleaching for 36 h and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao did not reduce but rather increased their relative abundances and so as the relative abundances of these four arg subtypes the genus of microbacterium corynebacterium and staphylococcus are potential hosts of aada5 01 and thus the chemical conditioning with fe iii cao increased their relative abundances to accordingly increase the relative abundance of aada5 01 in conditioned sludge therefore although sludge conditioning treatments reduced the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 in sludge via damaging the sludge microbial cells the sludge bacterial community determined the relative abundances of residual args in the conditioned sludge 4 3 bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao removed a majority of extracellular args recent study revealed that the extracellular args are persistent in the wastewater and their removal was much lower than that of intracellular args in wastewater treatment processes zhang et al 2017 indeed liu et al 2018 reported that the chlorine disinfection of wastewater even increased the abundances of extracellular args thereby posing risk of the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in the environment we found in the present study that the chemical conditioning with pam could not remove the extracellular args in raw sludge but the bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao removed a majority of extracellular args in raw sludge this result suggests that although bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao led to drastic damage of sludge microbial cells the released extracellular args were not accumulated in conditioned sludge but most likely were degraded thus potentially limiting their release into the environment however the extracellular args including aada2 03 aada5 01 sul2 and tet 34 were not removed by bioleaching or chemical conditioning with fe iii cao exhibiting their persistence in conditioned sludge it should be noted that the abundances of args and inti1 in dewatered sludge cake and sludge filtrate after mechanical dewatering processes were not fully characterized in the present study because of the varied solid liquid separation efficiencies of different mechanical dewatering approaches such as belt filters filter press and decanter centrifuges christensen et al 2015 however since most intracellular and extracellular args can be effectively removed during the bioleaching conditioning or chemical conditioning with fe iii cao it is reasonable to presume that these two conditioning methods would result in low abundances of most args in dewatered sludge cake achieved by mechanical dewatering although conditioning parameters influenced the removal of args and inti1 in conditioned sludge their successful removal can be attained once the severe damage of sludge microbial cells is achieved by sludge conditioning treatments meanwhile the findings obtained from the present study would suit for other sewage sludge samples because the damage of sludge microbial cells as the main mechanism for arg removal induced by sludge conditioning usually exists during the conditioning of different sewage sludge samples he et al 2017 lu et al 2017 2018 the findings of the present study imply that it is feasible in practice to remove args in sludge by selecting appropriate sludge conditioning approaches such as bioleaching conditioning or chemical conditioning with fe iii cao in such a way the abundances of args in landfill leachates may be reduced when the dewatered sludge cakes are landfilled wu et el 2017 besides the removal of args during sludge conditioning treatments may result in low abundances of args in sewage sludge compost products consequently reducing the dissemination of args in the soil environment thus further work is still needed to study the environmental risks of the residual args with high relative abundances in conditioned sludge and whether the removal of args and inti1 during bioleaching conditioning and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao would reduce the dissemination of args to the environment especially in the landfilling of dewatered sludge cake or land application of sewage sludge compost products 5 conclusions the present study evaluated for the first time the effect of sludge conditioning on the removal of args and inti1 from sewage sludge the chemical conditioning with pam and aerobic incubation treatment did not remove args and inti1 from sewage sludge the chemical acidification reduced the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 but increased their relative abundances however the chemical conditioning with fe iii cao and bioleaching conditioning which are a conventional sludge conditioning approach and an innovative conditioning technique reduced the absolute and relative abundances of most args and removed a majority of extracellular args in sludge during sludge conditioning treatments the sludge microbial cells were severely damaged to decrease the total bacterial biomass in sludge and accordingly the bacterial hosts carrying args and inti were effectively damaged to reduce the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 besides the sludge bacterial community in conditioned sludge determined the relative abundances of residual args therefore sludge conditioning can be an important sludge treatment process of wwtps in attenuating antibiotic resistance and bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao can be employed as effective conditioning ways to reduce args in sewage sludge acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the financial support from

19031,conditioning can drastically improve the dewaterability of sewage sludge and thus it is widely practiced in most wastewater treatment plants wwtps in wwtps various antibiotic resistance genes args present in sewage are concentrated in the sewage sludge but the effect of sludge conditioning on args in sewage sludge remains unclear here we evaluated and compared the effectiveness of four sludge conditioning methods namely chemical conditioning with polyacrylamide pam chemical conditioning with fe iii cao bioleaching conditioning and chemical acidification conditioning and an aerobic incubation control in removing 46 target args and inti1 from a municipal sewage sludge the damage of sludge microbial cells and the change in the sludge bacterial community during the various sludge conditioning treatments were also characterized the results suggested that the chemical conditioning with pam and aerobic incubation treatment did not remove args and inti1 from the sewage sludge the chemical acidification reduced the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 but increased their relative abundances however the chemical conditioning with fe iii cao and bioleaching conditioning reduced both the absolute and relative abundances of most args and removed a majority of extracellular args in the sludge during sludge conditioning treatments the sludge microbial cells were severely damaged to decrease the total bacterial biomass in sludge and accordingly the bacterial hosts carrying args and inti were effectively damaged to reduce the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 in addition the sludge bacterial community in conditioned sludge determined the relative abundances of residual args our findings suggest that sludge conditioning can be an important sludge treatment process in attenuating antibiotic resistance in sewage sludge and bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao can be employed as effective conditioning ways to reduce args in sewage sludge potentially limiting their release to the environment graphical abstract image 1 keywords sludge conditioning antibiotic resistance genes removal bioleaching chemical conditioning with fe iii cao 1 introduction the escalating crisis of multidrug resistance conferred by a lot of antibiotic resistance genes args is raising fears of untreatable infections caused by bacterial superbugs harms et al 2016 xin et al 2018 and has been one of the major global public health issues levy 2002 vikesland et al 2017 wright et al 2007 zhu et al 2016 it is already recognized that urban wastewater treatment plants wwtps are hotspots for args spread into the environment hu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 munir et al 2011 rizzo et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 in conventional treatment processes various args present in sewage are concentrated and disseminated via mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmids and inti1 in the sewage sludge ju et al 2016 miller et al 2014 su et al 2015 yang et al 2013 land application of biosolids derived from the args containing sludge may increase the prevalence of args in soil environment fahrenfeld et al 2014 lau et al 2017 pepper et al 2018 xie et al 2016 thus it is urgent to critically evaluate the existing sewage sludge treatment processes of wwtps in the fate of args and mges and to develop effective ways to attenuate args in sewage sludge thus limiting their release to the environment the impacts of some sludge treatment technologies such as anaerobic digestion and composting on the changes of args in sludge have been extensively investigated diehl and lapara 2010 gao et al 2017 luo et al 2017 ma et al 2011 tian et al 2016 for instance anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge was found to be effective in attenuating some tetracycline macrolides and aminoglycosides resistance genes in municipal sewage sludge luo et al 2017 ma et al 2011 tian et al 2016 in addition shifting the condition of the anaerobic digestion from mesophilic to thermophilic could also effectively reduce the abundances of most arg subtypes except for aminoglycoside resistance genes luo et al 2017 tian et al 2016 gao et al 2017 found that although thermophilic anaerobic digestion with fe0 led to the attenuation of seven tetracycline resistance genes args with different resistance mechanisms behaved distinctly in anaerobic digesters in comparison su et al 2015 reported an increased diversity and abundances of args conferring resistance to major classes of antibiotics during conventional composting of sewage sludge and similar findings were also reported by zhang et al 2016 in summary thermophilic anaerobic digestion can attenuate some args in sludge while the conventional composting of sludge is ineffective in removing args in sludge because of the increased diversity and abundances of sludge bacterial communities during sludge composting although excess sewage sludge can be anaerobic digested for sludge reduction and the production of bioenergy in some cases other sludge disposal approaches including land application landfill drying and incineration are extensively applied christensen et al 2015 for instance many wwtps in china are not ready to adopt anaerobic digestion processes for treating sewage sludge feng et al 2015 jin et al 2014 and thus the sewage sludge is usually mechanically dewatered and then landfilled or composted hu et al 2015 sludge dewatering is generally indispensable for most sludge disposal processes because it can not only increase the dry solids content in sludge to satisfy the requirement of landfill drying or incineration chen et al 2004 christensen et al 2015 but also improve the efficiency of sludge composting lu et al 2017 mowla et al 2013 zheng et al 2016 however efficient mechanical dewatering of sewage sludge is often difficult to achieve due to their colloidal characteristics therefore sludge conditioning prior to the mechanical dewatering is very crucial for improving sludge dewaterability jin et al 2004 lu et al 2017 novak et al 2006 our previous studies revealed that sludge conditioning may result in serious lysis of sludge microbial cells to release the water entrapped in sludge floc matrix and as such the dryness of dewatered sludge cake can be improved lu et al 2017 2018 meanwhile synthetic organic polymers and metal ions are extensively used to coagulate the colloidal particles present in sludge to improve sludge filterability lu et al 2017 2018 qi et al 2011 interestingly previous studies found that microbial cell lysis exerted significant effect on the removal of args in wastewater czekalski et al 2016 hu et al 2016 for instance di cesare et al 2016 reported that the removal of a majority of bacteria and associated args from wastewater was achieved by uv or chlorine disinfection that aggressively destructed the bacterial cell structures in addition czekalski et al 2016 found that ozone at high doses inactivated the bacterial cell of escherichia coli and its plasmid encoded sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 in wastewater on the other hand some recent studies found that extracellular args are persistent in wastewater treatment processes zhang et al 2017 and the chlorine disinfection even increased the abundances of intracellular and extracellular args in treated wastewater liu et al 2018 therefore it would be interesting to test if the lysis of sludge microbial cells induced by sludge conditioning could effectively remove the various args including both extracellular and intracellular args and mges present in sludge furthermore it is meaningful to find sludge conditioning approaches that can effectively attenuate args and mges in sludge to potentially reduce the dissemination of antibiotic resistance to the environment in the present study we focus on two conventional sludge conditioning approaches chemical conditioning with polyacrylamide pam fu et al 2010 huang et al 2002 and chemical conditioning with fe iii and cao deneux mustin et al 2001 and two innovative sludge conditioning methods including bioleaching conditioning liu et al 2012 wong et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 and chemical acidification conditioning chen et al 2001 2004 lu et al 2017 the two conventional sludge conditioning approaches have been extensively used for many years in wwtps bioleaching of sludge driven by acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was recently developed as an efficient conditioning approach to improve sludge dewaterability wong et al 2015 zheng et al 2016 and the dewatered bioleached sludge can be easily composted with very low dosages of bulking agents hu et al 2015 because of the effectiveness in enhancing sludge dewaterability and the easiness of the composting of dewatered bioleached sludge more than 20 wwtps in china have already adopted the bioleaching conditioning approach to condition more than 5000 tons sludge per day hu et al 2015 in addition chemical acidification is a useful way to enhance the dryness of dewatered sludge cake chen et al 2001 2004 lu et al 2017 which can be combined with other conditioning approaches to improve sludge dewaterability the objectives of the present study are to 1 compare the effectiveness of these four sludge conditioning methods in removing inti1 and 46 target args conferring resistance to major classes of antibiotics in sludge by using real time quantitative pcr qpcr 2 study the impacts of sludge conditioning treatments on the damage of sludge microbial cells and the sludge bacterial community composition by using flow cytometry and illumine sequencing of bacterial 16s rrna genes czekalski et al 2016 guo et al 2014 thus revealing the mechanisms responsible for the possible attenuation of args and inti1 during sludge conditioning processes and 3 investigate the impacts of sludge conditioning treatments on the abundances of extracellular and intracellular args in conditioned sludge the findings of this study help understand the feasibility of removing antibiotic resistance in sludge by selecting appropriate sludge conditioning approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 municipal sewage sludge sample in the present study the municipal sewage sludge used was collected from the sludge thickening pond of the lucun wastewater treatment plant in wuxi city jiangsu province china the plant treats 3 105 m3 d of wastewater using an anaerobic anoxic oxic process the ph value 7 21 solid content 2 83 and organic matter content 61 2 were determined immediately after collection according to respective standard methods apha 2005 the specific resistance to filtration srf was determined using the buchner funnel test lu et al 2017 and the moisture content in dewatered sludge cake was determined using a lab filtration compression cell test lu et al 2017 2018 the detailed physical chemical properties of the municipal sewage sludge are shown in table s1 municipal sewage sludge was collected in sterile polyethylene containers and then stored on ice and transported to our laboratory the sludge conditioning treatments were performed within 24 h after the sampling 2 2 sludge conditioning treatment and the extraction of total genomic dna municipal sewage sludge was conditioned using chemical conditioning with pam chemical conditioning with fe iii cao bioleaching conditioning and chemical acidification conditioning meanwhile aerobic incubation of the sewage sludge was carried out as a control to reveal the impact of aerobic incubation on the args and inti1 in the sludge each conditioning treatment and the aerobic incubation control were performed in triplicate and all the sludge conditioning treatments were carried out at the same time the detailed procedures of sludge conditioning treatments are described as follows chemical conditioning with pam pam with an average molecular weight of 3 106 g mol was used to prepare a pam aqueous solution 2000 mg l the solution was allowed to stabilize for 24 h before use to ensure the full stretching of the acrylamide subunits fu et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 at dosages of 2 30 and 4 60 mg pam g ds 16 3 and 32 6 ml pam solution was respectively added to 500 ml of the raw sewage sludge placed in two sets of triplicate 1000 ml erlenmeyer flasks the sludge was mixed at 270 rpm for 1 min and then at 30 rpm for 9 min by using a magnetic stirrer device fu et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 chemical conditioning with fe iii cao at a dosage of 0 300 g cao g ds 4 25 g cao was added into triplicate 1000 ml erlenmeyer flasks each one containing 500 ml of raw sewage sludge all flasks were shaken for 30 min in a gyratory shaker at 28 c and 180 rpm to ensure the full reaction zhou et al 2018 subsequently 1 91 g fecl3 6h2o was added to the above sludge at a dosage of 0 028 g fe iii g ds and then shaken for 30 min in a gyratory shaker at 28 c and 180 rpm deneux mustin et al 2001 zhou et al 2018 meanwhile sludge conditioned with 0 350 g cao g ds and 0 034 g fe iii g ds was also prepared using the above method to study how the dosage of fe iii cao impacts the removal of args and inti1 in sludge bioleaching conditioning treatment a volume of 50 ml a ferrooxidans lx5 inoculum and 5 0 g feso4 7h2o were respectively added into triplicate 1000 ml erlenmeyer flasks each one containing 450 ml of raw sewage sludge zheng et al 2009 2016 zhou et al 2018 all flasks were incubated in a gyratory shaker at 28 c and 180 rpm for 36 h and the loss of water in each flask due to the evaporation was compensated by adding distilled water based on weight loss a volume of 75 ml sludge was collected from each flask at 12 24 and 36 h and the ph value of each corresponding sludge sample was 3 90 2 80 and 2 42 respectively chemical acidification conditioning the chemical acidification conditioning of sludge was conducted in a series of 1000 ml erlenmeyer flasks each one containing 500 ml of raw sewage sludge the ph value of sewage sludge was adjusted to around 3 90 2 80 and 2 42 which were close to the ph of the bioleached sludge recorded at 12 24 and 36 h respectively by adding 9 20 m sulfuric acid ar the sludge was then shaken in a gyratory shaker at 28 c and 180 rpm for 30 min lu et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 due to the strong buffering capacity of raw sewage sludge the above procedures were repeated three times to ensure the stability of adjusted sludge ph aerobic incubation of sludge control triplicate 1000 ml erlenmeyer flasks each one containing 500 ml of raw sewage sludge were incubated for 12 24 and 36 h respectively in a gyratory shaker at 28 c and 180 rpm our preliminary studies table s1 have revealed that bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao decreased both the sludge srf and the moisture content of dewatered sludge cake the chemical conditioning with pam decreased the sludge srf but did not reduced the moisture content of dewatered sludge cake the chemical acidification effectively reduced the moisture content of dewatered sludge cake but not the sludge srf because of the release of sludge extracellular polymeric substances and the deflocculation of sludge flocs lu et al 2017 obviously these four conditioning approaches were effective to improve sludge filterability and or the dryness of dewatered sludge cake both of which are crucial for enhancing sludge dewaterability lu et al 2018 after sludge conditioning treatments 50 ml of each conditioned sludge sample was frozen at 20 c and subsequently dried with a vacuum freeze dryer scientz n10 ningbo scientz biotechnology co ltd china meanwhile the damage of sludge microbial cells in the conditioned sludge samples sludge samples after conditioning was assessed using flow cytometry and the counts of intact cells and damaged cells were determined total genomic dna was extracted from 0 1 g freeze dried sludge sample using a powersoil dna isolation kit mobio usa the total genomic dna was eluted with 50 μl of provided elution buffer 10 mm tris without edta ph 8 and stored at 20 c the dna concentration and purity were measured by using a nanodrop 2000 thermo scientific usa and the related information can be found in table s2 2 3 extraction of extracellular dna from conditioned sludge samples for the raw sludge sludge bioleached for 36 h sludge aerobically incubated for 36 h sludge chemically acidified to ph 2 42 and sludge chemically conditioned with pam 4 60 mg g ds or fe iii cao 0 350 g cao g ds and 0 034 g fe iii g ds the extracellular dna was extracted from sludge samples for the determination of the absolute abundances of extracellular args in sludge firstly a volume of 200 ml sludge samples were passed through filter papers whatman no 1 and then the obtained sludge filtrates were filtrated through 0 22 μm membranes to remove residual cells the final filtrates were used to collect extracellular dna with a precipitation method eichmiller et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 in details 242 ml of absolute ethanol and 11 ml of 3 m sodium acetate were added to 110 ml filtrate samples respectively and then the mixed solutions were stored at 20 c for overnight after that the mixed solutions were centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min to obtain the precipitates and precipitates was freeze dried and then used to extract extracellular dna with powersoil dna isolation kit mobio usa the measurement of extracellular dna concentration and purity followed the method mentioned above and the related information can be found in table s3 2 4 real time quantitative pcr qpcr for determining args and inti1 in this study inti1 and 46 arg subtypes were investigated in detail using the viia 7 real time pcr system applied biosystems inc usa with a high throughput quantitative reaction platform wcgene biotech shanghai china garner et al 2018 when quantifying 254 args in raw sludge and conditioned sludge samples by using high throughput quantitative real time pcr ht qpcr fig s1 su et al 2015 we found that these 46 target genes covered almost all detected args in raw sludge and conditioned sludge samples because the ht qpcr method is only semi quantitative the qpcr approach was utilized in the present study to precisely quantify the absolute abundances of 46 target genes and inti1 in sludge samples a total of a pair of bacterial universal 16s rrna gene primers inti1 primers and 46 validated arg primers table s4 were applied which included aminoglycoside beta lactamase fca sulfonamide macrolide lincosamide streptogramin b mlsb vancomycin and tetracycline resistance genes su et al 2015 zhu et al 2013 the plasmids containing these specific genes were manufactured by sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china which were used as standards in a 10 fold dilution to make qpcr standard curves pcr reaction mixtures 10 μl for each well consisted of 5 μl faststart universal sybr green master with rox roche applied sciences indianapolis in 3 μl nuclease free pcr grade water 1 μl each primer and 1 μl of standard plasmid or dna samples the reaction procedure of quantitative pcr mainly included the initial enzyme activation at 95 c for 10 min and 40 cycles of the following program used for amplification including denaturation at 95 c for 30 s and annealing at 60 c for 30s wang et al 2014 an automatic heating and melting curve was comprised in the program and each melting curve was checked the amplification efficiencies of different pcr reactions ranged from 90 to 110 and r2 values were higher than 0 99 for all standard curves table s5 each reaction was run in triplicate along with standard curves and the pcr reaction mixtures without dna samples were used as negative control the detection limits of specific target genes are shown in table s5 the absolute and relative abundances of target genes are presented as

according to previous studies kuang et al 2013 xiong et al 2012 zhou et al 2011 and the details are described in supplementary material 2 6 measurement of the intact cells the membrane damaged cells and the damaged cells in conditioned sludge samples by flow cytometry conditioned sludge samples were fluorescently stained with an annexin v fitc apoptosis detection kit sigma aldrich usa and measured by a bd biosciences accuric6 flow cytometer becton dickinson immunocytometry systems san jose calif to reflect the damage of sludge bacterial cells induced by sludge conditioning treatments guo et al 2014 ziglio et al 2002 the detailed staining and detection procedures could be found in our recent publication zhou et al 2018 briefly approximate 1 ml of conditioned sludge sample was diluted using sterile water to reduce its solid content to around 0 005 in order to avoid the negative effects of inert particles on the related staining and measuring process subsequently 0 5 ml of diluted sludge sample was respectively stained by propidium iodide pi and fitc annexin v according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer sigma aldrich usa and then the stained sludge sample was measured by a bd biosciences accuric6 flow cytometer the annexin v fitc apoptosis detection kit contains membrane impermeable nucleic acid dye propidium iodide pi and fitc annexin v which has high affinity for the phospholipid phosphatidylserine ps in the inner layer of cell membrane fitc annexin v staining can identify the membrane damaged cell via binding with ps that is exposed to the external cellular environment meanwhile pi can identify the damaged cell because only the cellular membranes of dead and damaged cells are permeable to pi czekalski et al 2016 di cesare et al 2016 thus sludge microbial cells can be distinguished from fitc annexin v and pi negative the intact cells fitc annexin v positive and pi negative the membrane damaged cells and fitc annexin v negative positive and pi positive the damaged cells for each sludge sample data were collected from 10 000 cells and calculations of the proportion of different cells were carried out with the flowjo v10

cluster html in qiime software network analysis based on the spearman correlation analysis between args and bacterial taxa was conducted using the gephi platform ju et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 a significance cutoff of α 0 05 was used for all analyses 3 results 3 1 effects of sludge conditioning treatments on the absolute abundances of args and inti1 in the raw sludge the absolute abundances of the detected 46 args and inti1 were approximately 1 05 1010 and 2 95 109 gene copies per gram dry sludge fig 1 respectively among these arg subtypes the top 15 most abundant args included one sulfonamide sul2 ten aminoglycoside aada5 01 aada1 strb aada2 03 aada2 02 aada2 01 aada 02 aada 01 aac 6 ii and aac 6 ib 03 one mlsb mexf one chloramphenicol catb3 one beta lactamase blaveb and one tetracycline tetg 01 accounting for 85 9 of the absolute abundance of the total args the absolute abundance of the total args in the aerobically incubated sludge 12 h 24 h or 36 h and sludge conditioned with pam 2 30 or 4 60 mg pam g ds was not significantly different to that of the raw sludge p 0 071 the absolute abundance of the total args in the sludge conditioned with bioleaching or chemical acidification conditioning were significantly reduced with an extension of bioleaching period from 12 h to 36 h p 0 05 or with a decline of sludge ph from 3 90 to 2 42 by chemical acidification p 0 05 however no significant difference in the absolute abundance of the total args was found between the sludge conditioned with two different dosages of fe iii cao p 0 162 overall bioleaching for 36 h chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao and chemical acidification to sludge ph 2 42 all led to significant reduction p 0 05 in the absolute abundance of total args and inti1 in sludge by 2 16 2 38 and 3 27 3 79 log units respectively these approaches were much more effective than the other conditioning treatments and distinctly altered the overall pattern of args profile in sludge anosim r 0 9598 p 0 0002 in particular only 16 15 and 13 arg subtypes were detected in sludge being bioleached for 36 h and sludge chemically conditioned with two dosages of fe iii cao fig 1b most arg subtypes in the raw sludge however could still be detected after the raw sludge was chemically acidified to ph 2 42 the absolute abundances of residual args except for vanc 03 tet 34 and tetm 01 were reduced by 1 63 4 96 log units for bioleaching for 36 h 1 71 4 13 log units for chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao and 1 58 3 83 log units for chemical acidification to sludge ph 2 42 respectively fig 1b and table s6 3 2 effects of sludge conditioning treatments on the damage of sludge microbial cells and the reduction of total bacterial biomass the intact cell and damaged cell counts were 87 5 and 11 3 respectively in the raw sludge as shown in fig 2 a the chemical conditioning with two dosages of pam and aerobic incubation with duration of 12 36 h did not significantly change either the intact cell count p 0 350 or the damaged cell count in sludge p 0 141 however the bioleaching conditioning chemical conditioning with fe iii cao and chemical acidification all significantly decreased the intact cell count to 48 8 66 3 p 0 05 and correspondingly increased the damaged cell count to 26 6 48 6 p 0 05 the bioleaching conditioning chemical conditioning with fe iii cao and chemical acidification significantly reduced 16s rrna gene copies a proxy for total bacterial cells in sludge by 2 73 3 79 log units p 0 05 while chemical conditioning with pam and aerobic incubation did not significantly change the 16s rrna gene copies in sludge p 0 146 fig 2b the 16s rrna gene copies positively correlated with the intact cell counts in conditioned sludge samples spearman ρ 0 770 p 0 01 and negatively correlated with the damaged cell counts in conditioned sludge samples ρ 0 783 p 0 01 significant positive relationships were recorded between the 16s rrna gene copies and the absolute abundance of inti1 ρ 0 938 p 0 01 or most args except for vanc 03 and tet 34 ρ 0 752 0 996 p 0 01 table s7 in detail the absolute abundance of inti1 was reduced by 1 01 log unit with a reduction of one log 16s rrna gene copy in sludge the absolute abundances of aminoglycoside beta lactamase sulfonamide fca and mlsb resistance genes were reduced by 0 79 0 90 log unit with a reduction of one log 16s rrna gene copy in sludge the absolute abundances of tetracycline and vancomycin resistance genes however were reduced by only 0 36 0 49 log unit with a reduction of one log 16s rrna gene copy in sludge fig 3 3 3 effects of sludge conditioning treatments on the relative abundances of args and inti1 the distances and variations between raw and conditioned sludge samples were visualized by principal components analysis pca based on the relative abundances normalizing to 16s rrna genes of arg subtypes fig s2 the raw sludge aerobically incubated sludge 12 h 24 h or 36 h and sludge conditioned with 2 30 or 4 60 mg pam g ds clustered apart from the other conditioned sludge samples the relative abundances of most args however were greatly increased by chemical acidification and bioleaching conditioning for 12 or 24 h fig 4 both the bioleaching conditioning for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao led to the relative abundance reduction of mlsb resistance genes by 61 4 75 4 and beta lactamase resistance genes by approximately 100 respectively for the aminoglycoside resistance genes the bioleaching conditioning for 36 h reduced their relative abundances by 80 6 but chemical conditioning with the two dosages of fe iii cao only decreased their relative abundances by 8 35 15 4 due to the low removal of aada5 01 although either bioleaching for 36 h or chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao reduced the relative abundances of most fca vancomycin and tetracycline resistance genes in the conditioned sludge the relative abundances of flor vanc 03 tetm 01 and tet 34 were drastically increased in addition the bioleaching for 36 h resulted in a reduction of inti1 relative abundance from 0 0155 gene copy per 16s rrna gene in raw sludge to as low as 0 0051 gene copy per 16s rrna gene which was not attained by other conditioning treatments fig 4c 3 4 impacts of sludge conditionings on the sludge bacterial community and its correlation with the relative abundance profiles of args according to the results of pca and upgma clustering analysis based on the bacterial relative abundances in sludge samples fig s3 and s4 the raw sludge aerobically incubated sludge 12 h 24 h or 36 h and sludge conditioned with 2 30 or 4 60 mg pam g ds clustered apart from the other conditioned sludge samples in addition the bioleaching for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao decreased the richness of the sludge bacterial community chao1 and otus in the raw sludge more than other conditioning treatments and the bioleaching for 36 h resulted in the lowest diversity of the sludge bacterial community shannon and simpson table s8 procrustes analysis was used to link the arg profiles the relative abundances of args with the bacterial community composition bacterial 16s rrna gene otus data and a significant correlation sum of squares m2 0 5777 ρ 0 660 p 0 001 was found by considering all of the conditioned sludge samples fig 5 a the co occurrence between arg subtypes and microbial taxa was revealed by a network analysis to illustrate the detailed relationships between specific arg subtypes and microbial taxa fig 5b it can be found that 66 bacterial taxa at genus level table s9 significantly correlated with the detected 46 arg subtypes in sludge spearman ρ 0 70 p 0 01 the relative abundances of 66 arg associated bacteria in raw and conditioned sludge samples were further compared fig 6 the results of cluster analysis reflected that the chemical conditioning with pam and the aerobic incubation exerted marginal impacts on the community composition of arg associated bacteria in sludge while the bioleaching chemical acidification and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao induced more notable changes in the community composition of arg associated bacteria in sludge it is worthy to note that bioleaching for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao selected for distinct communities of the arg associated bacteria in sludge anosim r 0 8848 p 0 0033 the total relative abundance of arg associated bacteria was reduced from 25 5 in raw sludge to 10 3 13 6 by the bioleaching for 36 h or chemical conditioning with two dosage of fe iii cao however the bioleaching for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosage of fe iii cao increased the relative abundance of clostridium genus from 0 34 to 0 45 0 60 and also increased the relative abundances of microbacterium and prevotella genus by 2 85 15 0 and 19 2 66 5 folds respectively in addition the relative abundances of the genus corynebacterium and staphylococcus were increased by the chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao 3 5 impacts of sludge conditioning treatments on the extracellular args in conditioned sludge abundant extracellular args were detected in the raw sludge which included 11 aminoglycoside 1 53 106 4 38 107 gene copies per liter sample 12 tetracycline 4 99 105 1 43 107 gene copies per liter sample 8 mlsb 2 93 103 1 05 107 gene copies per liter sample 4 beta lactamase 8 78 105 2 17 107 gene copies per liter sample 3 vancomycin 8 51 104 3 94 105 gene copies per liter sample 3 fca 1 51 105 1 21 107 gene copies per liter sample and 1 sulfonamide 1 00 108 gene copies per liter sample resistance genes fig 7 compared to the intracellular args in each sludge sample fig s5 the extracellular part only accounted for less than 0 122 of the total args in the sludge the chemical conditioning with 4 60 mg pam g ds had no noticeable impact on either the diversity of extracellular arg subtypes or the absolute abundances of individual extracellular arg subtypes however both the diversity of extracellular arg subtypes and the absolute abundances of most extracellular args in raw sludge were reduced by the bioleaching for 36 h aerobic incubation for 36 h chemical conditioning with fe iii cao 0 350 g cao g ds and 0 034 g fe iii g ds and chemical acidification to sludge ph 2 42 only 3 extracellular args i e aada2 03 sul2 and tet 34 and 4 extracellular args i e aada2 03 aada5 01 sul2 and tet 34 remained in the bioleached sludge and sludge chemically conditioned with fe iii cao respectively these two conditioning approaches were also superior over the other approaches to remove the intracellular args in sludge fig s5 4 discussion 4 1 sludge conditioning treatments reduced the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 in sludge via severely damaging the sludge microbial cells previous studies reported that args in sludge cannot be effectively attenuated during the conventional composting of sewage sludge su et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 we found in the present study that the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 can be effectively reduced by chemical acidification bioleaching or chemical conditioning with fe iii cao but not by chemical conditioning with pam or aerobic incubation i e aerobic digestion of sludge during the bioleaching or chemical acidification of sewage sludge most args and inti1 were gradually attenuated with the decline in sludge ph to around 2 42 when the raw sludge was bioleached for 36 h chemically conditioned with two dosages of fe iii cao or chemically acidified to ph 2 42 the absolute abundances of the total args and inti1 in sludge were reduced by 2 16 2 38 and 3 27 3 79 log units respectively it was reported in previous studies that the alkaline fermentation of sewage sludge in anaerobic reactors only reduced the absolute abundances of sulfonamides and tetracycline resistance genes by 0 42 1 36 log units huang et al 2017 the hyperthermophilic composting of sewage sludge reduced the absolute abundances of total args and mges by 1 04 and 0 92 log units respectively liao et al 2018 and the absolute abundance of total args were even increased during the conventional composting of sewage sludge su et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 obviously the sludge conditioning processes can be more effective than composting aerobic digestion or anaerobic digestion to reduce the absolute abundances of args and inti1 in sewage sludge which may be a very important step in wwtps to control antibiotic resistance therefore the chemical acidification bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao cannot only improve the sludge filterability and or the dryness of dewatered sludge cake but are also useful to reduce the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 in sewage sludge the chemical conditioning with pam and aerobic incubation did not damage sludge microbial cells but the other three conditioning approaches induced the drastic damage of sludge microbial cells flow cytometry data in fact several recent studies highlighted the importance of the destruction of bacterial cell structures in removing args from wastewater czekalski et al 2016 di cesare et al 2016 hu et al 2016 for instance it was reported by czekalski et al 2016 that the membrane integrity and dna stability of escherichia coli cells in wastewater can be destroyed by ozone at high doses to degrade plasmid encoded sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 in escherichia coli in the present study the correlation between 16s rrna gene copies and the damaged cell count negative in sludge suggests that the chemical acidification bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao severely damaged sludge microbial cells to reduce the total bacterial biomass in the conditioned sludge the positive relationships between the 16s rrna gene copies and the absolute abundances of inti1 and most args table s7 suggest that the cells of most hosts carrying args and inti1 were damaged along with the reduction of the total bacterial biomass in sludge consequently removing most args and inti1 from sewage sludge thus the main underlying mechanism for arg removal by sludge conditioning treatments is likely that the sludge microbial cells were severely damaged by sludge conditioning to decrease the total bacterial biomass in sludge and accordingly the bacterial hosts carrying args and inti were effectively damaged to attenuate most args and inti1 in sludge although bioleaching for 36 h chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao and chemical acidification to sludge ph 2 42 resulted in similar reduction extents of total args and 16s rrna gene copies in sludge the residual arg profiles in the conditioned sludge were totally different most arg subtypes that were initially detected in the raw sludge including 10 12 of the top 15 most abundant args were below their respective detection limits after the bioleaching for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao which was not attained by chemical acidification to sludge ph 2 42 on the other hand individual arg subtypes responded differently to the sludge conditioning treatments which was also found in the thermophilic anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge tian et al 2016 for instance the removal of aminoglycoside beta lactamase sulfonamide fca and mlsb resistance genes with a reduction of one log 16s rrna gene copy in sludge was much higher than that of tetracycline and vancomycin resistance genes fig 3 among tetracycline and vancomycin resistance genes tetm 01 was only slightly attenuated by bioleaching for 36 h chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao and chemical acidification to sludge ph 2 42 but vanc 03 and tet 34 were even enriched by these three conditioning treatments suggesting that their hosts may be very resistant to these conditioning treatments 4 2 the sludge bacterial community determined the relative abundances of residual args in conditioned sludge since the chemical conditioning with pam and aerobic incubation changed neither the absolute abundances of args and inti1 nor the 16s rrna gene copies in sludge they marginally impacted the relative abundances of args and inti1 in sludge fig s2 and fig 4 the increases of the relative abundances of most args and inti1 induced by chemical acidification and bioleaching conditioning for 12 or 24 h resulted from the fact that the reduction extent of total bacterial biomass 16s rrna gene copies was much higher than that of args or inti1 absolute abundance in sludge only the bioleaching conditioning for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao reduced the relative abundances of most args however they led to the increases in the relative abundances of vanc 03 tetm 01 and tet 34 because of the very slight removal of tetm 01 and no removal of vanc 03 and tet 34 in conditioned sludge thus bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao were effective to reduce the relative abundances of most args in sludge which was not attained by chemical acidification conditioning the aerobic incubation and chemical conditioning with pam almost had no apparent effect on the bacterial community composition in raw sludge but chemical acidification bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao remarkably changed the sludge bacterial community composition based on the result of procrustes analysis it can be found that arg profiles relative abundance were significantly correlated with the bacterial community composition bacterial 16s rrna gene otus data in conditioned sludge indeed previous studies have revealed that the changes in the microbial community composition contributed to the profiles of args during sludge composting or anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge luo et al 2017 su et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 in addition it is worthy to note that the genus of acidithiobacillus did not significantly correlate with any arg subtype implying that the a ferrooxidans lx5 which was inoculated into the sludge for the bioleaching conditioning was unlikely a potential host of the detected args although both the bioleaching for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao reduced the relative abundances of most args in sludge they led to distinct communities of the arg associated bacteria in sludge these two conditioning treatments effectively killed the potential hosts carrying most aminoglycoside mlsb and beta lactamase resistance genes fig 6 which included the genus of dechloromonas azovibrio blvii28 crenothrix sulfuritalea thauera epulopiscium coprococcus candidatus accumulibacter crocinitomix nostocoida epulopiscium coprococcus and thermacetogenium probably because they are sensitive to the change of sludge ph as a consequence the relative abundances of most aminoglycoside mlsb and beta lactamase resistance genes in sludge were effectively reduced by both the bioleaching for 36 h and chemical conditioning with two dosages of fe iii cao given that the genus of clostridium microbacterium and prevotella mainly are the potential hosts of flor vanc 03 tet 34 and tetm 01 bioleaching for 36 h and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao did not reduce but rather increased their relative abundances and so as the relative abundances of these four arg subtypes the genus of microbacterium corynebacterium and staphylococcus are potential hosts of aada5 01 and thus the chemical conditioning with fe iii cao increased their relative abundances to accordingly increase the relative abundance of aada5 01 in conditioned sludge therefore although sludge conditioning treatments reduced the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 in sludge via damaging the sludge microbial cells the sludge bacterial community determined the relative abundances of residual args in the conditioned sludge 4 3 bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao removed a majority of extracellular args recent study revealed that the extracellular args are persistent in the wastewater and their removal was much lower than that of intracellular args in wastewater treatment processes zhang et al 2017 indeed liu et al 2018 reported that the chlorine disinfection of wastewater even increased the abundances of extracellular args thereby posing risk of the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in the environment we found in the present study that the chemical conditioning with pam could not remove the extracellular args in raw sludge but the bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao removed a majority of extracellular args in raw sludge this result suggests that although bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao led to drastic damage of sludge microbial cells the released extracellular args were not accumulated in conditioned sludge but most likely were degraded thus potentially limiting their release into the environment however the extracellular args including aada2 03 aada5 01 sul2 and tet 34 were not removed by bioleaching or chemical conditioning with fe iii cao exhibiting their persistence in conditioned sludge it should be noted that the abundances of args and inti1 in dewatered sludge cake and sludge filtrate after mechanical dewatering processes were not fully characterized in the present study because of the varied solid liquid separation efficiencies of different mechanical dewatering approaches such as belt filters filter press and decanter centrifuges christensen et al 2015 however since most intracellular and extracellular args can be effectively removed during the bioleaching conditioning or chemical conditioning with fe iii cao it is reasonable to presume that these two conditioning methods would result in low abundances of most args in dewatered sludge cake achieved by mechanical dewatering although conditioning parameters influenced the removal of args and inti1 in conditioned sludge their successful removal can be attained once the severe damage of sludge microbial cells is achieved by sludge conditioning treatments meanwhile the findings obtained from the present study would suit for other sewage sludge samples because the damage of sludge microbial cells as the main mechanism for arg removal induced by sludge conditioning usually exists during the conditioning of different sewage sludge samples he et al 2017 lu et al 2017 2018 the findings of the present study imply that it is feasible in practice to remove args in sludge by selecting appropriate sludge conditioning approaches such as bioleaching conditioning or chemical conditioning with fe iii cao in such a way the abundances of args in landfill leachates may be reduced when the dewatered sludge cakes are landfilled wu et el 2017 besides the removal of args during sludge conditioning treatments may result in low abundances of args in sewage sludge compost products consequently reducing the dissemination of args in the soil environment thus further work is still needed to study the environmental risks of the residual args with high relative abundances in conditioned sludge and whether the removal of args and inti1 during bioleaching conditioning and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao would reduce the dissemination of args to the environment especially in the landfilling of dewatered sludge cake or land application of sewage sludge compost products 5 conclusions the present study evaluated for the first time the effect of sludge conditioning on the removal of args and inti1 from sewage sludge the chemical conditioning with pam and aerobic incubation treatment did not remove args and inti1 from sewage sludge the chemical acidification reduced the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 but increased their relative abundances however the chemical conditioning with fe iii cao and bioleaching conditioning which are a conventional sludge conditioning approach and an innovative conditioning technique reduced the absolute and relative abundances of most args and removed a majority of extracellular args in sludge during sludge conditioning treatments the sludge microbial cells were severely damaged to decrease the total bacterial biomass in sludge and accordingly the bacterial hosts carrying args and inti were effectively damaged to reduce the absolute abundances of most args and inti1 besides the sludge bacterial community in conditioned sludge determined the relative abundances of residual args therefore sludge conditioning can be an important sludge treatment process of wwtps in attenuating antibiotic resistance and bioleaching and chemical conditioning with fe iii cao can be employed as effective conditioning ways to reduce args in sewage sludge acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the financial support from

exposure of the gac to monochloramine and ranged from 0 5 to 21 3 depending on the type of gac used correlation analyses were conducted to identify carbon properties that can determine the n2 yield for monochloramine conversion such as the amount of oxygen groups the elemental composition and the trace metal content it was found that the n2 yield significantly correlates with the copper content of the tested carbons model calculations combining pool hydraulics with formation abatement of inorganic chloramines and ndma as well as chloramine transformations in gac filters showed that the concentration of inorganic chloramines and carcinogenic ndma can be decreased by a factor of 2 if the tested gacs could be modified to convert up to 50 of the monochloramine to n2 graphical abstract

commercial gacs they had investigated they concluded that the chemical characteristics of the individual gacs are irrelevant with respect to the n2 yield however the observed n2 yields ranged from 23 to 40 and only the low accuracy of the detection method prevented them from being able to significantly distinguish between the n2 yields of the gacs investigated fairey et al 2007 previous findings indicated that the rate of n2 production correlates with the amount of oxide groups present at the gac surface see equation 2 in this context it is not known whether additional surface oxides are formed by the reaction of gacs with free chlorine equation 3 snoeyink et al 1974 suidan et al 1977a 1977b 1977c that is typically present besides chloramines in pool water and that affects monochloramine conversion to n2 3 c hocl h2o c o h3o cl results from previous studies suggest that trace element constituents may favour monochloramine conversion to n2 various carbonaceous raw materials have been used to prepare activated carbons with different concentrations of heteroatoms and trace element compositions tsai and chang 1994 sun and webley 2010 sevilla et al 2011 wang et al 2014 among these iron lead and copper were found to catalyse the process of monochloramine decay vikesland and valentine 2002 zhang et al 2002 edwards and dudi 2004 switzer et al 2006 fu et al 2009 copper attracted particular interest because it favours disproportionation of monochloramine to form dichloramine fu et al 2009 that in turn reacts with activated carbon to form n2 according to equation 4 bauer and snoeyink 1973 scaramelli and digiano 1977 4 2 nhcl2 5 h2o c n2 4 h3o 4 cl c o consequently the primary objectives of this study were to understand the impact of chemical gac properties such as the concentration of oxygen surface groups elemental composition and traces of noble and transition metals on the yield of n2 from the reduction of monochloramine at four different gacs available commercially to ensure sufficient accuracy and practical relevance as well long term fixed bed experiments were carried out to determine reaction rate constants and yields under conditions that are typical for swimming pool water to test the correlation of chemical carbon properties on rates and yields acidic oxygen functionalities of the used gacs namely phenols lactonic groups and carboxyl groups the content of noble and transition metals such as pd rh mn co cu fe and ni and the elemental composition of the carbons with respect to c n h and s were to be analysed finally in order to understand if and to what extent gac treatment with gacs that comprise a high n2 yield could mitigate the concentration of chloramines and ndma in swimming pool systems model calculations combining pool hydraulics with the formation and abatement of inorganic chloramines and ndma as well as chloramine transformations in gac filters were to be done 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental determination of the carbon reactivity nh4 yield and n2 yield many previous studies showed that the reduction of monochloramine in a fixed gac bed can be described in sufficient detail using first order reaction kinetics skibinski et al 2018 kim 1977 scaramelli and digiano 1977 kim and snoeyink 1980 thus for a gac bed fed with a monochloramine solution with the inflow concentration cbed in and the outflow concentration cbed out the empty bed contact time tebct is given by vbed qbed where vbed and qbed are the bed volume and the volumetric flow rate and the apparent first order reaction rate constant kapp is obtained according to 5 k app 1 t ebct ln c bed in c bed out the procedure for determining kapp in fixed bed column experiments under fully controlled conditions has been described previously by the authors skibinski et al 2018 in brief a laboratory scale fixed bed column with known bed volume vbed and diameter dbed was continuously fed at a constant flow rate qbed with a monochloramine solution that was prepared from deionised water from a rapidly stirred double walled glass tank with feedback controlled ph and temperature the effluent of the fixed bed column was fed back into the glass tank monochloramine and free chlorine concentrations in the tank of the fixed bed reactor fbr system were continuously measured using a membrane covered amperometric 2 electrode total chlorine sensor cte 1 dmt prominent germany that was calibrated daily using the photometric dpd method din en iso 7393 2 2000 the concentration of monochloramine in the tank cbed in was kept constant during each experiment by feedback controlled dosing qst of a highly concentrated monochloramine stock solution of 1 5 g l 1 as cl2 cst the outflow concentration of monochloramine cbed out from the laboratory scale fixed bed column was indirectly calculated as described elsewhere skibinski et al 2018 identical repeated validation experiments conducted with the same system showed previously that the repeatability standard deviation of kapp a measure that describes the precision of the experimental test method was 0 006 s 1 skibinski et al 2018 fixed bed column experiments were conducted under conditions that are typical for swimming pool water treatment experiments were run over several hours until stationary conditions of gac reactivity were reached scaramelli and digiano 1977 table 1 summarizes the operation conditions of the laboratory scale fixed bed column experiments as given by equations 1 and 2 oxidation of gacs by monochloramine leads to the formation of oxygen surface groups which in turn determine the yields of n2 and ammonia of the monochloramine gac reaction the rather short contact time in the column 2 88 s was chosen to assure a homogeneous and thus representative oxidations state of the gac bed across the columns bed depth further previous studies showed that the time needed until kapp reached stationary conditions was very low for the small bed volume used in this study 32 ml skibinski et al 2018 according to equation 1 and equation 2 monochloramine is converted in the filter column forming nh4 and n2 the percentage of both reactions related to the overall monochloramine conversion was determined by analysing the specific cumulative amount of ammonium formed per g of gac nnh4 t since the beginning of an experiment until time t per specific cumulative amount of monochloramine converted per g of gac in the filter column nmca t until time t the average nh4 yield ynh4 t at time t since the beginning of an experiment equation 6 was then calculated from the slope of the linear regression between nnh4 t and nmca t 6 y nh 4 t n nh 4 t n mca t nmca t was obtained as the integral of qst by cst and by the differential reaction time dt since ammonium was accumulating in the tank during an experiment nnh4 t was obtained as the product of the concentration of ammonium in the tank after a certain reaction time t and the total volume of water present in the laboratory scale plant the photometric dpd method din en iso 7393 2 2000 was used to confirm the absence of free chlorine in the monochloramine solution in the tank of the fbr system over the run time of the experiments this was of particular importance because depletion of nh4 formed in the filter column by chlorination reactions could be neglected the n2 yield yn2 t was determined indirectly as given in equation 7 assuming that nh4 and n2 were the only nitrogenous reaction products present in the tank bauer and snoeyink 1973 fairey et al 2007 7 y n 2 t 1 y nh 4 2 2 preparation of the monochloramine and hocl stock solution all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water millipore direct q uv3 water purification system merck millipore germany monochloramine stock solutions used in the fixed bed column experiments were prepared as described in detail previously skibinski et al 2018 by slowly adding a hocl solution 0 032 mol l 1 to an ammonia stock solution 0 098 mol l 1 to reach a final molar ratio of chlorine to ammonia of 1 00 1 03 at ph 10 under stirring aoki 1989 monochloramine and hocl stock solutions were stored protected from light at 4 c before use 2 3 granular activated carbons four commercially available gacs hydraffin 30n from donau carbon gmbh 30n centaur from chemviron carbon gmbh centaur silcarbon k 835 from silcarbon aktivkohle gmbh k835 and saratec 100058 from bluecher gmbh 100058 were used in this study the raw materials were anthracite coal 30n coconut shells k835 bituminous coal centaur and non porous polymer based spheres 100058 according to the specifications provided by the manufacturers the gacs had been produced by initial carbonisation of the different raw materials at low temperatures followed by physical activation with steam 30n 100058 fichtner 2010 branton et al 2011 böhringer et al 2011 steam and carbon dioxide k835 raave et al 2014 or impregnation with urea and subsequent heating centaur matviya and hayden 1994 hayden 1995 the mean grain diameters of the used carbons d60 were as follows 1 57 mm k835 1 51 mm 30n 1 27 mm centaur and 0 51 mm 100058 the respective grain size distributions are given elsewhere skibinski et al 2018 before use the fresh gacs were treated by i soaking in ultrapure water ii evacuating the soaked suspension of gac and iii washing and decantation as described previously by skibinski et al 2018 2 4 altered granular activated carbons as the reaction to n2 according to equation 2 requires the presence of surface oxides it is to be expected that an increased concentration of surface oxides on the activated carbon will increase the reaction rate according to equation 2 and the n2 yield therefore in order to determine the impact of surface oxide concentration on the n2 yield of the monochloramine gac reaction fixed bed column experiments were performed with gacs that had been pre treated with hocl according to equation 3 the laboratory scale fixed bed column was operated as described in section 2 1 but instead of using a solution of monochloramine a highly concentrated hocl stock solution 4 5 mg l 1 as cl2 was added to the glass tank experiments with hocl were run until 2 2 mmol ggac 1 of hocl as cl2 reacted in the laboratory scale gac filter the gacs remained in the filter column after hocl treatment thereafter the fixed bed column was operated with a solution of monochloramine to determine the n2 yield of the monochloramine gac reaction 2 5 analytical quantification of monochloramine free chlorine and ammonium the concentration of the monochloramine stock solutions was determined spectrophotometrically on a daily basis taking into account the overlapping absorbance peaks of monochloramine and dichloramine nhcl2 at 245 nm and 295 nm εnh2cl 245 nm 445 l mol 1 cm 1 εnhcl2 245 nm 208 l mol 1 cm 1 εnh2cl 295 nm 14 l mol 1 cm 1 εnhcl2 295 nm 267 l mol 1 cm 1 schreiber and mitch 2005 results not shown spectrophotometric measurements at 360 nm confirmed the absence of trichloramine ncl3 in the monochloramine stock solution εncl3 360 nm 126 l mol 1 cm 1 valentine et al 1986 schurter et al 1995 the hocl stock solutions were standardised spectrophotometrically at ph 10 as the ocl ion using a molar absorption coefficient at 294 nm εocl 294nm of 348 l mol 1 cm 1 hand and margerum 1983 a unicam uv2 200 uv vis spectrophotometer was used for the absorbance measurements for quantification of ammonium nh4 samples were taken from the tank and analysed by size exclusion chromatography with organic carbon and organic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond as described elsewhere huber et al 2011a it should be noted that although the lc ocd ond was designed for organic nitrogen detection it is also capable of quantifying inorganic nitrogen compounds such as ammonium huber et al 2011b samples were stored in headspace free vials with screw caps 25 ml at 4 c until analysis with lc ocd ond that followed within 12 h after sampling the limit of detection for ammonium is assumed to be equal to that of urea 1 ppb previously determined by using the lc ocd ond method huber et al 2011b finally lc ocd ond analysis confirmed that no other nitrogen containing substances were present in the water samples taken from the tank 2 6 chemical characterisation of the granular activated carbons 2 6 1 boehm titration boehm titration boehm 1966 recently standardised goertzen et al 2010 oickle et al 2010 was used to quantify the oxygen groups present on the gac surface this method allows distinguishing oxygen groups by their different acidity in particular phenols lactonic groups and carboxyl groups for analysis the fresh and altered gacs were dried over a period of 24 h at 70 c to avoid volatile surface oxides being removed by drying snoeyink et al 1974 then 1 5 g of the carbon was suspended in 50 ml solutions of either 0 05 mol l 1 nahco3 na2co3 or naoh after shaking the suspensions at 150 rpm for 24 h the samples were filtered using 0 45 μm polycarbonate track etch membrane filters sartorius ag germany aliquots 10 ml each of the filtered nahco3 and naoh solutions were each acidified with 20 ml 0 05 mol l 1 hcl and a 10 ml aliquot of the filtered naco3 sample was acidified with 30 ml 0 05 mol l 1 hcl co2 was stripped from the acidified samples by continuously sparkling with n2 for 2 h finally 0 05 mol l 1 naoh was added drop wise to the acidified samples under simultaneous sparkling with n2 until ph 7 was reached the volume of 0 05 mol l 1 naoh needed to reach ph 7 was denoted as vnaoh and was determined in triplicate for each batch experiment the amount of carbon surface functionalities in terms of phenols lactonic groups and carboxyl groups were calculated based on vnaoh as described elsewhere goertzen et al 2010 oickle et al 2010 2 6 2 zeta potential to further elucidate the acidic character of the gacs the zeta ζ potential of the fresh gacs was measured from their electrophoretic mobility sze et al 2003 using a zetasizer nano zs equipped with an mpt 2 autotitrator malvern instruments worcestershire uk for zeta analysis the gacs were ground to powdered carbon using a ball mill pm100 retsch germany a suspension of the powdered carbon was prepared in 0 01 mol l 1 kcl solution after a settling time of 24 h the supernatant of the suspension was used for analysis zeta potentials were analysed at different ph as described by strelko et al 2002 adjustment of the ph was performed by dosing solutions with either 0 1 mol l 1 hcl or 0 1 mol l 1 naoh zeta potentials are given as the average of three replicates the isoelectric point of the gacs is taken to be the ph at which the surface exhibits a neutral net zeta potential 2 6 3 trace metal content the concentration of two groups of elements widely used as catalysts e g noble metals pd rh and transition metals mn co cu fe and ni goifman et al 2006 liu et al 2013 in the fresh gacs were analysed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission mass spectroscopy icp ms using a pqexcell instrument thermo fisher scientific inc usa according to the german standard din en iso 17294 2 2004 prior to icp ms analysis powdered samples of the dried fresh gacs were digested for 30 min in a closed ptfe vessel at 180 c by microwaves mars 5 cem corp united states for digestion 0 5 g of ground carbon was suspended in a mixture of 5 ml concentrated nitric acid hno3 1 ml h2o2 30 and 5 ml ultrapure water digested samples were filtered by a 0 45 μm polycarbonate track etch membrane filter sartorius ag germany and subsequently diluted with ultrapure water to 50 ml diluted samples were then analysed by icp ms concentrations of trace metals are reported as the mean value of two replicates the limits of detection for the method were calculated as the threefold standard deviation of blank samples blank samples were prepared according to the above described routine but without the carbon sample 2 6 4 elemental analysis analysis of the carbon hydrogen and nitrogen content of the gacs was performed using a chn element analyser vario el elementar analysesystem gmbh the sulphur content of the gacs was analysed according to the german standard din 51724 3 2012 using an eltra cs 580 analyser the following amounts of powdered gac samples were used 5 7 mg c n h and 100 150 mg s the c n h and s content of the gacs is given as the mean of two replicates the limits of detection were 0 007 g ggac 1 c 0 017 g ggac 1 n 0 003 g ggac 1 h and 0 05 g ggac 1 s 2 7 statistical analysis student s t tests were used to test for a difference in nh4 yields between the gacs investigated the null hypothesis that states that no differences were observed was rejected for a probability of 0 05 to determine if any of the chemical carbon properties could function as an indicator for the apparent n2 yield pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for the linear correlation between the trace element concentrations of the gacs and the n2 yield only linear correlations with a coefficient 0 9 have been further considered for descriptive analysis therefore an assessment of the graphical visualisation of the dependency of the n2 yield on the corresponding concentration of surface oxygen groups or trace elements was carried out due to the low number of tested carbons n 4 a determination of the significance of the linear correlations as well as a multivariate analysis on the synergetic effect of different chemical carbon properties on the n2 yield were not carried out if not mentioned otherwise errors are given as 95 confidence interval calculated from the standard deviation number of observations and the t distribution 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon reactivity and reaction products in fig 1 a d the specific amount of nh4 produced per g of gac as well as the apparent reaction rate constant kapp are plotted against the amount of monochloramine degraded when using filter beds of the 30n k835 centaur and 100058 carbons in agreement with previous findings kapp initially decreased until quasi stationary conditions were reached fairey et al 2007 which was after 0 75 1 25 mmol of monochloramine had reacted per g of gac equivalent to 75 125 h of filter run time the decrease in reactivity has previously been explained by an increase in diffusional resistance with on going reaction time skibinski et al 2018 in brief it is assumed that the monochloramine gac reaction that starts first at the outer surface of the gac grains and the reaction front then moves towards the centre of the grains with on going reaction time leaving behind reacted carbon sites the fact that kapp did not decrease until zero when stationary conditions were reached could be explained by oxygen groups that continuously evolve from the surface as co or co2 thus providing new free active sites snoeyink et al 1974 the reaction rate constants kapp at stationary conditions were found to be 0 015 s 1 100058 0 016 s 1 30n 0 018 s 1 k835 and 0 024 s 1 centaur the unusual course of kapp for the 100058 carbon has been discussed previously and was explained by a shift in the reaction controlling mechanism due to the inhomogeneous pore size distribution of the 100058 carbon skibinski et al 2018 the nh4 yields of the respective gacs were derived from the slope of the plot of the cumulative amount of nh4 produced versus the cumulative amount of monochloramine removed in the gac bed see fig 1 a d the linear correlation for all gacs indicates that the nh4 yield did not change during the course of the reaction the coefficient of determination r2 for linear fitting ranged from 0 993 to 0 999 indicating that the linear regression provides an adequate fit to the experimental data the nh4 yields for the gacs were found as follows 78 7 3 6 k835 88 4 2 30 100058 95 8 2 2 centaur 99 5 4 2 30n to assess the reliability of the measured nh4 yields experiments with the k835 carbon were repeated three times data not shown hypothesis testing p 0 05 showed no significant differences in the nh4 yield among the three repetitions indicating a satisfactory reproducibility for the centaur gac fairey et al 2007 reported a nh4 yield of 69 11 which is far lower than the 95 8 2 2 p 0 001 found in the present study as will be discussed below in section 3 4 this is most probably due to strong variations in the different batches of that gac the n2 yields calculated as described in section 2 1 were as follows 0 5 4 7 30n 4 2 3 0 centaur 11 6 3 1 100058 21 3 4 1 k835 slightly higher n2 yields of other gacs were reported in previous fixed bed column studies 42 scaramelli and digiano 1977 23 40 fairey et al 2007 and 27 3 kim 1977 contrary to the findings of fairey et al 2007 hypothesis testing p 0 05 in this study showed that the differences in n2 yields among the tested gacs were significant table a1 in the supporting material sm lists other processes that potentially could have an effect on the observed n2 yield of the monochloramine gac reaction but were determined to be negligible 3 2 formation of surface oxygen groups 3 2 1 characterisation of fresh gacs 3 2 1 1 acidic oxygen groups the amounts of acidic oxygen groups present on the surface of the gacs as determined by boehm titration are shown in table 2 values are given for the fresh and altered gacs as analysed at the end of the fbr experiments the fresh gacs contained total acidic oxidised functionalities in a concentration range from 1728 to 1926 μmol ggac 1 the majority of acidic oxygen groups were present as carboxylic groups whereas only small amounts of lactonic and phenolic groups were present this composition is typical for activated carbons cagnon et al 2005 kalijadis et al 2011 allwar 2012 3 2 1 2 ζ potential fig 2 shows the ζ potential of the fresh 100058 k835 30n and centaur gacs for the 100058 k835 and centaur gacs the ζ potential decreased steeply with increasing ph until it remained constant above a ph of 8 10 the net negative charge in this ph range can be explained by the dissociation of carboxylic groups which occurs between ph 2 to 6 for activated carbons strelko et al 2002 chingombe et al 2005 even though the fresh 30n carbon had the same level of carboxyl groups compared to the other fresh carbons see table 2 its change in zeta potential between ph 2 and 6 was comparatively low this could be explained by a more homogeneous distribution of carboxylic groups between internal and external particle surfaces for the 30n carbon memendez et al 1995 for the k835 100058 and centaur carbon a significant amount of carboxylic groups is assumed to be located at the external surface of the carbon grains thus having a more pronounced effect on the electrophoretic mobility i e zeta potential compared to the 30n carbon further the fresh 30n carbon has a higher isoelectric point phiep of 7 2 when compared to the other fresh gacs phiep 2 as all carbons comprised almost the same amount of total acidic groups this indicates that a significantly higher amount of groups with basic properties imparts the surface of the 30n carbon memendez et al 1995 due to the high amount of carboxylic functionalities suggested by the change in ζ potential with ph the main focus for further characterisation was on acidic functionalities rather than on basic groups that were not further quantified it should be noted here that the activated carbon grains had been ground prior to the determination of the zeta potential which may have altered their surface chemical properties 3 2 2 characterisation of altered gacs the amounts of total acidic surface groups formed over the course of the fbr experiments table 2 were as follows 240 μmol ggac 1 centaur 282 μmol ggac 1 30n 364 μmol ggac 1 100058 368 μmol ggac 1 k835 with the increase in the concentration of total acidic groups a slight change in the composition of specific oxygen groups i e carboxylic phenolic and lactonic revealed the percentage of phenolic groups of the tested gacs increased by 3 whereas the percentage of carboxylic groups decreased by 7 mean value of all gacs hypothesis testing p 0 05 showed that the differences in the amounts of lactonic groups were not significant the highly disorganized structure of activated carbons consists of amorphous carbon and crystalline graphitic microstructures the edges of these microstructures consist of unsaturated c c bonds xiang et al 2016 and heteroatoms usually bonded to these sites could give rise to the formation of oxygen surface groups by wet oxidation e g by hocl menendez diaz and martin gullon 2006 or monochloramine fairey et al 2006 further previous studies suggest that the formation of oxygen functionalities such as carboxylic functions could imply the cleavage of an aromatic ring by strong oxidants perrard et al 2012 snoeyink et al 1974 previously reported an increase in the total acidic surface groups of 1 000 μmol ggac 1 when oxidising gacs with hypochlorous acid hocl the higher concentration of surface oxides found by snoeyink et al 1974 compared to those found in this study can be explained by the higher oxidation potential of hocl than monochloramine a correlation analysis was conducted for the amount of oxygen groups i e carboxylic phenolic and lactonic present on the surface of the fresh and oxidised gacs and the corresponding n2 yield all correlation coefficients were 0 9 further a correlation analysis was conducted for the amounts of oxygen groups formed on the surface of the oxidised gacs over the course of the fbr experiments section 3 1 and the corresponding n2 yield the correlation coefficients were 0 94 for the high amount of carboxylic groups formed and 0 94 for the low amount of phenols formed since long term experiments revealed that the n2 yield did not change with on going oxidation by monochloramine see fig 1 these findings were determined to be negligible in summary it can be concluded that gac surface oxidation by monochloramine leads to an increase in the amount of oxygen surface groups accompanied by a minor change in the composition of acidic oxygen functionalities these findings give evidence that a proportion of monochloramine reacts at carbon surfaces according to equation 1 however the n2 yield of the monochloramine gac reaction was unaffected by the amount or type of oxygen groups formed at the carbon surface with on going reaction time these findings contradict the mechanism indicated by equation 2 raising doubt that monochloramine transformation at surface oxides is a feasible explanation for the observed transformation of monochloramine to n2 an important reason for the absence of the expected change in n2 yield could be the comparably low amount of total acidic oxide groups formed over the course of the reaction 240 μmol ggac 1 368 μmol ggac 1 3 3 impact of hocl pre treatment on the n2 yield in order to clarify if the concentration of surface oxides affects the observable n2 yield the fresh k835 and centaur carbon were pre treated with hocl prior to the determination of the n2 and nh4 yield of the monochloramine gac reaction figure b1 sm presents the reactivity of the k835 and centaur carbon for hocl removal with increasing reaction time as for monochloramine removal the carbon reactivity for hocl removal decreased until kapp reached an almost constant value the decrease in reactivity for monochloramine see fig 1 has been assigned to an increase in diffusional resistance with on going reaction time see section 3 1 assuming that the same process applies to the reaction of hocl at gac grains it could be assumed that the reaction of hocl starts at the outer surface of the gac grains and the reaction front then moves towards the centre of the grains with on going reaction time leaving behind reacted carbon sites the stationary first order reaction rate constants for hocl removal were higher than those for monochloramine removal by a factor of 3 fig 3 a and b shows the reaction rate constant kapp and the amount of nh4 produced for the monochloramine gac reaction after hocl pre treatment the apparent reaction rate constant kapp for monochloramine removal did not change during the gac filtration after hocl pre treatment this could be explained by the fact that the external and internal surface of the carbon has already been oxidised by hocl following equation 2 it is hypothesised that the formation of oxygen groups at the gac surface caused by hocl pre treatment snoeyink et al 1974 enhances the conversion of monochloramine to n2 as more surface oxides are formed it has been shown previously that oxidation by hocl also leads to the formation of mostly the same types of surface oxides carboxylic and hydroxylic groups hassan and yasin 2015 compared to those found in this study formed from oxidation by monochloramine however compared to the nh4 yield observed before the gacs were treated with hocl see fig 1 b c the differences were 0 5 k835 and 5 8 centaur taking into account the precision of the method as expressed by the standard deviation observed these differences were considered to be not significant p 0 05 since no change in nh4 yield and n2 yield occurred after hocl treatment the impact of acidic oxygen functionalities present at the carbon surfaces on monochloramine conversion to n2 was determined to be negligible these findings contradict the reaction mechanism reported previously equation 2 and indicate that the concentration of surface oxides only partly determines the n2 yield of monochloramine conversion in gac filters an alternative mechanism that could be responsible for the observed n2 yields is presented in section 3 4 3 4 impact of trace elements on the n2 yield the elemental analysis of the fresh gacs and the results of the correlation analysis for the dependency of the n2 yield on the elemental composition of the gacs are presented in table 3 the elemental analysis showed that the centaur carbon comprised the highest amount of nitrogen and the second highest amount of sulphur among the gacs investigated previous studies suggested an increased catalytic activity for carbons with a high nitrogen content e g for oxygen reduction reactions zhang et al 2014a zhang et al 2014b or presence of thiol groups e g monochloramine removal jacangelo et al 1987 the high nitrogen content of the centaur gac is explained by the manufacturing method that included impregnation of the carbonised raw material with urea prior to the activation step hayden 1995 matviya and hayden 1994 however correlation analysis showed that correlation coefficients for the correlation between the concentration of heteroatoms in the gacs and the corresponding n2 yield of the monochloramine gac reaction were 0 55 table 3 the content of trace metals found in the considered gacs was typical for activated carbons prepared from natural raw products tsai and chang 1994 it has been shown in previous studies that metals such as fe pd or cu can favour monochloramine conversion to either nh4 or n2 vikesland and valentine 2002 edwards and dudi 2004 switzer et al 2006 fu et al 2009 the correlation coefficients are given in table 3 except for copper the correlation coefficients were 0 9 for copper however r 0 95 the analysis of the graphical visualisation of the dependency of the n2 yield on the corresponding concentration of copper figure not shown showed an even distribution of the data points indicating that no outlier caused the high r thus for copper the hypothesis of a correlation between the copper content of a gac and the n2 yield was accepted further the graphical visualisation revealed that transformation of monochloramine to n2 increased only when a certain minimal copper concentration was present at the carbon surface previous batch studies that support this hypothesis showed that copper catalyses monochloramine decay by direct catalysis of cu ii and indirect catalysis of the active radical intermediates formed in case of direct catalysis which was found to be the primary reaction path fu et al 2009 monochloramine is degraded to dichloramine equations 8 and 9 8 cu2 nh2cl cuiinh2cl 2 complex 9 cuiinh2cl 2 nh2cl nhcl2 nh3 cu2 assuming the same process occurs in gac dichloramine would be further converted at active carbon surface sites to n2 according to equation 4 kim et al 1978 further products of the reaction system of nh2cl and cu ii are nhcl and nh2 radicals fu et al 2009 self merging reactions between the nh2 radicals lead to the formation of n2 as an end product as well fu et al 2009 both direct and indirect catalysis of the decay of monochloramine by cu ii provide a feasible explanation for the high monochloramine conversion to n2 found for gacs with a high cu content it further has to be acknowledged that the proposed mechanism for monochloramine transformation via copper catalysis only includes the proportion of monochloramine that is transformed to n2 another proportion of monochloramine still reacts with active sites on the carbon surface see equation 1 forming oxygen groups over the course of reaction as it has been in the experiments conducted in the present study see table 2 it is subject to further research to verify the proposed mechanism that explains the importance of copper on carbon surfaces for monochloramine transformation and establish an overall reaction scheme for monochloramine transformation including monochloramine reactions with copper and the carbon material it should be noted here that according to data in the literature the copper content varies significantly among different batches of the centaur carbon e g 24 16 μg g 1 gac gardner et al 2002 and 12 2 2 0 μg g 1 gac this study such differences may cause the different conversion of monochloramine to nh4 found in this study and in previous measurements fairey et al 2007 see section 3 1 4 predicting concentrations of chloramines and ndma in pool water depending on the carbon type used in the gac filter 4 1 the numerical swimming pool model in order to determine the effect of the carbon type apparent rate constant and n2 yield used in a gac filter on concentrations inorganic chloramine and ndma in real swimming pool systems a simplified numerical model of a swimming pool was set up using the software aquasim reichert 1994 the numerical pool model is based on the simplified hydraulic approach by cloteaux et al 2013 and consists of a pool basin a fresh water inlet and a water recirculation with gac filter and its chloramine transformation reactions see figure c1 sm further loading with ammonium and urea form the bathers chlorine reactions with ammonia jafvert and valentine 1992 and urea blatchley and cheng 2010 gérardin et al 2015 as well as ndma formation by the reaction of chloramines with dma schreiber and mitch 2006 were taken into account in the model the first order decomposition rate constants kapp determined in the experiments conducted in the present study see section 3 1 were used in the model simulation the first order approach has previously been found to be applicable to typical bed depth used in real scale gac filters scaramelli and digiano 1977 becker et al 1990 and has been found to be valid for a wide range of temperatures flow velocities and inflow concentrations skibinski et al 2018 that also cover those of the numerical swimming pool model as the temperature of the experimental determination of kapp in this study was the same as that of the numerical swimming pool model a temperature correction of kapp as proposed previously by the authors e g via the arrhenius equation skibinski et al 2018 was not applied as yields of n2 and ammonia revealed to be constant throughout a long time of operation and with on going oxidation of the gacs in the experiments conducted in the present study fig 1 the same constant yields of n2 and ammonia for monochloramine transformation at gacs were used for the numerical swimming pool model a more detailed description of the numerical swimming pool model its reactions and simulation runs performed are given in section c sm 4 2 modeling results each simulation run was started with the pool system being filled with pure water that did not contain any of the respective reactants intermediates or products simulations were performed at continuous bather loading until stationary concentrations of all the respective species in the pool were reached each single simulation run was performed with a certain gac i e a specific set of kapp and n2 yield table d1 sm summarizes the kapp values and n2 yields used fig 4 shows the simulated relative monochloramine concentration profiles c z cbed in over the bed depth of the theoretical full scale gac filter using the kapp values of the four commercial gacs tested in this study equal profiles have been simulated for other gacs tested in previous studies see table d1 sm as well but are not shown here it revealed that monochloramine is only partially removed across the total bed depth of the gac filters of 0 9 m the relative monochloramine removal for the gacs tested in this study was the following 80 6 100058 82 4 30n 86 1 k835 92 6 centaur the relative amounts of transformation products n2 and nh4 formed over the bed depth of the gac filters are shown in figure e1 sm the amount of monochloramine converted to n2 across the gac filter depends on the n2 yield of the particular carbon rather than on the carbon reactivity as expressed in the rate constant kapp fig 5 shows an example of the simulated time dependent concentration of inorganic chloramines and ndma in the pool for a system making use of gac filters of the k835 gac and of 0 9 m depth the time needed to reach stationary conditions in the pool was 2 h for inorganic chloramines and up to 1000 h for ndma the fact that the time needed to reach stationary chloramine concentrations in the pool was lower than the hydraulic retention time of the pool 3 h could primarily be explained by the high rate constants for chloramine formation reaction 1 3 and 11 table c2 sm and consequently the fast depletion of free available ammonium ammonium concentrations in the numerical pool were very low 0 0018 mg l 1 when stationary conditions were reached previous studies found that ammonia itself is typically not present in a chlorine treated pool wojtowicz 2001 thus supporting these findings the time needed to reach stationary ndma concentrations could primarily be explained by the low rate constants for ndma formation reaction 27 table c2 sm modelled concentrations in the pool at steady state were 0 17 mg l 1 as cl2 sum of inorganic chloramines 0 1 mg l 1 as cl2 monochloramine 0 04 mg l 1 as cl2 dichloramine 0 03 mg l 1 as cl2 trichloramine and 0 012 ng l 1 ndma mean concentrations of chloramines and ndma in full scale pools with almost equal concentrations of free chlorine 0 5 mg l 1 as cl2 as determined over a period of 6 month were slightly higher 0 23 mg l 1 as cl2 sum of inorganic chloramines 0 17 mg l 1 as cl2 monochloramine 0 05 mg l 1 as cl2 dichloramine 0 01 mg l 1 as cl2 trichloramine weaver et al 2009 and 0 06 5 9 ng l 1 ndma jurado sanchez et al 2010 soltermann et al 2012 lee et al 2013 since the frequency of bathers entering the full scale pools over time was not given by the authors this data cannot be used to validate the numerical pool model however it can be concluded that the overall magnitude of concentrations shows an adequate similarity between modelled and full scale results fig 6 shows the effect of both kapp and n2 yield on the stationary concentrations of inorganic chloramines sum of mono di and trichloramine and ndma in the basin of the simplified numerical pool model simulation results are displayed as the relative reduction compared to the scenario without a gac filter for the purpose of comparison the removal performance of the gacs used in this study 30n k835 centaur and 100058 and those considered in previous fixed bed column studies scaramelli and digiano 1977 fairey et al 2007 kim 1977 are displayed table d1 sm summarizes the kapp values and n2 yields used among a variety of considered gacs the reductions relative to the scenario without a gac filter ranged from 0 5 to 2 7 inorganic chloramines and from 1 7 to 4 5 ndma depending on the gac used thus the model results confirm the initial hypothesis that conversion of monochloramine to n2 in gac filters sustainably reduces the concentrations of inorganic chloramines and ndma in the basin of a pool system moreover the results indicate that the reduction of chloramines and ndma can be increased by a factor of 2 if the tested gacs can be modified to comprise a n2 yield of up to 50 by comparing the concentrations of chloramines and ndma in the basin at the same n2 yield but different kapp it becomes clear that concentrations of chloramines and ndma change only slightly for kapp higher than 0 020 s 1 this could be explained by the fact that almost all monochloramine is removed across the gac filter for reaction rate constants 0 020 s 1 5 summary and conclusions using a fixed bed reactor system yields of monochloramine conversion by a chemical surface reaction to elemental nitrogen n2 in gac beds were determined under conditions typical for swimming pool water treatment n2 yields ranged between 0 5 4 7 and 21 3 4 1 for the four gacs tested no significant change in n2 yield was found with on going exposure of the gac to monochloramine contrary to the n2 yield the apparent reaction rates for the removal of monochloramine in gac beds initially decreased until quasi stationary conditions were reached after 0 75 1 25 mmol ggac 1of monochloramine had reacted when quasi stationary conditions had been reached a total of 240 368 μmol ggac 1 of oxygen groups were formed by monochloramine oxidation with carboxylic groups being the prevailing type contrary to previous assumptions the n2 yield did not correlate with the amount of oxygen groups present on the carbons surface this was also true after intense pre oxidation of the gacs with 2 2 mmol ggac 1 as cl2 of hypochlorous acid correlation analysis between the trace elemental composition of the gacs and the n2 yield indicates a linear dependency of the n2 yield on the copper content of the gacs r 0 95 this can be explained by direct catalysis of the disproportionation of monochloramine by cu ii forming dichloramine assuming the same process takes place in gac beds dichloramine will be further converted at active carbon surface sites to n2 these findings still have to be verified in future experiments testing a higher number gacs with different amounts of cu immobilised on the carbon surface simulations using a simplified numerical model of a real swimming pool showed that progressive monochloramine conversion to n2 in gac filters significantly lowers the concentration of inorganic chloramines and ndma in pool water the relative reduction of monochloramine and ndma compared to the scenario without a gac filter ranged from 0 5 to 2 7 for inorganic chloramines and from 1 7 to 4 5 for ndma depending on the type of gac used also model results indicated that the reduction of inorganic chloramines and ndma in the pool could be increased by a factor of 2 if the tested gacs could be modified so that their yields of monochloramine

19032,inorganic chloramines mono di and trichloramine are formed in swimming pool water from the unintended reaction of free chlorine with ammonia that is introduced by bathers monochloramine is of particular interest as it is known to react further in pool water forming harmful dbps such carcinogenic n nitrosodimethylamine ndma during pool water treatment with granular activated carbon gac filters monochloramine is transformed by chemical reactions on the carbon surface to n2 and ammonia as ammonia is led back into the pool where it is chlorinated again under the renewed formation of inorganic chloramines it is recommended to use gacs with a high n2 yield for monochloramine transformation in pool water treatment in this study yields of n2 and ammonia from monochloramine conversion by commercially available gacs were determined using a fixed bed reactor system under conditions that are typical for swimming pool water treatment the n2 yields remained constant with on going exposure of the gac to monochloramine and ranged from 0 5 to 21 3 depending on the type of gac used correlation analyses were conducted to identify carbon properties that can determine the n2 yield for monochloramine conversion such as the amount of oxygen groups the elemental composition and the trace metal content it was found that the n2 yield significantly correlates with the copper content of the tested carbons model calculations combining pool hydraulics with formation abatement of inorganic chloramines and ndma as well as chloramine transformations in gac filters showed that the concentration of inorganic chloramines and carcinogenic ndma can be decreased by a factor of 2 if the tested gacs could be modified to convert up to 50 of the monochloramine to n2 graphical abstract

filtration has further been known to remove mono di and trichloramine by a chemical reaction at the carbon surface bauer and snoeyink 1973 scaramelli and digiano 1977 kochany and lipczynska kochany 2008 sakuma et al 2015 previous studies showed that monochloramine is chemically reduced at the surface of activated carbons to ammonia nh3 or ammonium ion nh4 equation 1 a second mechanism was proposed by bauer and snoeyink 1973 who concluded on a chemical reaction of monochloramine with surface oxides c o to form n2 according to equation 2 until now no direct evidence for the oxidative decomposition of monochloramine to n2 according to equation 2 has been presented 1 nh2cl h2o c nh4 cl c o 2 2 nh2cl c o 2 h2o n2 2 h3o 2 cl c removal of monochloramine and the type of reaction product formed by the degradation of monochloramine in gac filters is highly relevant for the practical application of gac in the treatment of swimming pool water if only the reaction according to equation 1 was taking place then during a full cycle of swimming pool water through the treatment system and back to the pool only little effect would be achievable as the re chlorination of the treated water would again produce mono di and trichloramine consequently the application of gac with a high n2 yield is crucial to keep the concentration of inorganic chloramines and ndma in the pool water at a constant limited concentration studies on the selective conversion of monochloramine to n2 by activated carbon are scarce there are only a few studies that have dealt with the importance of the chemical properties of the activated carbon surface for the n2 yield fairey at al 2007 concluded that the n2 yield of the monochloramine gac reaction did not significantly differ among a set of five commercial gacs they had investigated they concluded that the chemical characteristics of the individual gacs are irrelevant with respect to the n2 yield however the observed n2 yields ranged from 23 to 40 and only the low accuracy of the detection method prevented them from being able to significantly distinguish between the n2 yields of the gacs investigated fairey et al 2007 previous findings indicated that the rate of n2 production correlates with the amount of oxide groups present at the gac surface see equation 2 in this context it is not known whether additional surface oxides are formed by the reaction of gacs with free chlorine equation 3 snoeyink et al 1974 suidan et al 1977a 1977b 1977c that is typically present besides chloramines in pool water and that affects

copper attracted particular interest because it favours disproportionation of monochloramine to form dichloramine fu et al 2009 that in turn reacts with activated carbon to form n2 according to

properties such as the concentration of oxygen surface groups elemental composition and traces of noble and transition metals on the yield of n2 from the reduction of monochloramine at four different gacs available commercially to ensure sufficient accuracy and practical relevance as well long term fixed bed experiments were carried out to determine reaction rate constants and yields under conditions that are typical for swimming pool water to test the correlation of chemical carbon properties on rates and yields acidic oxygen functionalities of the used gacs namely phenols lactonic groups and carboxyl groups the content of noble and transition metals such as pd rh mn co cu fe and ni and the elemental composition of the carbons with respect to c n h and s were to be analysed finally in order to understand if and to what extent gac treatment with gacs that comprise a high n2 yield could mitigate the concentration of chloramines and ndma in swimming pool systems model calculations combining pool hydraulics with the formation and abatement of inorganic chloramines and ndma as well as chloramine transformations in gac filters were to be done 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental determination of the carbon reactivity nh4 yield and n2 yield many previous studies showed that the reduction of monochloramine in a fixed gac bed can be described in sufficient detail using first order reaction kinetics skibinski et al 2018 kim 1977 scaramelli and digiano 1977 kim and snoeyink 1980 thus for a gac bed fed with a monochloramine solution with the inflow concentration

reaction rate constant kapp is obtained according to 5 k app 1 t ebct ln c bed in c bed out the procedure for determining kapp in fixed bed column experiments under fully controlled conditions has been described previously by the authors skibinski et al 2018 in brief a laboratory scale fixed bed column with known bed volume vbed and diameter dbed was continuously fed at a constant flow rate qbed with a monochloramine solution that was prepared from deionised water from a rapidly stirred double walled glass tank with feedback controlled ph and temperature the effluent of the fixed bed column was fed back into the glass tank monochloramine and free chlorine concentrations in the tank of the fixed bed reactor fbr system were continuously measured using a membrane covered amperometric 2 electrode total chlorine sensor cte 1 dmt prominent germany that was calibrated daily using the photometric dpd method din en iso 7393 2 2000 the concentration of monochloramine in the tank cbed in was kept constant during each experiment by feedback controlled dosing qst of a highly concentrated monochloramine stock solution of 1 5 g l 1 as cl2 cst the outflow concentration of monochloramine cbed out from the laboratory scale fixed bed column was indirectly calculated as described elsewhere skibinski et al 2018 identical repeated validation experiments conducted with the same system showed previously that the repeatability standard deviation of kapp a measure that describes the precision of the experimental test method was 0 006 s 1 skibinski et al 2018 fixed bed column experiments were conducted under conditions that are typical for swimming pool water treatment experiments were run over several hours until stationary conditions of gac reactivity were reached scaramelli and digiano 1977 table 1 summarizes the operation conditions of the laboratory scale fixed bed column experiments as given by equations 1 and 2 oxidation of gacs by monochloramine leads to the formation of oxygen surface groups which in turn determine the yields of n2 and ammonia of the monochloramine gac reaction the rather short contact time in the column 2 88 s was chosen to assure a homogeneous and thus representative oxidations state of the gac bed across the columns bed depth further previous studies showed that the time needed until kapp reached stationary conditions was very low for the small bed volume used in this study 32 ml skibinski et al 2018 according to equation 1 and equation 2 monochloramine is converted in the filter column forming nh4 and n2 the percentage of both reactions related to the overall monochloramine conversion was determined by analysing the specific cumulative amount of ammonium formed per g of gac nnh4 t since the beginning of an experiment until time t per specific cumulative amount of monochloramine converted per g of gac in the filter column nmca t until time t the average nh4 yield ynh4 t at time t since the beginning of an experiment equation 6 was then calculated from the slope of the linear regression between nnh4 t and nmca t 6 y nh 4 t n nh 4 t n mca t nmca t was obtained as the integral of qst by cst and by the differential reaction time dt since ammonium was accumulating in the tank during an experiment nnh4 t was obtained as the product of the concentration of ammonium in the tank after a certain reaction time t and the total volume of water present in the laboratory scale plant the photometric dpd method din en iso 7393 2 2000 was used to confirm the absence of free chlorine in the monochloramine solution in the tank of the fbr system over the run time of the experiments this was of particular importance because depletion of nh4 formed in the filter column by chlorination reactions could be neglected the n2 yield yn2 t was determined indirectly as given in equation 7 assuming that nh4 and n2 were the only nitrogenous reaction products present in the tank bauer and snoeyink 1973 fairey et

stored protected from light at 4 c before use 2 3 granular activated carbons four commercially available gacs hydraffin 30n from donau carbon gmbh 30n centaur from chemviron carbon gmbh centaur silcarbon k 835 from silcarbon aktivkohle gmbh k835 and saratec 100058 from bluecher gmbh 100058 were used in this study the raw materials were anthracite coal 30n coconut shells k835 bituminous coal centaur and non porous polymer based spheres 100058 according to the specifications provided by the manufacturers the gacs had been produced by initial carbonisation of the different raw materials at low temperatures followed by physical activation with steam 30n 100058 fichtner 2010 branton et al 2011 böhringer et al 2011 steam and carbon dioxide k835 raave et al 2014 or impregnation with urea

respective grain size distributions are given elsewhere skibinski et al 2018 before use the fresh gacs were treated by i soaking in ultrapure water ii evacuating the soaked suspension of gac and iii washing and decantation as described previously by skibinski et al 2018 2 4 altered granular activated carbons as the reaction to n2 according to equation 2 requires the presence of surface oxides it is to be expected that an increased concentration of surface oxides on the activated carbon will increase the reaction rate according to equation 2 and the n2 yield therefore in order to determine the impact of surface oxide concentration on the n2 yield of the monochloramine gac reaction fixed bed column experiments were performed with gacs that had been pre treated with hocl according to equation 3 the laboratory scale fixed bed column was operated as described in section 2 1 but instead of using a solution of monochloramine a highly concentrated hocl stock solution 4 5 mg l 1 as cl2 was added to the glass tank experiments with hocl were run until 2 2 mmol ggac 1 of hocl as cl2 reacted in the laboratory scale gac filter the gacs remained in the filter column after hocl treatment thereafter the fixed bed column was operated with a solution of monochloramine to determine the n2 yield of the monochloramine gac reaction 2 5 analytical quantification of monochloramine free chlorine and ammonium the concentration of the monochloramine stock solutions was determined spectrophotometrically on a daily basis taking into account the overlapping absorbance peaks of monochloramine and

the hocl stock solutions were standardised spectrophotometrically at ph 10 as the ocl ion using a molar absorption coefficient at 294 nm εocl 294nm of 348 l mol 1 cm 1 hand and margerum 1983 a unicam uv2 200 uv vis spectrophotometer was used for the absorbance measurements for quantification of ammonium nh4 samples were taken from the tank and analysed by size exclusion chromatography with organic carbon and organic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond as described elsewhere huber et al 2011a it should be noted that although the lc ocd ond was designed for organic nitrogen detection it is also capable of quantifying inorganic nitrogen compounds such as ammonium huber et al 2011b samples were stored in headspace free vials with screw caps 25 ml at 4 c until analysis with lc ocd ond that followed within 12 h after sampling the limit of detection for ammonium is assumed to be equal to that of urea 1 ppb previously determined by using the lc ocd ond method huber et al 2011b finally lc ocd ond analysis confirmed that no other nitrogen containing substances were present in the water samples taken from the tank 2 6 chemical characterisation of the granular activated carbons 2 6 1 boehm titration boehm titration boehm 1966 recently standardised goertzen et al 2010 oickle et al 2010 was used to quantify the oxygen groups present on the gac surface this method allows distinguishing oxygen groups by their different acidity in particular phenols lactonic groups and carboxyl groups for analysis the fresh and altered gacs were dried over a period of 24 h at 70 c to avoid volatile surface oxides being removed by drying snoeyink et al 1974 then 1 5 g of the carbon was suspended in 50 ml solutions of either 0 05 mol l 1 nahco3 na2co3 or naoh after shaking the suspensions at 150 rpm for 24 h the samples were filtered using 0 45 μm polycarbonate track etch membrane filters sartorius ag germany aliquots 10 ml each of the filtered nahco3 and naoh solutions were each acidified with 20 ml 0 05 mol l 1 hcl and a 10 ml aliquot of the filtered naco3 sample was acidified with 30 ml 0 05 mol l 1 hcl co2 was stripped from the acidified samples by continuously sparkling with n2 for 2 h finally 0 05 mol l 1 naoh was added drop wise to the acidified samples under simultaneous sparkling with n2 until ph 7 was reached the volume of 0 05 mol l 1 naoh needed to reach ph 7 was denoted as vnaoh and was determined in triplicate for each batch experiment the amount of carbon surface functionalities in terms of phenols lactonic groups and carboxyl groups were calculated based on vnaoh as described elsewhere goertzen et al 2010 oickle et al 2010 2 6 2 zeta potential to further elucidate the acidic character of the gacs the zeta ζ potential of the fresh gacs was measured from their

inductively coupled plasma atomic emission mass spectroscopy icp ms using a pqexcell instrument thermo fisher scientific inc usa according to the german standard din en iso 17294 2 2004 prior to icp ms analysis powdered samples of the dried fresh gacs were digested for 30 min in a closed ptfe vessel at 180 c by microwaves mars 5 cem corp united states for digestion 0 5 g of ground carbon was suspended in a mixture of 5 ml concentrated nitric acid hno3 1 ml h2o2 30 and 5 ml ultrapure water digested samples were filtered by a 0 45 μm polycarbonate track etch membrane filter sartorius ag

of detection for the method were calculated as the threefold standard deviation of blank samples blank samples were prepared according to the above described routine but without the carbon sample 2 6

content of the gacs is given as the mean of two replicates the limits of detection were 0 007 g ggac 1 c 0 017 g ggac 1 n 0 003 g ggac 1 h and 0 05 g ggac 1 s 2 7 statistical analysis student s t tests were used to test for a difference in nh4 yields between the gacs investigated the null hypothesis that states that no differences were observed was rejected for a probability of 0 05 to determine if any of the chemical carbon properties could function as an indicator for the apparent n2 yield pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for the linear correlation between the trace element concentrations of the gacs and the n2 yield only linear correlations with a coefficient 0 9 have been further considered for descriptive analysis therefore an assessment of the graphical visualisation of the dependency of the n2 yield on the corresponding concentration of surface oxygen groups or trace elements was carried out due to the low number of tested carbons n 4 a determination of the significance of the linear correlations as well as a multivariate analysis on the synergetic effect of different chemical carbon properties on the n2 yield were not carried out if not mentioned otherwise errors are given as 95 confidence interval calculated from the standard deviation number of observations and the t distribution 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon reactivity and reaction products in fig 1 a d the specific amount of nh4 produced per g of gac as well as the apparent reaction rate constant kapp are plotted against the amount of monochloramine degraded when using filter beds of the 30n k835 centaur and 100058 carbons in agreement with previous findings kapp initially decreased until quasi stationary conditions were reached fairey et al 2007 which was after 0 75 1 25 mmol of monochloramine had reacted per g of gac equivalent to 75 125 h of filter run time the decrease in reactivity has previously been explained by an increase in diffusional resistance with on going reaction time skibinski et al 2018 in brief it is assumed that the monochloramine gac reaction that starts first at the outer surface of the gac grains and the reaction front then moves towards the centre of the grains with on going reaction time leaving behind reacted carbon sites the fact that kapp did not decrease until zero when stationary conditions were reached could be explained by oxygen groups that continuously evolve from the surface as co or co2 thus providing new free active sites snoeyink et al 1974 the reaction rate constants kapp at stationary conditions were found to be 0 015 s 1 100058 0 016 s 1 30n 0 018 s 1 k835 and 0 024 s 1 centaur the unusual course of kapp for the 100058 carbon has been discussed previously and was explained by a shift in the reaction controlling mechanism due to the inhomogeneous pore size distribution of the 100058 carbon skibinski et al 2018 the nh4 yields of the respective gacs were derived from the slope of the plot of the cumulative amount of nh4 produced versus the cumulative amount of monochloramine removed in the gac bed see fig 1 a d the linear correlation for all gacs indicates that the nh4 yield did not change during the course of the reaction the coefficient of determination r2 for linear fitting ranged from 0 993 to 0 999 indicating that the linear regression provides an adequate fit to the experimental data the nh4 yields for the gacs were found as follows 78 7 3 6 k835 88 4 2 30 100058 95 8 2 2 centaur 99 5 4 2 30n to assess the reliability of the measured nh4 yields experiments with the k835 carbon were repeated three times data not shown hypothesis testing p 0 05 showed no significant differences in the nh4 yield among the three repetitions indicating a satisfactory reproducibility for the centaur gac fairey et al 2007 reported a nh4 yield of 69 11 which is far lower than the 95 8 2 2 p 0 001 found in the present study as will be discussed below in section 3 4 this is most probably due to strong variations in the different batches of that gac the n2 yields calculated as described in section 2 1 were as follows 0 5 4 7 30n 4 2 3 0 centaur 11 6 3 1 100058 21 3 4 1 k835 slightly higher n2 yields of other gacs were reported in previous fixed bed column studies 42 scaramelli and digiano 1977 23 40 fairey et al 2007 and 27 3 kim 1977 contrary to the findings of fairey et al 2007 hypothesis testing p 0 05 in this study showed that the differences in n2 yields among the tested gacs were significant table a1 in the supporting material sm lists other processes that potentially could have an effect on the observed n2 yield of the monochloramine gac reaction but were determined to be negligible 3 2 formation of surface oxygen groups 3 2 1 characterisation of fresh gacs 3 2 1 1 acidic oxygen groups the amounts of acidic oxygen groups present on the surface of the gacs as determined by boehm titration are shown in table 2 values are given for the fresh and altered gacs as analysed at the end of the fbr experiments the fresh gacs contained total acidic oxidised functionalities in a concentration range from 1728 to 1926 μmol ggac 1 the majority of acidic oxygen groups were present as carboxylic groups whereas only small amounts of lactonic and phenolic groups were present this composition is typical for activated carbons cagnon et al 2005 kalijadis et al 2011 allwar 2012 3 2 1 2 ζ potential fig 2 shows the ζ potential of the fresh 100058 k835 30n and centaur gacs for the 100058 k835 and centaur gacs the ζ potential decreased steeply with increasing ph until it remained constant above a ph of 8 10 the net negative charge in this ph range can be explained by the dissociation of carboxylic groups which occurs between ph 2 to 6 for activated carbons strelko et al 2002 chingombe et al 2005 even though the fresh 30n carbon had the same level of carboxyl groups compared to the other fresh carbons see table 2 its change in zeta potential between ph 2 and 6 was comparatively low this could be explained by a more homogeneous distribution of carboxylic groups between internal and external particle surfaces for the 30n carbon memendez et al 1995 for the k835 100058 and centaur carbon a significant amount of carboxylic groups is assumed to be located at the external surface of the carbon grains thus having a more pronounced effect on the electrophoretic mobility i e zeta potential compared to the 30n carbon further the fresh 30n carbon has a higher isoelectric point phiep of 7 2 when compared to the other fresh gacs phiep 2 as all carbons comprised almost the same amount of total acidic groups this indicates that a significantly higher amount of groups with basic properties imparts the surface of the 30n carbon memendez et al 1995 due to the high amount of carboxylic functionalities suggested by the change in ζ potential with ph the main focus for further characterisation was on acidic functionalities rather than on basic groups that were not further quantified it should be noted here that the activated carbon grains had been ground prior to the determination of the zeta potential which may have altered their surface chemical properties 3 2 2 characterisation of altered gacs the amounts of total acidic surface groups formed over the course of the fbr experiments table 2 were as follows 240 μmol ggac 1 centaur 282 μmol ggac 1 30n 364 μmol ggac 1 100058 368 μmol ggac 1 k835 with the increase in the concentration of total acidic groups a slight change in the composition of specific oxygen groups i e carboxylic phenolic and lactonic revealed the percentage of phenolic groups of the tested gacs increased by 3 whereas the percentage of carboxylic groups decreased by 7 mean value of all gacs hypothesis testing p 0 05 showed that the differences in the amounts of lactonic groups were not significant the highly disorganized structure of activated carbons consists of amorphous carbon and crystalline graphitic microstructures the edges of these microstructures consist of unsaturated c c bonds xiang et al 2016 and heteroatoms usually bonded to these sites could give rise to the formation of oxygen surface groups by wet oxidation e g by hocl menendez diaz and martin gullon 2006 or monochloramine fairey et al 2006 further previous studies suggest that the formation of oxygen functionalities such as carboxylic functions could imply the cleavage of an aromatic ring by strong oxidants perrard et al 2012 snoeyink et al 1974 previously reported an increase in the total acidic surface groups of 1 000 μmol ggac 1 when oxidising gacs with hypochlorous acid hocl the higher concentration of surface oxides found by snoeyink et al 1974 compared to those found in this study can be explained by the higher oxidation potential of hocl than monochloramine a correlation analysis was conducted for the amount of oxygen groups i e carboxylic phenolic and lactonic present on the surface of the fresh and oxidised gacs and the corresponding n2 yield all correlation coefficients were 0 9 further a correlation analysis was conducted for the amounts of oxygen groups formed on the surface of the oxidised gacs over the course of the fbr experiments section 3 1 and the corresponding n2 yield the correlation coefficients were 0 94 for the high amount of carboxylic groups formed and 0 94 for the low amount of phenols formed since long term experiments revealed that the n2 yield did not change with on going oxidation by monochloramine see fig 1 these findings were determined to be negligible in summary it can be concluded that gac surface oxidation by monochloramine leads to an increase in the amount of oxygen surface groups accompanied by a minor change in the composition of acidic oxygen functionalities these findings give evidence that a proportion of monochloramine reacts at carbon surfaces according to equation 1 however the n2 yield of the monochloramine gac reaction was unaffected by the amount or type of oxygen groups formed at the carbon surface with on going reaction time these findings contradict the mechanism indicated by equation 2 raising doubt that monochloramine transformation at surface oxides is a feasible explanation for the observed transformation of monochloramine to n2 an important reason for the absence of the expected change in n2 yield could be the comparably low amount of total acidic oxide groups formed over the course of the reaction 240 μmol ggac 1 368 μmol ggac 1 3 3 impact of hocl pre treatment on the n2 yield in order to clarify if the concentration of surface oxides affects the observable n2 yield the fresh k835 and centaur carbon were pre treated with hocl prior to the determination of the n2 and nh4 yield of the monochloramine gac reaction figure b1 sm presents the reactivity of the k835 and centaur carbon for hocl removal with increasing reaction time as for monochloramine removal the carbon reactivity for hocl removal decreased until kapp reached an almost constant value the decrease in reactivity for monochloramine see fig 1 has been assigned to an increase in diffusional resistance with on going reaction time see section 3 1 assuming that the same process applies to the reaction of hocl at gac grains it could be assumed that the reaction of hocl starts at the outer surface of the gac grains and the reaction front then moves towards the centre of the grains with on going reaction time leaving behind reacted carbon sites the stationary first order reaction rate constants for hocl removal were higher than those for monochloramine removal by a factor of 3 fig 3 a and b shows the reaction rate constant kapp and the amount of nh4 produced for the monochloramine gac reaction after hocl pre treatment the apparent reaction rate constant kapp for monochloramine removal did not change during the gac filtration after hocl pre treatment this could be explained by the fact that the external and internal surface of the carbon has already been oxidised by hocl following equation 2 it is hypothesised that the formation of oxygen groups at the gac surface caused by hocl pre treatment snoeyink et al 1974 enhances the conversion of monochloramine to n2 as more surface oxides are formed it has been shown previously that oxidation by hocl also leads to the formation of mostly the same types of surface oxides carboxylic and hydroxylic groups hassan and yasin 2015 compared to those found in this study formed from oxidation by monochloramine however compared to the nh4 yield observed before the gacs were treated with hocl see fig 1 b c the differences were 0 5 k835 and 5 8 centaur taking into account the precision of the method as expressed by the standard deviation observed these differences were considered to be not significant p 0 05 since no change in nh4 yield and n2 yield occurred after hocl treatment the impact of acidic oxygen functionalities present at the carbon surfaces on monochloramine conversion to n2 was determined to be negligible these findings contradict the reaction mechanism reported previously equation 2 and indicate that the concentration of surface oxides only partly determines the n2 yield of monochloramine conversion in gac filters an alternative mechanism that could be responsible for the observed n2 yields is presented in section 3 4 3 4 impact of trace elements on the n2 yield the elemental analysis of the fresh gacs and the results of the correlation analysis for the dependency of the n2 yield on the elemental composition of the gacs are presented in table 3 the elemental analysis showed that the centaur carbon comprised the highest amount of nitrogen and the second highest amount of sulphur among the gacs investigated previous studies suggested an increased catalytic activity for carbons with a high nitrogen content e g for oxygen reduction reactions zhang et al 2014a zhang et al 2014b or presence of thiol groups e g monochloramine removal jacangelo et al 1987 the high nitrogen content of the centaur gac is explained by the manufacturing method that included impregnation of the carbonised raw material with urea prior to the activation step hayden 1995 matviya and hayden 1994 however correlation analysis showed that correlation coefficients for the correlation between the concentration of heteroatoms in the gacs and the corresponding n2 yield of the monochloramine gac reaction were 0 55 table 3 the content of trace metals found in the considered gacs was typical for activated carbons prepared from natural raw products tsai and chang 1994 it has been shown in previous studies that metals such as fe pd or cu can favour monochloramine conversion to either nh4 or n2 vikesland and valentine 2002 edwards and dudi 2004 switzer et al 2006 fu et al 2009 the correlation coefficients are given in table 3 except for copper the correlation coefficients were 0 9 for copper however r 0 95 the analysis of the graphical visualisation of the dependency of the n2 yield on the corresponding concentration of copper figure not shown showed an even distribution of the data points indicating that no outlier caused the high r thus for copper the hypothesis of a correlation between the copper content of a gac and the n2 yield was accepted further the graphical visualisation revealed that transformation of monochloramine to n2 increased only when a certain minimal copper concentration was present at the carbon surface previous batch studies that support this hypothesis showed that copper catalyses monochloramine decay by direct catalysis of cu ii and indirect catalysis of the active radical intermediates formed in case of direct catalysis which was found to be the primary reaction path fu et al 2009 monochloramine is degraded to dichloramine equations 8 and 9 8 cu2 nh2cl cuiinh2cl 2 complex 9 cuiinh2cl 2 nh2cl nhcl2 nh3 cu2 assuming the same process occurs in gac dichloramine would be further converted at active carbon surface sites to n2 according to equation 4 kim et al 1978 further products of the reaction system of nh2cl and cu ii are nhcl and nh2 radicals fu et al 2009 self merging reactions between the nh2 radicals lead to the formation of n2 as an end product as well fu et al 2009 both direct and indirect catalysis of the decay of monochloramine by cu ii provide a feasible explanation for the high monochloramine conversion to n2 found for gacs with a high cu content it further has to be acknowledged that the proposed mechanism for monochloramine transformation via copper catalysis only includes the proportion of monochloramine that is transformed to n2 another proportion of monochloramine still reacts with active sites on the carbon surface see equation 1 forming oxygen groups over the course of reaction as it has been in the experiments conducted in the present study see table 2 it is subject to further research to verify the proposed mechanism that explains the importance of copper on carbon surfaces for monochloramine transformation and establish an overall reaction scheme for monochloramine transformation including monochloramine reactions with copper and the carbon material it should be noted here that according to data in the literature the copper content varies significantly among different batches of the centaur carbon e g 24 16 μg g 1 gac gardner et al 2002 and 12 2 2 0 μg g 1 gac this study such differences may cause the different conversion of monochloramine to nh4 found in this study and in previous measurements fairey et al 2007 see section 3 1 4 predicting concentrations of chloramines and ndma in pool water depending on the carbon type used in the gac filter 4 1 the numerical swimming pool model in order to determine the effect of the carbon type apparent rate constant and n2 yield used in a gac filter on concentrations inorganic chloramine and ndma in real swimming pool systems a simplified numerical model of a swimming pool was set up using the software aquasim reichert 1994 the numerical pool model is based on the simplified hydraulic approach by cloteaux et al 2013 and consists of a pool basin a fresh water inlet and a water recirculation with gac filter and its chloramine transformation reactions see figure c1 sm further loading with ammonium and urea form the bathers chlorine reactions with ammonia jafvert and valentine 1992 and urea blatchley and cheng 2010 gérardin et al 2015 as well as ndma formation by the reaction of chloramines with dma schreiber and mitch 2006 were taken into account in the model the first order decomposition rate constants kapp determined in the experiments conducted in the present study see section 3 1 were used in the model simulation the first order approach has previously been found to be applicable to typical bed depth used in real scale gac filters scaramelli and digiano 1977 becker et al 1990 and has been found to be valid for a wide range of temperatures flow velocities and inflow concentrations skibinski et al 2018 that also cover those of the numerical swimming pool model as the temperature of the experimental determination of kapp in this study was the same as that of the numerical swimming pool model a temperature correction of kapp as proposed previously by the authors e g via the arrhenius equation skibinski et al 2018 was not applied as yields of n2 and ammonia revealed to be constant throughout a long time of operation and with on going oxidation of the gacs in the experiments conducted in the present study fig 1 the same constant yields of n2 and ammonia for monochloramine transformation at gacs were used for the numerical swimming pool model a more detailed description of the numerical swimming pool model its reactions and simulation runs performed are given in section c sm 4 2 modeling results each simulation run was started with the pool system being filled with pure water that did not contain any of the respective reactants intermediates or products simulations were performed at continuous bather loading until stationary concentrations of all the respective species in the pool were reached each single simulation run was performed with a certain gac i e a specific set of kapp and n2 yield table d1 sm summarizes the kapp values and n2 yields used fig 4 shows the simulated relative monochloramine concentration profiles c z cbed in over the bed depth of the theoretical full scale gac filter using the kapp values of the four commercial gacs tested in this study equal profiles have been simulated for other gacs tested in previous studies see table d1 sm as well but are not shown here it revealed that monochloramine is only partially removed across the total bed depth of the gac filters of 0 9 m the relative monochloramine removal for the gacs tested in this study was the following 80 6 100058 82 4 30n 86 1 k835 92 6 centaur the relative amounts of transformation products n2 and nh4 formed over the bed depth of the gac filters are shown in figure e1 sm the amount of monochloramine converted to n2 across the gac filter depends on the n2 yield of the particular carbon rather than on the carbon reactivity as expressed in the rate constant kapp fig 5 shows an example of the simulated time dependent concentration of inorganic chloramines and ndma in the pool for a system making use of gac filters of the k835 gac and of 0 9 m depth the time needed to reach stationary conditions in the pool was 2 h for inorganic chloramines and up to 1000 h for ndma the fact that the time needed to reach stationary chloramine concentrations in the pool was lower than the hydraulic retention time of the pool 3 h could primarily be explained by the high rate constants for chloramine formation reaction 1 3 and 11 table c2 sm and consequently the fast depletion of free available ammonium ammonium concentrations in the numerical pool were very low 0 0018 mg l 1 when stationary conditions were reached previous studies found that ammonia itself is typically not present in a chlorine treated pool wojtowicz 2001 thus supporting these findings the time needed to reach stationary ndma concentrations could primarily be explained by the low rate constants for ndma formation reaction 27 table c2 sm modelled concentrations in the pool at steady state were 0 17 mg l 1 as cl2 sum of inorganic chloramines 0 1 mg l 1 as cl2 monochloramine 0 04 mg l 1 as cl2 dichloramine 0 03 mg l 1 as cl2 trichloramine and 0 012 ng l 1 ndma mean concentrations of chloramines and ndma in full scale pools with almost equal concentrations of free chlorine 0 5 mg l 1 as cl2 as determined over a period of 6 month were slightly higher 0 23 mg l 1 as cl2 sum of inorganic chloramines 0 17 mg l 1 as cl2 monochloramine 0 05 mg l 1 as cl2 dichloramine 0 01 mg l 1 as cl2 trichloramine weaver et al 2009 and 0 06 5 9 ng l 1 ndma jurado sanchez et al 2010 soltermann et al 2012 lee et al 2013 since the frequency of bathers entering the full scale pools over time was not given by the authors this data cannot be used to validate the numerical pool model however it can be concluded that the overall magnitude of concentrations shows an adequate similarity between modelled and full scale results fig 6 shows the effect of both kapp and n2 yield on the stationary concentrations of inorganic chloramines sum of mono di and trichloramine and ndma in the basin of the simplified numerical pool model simulation results are displayed as the relative reduction compared to the scenario without a gac filter for the purpose of comparison the removal performance of the gacs used in this study 30n k835 centaur and 100058 and those considered in previous fixed bed column studies scaramelli and digiano 1977 fairey et al 2007 kim 1977 are displayed table d1 sm summarizes the kapp values and n2 yields used among a variety of considered gacs the reductions relative to the scenario without a gac filter ranged from 0 5 to 2 7 inorganic chloramines and from 1 7 to 4 5 ndma depending on the gac used thus the model results confirm the initial hypothesis that conversion of monochloramine to n2 in gac filters sustainably reduces the concentrations of inorganic chloramines and ndma in the basin of a pool system moreover the results indicate that the reduction of chloramines and ndma can be increased by a factor of 2 if the tested gacs can be modified to comprise a n2 yield of up to 50 by comparing the concentrations of chloramines and ndma in the basin at the same n2 yield but different kapp it becomes clear that concentrations of chloramines and ndma change only slightly for kapp higher than 0 020 s 1 this could be explained by the fact that almost all monochloramine is removed across the gac filter for reaction rate constants 0 020 s 1 5 summary and conclusions using a fixed bed reactor system yields of monochloramine conversion by a chemical surface reaction to elemental nitrogen n2 in gac beds were determined under conditions typical for swimming pool water treatment n2 yields ranged between 0 5 4 7 and 21 3 4 1 for the four gacs tested no significant change in n2 yield was found with on going exposure of the gac to monochloramine contrary to the n2 yield the apparent reaction rates for the removal of monochloramine in gac beds initially decreased until quasi stationary conditions were reached after 0 75 1 25 mmol ggac 1of monochloramine had reacted when quasi stationary conditions had been reached a total of 240 368 μmol ggac 1 of oxygen groups were formed by monochloramine oxidation with carboxylic groups being the prevailing type contrary to previous assumptions the n2 yield did not correlate with the amount of oxygen groups present on the carbons surface this was also true after intense pre oxidation of the gacs with 2 2 mmol ggac 1 as cl2 of hypochlorous acid correlation analysis between the trace elemental composition of the gacs and the n2 yield indicates a linear dependency of the n2 yield on the copper content of the gacs r 0 95 this can be explained by direct catalysis of the disproportionation of monochloramine by cu ii forming dichloramine assuming the same process takes place in gac beds dichloramine will be further converted at active carbon surface sites to n2 these findings still have to be verified in future experiments testing a higher number gacs with different amounts of cu immobilised on the carbon surface simulations using a simplified numerical model of a real swimming pool showed that progressive monochloramine conversion to n2 in gac filters significantly lowers the concentration of inorganic chloramines and ndma in pool water the relative reduction of monochloramine and ndma compared to the scenario without a gac filter ranged from 0 5 to 2 7 for inorganic chloramines and from 1 7 to 4 5 for ndma depending on the type of gac used also model results indicated that the reduction of inorganic chloramines and ndma in the pool could be increased by a factor of 2 if the tested gacs could be modified so that their yields of monochloramine conversion to n2 is 50 acknowledgements prof wladimir reschetilowski prof martin jekel and dr irena senkovska are thanked for their valuable discussions regarding the work presented in this study

contamination gomes et al 2013 sowers and may 2013 thus far phylogenetically diverse ohrb have been identified with pcb dechlorination activities including dehalococcoides dehalobium dehalobacter and dehalogenimonas fennell et al 2004 bedard et al 2007 may et al 2008 adrian et al 2009 yoshida et al 2009 wang and he 2013a wang et al 2014 nonetheless due to low solubility and bioavailability of pcbs as well as long generation time of pcb dechlorinating ohrb the biomass of ohrb is extremely low fish 1996 payne et al 2011 which hinders their application in in situ bioremediation of pcbs to stimulate the growth of pcb dechlorinating ohrb an effective strategy is to add other organohalides as priming compounds which has been intensively investigated in previous studies bedard et al 1996 1998 wu et al 1999 vandort et al 1997 deweerd and bedard 1999 krumins et al 2009 park et al 2011 in 1996 the priming effect of adding a single pcb congener on reductive dechlorination of a weathered pcb commercial mixture aroclor 1260 was firstly reported bedard et al 1996 experimental evidences showed that amendment of 0 35 mm 25 34 cb selectively stimulated para dechlorination of penta cbs containing 234 or 2345 chlorophenyl groups by up to 83 in 12 weeks later on a variety of pcb and polybrominated biphenyl pbb congeners were identified to have similar priming effects on pcb dechlorination wu et al 1999 bedard et al 1998 in addition to halogenated biphenyls as pcb analogues a diverse range of halogenated benzoates benzonitrile nitrobenzene and benzamide were confirmed with capabilities of priming pcb dechlorination deweerd and bedard 1999 park et al 2011 nonetheless it is controversial to stimulate pcb dechlorination at contaminated sites with above mentioned priming organohalides due to their limitations in introducing external toxic pollutants and possibly priming non pcb dechlorinating ohrb bedard et al 1996 1998 vandort et al 1997 deweerd and bedard 1999 krumins et al 2009 park et al 2011 therefore an ideal priming compound to stimulate pcb dechlorination should meet following criteria 1 the priming compound has higher bioavailability to stimulate the growth of pcb dechlorinating ohrb compared to pcbs 2 the stimulated ohrb employ the same reductive dehalogenase rdase to catalyze halogen removal from both pcbs and priming organohalides which could guarantee the primed ohrb being ready to dechlorinate pcbs with already expressed rdases and prevent the loss of pcb rdase genes or pcb dechlorinating ohrb in long term application and 3 the priming organohalides are completely dehalogenated to non toxic end product s in our previous studies tetrachloroethene pce was utilized as an alternative electron acceptor to isolate pcb dechlorinating dehalococcoides mccartyi cg1 cg4 and cg5 wang et al 2014 strains cg1 cg4 and cg5 were identified to employ single bifunctional pcb rdases to dechlorinate both pcbs and pce later then pce was successfully employed to enrich a pcb dechlorinating bacterium d mccartyi jna for generating enough biomass for genomic characterization wang et al 2015 in addition these pcb dechlorinators could transfer pce to dichloroethenes dces which could be further dechlorinated to non toxic ethene by other ohrb maymó gatell et al 1997 aulenta et al 2002 he et al 2003 moreover in situ bioremediation of chloroethenes e g pce and dces employing ohrb has been successfully applied in field bioremediation mcguire et al 2006 davis et al 2008 löffler et al 2012 stroo et al 2012 stroo et al 2014 perez de mora et al 2014 kao et al 2016 atashgahi et al 2017 chen et al 2018 matturro et al 2018 niño de guzmán et al 2018 shapiro et al 2018 schaefer et al 2018 therefore pce might be an ideal priming organohalide to stimulate pcb dechlorination which awaits experimental evidences in this study we investigated the priming effects of pce in both an isolated pcb dechlorinating pure culture and a river sediment microcosm the pce concentration was optimized first in the pure culture and was then applied in the microcosm experiments experimental evidences suggested that pce could effectively stimulate pcb dechlorination activities by boosting the growth of indigenous ohrb without introducing external toxic pollutants this study successfully demonstrated that pce could be utilized as an efficient priming compound to stimulate pcb dechlorination 2 materials and methods 2 1 culture transferring microcosm preparation and growth conditions d mccartyi cg1 was cultivated in

nucleotide archive ena with accession no ers2709635 3 results 3 1 pce enhances pcb dechlorination in d mccartyi cg1 to investigate the priming effect of pce on pcb dechlorination gradient concentrations 0 05 5 mm of pce were spiked into the pure culture of cg1 together with 2 5 μm pcb180 2345 245 pcb which is a major pcb congener in aroclor 1260 and at pcb contaminated sites bedard et al 1996 1998 vandort et al 1997 deweerd and bedard 1999 payne et al 2011 in bottles amended with 2 mm pce pce was gradually dechlorinated to tce and dces fig 1 a fig s1 moreover pcb180 was dechlorinated to pcb153 245 245 cb which was enhanced with 0 05 0 2 mm pce as a priming organohalide fig 1b nonetheless compared to control bottles without pce amendment of 0 2 mm pce inhibited the dechlorination of pcb180 fig 1b in addition dechlorination of both pcb180 and pce was completely inhibited in bottles amended with 5 mm pce fig 1a and b these results suggested that amendment of 0 05 0 2 mm pce as a priming organohalide could effectively stimulate pcb dechlorination in strain cg1 notably pce dechlorination products changed from dces to tce when increasing pce concentration from 0 05 to 2 mm fig s1 for example more than 50 of pce was dechlorinated to dces when initial pce concentration was 0 2 mm and predominantly to tce when further increasing the pce concentration also compared to bottles with sole amendment of pce fig s2 pcb180 posed inhibition effects on pce dechlorination and postponed pce dechlorination for several days fig s3 strain cg1 employs the bifunctional pcba1 for the reductive dechlorination of both pcbs and pce wang et al 2014 to test whether the reductive dechlorination of pcbs and pce proceeds synchronously or sequentially in cg1 both in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed interestingly pcb180 and pce were simultaneously dechlorinated in the living culture of cg1 amended with both pcb180 and pce fig 1a and b the pcb dechlorination started with pce dechlorination and slowed down or even ceased soon after the completion of pce dechlorination fig 1a and b in the in vitro assays with crude cell lysates of pce fed cg1 around 70 of pce and 91 of pcb180 were synchronously dechlorinated to tce and pcb153 fig 2 respectively which further confirmed the synchronous dechlorination of pcbs and pce in cg1 3 2 pce primes pcb dechlorination in a river sediment microcosm our previous studies showed the frequent detection of dehalococcoides in sediment samples collected from black odorous urban rivers which are tidal rivers with high strength of organic pollution lu et al 2017 based on above observation of enhancement of pcb dechlorination activities primed by 0 05 0 2 mm pce sediment microcosms amended with varied organohalides were setup with a black odorous urban river sediment to test whether pce 0 2 mm could effectively prime pcb dechlorination in the river sediment interestingly pce in all tested microcosms were completely dechlorinated to non toxic ethene fig 3 a and b fig 4 a in the microcosm amended with both pcb180 and pce with a lag phase of around 30 days reductive dechlorination of pcb180 2345 245 pcb to pcb146 235 245 cb by removing double flanked para chlorines from 2345 phenyl ring was initiated and 74 of pcb180 was dechlorinated after 120 days of incubation in contrast to the meta chlorine removal in strain cg1 fig 3d similar pce priming effects were observed in river sediment microcosms amended with pce and aroclor 1260 fig 4b the chlorine removal from aroclor 1260 started within 30 days in the sediment microcosms amended with pce decreasing the average chlorines per biphenyls from 6 39 to 6 19 after 120 days of incubation fig 4b accordingly about 6 5 of hexa cbs 14 6 of hepta cbs 28 3 of octa cbs and 19 4 of nona cbs in aroclor 1260 were dechlorinated to penta tetra and tri cbs through removing flanked para chlorines from 245 2345 and 23456 chlorophenyl rings resulting in the accumulation of 2356 234 cb 234 235 cb 235 245 cb 235 235 cb 234 25 cb 235 25 cb and 245 25 cb fig 5 c table s1 consequently around 14 8 of para chlorines corresponding to 3 0 of total chlorines were removed from aroclor 1260 in the pce priming sediment microcosm table s1 which could be comparable to the removal of 16 5 of para chlorines and 3 8 of total chlorines in housatonic river sediment primed with 25 34 cb bedard et al 1998 in all sediment microcosms amended with both pce and pcbs either pcb180 or aroclor 1260 the high pcb dechlorination activities accompanied with pce dechlorination fig 4c and d suggested that pcb and pce dechlorination might be mediated by the same ohrb notably no obvious pcb dechlorination activity was observed in the sediment microcosm without pce amendment figs 3c and 5b table s1 3 3 the microbial community composition in sediment microcosms to investigate the impact of pce and pcb amendment on the river sediment microbial community composition as well as to identify the indigenous ohrb 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed with community gdna from six experimental sets biotic control microcosms without pce or pcb amendment pce microcosms with pce amendment pcb180 microcosms with pce180 amendment aroclor 1260 microcosms with amendment of aroclor 1260 pce pcb180 microcosms with amendment of both pce and pcb180 pce aroclor 1260 microcosms with amendment of both pce and aroclor 1260 rarefaction analysis of sequences showed that all rarefaction curves reached curvilinear or plateau phases with 99 5 sequencing coverage fig s4 indicating that rare species could be captured in this study pcoa suggested that both pce and pcb amendment drove the microbial community composition shift in distinct patterns fig s5 particularly in contrast to the separation of the pce pcb180 fed microcosm from the pce aroclor 1260 fed microcosm the close clustering of pcb180 and aroclor 1260 fed microcosms suggested that distinct pcb congeners could pose similar impacts on the sediment microbial community composition but may have different community profiling effects when co existing with pce fig s5 profiling of major microbial community compositions suggested that the relative abundance of dehalococcoides as obligate ohrb significantly and positively correlated pearson test r2 0 878 p 0 02 with the reductive dechlorination of pcbs and pce fig 6 in sediments amended with only pcb180 or aroclor 1260 the relative abundance of dehalococcoides was found to be less than 0 1 of total microbial community in line with their extremely low dechlorination activities figs 3c 5b and 6 by contrast the comparatively high relative abundance of dehalococcoides was observed in the three sediment microcosms i e pce 6 3 of total microbial community pce pcb180 5 0 of total microbial community and pce aroclor 1260 2 3 of total microbial community respectively fig 6 sequences retrieved from the 16s rrna gene sequencing data showed the presence of three different otus of the class dehalococcoidia in the pce pcbs dechlorinating microcosms fig s6 further examination of known reductive dehalogenase genes i e pcba1 pcba4 pcba5 pcea tcea bvca and vcra identified the vcra and bvca genes in microcosms fed with pce or pce together with pcbs fig s7 notably the absence of known pcb rdase genes suggested that the pcb dechlorinating bacteria in the river sediment microcosm might harbor novel functional genes for pcb dechlorination in dechlorinating microbial communities many non dechlorinating populations e g fermentative bacteria and methanogens have important roles in mediating carbon and electron sources as well as other yet to be identified nutrients for organohalide respiring bacteria which could form a syntrophic microbial network men et al 2012 yan et al 2013 2015 as typical non dechlorinating populations lineages of aminicenantales 1 1 2 2 anaerolineaceae 2 4

syntrophomonas 1 9 2 7 were enriched in sediment microcosms with amendment of organohalides 4 discussion in this study we successfully demonstrated that pce could effectively prime pcb dechlorination in a river sediment without introducing external toxic compounds moreover synchronous dechlorination of pcbs and pce was confirmed in both in vivo and in vitro experiments with pure culture cg1 as well as in a river sediment microcosm although similar or even more extensive pcb dechlorination could be primed by pcb pbb congeners or other halogenated compounds in previous studies it was controversial to apply them to in situ pcb bioremediation due to the introduction of external toxic compounds generated from the priming organohalides bedard et al 1996 1998 vandort et al 1997 deweerd and bedard 1999 krumins et al 2009 park et al 2011 moreover ohrb harbored distinct rdase genes and had different dehalogenation specificities of which the dechlorination priming compounds might be different from each other therefore in the case of employment of pcb pbb congeners chlorobenzenes and chlorophenyls as priming compounds it was necessary to take efforts to identify the contaminated pcbs and the dechlorination specificities of indigenous organohalide respiring bacteria which could help to secure the successful stimulation of pcb dechlorination with these priming compounds by contrast since all identified pcb dechlorinating bacteria could dechlorinate pce e g cg1 cg4 cg5 jna cbdb1 195 and df 1 maymó gatell et al 1997 miller et al 2005 marco urrea et al 2011 wang et al 2014 2015 it would be a simple and efficient strategy to utilize pce as a priming compound to stimulate pcb bioremediation also compared to other priming organohalides pce had several other advantages including the higher bioavailability successful engineering experience in its in situ bioremediation and complete dechlorination to non toxic ethene aulenta et al 2002 mcguire et al 2006 davis et al 2008 stroo et al 2012 perez de mora et al 2014 wang et al 2014 kao et al 2016 atashgahi et al 2017 chen et al 2018 matturro et al 2018 niño de guzmán et al 2018 shapiro et al 2018 schaefer et al 2018 therefore all these experimental evidences suggested that pce could be a promising organohalide to prime pcb dechlorination at bioremediation sites to apply this halo priming strategy to in situ bioremediation varied parameters e g pce pcbs ratio temperature control and toxicity of intermediates should be taken into consideration a previous study reported that the ratio of the halo priming compound to pcbs could impact on the dechlorination extent of pcbs and the higher pbb pcb ratio led to the more extensive pcb dechlorination bedard et al 1998 in this study pcb dechlorination activities were primed by 0 05 0 2 mm pce and an optimized pce concentration was identified to be 0 2 mm i e pce pcb mol mol 80 on the other hand temperature may vary greatly from sites to sites which influenced the priming performance wu et al 1999 for example the pcb dechlorination rate was enhanced by around 4 times when the temperature was increased from 8 c to 25 c wu et al 1999 in this study extensive pcb dechlorination was observed within 4 months and the feasibility to apply pce as a priming compound under low temperature awaited future investigation also the incomplete dechlorinaiton of pce could result in accumulation of more toxic intermediates e g vinyl chloride therefore in situ bioremediation of pcb contamination sites with pce as a priming compound should be carefully designed and applied at pcb contaminated sites it might be necessary to couple pce priming pcb dechlorination with other strategies to assure the in situ bioremediation performance depending on whether indigenous pcb dechlorinating bacteria were present there or not in the case of presence of indigenous pcb and pce dechlorinating bacteria as shown in this study it is critical to boost the biomass of pcb dechlorinating bacteria by adding pce as an electron acceptor to prime pcb dechloirnation at the same time traditional biostimulation methods e g amendment of polymers as slow releasing sources of the electron donor and carbon to promote the growth of ohrb could be employed to further improve pcb dechlorination activities which had been successfully applied in the bioremediation of chloroethenes mcguire et al 2006 davis et al 2008 in the case of absence of indigenous ohrb for reductive dechlorination of pcbs and or pce to ethene external pcb and dichloroethene dce dechlorinating bacteria might be necessary to be introduced into the contaminated sites to augment pcb bioremediation which would be much more complicated compared to the sole biostimulation case though successful bioaugmentation of pcb dechlorination had been reported previously krumins et al 2009 fagervold et al 2011 payne et al 2011 2017 sowers and may 2013 it had been a grand challenge to secure the efficient pcb dechlorination by inoculating external fastidious pcb dechlorinating bacteria mainly due to that the indigenous microorganisms could easily outcompete the inoculating dechlorinating bacteria fagervold et al 2011 the addition of pce as a priming compound might favor the competition of inoculating dechlorinators over indigenous microorganisms by boosting biomass of the slow growing dechlorinating bacteria nonetheless future investigations on the balance of both pcb and dce dechlorinating bacteria would be recommended moreover though pce was demonstrated to prime pcb dechlorination in this study the long term priming effects or impact of second pce amendment on pcb dechlorination as well as quantitative measurement of reductive dehalogenase genes awaited future in depth analyses 5 conclusions pce was identified as an effective priming compound to enhance pcb dechlorination both in a pure culture of d mccartyi cg1 and a river sediment microcosm with an optimized concentration of 0 2 mm complete dechlorination of pce to non toxic ethene was achieved in the river sediment microcosm synchronous dechlorination of pcbs and pce was observed in both in vivo and in vitro experiments with pure culture cg1 as well as in the river sediment microcosm indigenous organohalide respiring dehalococcoides was enriched by more than 20 times in a river sediment microcosm with amendment of pce this study suggested that pce could be an effective priming compound to enhance bioremediation of pcbs acknowledgement we thanked xueqi zou for assistance in gc analysis this

19033,halo priming is an effective approach to initiate microbial reductive dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs at contaminated sites of which the application has been restricted by introducing extra pollutants generated from priming organohalides in this study tetrachloroethene pce was demonstrated to be an effective priming compound to enhance pcb dechlorination both in a pcb dechlorinating pure culture and a river sediment microcosm in the isolated pcb dechlorinating dehalococcoides mccartyi cg1 pcb dechlorination activities were stimulated by adding 0 05 0 2 mm pce and were inhibited when further increasing pce concentrations both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that pcbs and pce were synchronously dechlorinated in d mccartyi cg1 in a river sediment microcosm which was established to mimic in situ biostimulation of pcb dechlorination 0 2 mm pce could significantly improve para chlorine removal from both pcb180 2345 245 cb and aroclor 1260 and increase the relative abundance of indigenous dechlorinating dehalococcoides for more than 20 times from 0 1 to 2 3 5 0 at the same time pce as a priming compound was completely dechlorinated to non toxic ethene overall this study provided an efficient strategy to stimulate in situ bioremediation of pcbs graphical abstract image 1 keywords dehalococcoides pcbs tetrachloroethene microbial reductive dechlorination sediment 1 introduction polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs have been listed as persistent organic pollutants pops by the stockholm convention unep 2001 due to their persistence bio accumulation and toxicity in biota kelly et al 2007 although the production of pcbs has been banned for several decades they are ubiquitously present in a variety of environmental matrices including air water and soil through long range dispersion and mitigation gioia et al 2008 zhao et al 2016 2017 yadav et al 2017 which may result in accumulation in wildlife and human beings via food webs jepson et al 2016 zheng et al 2016 therefore pcbs are still an important environmental concern and pose a threat to public health iarc 2016 for in situ bioremediation of pcbs organohalide respiring bacteria ohrb could be employed to predominantly remove meta and para chlorines and consequently eliminate dioxin like toxicities of pcbs providing a promising way to cleanup pcb contamination gomes et al 2013 sowers and may 2013 thus far phylogenetically diverse ohrb have been identified with pcb dechlorination activities including dehalococcoides dehalobium dehalobacter and dehalogenimonas fennell et al 2004 bedard et al 2007 may et al 2008 adrian et al 2009 yoshida et al 2009 wang and he 2013a wang et al 2014 nonetheless due to low solubility and bioavailability of pcbs as well as long generation time of pcb dechlorinating ohrb the biomass of ohrb is extremely low fish 1996 payne et al 2011 which hinders their application in in situ bioremediation of pcbs to stimulate the growth of pcb dechlorinating ohrb an effective strategy is to add other organohalides as priming compounds which has been intensively investigated in previous studies bedard et al 1996 1998 wu et al 1999 vandort et al 1997 deweerd and bedard 1999 krumins et al 2009 park et al 2011 in 1996 the priming effect of adding a single pcb congener on reductive dechlorination of a weathered pcb commercial mixture aroclor 1260 was firstly reported bedard et al 1996 experimental evidences showed that amendment of 0 35 mm 25 34 cb selectively stimulated para dechlorination of penta cbs containing 234 or 2345 chlorophenyl groups by up to 83 in 12 weeks later on a variety of pcb and polybrominated biphenyl pbb congeners were identified to have similar priming effects on pcb dechlorination wu et al 1999 bedard et al 1998 in addition to halogenated biphenyls as pcb analogues a diverse range of halogenated benzoates benzonitrile nitrobenzene and benzamide were confirmed with capabilities of priming pcb dechlorination deweerd and bedard 1999 park et al 2011 nonetheless it is controversial to stimulate pcb dechlorination at contaminated sites with above mentioned priming organohalides due to their limitations in introducing external toxic pollutants and possibly priming non pcb dechlorinating ohrb bedard et al 1996 1998 vandort et al 1997 deweerd and bedard 1999 krumins et al 2009 park et al 2011 therefore an ideal priming compound to stimulate pcb dechlorination should meet following criteria 1 the priming compound has higher bioavailability to stimulate the growth of pcb dechlorinating ohrb compared to pcbs 2 the stimulated ohrb employ the same reductive dehalogenase rdase to catalyze halogen removal from both pcbs and priming organohalides which could guarantee the primed ohrb being ready to dechlorinate pcbs with already expressed rdases and prevent the loss of pcb rdase genes or pcb dechlorinating ohrb in long term application and 3 the priming organohalides are completely dehalogenated to non toxic end product s in our previous studies tetrachloroethene pce was utilized as an alternative electron acceptor to isolate pcb dechlorinating dehalococcoides mccartyi cg1 cg4 and cg5 wang et al 2014 strains cg1 cg4 and cg5 were identified to employ single bifunctional pcb rdases to dechlorinate both pcbs and pce later then pce was successfully employed to enrich a pcb dechlorinating bacterium d mccartyi jna for generating enough biomass for genomic characterization wang et al 2015 in addition these pcb dechlorinators could transfer pce to dichloroethenes dces which could be further dechlorinated to non toxic ethene by other ohrb maymó gatell et al 1997 aulenta et al 2002 he et al 2003 moreover in situ bioremediation of chloroethenes e g pce and dces employing ohrb has been successfully applied in field bioremediation mcguire et al 2006 davis et al 2008 löffler et al 2012 stroo et al 2012 stroo et al 2014 perez de mora et al 2014 kao et al 2016 atashgahi et al 2017 chen et al 2018 matturro et al 2018 niño de guzmán et al 2018 shapiro et al 2018 schaefer et al 2018 therefore pce might be an ideal priming organohalide to stimulate pcb dechlorination which awaits experimental evidences in this study we investigated the priming effects of pce in both an isolated pcb dechlorinating pure culture and a river sediment microcosm the pce concentration was optimized first in the pure culture and was then applied in the microcosm experiments experimental evidences suggested that pce could effectively stimulate pcb dechlorination activities by boosting the growth of indigenous ohrb without introducing external toxic pollutants this study successfully demonstrated that pce could be utilized as an efficient priming compound to stimulate pcb dechlorination 2 materials and methods 2 1 culture transferring microcosm preparation and growth conditions d mccartyi cg1 was cultivated in

nucleotide archive ena with accession no ers2709635 3 results 3 1 pce enhances pcb dechlorination in d mccartyi cg1 to investigate the priming effect of pce on pcb dechlorination gradient concentrations 0 05 5 mm of pce were spiked into the pure culture of cg1 together with 2 5 μm pcb180 2345 245 pcb which is a major pcb congener in aroclor 1260 and at pcb contaminated sites bedard et al 1996 1998 vandort et al 1997 deweerd and bedard 1999 payne et al 2011 in bottles amended with 2 mm pce pce was gradually dechlorinated to tce and dces fig 1 a fig s1 moreover pcb180 was dechlorinated to pcb153 245 245 cb which was enhanced with 0 05 0 2 mm pce as a priming organohalide fig 1b nonetheless compared to control bottles without pce amendment of 0 2 mm pce inhibited the dechlorination of pcb180 fig 1b in addition dechlorination of both pcb180 and pce was completely inhibited in bottles amended with 5 mm pce fig 1a and b these results suggested that amendment of 0 05 0 2 mm pce as a priming organohalide could effectively stimulate pcb dechlorination in strain cg1 notably pce dechlorination products changed from dces to tce when increasing pce concentration from 0 05 to 2 mm fig s1 for example more than 50 of pce was dechlorinated to dces when initial pce concentration was 0 2 mm and predominantly to tce when further increasing the pce concentration also compared to bottles with sole amendment of pce fig s2 pcb180 posed inhibition effects on pce dechlorination and postponed pce dechlorination for several days fig s3 strain cg1 employs the bifunctional pcba1 for the reductive dechlorination of both pcbs and pce wang et al 2014 to test whether the reductive dechlorination of pcbs and pce proceeds synchronously or sequentially in cg1 both in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed interestingly pcb180 and pce were simultaneously dechlorinated in the living culture of cg1 amended with both pcb180 and pce fig 1a and b the pcb dechlorination started with pce dechlorination and slowed down or even ceased soon after the completion of pce dechlorination fig 1a and b in the in vitro assays with crude cell lysates of pce fed cg1 around 70 of pce and 91 of pcb180 were synchronously dechlorinated to tce and pcb153 fig 2 respectively which further confirmed the synchronous dechlorination of pcbs and pce in cg1 3 2 pce primes pcb dechlorination in a river sediment microcosm our previous studies showed the frequent detection of dehalococcoides in sediment samples collected from black odorous urban rivers which are tidal rivers with high strength of organic pollution lu et al 2017 based on above observation of enhancement of pcb dechlorination activities primed by 0 05 0 2 mm pce sediment microcosms amended with varied organohalides were setup with a black odorous urban river sediment to test whether pce 0 2 mm could effectively prime pcb dechlorination in the river sediment interestingly pce in all tested microcosms were completely dechlorinated to non toxic ethene fig 3 a and b fig 4 a in the microcosm amended with both pcb180 and pce with a lag phase of around 30 days reductive dechlorination of pcb180 2345 245 pcb to pcb146 235 245 cb by removing double flanked para chlorines from 2345 phenyl ring was initiated and 74 of pcb180 was dechlorinated after 120 days of incubation in contrast to the meta chlorine removal in strain cg1 fig 3d similar pce priming effects were observed in river sediment microcosms amended with pce and aroclor 1260 fig 4b the chlorine removal from aroclor 1260 started within 30 days in the sediment microcosms amended with pce decreasing the average chlorines per biphenyls from 6 39 to 6 19 after 120 days of incubation fig 4b accordingly about 6 5 of hexa cbs 14 6 of hepta cbs 28 3 of octa cbs and 19 4 of nona cbs in aroclor 1260 were dechlorinated to penta tetra and tri cbs through removing flanked para chlorines from 245 2345 and 23456 chlorophenyl rings resulting in the accumulation of 2356 234 cb 234 235 cb 235 245 cb 235 235 cb 234 25 cb 235 25 cb and 245 25 cb fig 5 c table s1 consequently around 14 8 of para chlorines corresponding to 3 0 of total chlorines were removed from aroclor 1260 in the pce priming sediment microcosm table s1 which could be comparable to the removal of 16 5 of para chlorines and 3 8 of total chlorines in housatonic river sediment primed with 25 34 cb bedard et al 1998 in all sediment microcosms amended with both pce and pcbs either pcb180 or aroclor 1260 the high pcb dechlorination activities accompanied with pce dechlorination fig 4c and d suggested that pcb and pce dechlorination might be mediated by the same ohrb notably no obvious pcb dechlorination activity was observed in the sediment microcosm without pce amendment figs 3c and 5b table s1 3 3 the microbial community composition in sediment microcosms to investigate the impact of pce and pcb amendment on the river sediment microbial community composition as well as to identify the indigenous ohrb 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed with community gdna from six experimental sets biotic control microcosms without pce or pcb amendment pce microcosms with pce amendment pcb180 microcosms with pce180 amendment aroclor 1260 microcosms with amendment of aroclor 1260 pce pcb180 microcosms with amendment of both pce and pcb180 pce aroclor 1260 microcosms with amendment of both pce and aroclor 1260 rarefaction analysis of sequences showed that all rarefaction curves reached curvilinear or plateau phases with 99 5 sequencing coverage fig s4 indicating that rare species could be captured in this study pcoa suggested that both pce and pcb amendment drove the microbial community composition shift in distinct patterns fig s5 particularly in contrast to the separation of the pce pcb180 fed microcosm from the pce aroclor 1260 fed microcosm the close clustering of pcb180 and aroclor 1260 fed microcosms suggested that distinct pcb congeners could pose similar impacts on the sediment microbial community composition but may have different community profiling effects when co existing with pce fig s5 profiling of major microbial community compositions suggested that the relative abundance of dehalococcoides as obligate ohrb significantly and positively correlated pearson test r2 0 878 p 0 02 with the reductive dechlorination of pcbs and pce fig 6 in sediments amended with only pcb180 or aroclor 1260 the relative abundance of dehalococcoides was found to be less than 0 1 of total microbial community in line with their extremely low dechlorination activities figs 3c 5b and 6 by contrast the comparatively high relative abundance of dehalococcoides was observed in the three sediment microcosms i e pce 6 3 of total microbial community pce pcb180 5 0 of total microbial community and pce aroclor 1260 2 3 of total microbial community respectively fig 6 sequences retrieved from the 16s rrna gene sequencing data showed the presence of three different otus of the class dehalococcoidia in the pce pcbs dechlorinating microcosms fig s6 further examination of known reductive dehalogenase genes i e pcba1 pcba4 pcba5 pcea tcea bvca and vcra identified the vcra and bvca genes in microcosms fed with pce or pce together with pcbs fig s7 notably the absence of known pcb rdase genes suggested that the pcb dechlorinating bacteria in the river sediment microcosm might harbor novel functional genes for pcb dechlorination in dechlorinating microbial communities many non dechlorinating populations e g fermentative bacteria and methanogens have important roles in mediating carbon and electron sources as well as other yet to be identified nutrients for organohalide respiring bacteria which could form a syntrophic microbial network men et al 2012 yan et al 2013 2015 as typical non dechlorinating populations lineages of aminicenantales 1 1 2 2 anaerolineaceae 2 4 3 8 candidatus competibacter 1 8 4 1 fs117 23b 02 1 3 2 6 rbg 16 58 14 1 4 2 5 romboutsia 1 2 1 8 and sja 15 1 8 2 3 dominated in all sediment microcosms fig 6 by contrast clostridium 11 8 17 9 and syntrophomonas 1 9 2 7 were enriched in sediment microcosms with amendment of organohalides 4 discussion in this study we successfully demonstrated that pce could effectively prime pcb dechlorination in a river sediment without introducing external toxic compounds moreover synchronous dechlorination of pcbs and pce was confirmed in both in vivo and in vitro experiments with pure culture cg1 as well as in a river sediment microcosm although similar or even more extensive pcb dechlorination could be primed by pcb pbb congeners or other halogenated compounds in previous studies it was controversial to apply them to in situ pcb bioremediation due to the introduction of external toxic compounds generated from the priming organohalides bedard et al 1996 1998 vandort et al 1997 deweerd and bedard 1999 krumins et al 2009 park et al 2011 moreover ohrb harbored distinct rdase genes and had different dehalogenation specificities of which the dechlorination priming compounds might be different from each other therefore in the case of employment of pcb pbb congeners chlorobenzenes and chlorophenyls as priming compounds it was necessary to take efforts to identify the contaminated pcbs and the dechlorination specificities of indigenous organohalide respiring bacteria which could help to secure the successful stimulation of pcb dechlorination with these priming compounds by contrast since all identified pcb dechlorinating bacteria could dechlorinate pce e g cg1 cg4 cg5 jna cbdb1 195 and df 1 maymó gatell et al 1997 miller et al 2005 marco urrea et al 2011 wang et al 2014 2015 it would be a simple and efficient strategy to utilize pce as a priming compound to stimulate pcb bioremediation also compared to other priming organohalides pce had several other advantages including the higher bioavailability successful engineering experience in its in situ bioremediation and complete dechlorination to non toxic ethene aulenta et al 2002 mcguire et al 2006 davis et al 2008 stroo et al 2012 perez de mora et al 2014 wang et al 2014 kao et al 2016 atashgahi et al 2017 chen et al 2018 matturro et al 2018 niño de guzmán et al 2018 shapiro et al 2018 schaefer et al 2018 therefore all these experimental evidences suggested that pce could be a promising organohalide to prime pcb dechlorination at bioremediation sites to apply this halo priming strategy to in situ bioremediation varied parameters e g pce pcbs ratio temperature control and toxicity of intermediates should be taken into consideration a previous study reported that the ratio of the halo priming compound to pcbs could impact on the dechlorination extent of pcbs and the higher pbb pcb ratio led to the more extensive pcb dechlorination bedard et al 1998 in this study pcb dechlorination activities were primed by 0 05 0 2 mm pce and an optimized pce concentration was identified to be 0 2 mm i e pce pcb mol mol 80 on the other hand temperature may vary greatly from sites to sites which influenced the priming performance wu et al 1999 for example the pcb dechlorination rate was enhanced by around 4 times when the temperature was increased from 8 c to 25 c wu et al 1999 in this study extensive pcb dechlorination was observed within 4 months and the feasibility to apply pce as a priming compound under low temperature awaited future investigation also the incomplete dechlorinaiton of pce could result in accumulation of more toxic intermediates e g vinyl chloride therefore in situ bioremediation of pcb contamination sites with pce as a priming compound should be carefully designed and applied at pcb contaminated sites it might be necessary to couple pce priming pcb dechlorination with other strategies to assure the in situ bioremediation performance depending on whether indigenous pcb dechlorinating bacteria were present there or not in the case of presence of indigenous pcb and pce dechlorinating bacteria as shown in this study it is critical to boost the biomass of pcb dechlorinating bacteria by adding pce as an electron acceptor to prime pcb dechloirnation at the same time traditional biostimulation methods e g amendment of polymers as slow releasing sources of the electron donor and carbon to promote the growth of ohrb could be employed to further improve pcb dechlorination activities which had been successfully applied in the bioremediation of chloroethenes mcguire et al 2006 davis et al 2008 in the case of absence of indigenous ohrb for reductive dechlorination of pcbs and or pce to ethene external pcb and dichloroethene dce dechlorinating bacteria might be necessary to be introduced into the contaminated sites to augment pcb bioremediation which would be much more complicated compared to the sole biostimulation case though successful bioaugmentation of pcb dechlorination had been reported previously krumins et al 2009 fagervold et al 2011 payne et al 2011 2017 sowers and may 2013 it had been a grand challenge to secure the efficient pcb dechlorination by inoculating external fastidious pcb dechlorinating bacteria mainly due to that the indigenous microorganisms could easily outcompete the inoculating dechlorinating bacteria fagervold et al 2011 the addition of pce as a priming compound might favor the competition of inoculating dechlorinators over indigenous microorganisms by boosting biomass of the slow growing dechlorinating bacteria nonetheless future investigations on the balance of both pcb and dce dechlorinating bacteria would be recommended moreover though pce was demonstrated to prime pcb dechlorination in this study the long term priming effects or impact of second pce amendment on pcb dechlorination as well as quantitative measurement of reductive dehalogenase genes awaited future in depth analyses 5 conclusions pce was identified as an effective priming compound to enhance pcb dechlorination both in a pure culture of d mccartyi cg1 and a river sediment microcosm with an optimized concentration of 0 2 mm complete dechlorination of pce to non toxic ethene was achieved in the river sediment microcosm synchronous dechlorination of pcbs and pce was observed in both in vivo and in vitro experiments with pure culture cg1 as well as in the river sediment microcosm indigenous organohalide respiring dehalococcoides was enriched by more than 20 times in a river sediment microcosm with amendment of pce this study suggested that pce could be an effective priming compound to enhance bioremediation of pcbs acknowledgement we thanked xueqi zou for assistance in gc analysis this

19034,a wide range of cyanobacterial species and their harmful metabolites are increasingly detected in water bodies worldwide exacerbated by climate change and human activities the resulting bloom conditions represent significant challenges to production of safe drinking water and cost effective water reuse therefore their removal is a priority to ensure public safety while current microscopic taxonomy identification methods provide valuable information about cell numbers during treatment these methods are incapable of providing information about the fate of cells during treatment the objectives of this study were to 1 identify the critical control points for breakthrough and accumulation of cells by investigating the fate of cells during treatment processes using a combination of taxonomy cell integrity and next generation sequencing ngs and 2 assess the impact of pre treatment processes on breakthrough prevention at critical control points and the benefits of cell integrity and ngs analysis for improved management purposes this paper presents the results of an unprecedented cyanobacterial monitoring program conducted in four full scale water treatment plants located in three different climate zones cyanobacterial cell integrity and accumulation during operation process were assessed for the first time using next generation of gene sequencing methods ngs analysis led to detection of cyanobacterial and melainabacteria orders in water samples that were not identified by microscopy 80 5 of cells were completely lysed post pre oxidation for both ozone and potassium permanganate however unlike pre ozonation the remaining cells were undamaged cells with the potential to accumulate and grow within the plants post kmno4 treatment particularly in clarifier sludge to effectively monitor water quality this study presents a synergistic approach coupling new and traditional analytical methods and demonstrates the importance of identifying critical points for managing accumulation of cyanobacteria within plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacteria harmful metabolites microscopic taxonomy cell integrity next generation sequencing water treatment 1 introduction a wide range of cyanobacterial species and cell numbers have been frequently detected in water intakes of water treatment plants worldwide chorus and bartram 1999 schmidt et al 2002 zamyadi 2014 the harmful effects resulting from the presence of cyanobacterial cells even in low numbers below 500 cells ml include i production of varying concentrations of cyanotoxins with recorded human health effects such as severe cases of gastro intestinal and skin diseases liver failure and cancer potential links between alzheimer s disease and motor neurone disease mnd and mortalities and ii production of unpleasant taste and odour t o compounds in water leading to customer complaints and dissatisfaction with the aesthetic quality of distributed water chorus and bartram 1999 carmichael et al 2001 hobson et al 2010 holtcamp 2012 bradley et al 2013 zamyadi et al 2016 bishop et al 2017 chernoff et al 2017 climate change and human activities are creating more favourable conditions for cyanobacterial and algal growth wiedner et al 2007 elliott 2012 paerl and paul 2012 climate change impacts to catchments worldwide include increases in water temperature decreases in average rainfall and inflows low water levels in reservoirs and increases in high intensity rainfall events that deliver elevated nutrient and sediment loads elliott 2012 paerl and paul 2012 zamyadi 2014 furthermore significant population growth has led to rapid development of urban and agricultural areas and increased nutrient loads in water stressed regions sood et al 2015 zinicovscaia and cepoi 2016 in combination these impacts are predicted to increase the frequency duration and intensity of harmful cyanobacterial blooms and influence the presence and dominance of different species elliott 2012 paerl and paul 2012 these conditions lead to large variations in the concentration of cyanobacterial cells and their metabolites and the ratio of harmful non harmful cells in water bodies located in different climate zones zamyadi 2014 bowling et al 2016 bishop et al 2017 these variations impact the performance of treatment processes which were designed based upon historic trends in cyanobacterial challenge to the water treatment plant previous studies have demonstrated that the efficiency of treatment barriers for the removal of cyanobacterial and algal cells and their associated metabolites varies depending on the species present kommineni et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2013a recent investigations have revealed the presence of significant concentrations of cyanotoxins and t o compounds in treated water distributed for human consumption at 1 6 to 4 1 times higher than thresholds indicated in drinking water guidelines zamyadi et al 2013a 2016 pazouki et al 2016 hence the breakthrough of cells and their harmful metabolites have led to the temporary shutdown of drinking water production and distribution zamyadi 2014 these incidents are attributed to knowledge gaps in the understanding of the removal mechanism of these cells and their metabolites under varying water conditions within treatment plants kommineni et al 2009 pazouki et al 2016 and consequently the application of inaccurate and or rudimentary treatment design operation and evaluation cyanobacterial and algal blooms can also influence operation of water treatment plants and water recycling streams kommineni et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2013a pazouki et al 2016 for example breakthrough of cells in high numbers 106 107 cells ml world health organisation who highest alert level 105 cells ml have caused disruption of clarification and shorter filter run times chorus and bartram 1999 the breakthrough of cells into filtered water could lead to an increase in filtered water turbidity which is an indicator of breakthrough of other waterborne pathogens that would lead to loss of filtration credit removal water consumption advisory and plant closure kommineni et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2013a pazouki et al 2016 furthermore even in plants with low cell numbers below 500 cells ml at the intake accumulation of cells within certain treatment processes over time could lead to similar treatment problems and malfunctions zamyadi et al 2013b hence harmful cyanobacterial cells represent a significant challenge to the production of safe drinking water and a barrier to cost effective water reuse therefore the accurate and precise detection and removal of cyanobacterial cells is a priority to ensure public safety water recovery from treated wastewater post stabilization tanks or lagoons is a common practice in dry climates however eutrophication related issues were not adequately considered during design and construction of these mainly open systems kommineni et al 2009 martins et al 2011 sood et al 2015 zamyadi et al 2015a zamyadi et al 2016 zinicovscaia and cepoi 2016 thus it has been found that many tanks and lagoons worldwide are prone to cyanobacterial accumulation and growth which challenge the treatment processes designed for purification and reuse of these waters vasconcelos and pereira 2001 zamyadi et al 2016 praptiwi et al 2017 while current microscopic taxonomy identification methods provide valuable information about cell numbers during treatment they are time consuming and require analysis by highly qualified personnel furthermore changes in cell biovolume due to preservation by lugol s iodine solution can introduce measurement bias hawkins et al 2005 awwa 2010 cell count methods do not provide information about cell integrity and cell membrane damage during treatment zamyadi et al 2010 fan et al 2014 the toxigenicity of cyanobacterial blooms and their fate during water treatment cannot be determined based solely upon the identification of taxa by light microscopy coral et al 2013 zamyadi 2014 alternative analysis including cell integrity analytical methods using cell staining and flow cytometry both using batch samples and as an online instrument and next generation sequencing ngs methods can provide complementary information overcoming these limitations xi et al 2011 gumbo et al 2014 chiu et al 2016 lee et al 2017 kim et al 2018 fan et al 2014 however deriving the full benefit of the resulting data requires an understanding of method applicability and uncertainties the presence of harmful or unpleasant cyanobacterial algal metabolites is among the main challenges within our new environmental realities thus the main goal of this study is to investigate the fate of cyanobacterial and algal cells and their potentially harmful metabolites in full scale water treatment plants using a combination of microscopic taxonomy ngs and cell integrity methods the specific objectives of this study were to 1 identify the critical control points for breakthrough and accumulation of cells by investigating the fate of cells during treatment processes using a combination of taxonomy cell integrity and ngs analysis and 2 assess the impact of pre treatment processes on breakthrough prevention at critical control points and the benefits of cell integrity and ngs analysis for improved management purposes to the best of the authors knowledge this paper presents the first set of experiments applying ngs methods to identify performance of water treatment barriers for removal of cyanobacterial cells 2 material and

manufacturer guidelines the data analyses were conducted using bd accuri c6 software an alternative method to determine the integrity of cells was through the generation of a 3d image by determining the refractive index of the target cell the refractive index of cells which describes the impact of cell medium on light propagation was measured using a nanolive nanolive sa switzerland 3d cell explorer nanolive 2016 this method does not rely on the addition of chemical stains but processes the image based on the refractive index of the cell the water sample was diluted with reverse osmosis

use this kit was selected as it is suggested to be more appropriate choice for water samples due to the convenience high yield of dna and reproducibility of microbial community information hwang et al 2012 the dna concentration biomass extracted from each sample was within the range of 10 20 ng μl dna was quantified using nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotomer thermofisher scientific waltham ma usa and quality assessed through pcr amplification of the 16s rrna gene using cyanobacterial specific primers 27fl and 809r jungblut et al 2005 prior to sequencing the hypervariable regions v1 v3 of the 16s rrna gene were amplified using 27f 519r barcoded primers to remove excess nucleotides a clean up pcr was conducted with an addition of 4 μl of exosap mix 0 025 μl exo new england biolabs m0293s 0 25

miseq sequencing platform illumina san diego usa using the miseq reagent kit v2 to generate 300 bp reads per end sequence reads were initially processed using mothur v1 35 1 www mothur org software package schloss et al 2009 unno et al 2015 sequences containing ambiguous bases 200 bp and homopolyers longer than 8 bp were removed before unique sequences were aligned to the silva reference alignment chimeric sequences were removed through uchime before taxonomic identification was performed through comparison to the greengenes reference database balvociute and huson 2017 with a bootstrap minimum of 80 sequences that could not be identified were removed and subsampling was performed at a level of 2915 sequences per sample clustering of operational taxonomic units otus was performed at a 0 03 distance threshold between sequence reads using the average neighbour algorithm schloss and westcott 2011 the identity of each otu defined by this distance threshold was determined from a sequence consensus within a given otu at a confidence threshold of 80 otus from the 16s amplicon data set were classified to phylum and order level at 87 2 and 78 3 confidence respectively the proportion of each otu relative to method internal standard is reported as given ploidy differences between taxa a one to one relationship between cell numbers and otus is unlikely soppa 2017 rarefaction curves were generated using mothur to ensure adequate representation of each water treatment plant had been achieved figure si 2 a one way anova was used to test for differences in abundance and diversity of taxa between each sample site and treatment processes relative abundance and diversity were assessed for variance equality bartlett s test without transformation this procedure was then separately applied to cyanobacteria otus to determine significant differences in cyanobacterial relative abundance post treatment between sample sites to test for significant variation between treatments within sample sites unpaired t tests were performed on transformed data square root these tests were also performed to specifically test for variance in cyanobacteria abundance 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of treatment breakthrough critical control points sa wtp source treated wastewater after the stabilization lagoons is prone to cyanobacterial and algal bloom events whereby 3 2 106 and 2 4 105 cells ml of cyanobacteria and green algae respectively were detected at the water intake table 2 this plant provided the opportunity to monitor the fate of high numbers over 3 106 cells ml of cyanobacterial cells during coagulation clarification processes aphanocapsa was the dominant cyanobacteria genera detected at the intake followed by microcystis the who highest alert level for drinking water sources is 105 cells ml chorus and bartram 1999 however sa wtp is a water recycling facility for non potable reuse nevertheless these high cell numbers concentration of cyanotoxins and t o compounds were below detection limits cause treatment challenges fig 1 a and concerns about using the treated recycled water for agricultural and recreational urban ponds purposes the coagulation process in sa wtp table 1 resulted in the incorporation of 99 8 and 49 5 5 of free aphanocapsa and microcystis cells into flocs respectively fig 1b no free cells from the chlorophyceae class were detected after the coagulation process hence these results demonstrate genera dependence of coagulation performance nevertheless all remaining aphanocapsa and 93 7 of remaining microcystis were captured by the daff process fig 1c only 6 3 of microcystis broke through the filters and no cells were detected post chlorination notably at all times over 95 5 of cells in all samples from raw water to post daff were healthy cells the removal performance observed in sa wtp was similar to previously published monitoring results of full scale plants in temperate regions zamyadi et al 2013a however these results were contrary to laboratory sedimentation jar tests conducted by newcombe et al 2015 which were spiked with cultured cells of dolichospermum circinale microcystis aeruginosa cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in natural water newcombe et al 2015 found that coagulation clarification process performance for cell removal was species independent however their experiments were conducted with cell number one to two orders of magnitude smaller than cell numbers at the intakes of sa wtp and zamyadi et al 2013a during the sampling campaign in the treatment plant located in the mild temperate climate zone nsw wtp while green algae and diatom numbers were very low below 400 cells ml the cyanobacterial cell numbers were above the first who alert level 2000 cells ml at 3400 cells ml fig 2 a comprising mainly of cylindrospermopsis and microcystis this plant provided the opportunity to monitor the fate of low numbers below 5000 cells ml of cyanobacterial cells during coagulation clarification processes recycling the sludge lagoon supernatant to the head of the plant led to a 43 increase of cell numbers to 4900 cells ml prior to treatment within which cylindrospermopsis dominated fig 2a furthermore 80 of the overall cells at this stage were viable healthy cells compared to 50 cell viability rate at the intake prior to recycling fig 2b cell enumeration of the daf sludge showed that there was a transfer of high cylindrospermopsis cell numbers 55 000 cells ml into the sludge lagoons which combined with favourable retention time and growth conditions could have led to cell growth within the lagoons zamyadi et al 2016 praptiwi et al 2017 a possible explanation for the transfer of the healthy cylindrospermopsis cells into the sludge lagoon is that healthy and undamaged cells tend to float near the surface using their gas vesicles awwa 2010 which increases the chance of cells transferring through the outgoing sludge stream from clarification the favourable conditions of the sludge lagoons enable the cyanobacteria cells to accumulate and proliferate although the green algae and diatom species present during this sampling event were subjected to the same favourable accumulation and growth conditions there was limited transfer of these cells into the head of the plant via supernatant return fig 2a healthy cyanobacteria cells dominant the lagoon supernatant as their gas vesicles enhance their buoyancy in nsw wtp based on microscopic cell identification and counts the number of cyanobacterial cells in post daff water samples was below the detection limit however complementary ngs analysis revealed the presence of a cyanobacterial order and a melainabacteria phylum synechococcales and ys2 respectively in the same post daff water samples fig 2c pazouki et al 2016 and zamyadi et al 2013a observed breakthrough of cyanobacteria cells through river bank and dual sand anthracite filter systems respectively in the case of dual filter system in one occasion an increase in filtered water turbidity over threshold limit of 0 3 ntu led to plant closure due to risk of breakthrough of waterborne pathogens the presence of cyanobacterial genera from synechococcales in the marine environment is well studied wang et al 2011 however the existing knowledge about their presence in drinking water sources is limited komárek et al 2014 li and li 2016 ys2 bacterium used to be classified as cyanobacteria but recent genomic studies demonstrated that they do not have photosynthetic capability hence they are now classified as melainabacteria rienzi et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 ys2 bacteria are associated with human and animal faeces and have been detected in human gut rienzi et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 in nsw wtp filtered water turbidity was always below the threshold value cyanobacterial and melainabacteria cell numbers concentration of cyanotoxins and t o compounds were below the detection limit post chlorination the documented detection of fecal contamination indicators and cyanobacteria in the daff water demonstrates that ngs methods provide more accurate monitoring techniques to assess the risk of breakthrough of microorganisms into treated water amplification of 16s rrna has become the standard technique for microbial surveys and community classification and quantification pooling the genomic dna from each treatment plant for analysis allows for cost effective high throughput screening such ngs classification allows for a more in depth analysis of community composition which may be coupled to the data gathered from more traditional techniques such as microscopy accurate assessment of breakthrough risks is vital for implementation of adequate treatment barriers to ensure public health and safety awwa 2010 newcombe et al 2015 the use of ngs as supplemental information helped to elucidate the effectiveness of different treatments and identify critical point at these plants clarification process particularly accumulation of cell in sludge and filtration processes were identified as critical treatment points similar critical control points were identified in qld treatment plants an analysis of the full scale ramifications of the treatment process on biodiversity may elucidate the presence of site and treatment specific biomarkers for the assessment of treatment plant assessment the samples collected from both qld treatment types saw an increase in the enterobacteriales order post treatment steps figure si 3 pre ozonation resulting in 86 31 of otus being enterobacteriales whereas post sedimentation this order accounted for 66 24 of the microbiome the nsw treatment plant saw actinomycetales increase to accounting for 26 42 of the total microbial relative abundance the 16s rrna otu profile of the nsw and qld water treatment plants were significantly different p 0 0001 and is suggestive of the development of niche microbiomes in response to different treatment and environmental conditions the applicability of next generation sequencing in the water industry is hindered by both the time and the cost required for the large scale assessment that water quality regulations requires the vast array of emerging ngs platforms and available sequencing options however provide accurate real time results that may be coupled to current monitoring strategies for increased accuracy in monitoring bacterial populations hazardous to human health a developing ngs platform that may prove to integrate into current strategies is the minion oxford nanopore technologies which is particularly suited to the nucleic acid sequencing of water sources and portable to allow for in field assessment kerkhof et al 2017 pre treatment including pre oxidation is used to enhance coagulation clarification and subsequently filtration thus the next phase of this study focuses on plants using pre oxidation to evaluate the impact of this pre treatment process to reduce the risk of breakthrough at these critical control points 3 2 assessing the impact of pre treatment processes on breakthrough prevention at critical control points several utilities implement pre oxidation as a measure to prevent breakthrough and accumulation of cyanobacterial cells within treatment plants without conducting process performance studies the second phase of this project focused on assessing pre oxidation efficiency in full scale plants cylindrospermopsis and microcystis were the dominant cyanobacterial genera in the raw water and raw water mixed with the returned sludge supernatant respectively fig 3 a in qld wtp1 diatoms and green algae were also detected in these water samples fig 3a while cylindrospermopsis is a cyanobacterial genera commonly found in this tropical climate zone willis et al 2016 it has been more frequently detected in drinking water sources located in temperate regions during the last two decades sinha et al 2012 hence understanding the fate of cylindrospermopsis in full scale plants is of great interest to a broad group of water professionals worldwide pre ozonation caused complete lysis of 80 5 of cyanobacterial cells while significantly more diatoms and green algae cells survived ozonation fig 3b zamyadi et al 2015b demonstrated that oxidation of mixed species natural bloom samples using 2 mg l ozone and 10 min contact time would cause 46 reduction in total cyanobacterial cell numbers however these authors observed that ozonation efficiency to achieve complete cell lysis is genera dependent with microcystis being the least resistant and aphanizomenon the most resistant genera to ozonation while about 98 5 of cylindrospermopsis cells were removed during the sedimentation process 20 5 of microcystis cells broke through fig 3b in qld wtp1 otu relative abundance analysis confirmed the presence of cyanobacterial orders which included cylindrospermopsis and microcystis notably similar to nsw wtp ngs analysis provided additional information about the presence of microorganisms which were not identified by microscopy fig 3c two additional orders of cyanobacteria and one order of melainabacteria were detected in water samples pre treatment fig 3c otu relative abundance data also confirmed the presence of only microcystis cells suggesting that they may be the only species to broke through the clarification process fig 3c no cells were observed post filtration in this plant anova analysis revealed no significant variance p 0 1840 between treatments suggesting that the treatment train at qld wtp1 was as effective as nsw wtp for removal of total identified microorganisms in qld wtp1 only 10 5 of the remaining cells after pre ozonation were viable fig 4 a this plant was successful in separating the cells within the sedimentation sludge fig 3a and the cells were not reintroduced into the supernatant during water recovery from the sludge pre ozonation and consequent loss of cell viability is credited for successful control of cell accumulation and growth within the recycle stream as over 80 of the cells separated during sedimentation were not viable and did not have the capacity to live and or grow within the water recovery tanks notably nanolive analysis fig 4b demonstrated empty cell structures with complete release of intracellular compounds after oxidation while other cells withheld their intracellular compounds even though they were damaged nanolive analysis provided the first observation of oxidation impact on complete release of intracellular compounds via damaged cell walls coral et al 2013 used scanning electronic microscope to document fate of cyanobacterial cells from natural bloom samples during ozonation these authors demonstrated ozonation 4 mg l with 10 min of contact of microcystis and anabaena cells would cause over 90 cell damage with remaining cells preserving their structure the previously published data combined with results of this study demonstrate the need to understand the phenomena governing oxidation of cells and release of intracellular compounds no toxins or mib were measured in water samples from qld wtp1 however total geosmin concentrations in raw water raw water plus return of sludge supernatant post pre ozonation clarified water from the surface of sedimentation tank filtered water post bac and finished water were 15 9 15 1 8 7 7 6 below detection limit bdl bdl and bdl ng l respectively furthermore 20 6 5 ng l of geosmin was detected accumulating in sedimentation sludge bed samples these data demonstrate that ozonation had an impact on reduction in geosmin concentration however the ultimate barrier against this t o compound was bac which is in agreement with previous studies ho et al 2007 faruqi et al 2018 in qld wtp2 fig 5 a 80 of total cyanobacterial cells were removed using pre oxidation with kmno4 when using traditional methods of quantification ngs methodologies support this conclusion demonstrating a significant variation in total species relative abundance p 0 0268 microcystis was found to be the most resistant to kmno4 oxidation cylindrospermopsis anabaenopsis and planktolyngbya followed similar fate during the oxidation process interestingly total diatoms and green algae resisted oxidation with kmno4 fig 5a however based on ngs sequencing there was no significant difference in resistance of different cyanobacterial species to this form of treatment p 0 1774 furthermore 80 of the cells remaining post pre oxidation with kmno4 were healthy cells fig 5b thus kmno4 contributes more to reduction of total cell numbers than cell damage in a recent study oxidation of cyanobacterial cells using 10 mg l kmno4 inside a thicker led to reduction in total number of cells however remaining cells in the supernatant which was recycled to the head of the treatment train were viable cells producing t o compounds zamyadi et al 2016 no toxins or geosmin were measured in water samples from qld wtp2 however total mib concentrations in raw water raw water post pre oxidation using kmno4 clarified water from the surface of sedimentation tank filtered water and finished water were 12 6 12 9 6 6 6 4 6 8 ng l respectively it is hypothesised that released mib due to cell lysis was adsorbed by pac hence the reduction in mib concentration post addition of pac ahn et al 2007 jeong et al 2017 however the contact time and background organic matter in the water influenced pac adsorption capacity and 6 6 ng l breakthrough into following clarification filtration chlorination processes which did not have the capacity to remove mib zamyadi et al 2015a jeong et al 2017 4 conclusion the following conclusions are drawn from this study combined microscopic taxonomy cell integrity and ngs analysis demonstrated that accumulation and breakthrough of healthy cells and their metabolites can occur in water scum and sludge inside full scale plants without complementary information from these combined methods presence and breakthrough of certain potentially harmful microorganism like melainabacteria would be missed furthermore this study shows that water recovery practices and return of sludge supernatant could influence concentration of the cells at the intake mainly due to accumulation of high cell numbers within clarification sludge combined measurement techniques proved that these cells are viable and able to grow within the plants at the accumulation sites required time to complete ngs analysis and interpret the results is a limiting factor in using this method for rapid management strategies however in combination with other methods it can provide useful information the outcome of this full scale investigation demonstrates that while pre oxidation by ozonation or kmno4 would help to lyse the cells remaining cells post oxidation with kmno4 are viable cells with potential growth capacity in the meantime ozone is proved to be a stronger agent however complete cell lysis doesn t always occur post ozonation as well these conclusions signal specific knowledge gaps as follows currently the phenomena leading to selective accumulation of toxigenic cyanobacteria in treatment plants conditions causing the expression of toxicity and impact of treatment on the microbial communities are poorly understood for example should operation favour oxidation of cyanobacteria in the raw water or spent water sludge causing cell lysis to avoid the accumulation of toxic cyanobacteria inside the treatment processes despite the potential release of toxins what are the main and underlying conditions within physical chemical treatment processes such as clarification and filtration that cause changes in microbial community composition that indirectly favour toxicity once cells are concentrated by these processes acknowledgements this publication was supported by

19034,a wide range of cyanobacterial species and their harmful metabolites are increasingly detected in water bodies worldwide exacerbated by climate change and human activities the resulting bloom conditions represent significant challenges to production of safe drinking water and cost effective water reuse therefore their removal is a priority to ensure public safety while current microscopic taxonomy identification methods provide valuable information about cell numbers during treatment these methods are incapable of providing information about the fate of cells during treatment the objectives of this study were to 1 identify the critical control points for breakthrough and accumulation of cells by investigating the fate of cells during treatment processes using a combination of taxonomy cell integrity and next generation sequencing ngs and 2 assess the impact of pre treatment processes on breakthrough prevention at critical control points and the benefits of cell integrity and ngs analysis for improved management purposes this paper presents the results of an unprecedented cyanobacterial monitoring program conducted in four full scale water treatment plants located in three different climate zones cyanobacterial cell integrity and accumulation during operation process were assessed for the first time using next generation of gene sequencing methods ngs analysis led to detection of cyanobacterial and melainabacteria orders in water samples that were not identified by microscopy 80 5 of cells were completely lysed post pre oxidation for both ozone and potassium permanganate however unlike pre ozonation the remaining cells were undamaged cells with the potential to accumulate and grow within the plants post kmno4 treatment particularly in clarifier sludge to effectively monitor water quality this study presents a synergistic approach coupling new and traditional analytical methods and demonstrates the importance of identifying critical points for managing accumulation of cyanobacteria within plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords cyanobacteria harmful metabolites microscopic taxonomy cell integrity next generation sequencing water treatment 1 introduction a wide range of cyanobacterial species and cell numbers have been frequently detected in water intakes of water treatment plants worldwide chorus and bartram 1999 schmidt et al 2002 zamyadi 2014 the harmful effects resulting from the presence of cyanobacterial cells even in low numbers below 500 cells ml include i production of varying concentrations of cyanotoxins with recorded human health effects such as severe cases of gastro intestinal and skin diseases liver failure and cancer potential links between alzheimer s disease and motor neurone disease mnd and mortalities and ii production of unpleasant taste and odour t o compounds in water leading to customer complaints and dissatisfaction with the aesthetic quality of distributed water chorus and bartram 1999 carmichael et al 2001 hobson et al 2010 holtcamp 2012 bradley et al 2013 zamyadi et al 2016 bishop et al 2017 chernoff et al 2017 climate change and human activities are creating more favourable conditions for cyanobacterial and algal growth wiedner et al 2007 elliott 2012 paerl and paul 2012 climate change impacts to catchments worldwide include increases in water temperature decreases in average rainfall and inflows low water levels in reservoirs and increases in high intensity rainfall events that deliver elevated nutrient and sediment loads elliott 2012 paerl and paul 2012 zamyadi 2014 furthermore significant population growth has led to rapid development of urban and agricultural areas and increased nutrient loads in water stressed regions sood et al 2015 zinicovscaia and cepoi 2016 in combination these impacts are predicted to increase the frequency duration and intensity of harmful cyanobacterial blooms and influence the presence and dominance of different species elliott 2012 paerl and paul 2012 these conditions lead to large variations in the concentration of cyanobacterial cells and their metabolites and the ratio of harmful non harmful cells in water bodies located in different climate zones zamyadi 2014 bowling et al 2016 bishop et al 2017 these variations impact the performance of treatment processes which were designed based upon historic trends in cyanobacterial challenge to the water treatment plant previous studies have demonstrated that the efficiency of treatment barriers for the removal of cyanobacterial and algal cells and their associated metabolites varies depending on the species present kommineni et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2013a recent investigations have revealed the presence of significant concentrations of cyanotoxins and t o compounds in treated water distributed for human consumption at 1 6 to 4 1 times higher than thresholds indicated in drinking water guidelines zamyadi et al 2013a 2016 pazouki et al 2016 hence the breakthrough of cells and their harmful metabolites have led to the temporary shutdown of drinking water production and distribution zamyadi 2014 these incidents are attributed to knowledge gaps in the understanding of the removal mechanism of these cells and their metabolites under varying water conditions within treatment plants kommineni et al 2009 pazouki et al 2016 and consequently the application of inaccurate and or rudimentary treatment design operation and evaluation cyanobacterial and algal blooms can also influence operation of water treatment plants and water recycling streams kommineni et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2013a pazouki et al 2016 for example breakthrough of cells in high numbers 106 107 cells ml world health organisation who highest alert level 105 cells ml have caused disruption of clarification and shorter filter run times chorus and bartram 1999 the breakthrough of cells into filtered water could lead to an increase in filtered water turbidity which is an indicator of breakthrough of other waterborne pathogens that would lead to loss of filtration credit removal water consumption advisory and plant closure kommineni et al 2009 zamyadi et al 2013a pazouki et al 2016 furthermore even in plants with low cell numbers below 500 cells ml at the intake accumulation of cells within certain treatment processes over time could lead to similar treatment problems and malfunctions zamyadi et al 2013b hence harmful cyanobacterial cells represent a significant challenge to the production of safe drinking water and a barrier to cost effective water reuse therefore the accurate and precise detection and removal of cyanobacterial cells is a priority to ensure public safety water recovery from treated wastewater post stabilization tanks or lagoons is a common practice in dry climates however eutrophication related issues were not adequately considered during design and construction of these mainly open systems kommineni et al 2009 martins et al 2011 sood et al 2015 zamyadi et al 2015a zamyadi et al 2016 zinicovscaia and cepoi 2016 thus it has been found that many tanks and lagoons worldwide are prone to cyanobacterial accumulation and growth which challenge the treatment processes designed for purification and reuse of these waters vasconcelos and pereira 2001 zamyadi et al 2016 praptiwi et al 2017 while current microscopic taxonomy identification methods provide valuable information about cell numbers during treatment they are time consuming and require analysis by highly qualified personnel furthermore changes in cell biovolume due to preservation by lugol s iodine solution can introduce measurement bias hawkins et al 2005 awwa 2010 cell count methods do not provide information about cell integrity and cell membrane damage during treatment zamyadi et al 2010 fan et al 2014 the toxigenicity of cyanobacterial blooms and their fate during water treatment cannot be determined based solely upon the identification of taxa by light microscopy coral et al 2013 zamyadi 2014 alternative analysis including cell integrity analytical methods using cell staining and flow cytometry both using batch samples and as an online instrument and next generation sequencing ngs methods can provide complementary information overcoming these limitations xi et al 2011 gumbo et al 2014 chiu et al 2016 lee et al 2017 kim et al 2018 fan et al 2014 however deriving the full benefit of the resulting data requires an understanding of method applicability and uncertainties the presence of harmful or unpleasant cyanobacterial algal metabolites is among the main challenges within our new environmental realities thus the main goal of this study is to investigate the fate of cyanobacterial and algal cells and their potentially harmful metabolites in full scale water treatment plants using a combination of microscopic taxonomy ngs and cell integrity methods the specific objectives of this study were to 1 identify the critical control points for breakthrough and accumulation of cells by investigating the fate of cells during treatment processes using a combination of taxonomy cell integrity and ngs analysis and 2

regions the regions were selected to cover the following climate zones warm temperate mild temperate and humid tropical the water sources included three freshwater reservoirs and one treated wastewater stabilization lagoon system table 1 these plants were selected because they provided the opportunity to study both i accumulation of cells within treatment processes and ii impact of pre treatment focusing on pre oxidation on removal efficiency the wtp in the warm temperate climate zone is located in south australia and labelled sa wtp this is a water reuse plant fed by treated wastewater after the stabilization lagoons and its treated water in used for agricultural and recreational purposes the treatment process in this plant was coagulation using alum and coagulant aid followed by dissolved air flotation filtration daff 13 recycle then chlorination table 1 samples from this plant were taken at the intake raw water post coagulation post clarification using daff and chlorinated water cell counts and cell integrity analysis were undertaken on all samples while samples were taken for ngs analysis at all sampling points ngs analysis were only conducted on selected samples due to project time sensitive milestones the drinking water treatment plant in the mild temperate climate zone is 80 km south of sydney new south wales australia labelled nsw wtp the treatment processes in the plant were pre treatment by addition of powdered activated carbon pac then daff 13 recycle and post chlorination table 1 the spent filter backwash water and daf sludge float in this plant are fed to a gravity thickener lagoon for settling the lagoon supernatant is pumped to the head of the treatment plant prior to any chemical dosing at a ratio of 5 10 of the plants total flow rate samples from this plant were taken at the intake raw water raw water plus supernatant return prior to addition of any reagents daf sludge post clarification filtration using daff and final chlorinated water cell counts cell integrity and ngs analysis were undertaken on these samples in the humid tropical climate zone two full scale drinking water treatment plants were located in south eastern queensland australia labelled qld wtp1 and qld wtp2 in qld wtp1 raw water mixed with returned supernatant from the water recovery lagoon 10 of the plant total flow was pre oxidized using ozone table 1 in this plant the treatment train continues with coagulation using alum sedimentation filtration inter ozonation and biological activated carbon bac followed by chlorination table 1 the returned supernatant comes from a thickener basin fed by sedimentation sludge and the spent filter backwash water in this water samples were taken at raw water post pre ozonation clarified water post sedimentation sludge of sedimentation tank filtered water post bac and treated water in qld wtp2 reservoir water was pre oxidized using potassium permanganate kmno4 followed by addition of pac table 1 the pre treated water then went through coagulation sedimentation filtration and disinfection through chloramination table 1 in this plant water samples were taken at raw water after addition of kmno4 and pac clarified water sludge of clarifier filtered water and treated water the results presented are the average of three sampling events per point within these wtps sampling was conducted when cell numbers at the respective wtp raw water exceeded the particular threshold of 2000 cells ml which is who lowest alert level chorus and bartram 1999 triplicate samples three separate samples were obtained for cell count and microscopic speciation cell integrity analysis dna extraction and sequencing cyanotoxins and t o compounds analysis however due to the limited number of samples allocated to ngs dna extraction and sequencing was undertaken on selected samples 2 2 cell counts microscopic speciation and cellular metabolite analysis algal and cyanobacterial species identification and enumeration on samples 100 ml sample volume preserved in lugol s iodine were conducted using a compound microscope and a sedgewick rafter counting chamber cooperative research centre for freshwater ecology 1999 total organic carbon toc and dissolved organic carbon doc measurements were conducted on an 820 total organic carbon analyser sievers instruments inc measurements of uv absorbance at 254 nm uv 254 were carried out on a uv1201 uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu corp samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters prior to doc and uv analyses water samples 100 ml sample volume for both extracellular and total geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol mib analyses were concentrated using a solid phase micro extraction spme syringe fibre gerstel and analysed on a 7890a gas chromatograph system with 5975c vl series mass selective detector agilent technologies against quantified labelled internal standards ultrafine chemicals graham and hayes 1998 lloyd et al 1998 the detection limits for mib and geosmin were 4 and 2 ng l respectively geosmin and mib were purchased from a commercial supplier ultrafine chemicals and were used for the analytical method a liquid chromatography with

2010 spoof et al 2010 2 3 cell integrity the integrity of cyanobacterial cells in the full scale treatment plants was evaluated 50 ml sample volume using a fluorescein diacetate fda and propidium iodide pi staining method zamyadi et al 2010 and a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer bd oxford uk the fda stock solution 10 g l was prepared by dissolving fda powder sigma aldrich in a reagent grade acetone which was stored at 20 c until use the fda working solution 250 mg l was prepared by adding 25 μl of fda stock solution into 1 ml of acetone the fda working solution was kept under refrigeration and used within 2 h after preparation to minimise degradation xi et al 2011 the pi working solution 50 mg l was prepared by diluting 50 μl of pi solution 1 mg ml sigma aldrich in 1 ml of milli q water and stored at 4 c until use xi et al 2011 a simultaneous staining of the samples as presented by gumbo et al 2014 was performed by adding an aliquot of 20 μl of fda working solution final concentration of 5 0 mg l and 133 μl of pi working solution to 1 ml of sub sample in a 5 ml falcon tube final concentration of 6 7 mg l and incubated at room temperature for 15 min protected from light the stains were excited using an argon laser of 488 nm becton dickinson and company 2012 the fluorescence from fda staining was quantified by the fl 1 detector 533 30 nm and pi fluorescence by the fl 2 detector 585 40 nm the data were expressed as median fluorescence intensity mfi per percentage of positive cells to the marker the measurements were performed using a constant flow rate of 66 μl min as per the manufacturer guidelines the data analyses were conducted using bd accuri c6 software an alternative method to determine the integrity of cells was through the generation of a 3d image by determining the refractive index of the target cell the refractive index of cells which describes the impact of cell medium on light propagation was measured using a nanolive nanolive sa switzerland 3d cell explorer nanolive 2016 this method does not rely on the addition of chemical stains but processes the image based on the refractive index of the cell the water sample was diluted with reverse osmosis water using a dilution ratio of 1 50 in self standing centrifuge tubes followed by 1 min vortex to ensure mixing three ml of diluted sample was then pipetted into a 35 mm glass bottom culture dish fluorodishes wpi fd35 100 nanolive 2016 the sample was then placed into the viewing area of the 3d cell explorer and the microscope was adjusted for scanning the 3d cell explorer scanned the sample and processed the 3d scan using software steve nanolive sa switzerland the digital staining process was conducted through steve nanolive 2016 2 4 next generation sequencing ngs samples 50 ml sample volume for dna extraction were centrifuged for 30 min at 4000 g before environmental genomic dna was isolated from 10 ml of sample of water using the fastdna spinkit for soil and stored at 20 c until use this kit was selected as it is suggested to be more appropriate choice for water samples due to the convenience high yield of dna and reproducibility of microbial community information hwang et al 2012 the dna concentration biomass extracted from each sample was within the range of 10 20 ng μl dna was quantified using nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotomer thermofisher scientific waltham ma usa and quality assessed through pcr amplification of the 16s rrna gene using cyanobacterial specific primers 27fl and 809r jungblut et al 2005 prior to sequencing the hypervariable regions v1 v3 of the 16s rrna gene were amplified using 27f 519r barcoded primers to remove excess nucleotides a clean up pcr was conducted with an addition of 4 μl of exosap mix 0 025 μl exo new england biolabs m0293s 0 25 sap 3 725 μl water afterwards approximately 25 ng were submitted to the ramaciotti centre for genomics unsw australia for miseq sequencing where paired end sequencing was performed on an illumina miseq sequencing platform illumina san diego usa using the miseq reagent kit v2 to generate 300 bp reads per end sequence reads were initially processed using mothur v1 35 1 www mothur org software package schloss et al 2009 unno et al 2015 sequences containing ambiguous bases 200 bp and homopolyers longer than 8 bp were removed before unique sequences were aligned to the silva reference alignment chimeric sequences were removed through uchime before taxonomic identification was performed through comparison to the greengenes reference database balvociute and huson 2017 with a bootstrap minimum of 80 sequences that could not be identified were removed and subsampling was performed at a level of 2915 sequences per sample clustering of operational taxonomic units otus was performed at a 0 03 distance threshold between sequence reads using the average neighbour algorithm schloss and westcott 2011 the identity of each otu defined by this distance threshold was determined from a sequence consensus within a given otu at a confidence threshold of 80 otus from the 16s amplicon data set were classified to phylum and order level at 87 2 and 78 3 confidence respectively the proportion of each otu relative to method internal standard is reported as given ploidy differences between taxa a one to one relationship between cell numbers and otus is unlikely soppa 2017 rarefaction curves were generated using mothur to ensure adequate representation of each water treatment plant had been achieved figure si 2 a one way anova was used to test for differences in abundance and diversity of taxa between each sample site and treatment processes relative abundance and diversity were assessed for variance equality bartlett s test without transformation this procedure was then separately applied to cyanobacteria otus to determine significant differences in cyanobacterial relative abundance post treatment between sample sites to test for significant variation between treatments within sample sites unpaired t tests were performed on transformed data square root these tests were also performed to specifically test for variance in cyanobacteria abundance 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of treatment breakthrough critical control points sa wtp source treated wastewater after the stabilization lagoons is prone to cyanobacterial and algal bloom events whereby 3 2 106 and 2 4 105 cells ml of cyanobacteria and green algae respectively were detected at the water intake table 2 this plant provided the opportunity to monitor the fate of high numbers over 3 106 cells ml of cyanobacterial cells during coagulation clarification processes aphanocapsa was the dominant cyanobacteria genera detected at the intake followed by microcystis the who highest alert level for drinking water sources is 105 cells ml chorus and bartram 1999 however sa wtp is a water recycling facility for non potable reuse nevertheless these high cell numbers concentration of cyanotoxins and t o compounds were below detection limits cause treatment challenges fig 1 a and concerns about using the treated recycled water for agricultural and recreational urban ponds purposes the coagulation process in sa wtp table 1 resulted in the incorporation of 99 8 and 49 5 5 of free aphanocapsa and microcystis cells into flocs respectively fig 1b no free cells from the chlorophyceae class were detected after the coagulation process hence these results demonstrate genera dependence of coagulation performance nevertheless all remaining aphanocapsa and 93 7 of remaining microcystis were captured by the daff process fig 1c only 6 3 of microcystis broke through the filters and no cells were detected post chlorination notably at all times over 95 5 of cells in all samples from raw water to post daff were healthy cells the removal performance observed in sa wtp was similar to previously published monitoring results of full scale plants in temperate regions zamyadi et al 2013a however these results were contrary to laboratory sedimentation jar tests conducted by newcombe et al 2015 which were spiked with cultured cells of dolichospermum circinale microcystis aeruginosa cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in natural water newcombe et al 2015 found that coagulation clarification process performance for cell removal was species independent however their experiments were conducted with cell number one to two orders of magnitude smaller than cell numbers at the intakes of sa wtp and zamyadi et al 2013a during the sampling campaign in the treatment plant located in the mild temperate climate zone nsw wtp while green algae and diatom numbers were very low below 400 cells ml the cyanobacterial cell numbers were above the first who alert level 2000 cells ml at 3400 cells ml fig 2 a comprising mainly of cylindrospermopsis and microcystis this plant provided the opportunity to monitor the fate of low numbers below 5000 cells ml of cyanobacterial cells during coagulation clarification processes recycling the sludge lagoon supernatant to the head of the plant led to a 43 increase of cell numbers to 4900 cells ml prior to treatment within which cylindrospermopsis dominated fig 2a furthermore 80 of the overall cells at this stage were viable healthy cells compared to 50 cell viability rate at the intake prior to recycling fig 2b cell enumeration of the daf sludge showed that there was a transfer of high cylindrospermopsis cell numbers 55 000 cells ml into the sludge lagoons which combined with favourable retention time and growth conditions could have led to cell growth within the lagoons zamyadi et al 2016 praptiwi et al 2017 a possible explanation for the transfer of the healthy cylindrospermopsis cells into the sludge lagoon is that healthy and undamaged cells tend to float near the surface using their gas vesicles awwa 2010 which increases the chance of cells transferring through the outgoing sludge stream from clarification the favourable conditions of the sludge lagoons enable the cyanobacteria cells to accumulate and proliferate although the green algae and diatom species present during this sampling event were subjected to the same favourable accumulation and growth conditions there was limited transfer of these cells into the head of the plant via supernatant return fig 2a healthy cyanobacteria cells dominant the lagoon supernatant as their gas vesicles enhance their buoyancy in nsw wtp based on microscopic cell identification and counts the number of cyanobacterial cells in post daff water samples was below the detection limit however complementary ngs analysis revealed the presence of a cyanobacterial order and a melainabacteria phylum synechococcales and ys2 respectively in the same post daff water samples fig 2c pazouki et al 2016 and zamyadi et al 2013a observed breakthrough of cyanobacteria cells through river bank and dual sand anthracite filter systems respectively in the case of dual filter system in one occasion an increase in filtered water turbidity over threshold limit of 0 3 ntu led to plant closure due to risk of breakthrough of waterborne pathogens the presence of cyanobacterial genera from synechococcales in the marine environment is well studied wang et al 2011 however the existing knowledge about their presence in drinking water sources is limited komárek et al 2014 li and li 2016 ys2 bacterium used to be classified as cyanobacteria but recent genomic studies demonstrated that they do not have photosynthetic capability hence they are now classified as melainabacteria rienzi et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 ys2 bacteria are associated with human and animal faeces and have been detected in human gut rienzi et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 in nsw wtp filtered water turbidity was always below the threshold value cyanobacterial and melainabacteria cell numbers concentration of cyanotoxins and t o compounds were below the detection limit post chlorination the documented detection of fecal contamination indicators and cyanobacteria in the daff water demonstrates that ngs methods provide more accurate monitoring techniques to assess the risk of breakthrough of microorganisms into treated water amplification of 16s rrna has become the standard technique for microbial surveys and community classification and quantification pooling the genomic dna from each treatment plant for analysis allows for cost effective high throughput screening such ngs classification allows for a more in depth analysis of community composition which may be coupled to the data gathered from more traditional techniques such as microscopy accurate assessment of breakthrough risks is vital for implementation of adequate treatment barriers to ensure public health and safety awwa 2010 newcombe et al 2015 the use of ngs as supplemental information helped to elucidate the effectiveness of different treatments and identify critical point at these plants clarification process particularly accumulation of cell in sludge and filtration processes were identified as critical treatment points similar critical control points were identified in qld treatment plants an analysis of the full scale ramifications of the treatment process on biodiversity may elucidate the presence of site and treatment specific biomarkers for the assessment of treatment plant assessment the samples collected from both qld treatment types saw an increase in the enterobacteriales order post treatment steps figure si 3 pre ozonation resulting in 86 31 of otus being enterobacteriales whereas post sedimentation this order accounted for 66 24 of the microbiome the nsw treatment plant saw actinomycetales increase to accounting for 26 42 of the total microbial relative abundance the 16s rrna otu profile of the nsw and qld water treatment plants were significantly different p 0 0001 and is suggestive of the development of niche microbiomes in response to different treatment and environmental conditions the applicability of next generation sequencing in the water industry is hindered by both the time and the cost required for the large scale assessment that water quality regulations requires the vast array of emerging ngs platforms and available sequencing options however provide accurate real time results that may be coupled to current monitoring strategies for increased accuracy in monitoring bacterial populations hazardous to human health a developing ngs platform that may prove to integrate into current strategies is the minion oxford nanopore technologies which is particularly suited to the nucleic acid sequencing of water sources and portable to allow for in field assessment kerkhof et al 2017 pre treatment including pre oxidation is used to enhance coagulation clarification and subsequently filtration thus the next phase of this study focuses on plants using pre oxidation to evaluate the impact of this pre treatment process to reduce the risk of breakthrough at these critical control points 3 2 assessing the impact of pre treatment processes on breakthrough prevention at critical control points several utilities implement pre oxidation as a measure to prevent breakthrough and accumulation of cyanobacterial cells within treatment plants without conducting process performance studies the second phase of this project focused on assessing pre oxidation efficiency in full scale plants cylindrospermopsis and microcystis were the dominant cyanobacterial genera in the raw water and raw water mixed with the returned sludge supernatant respectively fig 3 a in qld wtp1 diatoms and green algae were also detected in these water samples fig 3a while cylindrospermopsis is a cyanobacterial genera commonly found in this tropical climate zone willis et al 2016 it has been more frequently detected in drinking water sources located in temperate regions during the last two decades sinha et al 2012 hence understanding the fate of cylindrospermopsis in full scale plants is of great interest to a broad group of water professionals worldwide pre ozonation caused complete lysis of 80 5 of cyanobacterial cells while significantly more diatoms and green algae cells survived ozonation fig 3b zamyadi et al 2015b demonstrated that oxidation of mixed species natural bloom samples using 2 mg l ozone and 10 min contact time would cause 46 reduction in total cyanobacterial cell numbers however these authors observed that ozonation efficiency to achieve complete cell lysis is genera dependent with microcystis being the least resistant and aphanizomenon the most resistant genera to ozonation while about 98 5 of cylindrospermopsis cells were removed during the sedimentation process 20 5 of microcystis cells broke through fig 3b in qld wtp1 otu relative abundance analysis confirmed the presence of cyanobacterial orders which included cylindrospermopsis and microcystis notably similar to nsw wtp ngs analysis provided additional information about the presence of microorganisms which were not identified by microscopy fig 3c two additional orders of cyanobacteria and one order of melainabacteria were detected in water samples pre treatment fig 3c otu relative abundance data also confirmed the presence of only microcystis cells suggesting that they may be the only species to broke through the clarification process fig 3c no cells were observed post filtration in this plant anova analysis revealed no significant variance p 0 1840 between treatments suggesting that the treatment train at qld wtp1 was as effective as nsw wtp for removal of total identified microorganisms in qld wtp1 only 10 5 of the remaining cells after pre ozonation were viable fig 4 a this plant was successful in separating the cells within the sedimentation sludge fig 3a and the cells were not reintroduced into the supernatant during water recovery from the sludge pre ozonation and consequent loss of cell viability is credited for successful control of cell accumulation and growth within the recycle stream as over 80 of the cells separated during sedimentation were not viable and did not have the capacity to live and or grow within the water recovery tanks notably nanolive analysis fig 4b demonstrated empty cell structures with complete release of intracellular compounds after oxidation while other cells withheld their intracellular compounds even though they were damaged nanolive analysis provided the first observation of oxidation impact on complete release of intracellular compounds via damaged cell walls coral et al 2013 used scanning electronic microscope to document fate of cyanobacterial cells from natural bloom samples during ozonation these authors demonstrated ozonation 4 mg l with 10 min of contact of microcystis and anabaena cells would cause over 90 cell damage with remaining cells preserving their structure the previously published data combined with results of this study demonstrate the need to understand the phenomena governing oxidation of cells and release of intracellular compounds no toxins or mib were measured in water samples from qld wtp1 however total geosmin concentrations in raw water raw water plus return of sludge supernatant post pre ozonation clarified water from the surface of sedimentation tank filtered water post bac and finished water were 15 9 15 1 8 7 7 6 below detection limit bdl bdl and bdl ng l respectively furthermore 20 6 5 ng l of geosmin was detected accumulating in sedimentation sludge bed samples these data demonstrate that ozonation had an impact on reduction in geosmin concentration however the ultimate barrier against this t o compound was bac which is in agreement with previous studies ho et al 2007 faruqi et al 2018 in qld wtp2 fig 5 a 80 of total cyanobacterial cells were removed using pre oxidation with kmno4 when using traditional methods of quantification ngs methodologies support this conclusion demonstrating a significant variation in total species relative abundance p 0 0268 microcystis was found to be the most resistant to kmno4 oxidation cylindrospermopsis anabaenopsis and planktolyngbya followed similar fate during the oxidation process interestingly total diatoms and green algae resisted oxidation with kmno4 fig 5a however based on ngs sequencing there was no significant difference in resistance of different cyanobacterial species to this form of treatment p 0 1774 furthermore 80 of the cells remaining post pre oxidation with kmno4 were healthy cells fig 5b thus kmno4 contributes more to reduction of total cell numbers than cell damage in a recent study oxidation of cyanobacterial cells using 10 mg l kmno4 inside a thicker led to reduction in total number of cells however remaining cells in the supernatant which was recycled to the head of the treatment train were viable cells producing t o compounds zamyadi et al 2016 no toxins or geosmin were measured in water samples from qld wtp2 however total mib concentrations in raw water raw water post pre oxidation using kmno4 clarified water from the surface of sedimentation tank filtered water and finished water were 12 6 12 9 6 6 6 4 6 8 ng l respectively it is hypothesised that released mib due to cell lysis was adsorbed by pac hence the reduction in mib concentration post addition of pac ahn et al 2007 jeong et al 2017 however the contact time and background organic matter in the water influenced pac adsorption capacity and 6 6 ng l breakthrough into following clarification filtration chlorination processes which did not have the capacity to remove mib zamyadi et al 2015a jeong et al 2017 4 conclusion the following conclusions are drawn from this study combined microscopic taxonomy cell integrity and ngs analysis demonstrated that accumulation and breakthrough of healthy cells and their metabolites can occur in water scum and sludge inside full scale plants without complementary information from these combined methods presence and breakthrough of certain potentially harmful microorganism like melainabacteria would be missed furthermore this study shows that water recovery practices and return of sludge supernatant could influence concentration of the cells at the intake mainly due to accumulation of high cell numbers within clarification sludge combined measurement techniques proved that these cells are viable and able to grow within the plants at the accumulation sites required time to complete ngs analysis and interpret the results is a limiting factor in using this method for rapid management strategies however in combination with other methods it can provide useful information the outcome of this full scale investigation demonstrates that while pre oxidation by ozonation or kmno4 would help to lyse the cells remaining cells post oxidation with kmno4 are viable cells with potential growth capacity in the meantime ozone is proved to be a stronger agent however complete cell lysis doesn t always occur post ozonation as well these conclusions signal specific knowledge gaps as follows currently the phenomena leading to selective accumulation of toxigenic cyanobacteria in treatment plants conditions causing the expression of toxicity and impact of treatment on the microbial communities are poorly understood for example should operation favour oxidation of cyanobacteria in the raw water or spent water sludge causing cell lysis to avoid the accumulation of toxic cyanobacteria inside the treatment processes despite the potential release of toxins what are the main and underlying conditions within physical chemical treatment processes such as clarification and filtration that cause changes in microbial community composition that indirectly favour toxicity once cells are concentrated by these processes acknowledgements this publication was supported by
