4410,characterizing soil moisture sm dynamics is a prerequisite for implementing sustainable vegetation restoration on the loess plateau lp of china however quantifying sm variation both spatially and temporally remains a challenge due to various driving factors and the complexity of land surface processes this study was designed to investigate the magnitude and trends of sm variation due to vegetation restoration in soil profiles at the regional scale using earth system reanalysis data and the community land model clm the results indicated that the surface layer sm had positive responses to vegetation restoration while the sm in the subsurface and deeper soil layers had negative responses the area averaged annual mean sm under vegetated condition in 2015 lc2015 was less than that in 2000 lc2000 with a magnitude of 11 7 mm spatially almost the whole lp region exhibited decreased sm in the 100 289 cm layer in the lc2015 simulation and significant differences were detected on the southeastern lp where the forest coverage clearly increased from 2000 to 2015 with the decreased annual mean sm ranging from 20 to 40 mm these differences were also reflected in the seasonal sm showing that sm in the 100 289 cm layer in the lc2015 simulation was less than that in the lc2000 simulation with significant differences of 11 5 mm 11 7 mm 11 9 mm and 11 7 mm for spring summer autumn and winter respectively p 0 05 notably the temporal variabilities in sm in both the lc2000 and lc2015 simulations showed a decreasing trend during the simulation period and the decreasing magnitudes increased as the soil depth increased the largest decreasing gradient was approximately 2 1 mm year in the 100 289 cm layer these findings implied that vegetation restoration on the lp led to a significant reduction in sm that was difficult to replenish by local precipitation and in turn had negative effects on plant growth and water resources keywords modeling vegetation restoration soil moisture soil profile sensitivity experiment 1 introduction soil moisture sm is an essential component of plant growth and plays an important role in sustainable ecological development deng et al 2016 fang et al 2016 yang et al 2014a however sm is highly variable spatiotemporally and quantitative identification of sm at the regional scale remains a challenge due to various driving factors and the complexity of land surface process mccoll et al 2017 vegetation cover a main land surface parameter may directly and indirectly modulate sm storage and distribution in terrestrial ecosystems by intercepting precipitation and controlling canopy evapotranspiration detto et al 2006 liancourt et al 2012 saleh et al 2006 yilmaz et al 2019 determining the influence of vegetation cover on dynamic changes in sm not only helps identify targets for ecological water requirements but is also an essential task of the hydrological sciences the loess plateau lp of china is a very fragile ecosystem on which a series of ecological restoration programs have been implemented fu et al 2017 the largest vegetation restoration project in the lp region called the grain for green program gfgp was launched by the chinese government in 1999 to reverse the deteriorating ecological environment and control soil erosion by converting sloping cropland into forest shrubland and grassland in 15 years the lp became dramatically greener and the vegetation coverage approximately doubled from 1999 to 2013 chen et al 2015 inevitably changing the ecosystem structure and function of this region the subsequent ecological outcomes associated with biophysical properties of the land surface and the effectiveness of large proportions of vegetation restoration have received great attention in geographical and ecological research communities bennett 2008 cao et al 2016 feng et al 2016 the positive effects of vegetation restoration on sm have been reported and the increased vegetation canopy has benefitted sm accumulation because canopy shadows have decreased land surface temperature and ground evaporation wang et al 2018 ye et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 however many studies have found that vegetation restoration has a negative effect on sm on the lp for example artificial afforestation consumes much more soil water than natural afforestation cao et al 2016 yang et al 2012b recent studies have also reported that large scale reforestation in water limited regions may cause soil desiccation deng et al 2016 jia et al 2015 and groundwater storage reduction gao et al 2015 such impacts vary by plant species and further lead to spatiotemporal heterogeneity of sm on the lp jia et al 2017 yang et al 2012a more importantly small old trees have been discovered in some regions which has been attributed to increased sm shortages there is no doubt that these changes in turn constrain vegetation productivity on the lp obviously the effectiveness of vegetation restoration mainly depends on vegetation types and available water resources yang et al 2014b therefore quantification of dynamic changes in sm in the revegetation implementation process at a regional scale is a prerequisite for evaluating the suitability and sustainability of vegetation restoration on the lp in past decades researches have sufficiently confirmed that forests can increase canopy interception and root zone soil water uptake cao et al 2016 sankaran et al 2005 however cropland experiences more evapotranspiration et than forest and grassland when the water supply is sufficient in spring and summer boisier et al 2012 wang et al 2009 some studies have shown that land use conversion causes sm competition among different species of vegetation feng et al 2016 previous studies have mainly focused on exploring the response mechanism of sm to vegetation restoration and the resulting knowledge has been obtained from short term observations as a result long term sm variability at the regional scale is still unclear particularly in deep soil layers due to limited representative sites and complicated land surface processes menz et al 2013 although remote sensing is able to monitor large scale sm dynamics bulut et al 2019 oozeer et al 2020 it has difficulty in accurately expressing the interaction between vegetation dynamics and root zone soil moisture hirschi et al 2014 jiao et al 2016 shin and mohanty 2013 nonetheless it is imperative to quantify the biophysical effects on sm associated with vegetation restoration at the regional scale especially in the root zone to properly understand how sm dynamics respond to current ecological restoration strategies multiple impact factors including vegetation coverage moisture states and many atmospheric forcing fields must be considered first and only then can the effect of vegetation restoration on sm dynamics be extracted to provide valuable insights into ecological policy making recently remote sensing techniques combined with earth system models have been widely applied to explore the response of land surface parameters to anthropogenic forcing anav et al 2013 fisher et al 2018 in this study we combine reanalysis data and the clm to quantify the response of sm to vegetation restoration on the lp the specific objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the performance of the clm for sm estimations in the lp region of china 2 quantitatively identify the spatiotemporal variations in sm under different land cover types using sensitivity simulation experiments and 3 investigate whether deep sm dynamics are different from sm in the upper layer of the soil profile under the influence of vegetation restoration this study was conducted to better understand the potential consequences of vegetation restoration on sm and to provide insights into the feasibility of large scale planning for vegetation restoration in the lp region 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description version 4 0 of the clm clm4 0 hereafter referred to simply as the clm coupled with version 1 2 of the community earth system model cesm1 2 was adopted in this study clm4 0 is developed by the national center for atmospheric research ncar and has been widely tested in different regions for ecological processes kim and mohanty 2016 li et al 2019 sun et al 2016 the land surface processes modeled by the clm include energy exchange among the atmosphere land and vegetation the land surface water cycle and stomatal physiology and photosynthesis of vegetation the clm represents the vegetation structure using plant functional types pfts which are characterized in terms of foliage projective cover fpc and leaf area index lai seventeen pfts are defined in the model that differ in leaf optical properties root profile stomatal physiology roughness length height and biomass each grid cell in the clm can contain multiple pfts to describe vegetation cover heterogeneity and the sum of the fpc for multiple pfts is 100 the soil has fifteen

surface runoff gradient diffusion gravity canopy transpiration through root extraction and interactions with groundwater additional information about the model can be found in technical documentation oleson et al 2010 2 2 data sources the historical spatiotemporal change in sm during 1981 2018 in the lp region was investigated using the era5 land reanalysis product mu√±oz sabater et al 2021 which combines historical observations into advanced modeling and data assimilation systems to provide a consistent view of global land surface and water resource estimates the quality of the era5 land reanalysis project was widely assessed by comparing it to site observations satellite based products and other reanalysis datasets chen and yuan 2020 cheng et al 2019 yang et al 2021 era5 land provides sm estimates of four soil profiles including depth intervals of 0 7 7 28 28 100 and 100 289 cm and the data have a latitude longitude grid of 0 1 0 1 with a monthly time step the qian et al 2004 atmospheric forcing data during 1972 2004 was employed in this study to run the clm this dataset was selected because it was developed by the national center for atmospheric research ncar and extensively validated by many studies globally a land cover product with a resolution of 300 m from the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci land cover project http www esa landcover cci org combines the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis derived lai product mod15a2h version 6 https lpdaac usgs gov products mod15a2hv006 to estimate fpc distribution of each pft in the lp region for 2000 and 2015 the mod15a2h is an 8 day composite dataset with a spatial resolution of 500 m and the common maximum value composite mvc method was used to obtain the monthly lai of each pft 2 3 experimental designs to assess the effect of vegetation restoration on soil moisture dynamics two numerical simulation experiments were designed a control experiment using vegetated cover conditions from the year 2000 hereafter referred to as lc2000 and a sensitivity experiment representing vegetation restoration conditions in the year 2015 hereafter referred to as lc2015 all simulations used offline mode which means that the land component of the coupled system was forced by a prescribed data set of atmospheric fluxes and states and the initial conditions of greenhouse gases were held at the year 2000 value with an atmospheric co2 of 367 ppm two simulations were driven by qian atmospheric forcing data from 1972 to 2004 and ran 99 years through three repetitive cycles of forcing data the first two cycles were considered the spin up period to ensure that land surface conditions reached equilibrium especially for sm in the soil profile and the results were analyzed using the third cycle of the last 33 years of simulation to assess the sensitivity of sm to vegetation restoration all drivers other than vegetation cover were identical between simulations and the only effect of vegetation restoration on sm was expressed as the differences between lc2015 and lc2000 2 4 model performance evaluation and data analysis a linear regression analysis was adopted in sm dynamics detection and the slope of the linear regression was used to quantify the trend of the sm change in different soil layers the t test was used to detect the statistically significance of the trend to investigate the regional difference between sensitivity experiments regional analyses were performed annually and in all seasons and t tests were performed on each grid cell to identify the statistically significant difference a 10 year era5 land dataset from 1995 to 2004 was used to evaluate the clm simulation performance on sm in the three soil layers 0 7 7 100 and 100 289 cm and three statistics including coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and percent bias pbias were used to evaluate the model performance numerically in each grid on the lp these statistics provided different forms of information regarding the model accuracy the r2 value is calculated to estimate the linear association between the simulated and observed values the rmse is applied to examine deviations between simulations and observations sanikhani et al 2019 and the pbias measures the average deviation of simulated outputs from observed values neupane and kumar 2015 3 results 3 1 regional trends in vegetation cover and sm with the implementation of the gfgp the vegetation coverage visibly changed and the coverage differences in the main vegetation types between 2000 and 2015 are shown in fig 1 the forest coverage evidently increased on the lp mainly on the southeastern lp with an increased magnitude from 10 to 20 compared with 2015 fig 1a shrubland remained stable from 2000 to 2015 and only a small proportion of the region on the southern edge of the lp displayed an increase fig 1b there was a general increase in grassland coverage on the lp and a larger increase occurred in north the central part of the region with an increased magnitude of approximately 25 35 fig 1c in contrast crop coverage clearly decreased on the lp and the largest decreases with a magnitude of 30 occurred on the northern lp fig 1d from 1981 to 2018 the area averaged annual sm at 0 7 7 100 and 100 289 cm in the lp region showed significant decreasing trends p 0 01 while the slopes of the long term linear trend were relatively small with magnitudes of 0 04 0 59 and 1 85 mm year for the 0 7 7 100 and 100 289 cm soil layers respectively fig 2 as a result sm in the top 289 cm exhibited a significant decreasing trend with a magnitude of 2 48 mm year fig 2j notably the whole region did not display the same trend because the sm distribution on the lp was spatially heterogeneous with lower sm on the northwestern lp and higher sm on the southeastern lp fig 2b e and h the area averaged annual trend masked evident spatial variability on the northwestern lp increasing trends were observed in the three soil layers although the trends were not statistically significant as the soil depth increased the area exhibiting an increasing trend diminished while the magnitudes of the increasing trend became larger the largest value was greater than 0 8 mm year in the 100 289 mm soil layer fig 2i nonetheless most parts of the lp displayed a decreasing trend with the largest magnitudes in the 100 289 mm soil layer exceeding 2 4 mm year on the southeastern lp within the top 289 cm of soil sm decreased significantly in most parts of the northeastern lp with decreased magnitudes ranging from 7 8 to 9 0 mm year fig 2l 3 2 model performance compared with era5 land data the clm performed well in capturing dominant spatial sm features showing that the mean annual sm in the three soil layers was high on the southeastern lp and low on the northwestern lp during the time period of 1995 2004 fig 3 the r2 values in the three soil layers exceeded 0 5 for entire lp region fig 4 a e and i and the eastern lp had higher r2 although the pattern of rmse increased with soil depth increase fig 4b f and j the calculated pbias for three soil layers were 20 fig 4c g and k suggesting that the model performance was acceptable in terms of the area averaged monthly sm some inconsistent features were observed in the simulated time series compared with corresponding era5 land datasets mainly because simulated data had less fluctuation than observed datasets indicating that the model did not capture some peak and low values well fig 4d and h the time series of the monthly value fluctuated correlatively with the era5 land data series with r2 values of 0 77 0 70 and 0 79 for the 0 7 7 100 and 100 289 cm layers respectively although the largest simulation differences occurred in the 7 100 cm soil layer an acceptable rmse of 14 36 was calculated between the simulated and observed time series data fig 4h overall the simulated sm not only matched well with dynamic spatial pattern of sm on the lp but also was consistent with time series of area averaged sm in the whole region 3 3 sm change due to vegetation restoration the comparison of the area averaged annual sm in the top 289 cm between lc2000 and lc2015 is shown in fig 5 sm in both lc2000 and lc2015 clearly fluctuated in the top layers of 0 7 and 7 100 cm and the annual time series of sm did not show clear differences between the two simulations however the fluctuations in the annual change decreased in the 100 289 cm soil layer and sm was lower in lc2015 than in lc2000 indicating that more sm was consumed in this soil layer in lc2015 fig 5c consequently the area averaged annual mean sm in lc2015 was less than that in lc2000 with a value of 11 7 mm table 1 notably the temporal variabilities in sm in both lc2000 and lc2015 showed a decreasing trend during the simulation period and the decreasing magnitudes increased as the soil depth increased and the largest rate of decrease was approximately 2 1 mm year in 100 289 cm soil layer to further investigate the spatial difference in the responses of sm to vegetation restoration the annual mean sm between lc2015 and lc2000 was compared in fig 6 only minor difference in sm distribution between lc2000 and lc2015 were identified in the top 100 cm soil layer on the southeastern part of the lp however almost the whole lp region exhibited decreased sm in lc2015 in the 100 289 cm layer and significant differences were detected on the southeastern lp where sm in lc2015 was less than that in lc2000 with a reduction in magnitude ranging from 20 to 40 mm fig 6i therefore the sm decrease in the 100 289 cm layer mainly accounted for the sm decrease in the top 289 cm on the lp fig 6l seasonally sm varied in different soil layers table 1 in the top layer of 0 7 cm sm in both lc2000 and lc2015 increased from 15 mm in spring to approximately 17 mm in autumn and then decreased to 16 mm in autumn in the 7 100 cm layer sm in the two simulations decreased from spring 234 mm to autumn 251 mm and then increased again there were no evident spatial differences in the four seasons between lc2015 and lc2000 in the 0 7 and 7 100 cm soil layers fig 7 however in the 100 289 cm layer the seasonal pattern of sm in both experiments was different from that in the top layer exhibiting relatively stable sm in the four seasons moreover seasonal sm in the 100 289 cm layer in lc2015 was less than that in lc2000 with differences of 11 5 mm 11 7 mm 11 9 mm and 11 7 mm for spring summer autumn and winter respectively and the statistically significant differences were mainly detected on the eastern lp p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture variation and model performance based on the era5 land reanalysis dataset the area averaged annual sm in the top 289 cm exhibited a significant decreasing trend p 0 01 with a gradient of 2 5 mm year from 1981 to 2018 many previous studies also reported that the sm on the lp showed decreasing trend particularly since implementation of vegetation restoration chen et al 2007 jia et al 2017 wang et al 2011 yang et al 2014b we also found that the decreased magnitudes varied among different soil layers exhibiting accelerated trends with soil depth increase which were consistent with both field deng et al 2016 and satellite observations feng et al 2017 although soil moisture variation has been investigated by many studies observational results commonly incorporate multiple factors and it remains difficult to determine the magnitude of sm change caused by a typical driving factor due to the complex interactions between sm and environmental factors to explore whether the decrease in sm on the lp was attributed to vegetation restoration on the lp we attempted to quantify the sole effect of vegetation restoration on sm change in the different soil profiles using sensitivity simulation experiments for this purpose the clm performance of the sm simulation in the lp region was assessed first although using ground truth measurements is the best way to evaluate model performance for the lp region with an area of 6 4 105 km2 accurate and extensive in situ measurements are scarce in situ measurements normally represent soil moisture dynamics over a single point while the soil moisture can evolve in a different way in heterogeneous areas thus it is unreasonable to compare area averaged representative values with model outputs at their typical resolutions fortunately a highly validated era5 land reanalysis dataset provide options for complementing scarce observation data era5 land dataset provides sm estimates of four soil profiles including depth intervals of 0 7 7 28 28 100 and 100 289 cm however clm simulates the sm in ten different soil layers on the top 289 cm including 0 71 2 79 6 23 11 89 21 22 36 61 61 98 103 80 172 76 and 286 46 cm to compare the simulated sm with era5 land data in the same soil profile for validating the simulation results we summed the sm in the depth of 6 23 11 89 21 22 36 61 61 98 103 80 cm to express the total sm amount in 7 100 cm the evaluation results showed that the clm not only well reflected the sm spatial pattern which exhibited a decrease from southeast to northwest but also captured the monthly sm distributions in the 0 7 7 100 and 100 289 cm soil layers which increase the confidence for identifying the soil moisture change due to vegetation restoration using sensitivity simulation experiment 4 2 sm change in the upper 100 cm of soil due to vegetation restoration the control experiments and sensitivity simulation experiment that represent different vegetation coverages in the lp region were driven by the same atmospheric forcing data sm in the top 100 cm did not have clear responses to vegetation restoration exhibiting a similar sm amount over time compared with the control experiment to explain the weak response of sm to vegetation restoration in the upper soil layer the clm outputted sm in the 7 21 21 62 and 62 100 cm layers were further analyzed we found that the pattern of sm change due to vegetation restoration in the 7 21 cm soil layer was very similar to those in the 21 62 cm soil layer showing larger sm in lc2015 compared with sm in lc2000 fig 8 while this pattern was reversed in 62 100 cm soil layer indicating sm decreased in 62 100 cm soil layer with vegetation coverage change from 2000 to 2015 thus the positive responses of sm to vegetation restoration in the 7 21 and 21 62 cm soil layer were offset by a negative response in the 62 100 cm soil layer leading to the weak change of total soil moisture in the top 100 cm fig 5b spatially significantly positive responses of sm to vegetation restoration were found in the northwestern lp where grass cover increased fig 9 c and f while the significantly negative responses were observed in eastern lp where large scale afforestation occurred fig 9i a possible explanation for these different responses is that direct ground evaporation is constrained to the upper soil layers because increased shade from canopy cover and forest floor litter associated with vegetation restoration resulted in less light penetration and lower soil temperature morecroft et al 1998 however in the subsurface soil layer vegetation consumed more water to meet its transpiration demand due to its deep and developed rooting systems which combined with reduced soil water infiltration by increased canopy interception leading to decreased sm jian et al 2015 additionally we found that the temporal variability of sm was similar to the temporal variability of precipitation in atmospheric forcing data fig 5 and fig 10 a because sm in the top surface layer quickly responded to precipitation yang et al 2012a thus the hydrological effect resulting from increased vegetation coverage was probably masked by the impacts of precipitation in the soil surface layer pitman et al 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 local precipitation is the main source of sm in the lp region some studies showed that the response of sm to precipitation in semiarid areas varied by soil depth and the infiltration depth of precipitation in the loessial soil hardly reaches 100 cm jia et al 2017 yang et al 2012a consequently infiltration of precipitation in the surface soil layer compensated for the increase in water uptake by vegetation and resulted in weak impact on soil moisture li et al 2018 4 3 sm change in the deeper soil profiles due to vegetation restoration in the deep layer of 100 289 cm the sm clearly decreased in the vegetation restoration experiment dense vegetation with high productivity consumes too much water stored in deep layers jia and shao 2014 yang et al 2012a and the forests in the region have higher water loss from et which is hardly recharged by precipitation jian et al 2015 nonetheless our results revealed that sm in both the control experiment and restoration experiment exhibited significant decreasing trends p 0 01 probably because transpiration increased with plant growth chen et al 2007 additionally seasonal variation in sm due to vegetation restoration was almost consistent in all seasons because sm was relatively stable in different seasons in the 100 289 cm soil layer in the same simulation experiment these findings support previous studies based on long term observations which show that there are no significant seasonal changes in sm in the deep soil layer in the lp region yang et al 2014a 2014b mainly because the sm amount in deep soil layers was diminished due to fewer rainfall replenishes spatially the decrease occurred throughout the region and was especially significant on the central and eastern lp partly because forest coverage evidently increased on the southeastern lp and woody species could consume more soil water via evapotranspiration than natural grass and crops cao et al 2009 jian et al 2015 another possible reason for this effect might be related to the coupling effect of precipitation change and vegetation restoration the precipitation component used in the atmospheric forcing dataset showed that an overall decreasing trend of precipitation was observed throughout the lp region fig 10a and was particularly evident in the eastern part of the lp fig 10d and the downward trend of sm due to vegetation restoration may have been intensified under decreased precipitation this in turn had negative effects on vegetation growth because sm below the surface layers was an important water source for introduced vegetation in the initial years fang et al 2016 yang et al 2014b this inevitably threatens ecosystem health and results in ecosystem degradation jin et al 2011 suggest that reforestation may be sustainable when precipitation exceeds 617 mm however the precipitation on the eastern lp is approximately 550 mm fig 10c which could not support the water consumption of plant in the long term due to the large area and high density of vegetation feng et al 2016 and zhang et al 2018 reported the current vegetation cover on the loess plateau is approaching or may have exceeded the sustainable water resource limits moreover evidence from the pollen record shows that the lp region has been covered by grassland during the holocene epoch with more monsoon precipitation jiang and ding 2005 therefore the feasibility of vegetation restoration should not only consider the interactions between sm and precipitation but also select reasonable plant species and planting density 4 4 uncertainties although our quantitative evaluation highlighted the sm reduction in subsurface and deeper soil layer due to vegetation restoration the results are likely model dependent first we used historical atmospheric forcing data 1972 2004 for clm to identify the impact of vegetation restoration on the spatiotemporal change of sm on the lp which meaning boundary conditions did not respond to climate change in the future this suggested that our results might incapably illustrate the impact of further restoration under climate change if the climate on the loess plateau suffers from large changes due to global warming second land cover in clm is described via fractional cover of pfts and the parametrization is uniform for a specific pft while the newly introduced vegetation on the lp includes black locust robinia pseudoacacia linn chinese pine pinus tabuliformis carr korshinsk peashrub caragana korshinskill kom and sea buckthorn hippophae rhamnoides linn and their phenology and physiology might not be accurately represented in the parametrization of the pft leading to the discrepancies between the simulation and the reality third the sensitivity simulation conducted in this study only considered natural succession of vegetation which is another potential source of uncertainty because management is also an important aspect of conducting vegetation restoration 5 conclusions in this study we quantified the spatiotemporal responses of sm to vegetation restoration on the lp in china sm in the surface layer had positive responses to vegetation restoration which was offset by the negative responses of sm in the subsurface soil layer above 100 cm thus the total sm in the top 100 cm had weak change due to vegetation restoration however sm in the 100 289 cm soil layer was significantly affected by vegetation restoration exhibiting a decreasing trend particularly on the southeastern lp where the forest coverage clearly increased additionally there were no clear seasonal changes associated with vegetation restoration which implied that the sm decline resulting from vegetation restoration occurred in all seasons regardless of how precipitation was distributed on the lp therefore to ensure sustainable ecological restoration future work should investigate water cycle components such as canopy interception and et to understand hydrological process

4410,characterizing soil moisture sm dynamics is a prerequisite for implementing sustainable vegetation restoration on the loess plateau lp of china however quantifying sm variation both spatially and temporally remains a challenge due to various driving factors and the complexity of land surface processes this study was designed to investigate the magnitude and trends of sm variation due to vegetation restoration in soil profiles at the regional scale using earth system reanalysis data and the community land model clm the results indicated that the surface layer sm had positive responses to vegetation restoration while the sm in the subsurface and deeper soil layers had negative responses the area averaged annual mean sm under vegetated condition in 2015 lc2015 was less than that in 2000 lc2000 with a magnitude of 11 7 mm spatially almost the whole lp region exhibited decreased sm in the 100 289 cm layer in the lc2015 simulation and significant differences were detected on the southeastern lp where the forest coverage clearly increased from 2000 to 2015 with the decreased annual mean sm ranging from 20 to 40 mm these differences were also reflected in the seasonal sm showing that sm in the 100 289 cm layer in the lc2015 simulation was less than that in the lc2000 simulation with significant differences of 11 5 mm 11 7 mm 11 9 mm and 11 7 mm for spring summer autumn and winter respectively p 0 05 notably the temporal variabilities in sm in both the lc2000 and lc2015 simulations showed a decreasing trend during the simulation period and the decreasing magnitudes increased as the soil depth increased the largest decreasing gradient was approximately 2 1 mm year in the 100 289 cm layer these findings implied that vegetation restoration on the lp led to a significant reduction in sm that was difficult to replenish by local precipitation and in turn had negative effects on plant growth and water resources keywords modeling vegetation restoration

restoration has a negative effect on sm on the lp for example artificial afforestation consumes much more soil water than natural afforestation cao et al 2016 yang et al 2012b recent studies have also reported that large scale reforestation in water limited regions may cause soil desiccation deng et al 2016 jia et al 2015 and groundwater storage reduction gao et al 2015 such impacts vary by plant species and further lead to spatiotemporal heterogeneity of sm on the lp jia et al 2017 yang et al 2012a more importantly small old trees have been discovered in some regions which has been attributed to increased sm shortages there is no doubt that these changes in turn constrain vegetation productivity on the lp obviously the effectiveness of vegetation restoration mainly depends on vegetation types and available water resources yang et al 2014b therefore quantification of dynamic changes in sm in the revegetation implementation process at a regional scale is a prerequisite for evaluating the suitability and sustainability of vegetation restoration on the lp in past decades researches have sufficiently confirmed that forests can increase canopy interception and root zone soil water uptake cao et al 2016 sankaran et al 2005 however cropland experiences more evapotranspiration et than forest and grassland when the water supply is sufficient in spring and summer boisier et al 2012 wang et al 2009 some studies have shown that land use conversion causes sm competition among different species of vegetation feng et al 2016 previous studies have mainly focused on exploring the response mechanism of sm to vegetation restoration and the resulting knowledge has been obtained from short term observations as a result long term sm variability at the regional scale is still unclear particularly in deep soil layers due to limited representative sites and complicated land surface processes menz et al 2013 although remote sensing is able to monitor large scale sm dynamics bulut et al 2019 oozeer et al 2020 it has difficulty in accurately expressing the interaction between vegetation dynamics and root zone soil moisture hirschi et al 2014 jiao et al 2016 shin and mohanty 2013 nonetheless it is imperative to quantify the biophysical effects on sm associated with vegetation restoration at the regional scale especially in the root zone to properly understand how sm dynamics respond to current ecological restoration strategies multiple impact factors including vegetation coverage moisture states and many atmospheric forcing fields must be considered first and only then can the effect of vegetation restoration on sm dynamics be extracted to provide valuable insights into ecological policy making recently remote sensing techniques combined with earth system models have been widely applied to explore the response of land surface parameters to anthropogenic forcing anav et al 2013 fisher et al 2018 in this study we combine reanalysis data and the clm to quantify the response of sm to vegetation restoration on the lp the specific objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the performance of the clm for sm estimations in the lp region of china 2 quantitatively identify the spatiotemporal variations in sm under different land cover types using sensitivity simulation experiments and 3 investigate whether deep sm dynamics are different from sm in the upper layer of the soil profile under the influence of vegetation restoration this study was conducted to better understand the potential consequences of vegetation restoration on sm and to provide insights into the feasibility of large scale planning for vegetation restoration in the lp region 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description version 4 0 of the clm clm4 0 hereafter referred to simply as the clm coupled with version 1 2 of the community earth system model cesm1 2 was adopted in this study clm4 0 is developed by the national center for atmospheric research ncar and has been widely tested in different regions for ecological processes kim and mohanty 2016 li et al 2019 sun et al 2016 the land surface processes modeled by the clm include energy exchange among the atmosphere land and vegetation the land surface water cycle and stomatal physiology and photosynthesis of vegetation the clm represents the vegetation structure using plant functional types pfts which are characterized in terms of foliage projective cover fpc and leaf area index lai seventeen pfts are defined in the model that differ in leaf optical properties root profile stomatal physiology

oleson et al 2010 2 2 data sources the historical spatiotemporal change in sm during 1981 2018 in the lp region was investigated using the era5 land reanalysis product mu√±oz sabater et al 2021 which combines historical observations into advanced modeling and data assimilation systems to provide a consistent view of global land surface and water resource estimates the quality of the era5 land reanalysis project was widely assessed by comparing it to site observations satellite based products and other reanalysis datasets chen and yuan 2020 cheng et al 2019 yang et al 2021 era5 land provides sm estimates of four soil profiles including depth intervals of 0 7 7 28 28 100 and 100 289 cm and the data have a latitude longitude grid of 0 1 0 1 with a monthly time step the qian et al 2004 atmospheric forcing data during 1972 2004 was employed in this study to run the clm this dataset was selected because it was developed by the national center for atmospheric research ncar and extensively validated by many studies globally a land cover product with a resolution of 300 m from the european space agency esa climate change initiative cci land cover project http www esa landcover cci org combines the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis derived lai product mod15a2h version 6 https lpdaac usgs gov products mod15a2hv006 to estimate fpc distribution of each pft in the lp region for 2000 and 2015 the mod15a2h is an 8 day composite dataset with a spatial resolution of 500 m and the common maximum value composite mvc method was used to obtain the monthly lai of each pft 2 3 experimental designs to assess the effect of vegetation restoration on soil moisture dynamics two numerical simulation experiments were designed a control experiment using vegetated cover conditions from the year 2000 hereafter referred to as lc2000 and a sensitivity experiment representing vegetation restoration conditions in the year 2015 hereafter referred to as lc2015 all simulations used offline mode which means that the land component of the coupled system was forced by a prescribed data set of atmospheric fluxes and states and the initial conditions of greenhouse gases were held at the year 2000 value with an atmospheric co2 of 367 ppm two simulations were driven by qian atmospheric forcing data from 1972 to 2004 and ran 99 years through three repetitive cycles of forcing data the first two cycles were considered the spin up period to ensure that land surface conditions reached equilibrium especially for sm in the soil profile and the results were analyzed using the third cycle of the last 33 years of simulation to assess the sensitivity of sm to vegetation restoration all drivers other than vegetation cover were identical between simulations and the only effect of vegetation restoration on sm was expressed as the differences between lc2015 and lc2000 2 4 model performance evaluation and data analysis a linear regression analysis was adopted in sm dynamics detection and the slope of the linear regression was used to quantify the trend of the sm change in different soil layers the t test was used to detect the statistically significance of the trend to investigate the regional difference between sensitivity experiments regional analyses were performed annually and in all seasons and t tests were performed on each grid cell to identify the statistically significant difference a 10 year era5 land dataset from 1995 to 2004 was used to evaluate the clm simulation performance on sm in the three soil layers 0 7 7 100 and 100 289 cm and three statistics including coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and percent bias pbias were used to evaluate the model performance numerically in each grid on the lp these statistics provided different forms of information regarding the model accuracy the r2 value is calculated to estimate the linear association between the simulated and observed values the rmse is applied to examine deviations between simulations and observations sanikhani et al 2019 and the pbias measures the average deviation of simulated outputs from observed values neupane and kumar 2015 3 results 3 1 regional trends in vegetation cover and sm with the implementation of the gfgp the vegetation coverage visibly changed and the coverage differences in the main vegetation types between 2000 and 2015 are shown in fig 1 the forest coverage evidently increased on the lp mainly on the southeastern lp with an increased magnitude from 10 to 20 compared with 2015 fig 1a shrubland remained stable from 2000 to 2015 and only a small proportion of the region on the southern edge of the lp displayed an increase fig 1b there was a general increase in grassland coverage on the lp and a larger increase occurred in north the central part of the region with an increased magnitude of approximately 25 35 fig 1c in contrast crop coverage clearly decreased on the lp and the largest decreases with a magnitude of 30 occurred on the northern lp fig 1d from 1981 to 2018 the area averaged annual sm at 0 7 7 100 and 100 289 cm in the lp region showed significant decreasing trends p 0 01 while the slopes of the long term linear trend were relatively small with magnitudes of 0 04 0 59 and 1 85 mm year for the 0 7 7 100 and 100 289 cm soil layers respectively fig 2 as a result sm in the top 289 cm exhibited a significant decreasing trend with a magnitude of 2 48 mm year fig 2j notably the whole region did not display the same trend because the sm distribution on the lp was spatially heterogeneous with lower sm on the northwestern lp and higher sm on the southeastern lp fig 2b e and h the area averaged annual trend masked evident spatial variability on the northwestern lp increasing trends were observed in the three soil layers although the trends were not statistically significant as the soil depth increased the area exhibiting an increasing trend diminished while the magnitudes of the increasing trend became larger the largest value was greater than 0 8 mm year in the 100 289 mm soil layer fig 2i nonetheless most parts of the lp displayed a decreasing trend with the largest magnitudes in the 100 289 mm soil layer exceeding 2 4 mm year on the southeastern lp within the top 289 cm of soil sm decreased significantly in most parts of the northeastern lp with decreased magnitudes ranging from 7 8 to 9 0 mm year fig 2l 3 2 model performance compared with era5 land data the clm performed well in capturing dominant spatial sm features showing that the mean annual sm in the three soil layers was high on the southeastern lp and low on the northwestern lp during the time period of 1995 2004 fig 3 the r2 values in the three soil layers exceeded 0 5 for entire lp region fig 4 a e and i and the eastern lp had higher r2 although the pattern of rmse increased with soil depth increase fig 4b f and j the calculated pbias for three soil layers were 20 fig 4c g and k suggesting that the model performance was acceptable in terms of the area averaged monthly sm some inconsistent features were observed in the simulated time series compared with corresponding era5 land datasets mainly because simulated data had less fluctuation than observed datasets indicating that the model did not capture some peak and low values well fig 4d and h the time series of the monthly value fluctuated correlatively with the era5 land data series with r2 values of 0 77 0 70 and 0 79 for the 0 7 7 100 and 100 289 cm layers respectively although the largest simulation differences occurred in the 7 100 cm soil layer an acceptable rmse of 14 36 was calculated between the simulated and observed time series data fig 4h overall the simulated sm not only matched well with dynamic spatial pattern of sm on the lp but also was consistent with time series of area averaged sm in the whole region 3 3 sm change due to vegetation restoration the comparison of the area averaged annual sm in the top 289 cm between lc2000 and lc2015 is shown in fig 5 sm in both lc2000 and lc2015 clearly fluctuated in the top layers of 0 7 and 7 100 cm and the annual time series of sm did not show clear differences between the two simulations however the fluctuations in the annual change decreased in the 100 289 cm soil layer and sm was lower in lc2015 than in lc2000 indicating that more sm was consumed in this soil layer in lc2015 fig 5c consequently the area averaged annual mean sm in lc2015 was less than that in lc2000 with a value of 11 7 mm table 1 notably the temporal variabilities in sm in both lc2000 and lc2015 showed a decreasing trend during the simulation period and the decreasing magnitudes increased as the soil depth increased and the largest rate of decrease was approximately 2 1 mm year in 100 289 cm soil layer to further investigate the spatial difference in the responses of sm to vegetation restoration the annual mean sm between lc2015 and lc2000 was compared in fig 6 only minor difference in sm distribution between lc2000 and lc2015 were identified in the top 100 cm soil layer on the southeastern part of the lp however almost the whole lp region exhibited decreased sm in lc2015 in the 100 289 cm layer and significant differences were detected on the southeastern lp where sm in lc2015 was less than that in lc2000 with a reduction in magnitude ranging from 20 to 40 mm fig 6i therefore the sm decrease in the 100 289 cm layer mainly accounted for the sm decrease in the top 289 cm on the lp fig 6l seasonally sm varied in different soil layers table 1 in the top layer of 0 7 cm sm in both lc2000 and lc2015 increased from 15 mm in spring to approximately 17 mm in autumn and then decreased to 16 mm in autumn in the 7 100 cm layer sm in the two simulations decreased from spring 234 mm to autumn 251 mm and then increased again there were no evident spatial differences in the four seasons between lc2015 and lc2000 in the 0 7 and 7 100 cm soil layers fig 7 however in the 100 289 cm layer the seasonal pattern of sm in both experiments was different from that in the top layer exhibiting relatively stable sm in the four seasons moreover seasonal sm in the 100 289 cm layer in lc2015 was less than that in lc2000 with differences of 11 5 mm 11 7 mm 11 9 mm and 11 7 mm for spring summer autumn and winter respectively and the statistically significant differences were mainly detected on the eastern lp p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture variation and model performance based on the era5 land reanalysis dataset the area averaged annual sm in the top 289 cm exhibited a significant decreasing trend p 0 01 with a gradient of 2 5 mm year from 1981 to 2018 many previous studies also reported that the sm on the lp showed decreasing trend particularly since implementation of vegetation restoration chen et al 2007 jia et al 2017 wang et al 2011 yang et al 2014b we also found that the decreased magnitudes varied among different soil layers exhibiting accelerated trends with soil depth increase which were consistent with both field deng et al 2016 and satellite observations feng et al 2017 although soil moisture variation has been investigated by many studies observational results commonly incorporate multiple factors and it remains difficult to determine the magnitude of sm change caused by a typical driving factor due to the complex interactions between sm and environmental factors to explore whether the decrease in sm on the lp was attributed to vegetation restoration on the lp we attempted to quantify the sole effect of vegetation restoration on sm change in the different soil profiles using sensitivity simulation experiments for this purpose the clm performance of the sm simulation in the lp region was assessed first although using ground truth measurements is the best way to evaluate model performance for the lp region with an area of 6 4 105 km2 accurate and extensive in situ measurements are scarce in situ measurements normally represent soil moisture dynamics over a single point while the soil moisture can evolve in a different way in heterogeneous areas thus it is unreasonable to compare area averaged representative values with model outputs at their typical resolutions fortunately a highly validated era5 land reanalysis dataset provide options for complementing scarce observation data era5 land dataset provides sm estimates of four soil profiles including depth intervals of 0 7 7 28 28 100 and 100 289 cm however clm simulates the sm in ten different soil layers on the top 289 cm including 0 71 2 79 6 23 11 89 21 22 36 61 61 98 103 80 172 76 and 286 46 cm to compare the simulated sm with era5 land data in the same soil profile for validating the simulation results we summed the sm in the depth of 6 23 11 89 21 22 36 61 61 98 103 80 cm to express the total sm amount in 7 100 cm the evaluation results showed that the clm not only well reflected the sm spatial pattern which exhibited a decrease from southeast to northwest but also captured the monthly sm distributions in the 0 7 7 100 and 100 289 cm soil layers which increase the confidence for identifying the soil moisture change due to vegetation restoration using sensitivity simulation experiment 4 2 sm change in the upper 100 cm of soil due to vegetation restoration the control experiments and sensitivity simulation experiment that represent different vegetation coverages in the lp region were driven by the same atmospheric forcing data sm in the top 100 cm did not have clear responses to vegetation restoration exhibiting a similar sm amount over time compared with the control experiment to explain the weak response of sm to vegetation restoration in the upper soil layer the clm outputted sm in the 7 21 21 62 and 62 100 cm layers were further analyzed we found that the pattern of sm change due to vegetation restoration in the 7 21 cm soil layer was very similar to those in the 21 62 cm soil layer showing larger sm in lc2015 compared with sm in lc2000 fig 8 while this pattern was reversed in 62 100 cm soil layer indicating sm decreased in 62 100 cm soil layer with vegetation coverage change from 2000 to 2015 thus the positive responses of sm to vegetation restoration in the 7 21 and 21 62 cm soil layer were offset by a negative response in the 62 100 cm soil layer leading to the weak change of total soil moisture in the top 100 cm fig 5b spatially significantly positive responses of sm to vegetation restoration were found in the northwestern lp where grass cover increased fig 9 c and f while the significantly negative responses were observed in eastern lp where large scale afforestation occurred fig 9i a possible explanation for these different responses is that direct ground evaporation is constrained to the upper soil layers because increased shade from canopy cover and forest floor litter associated with vegetation restoration resulted in less light penetration and lower soil temperature morecroft et al 1998 however in the subsurface soil layer vegetation consumed more water to meet its transpiration demand due to its deep and developed rooting systems which combined with reduced soil water infiltration by increased canopy interception leading to decreased sm jian et al 2015 additionally we found that the temporal variability of sm was similar to the temporal variability of precipitation in atmospheric forcing data fig 5 and fig 10 a because sm in the top surface layer quickly responded to precipitation yang et al 2012a thus the hydrological effect resulting from increased vegetation coverage was probably masked by the impacts of precipitation in the soil surface layer pitman et al 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 local precipitation is the main source of sm in the lp region some studies showed that the response of sm to precipitation in semiarid areas varied by soil depth and the infiltration depth of precipitation in the loessial soil hardly reaches 100 cm jia et al 2017 yang et al 2012a consequently infiltration of precipitation in the surface soil layer compensated for the increase in water uptake by vegetation and resulted in weak impact on soil moisture li et al 2018 4 3 sm change in the deeper soil profiles due to vegetation restoration in the deep layer of 100 289 cm the sm clearly decreased in the vegetation restoration experiment dense vegetation with high productivity consumes too much water stored in deep layers jia and shao 2014 yang et al 2012a and the forests in the region have higher water loss from et which is hardly recharged by precipitation jian et al 2015 nonetheless our results revealed that sm in both the control experiment and restoration experiment exhibited significant decreasing trends p 0 01 probably because transpiration increased with plant growth chen et al 2007 additionally seasonal variation in sm due to vegetation restoration was almost consistent in all seasons because sm was relatively stable in different seasons in the 100 289 cm soil layer in the same simulation experiment these findings support previous studies based on long term observations which show that there are no significant seasonal changes in sm in the deep soil layer in the lp region yang et al 2014a 2014b mainly because the sm amount in deep soil layers was diminished due to fewer rainfall replenishes spatially the decrease occurred throughout the region and was especially significant on the central and eastern lp partly because forest coverage evidently increased on the southeastern lp and woody species could consume more soil water via evapotranspiration than natural grass and crops cao et al 2009 jian et al 2015 another possible reason for this effect might be related to the coupling effect of precipitation change and vegetation restoration the precipitation component used in the atmospheric forcing dataset showed that an overall decreasing trend of precipitation was observed throughout the lp region fig 10a and was particularly evident in the eastern part of the lp fig 10d and the downward trend of sm due to vegetation restoration may have been intensified under decreased precipitation this in turn had negative effects on vegetation growth because sm below the surface layers was an important water source for introduced vegetation in the initial years fang et al 2016 yang et al 2014b this inevitably threatens ecosystem health and results in ecosystem degradation jin et al 2011 suggest that reforestation may be sustainable when precipitation exceeds 617 mm however the precipitation on the eastern lp is approximately 550 mm fig 10c which could not support the water consumption of plant in the long term due to the large area and high density of vegetation feng et al 2016 and zhang et al 2018 reported the current vegetation cover on the loess plateau is approaching or may have exceeded the sustainable water resource limits moreover evidence from the pollen record shows that the lp region has been covered by grassland during the holocene epoch with more monsoon precipitation jiang and ding 2005 therefore the feasibility of vegetation restoration should not only consider the interactions between sm and precipitation but also select reasonable plant species and planting density 4 4 uncertainties although our quantitative evaluation highlighted the sm reduction in subsurface and deeper soil layer due to vegetation restoration the results are likely model dependent first we used historical atmospheric forcing data 1972 2004 for clm to identify the impact of vegetation restoration on the spatiotemporal change of sm on the lp which meaning boundary conditions did not respond to climate change in the future this suggested that our results might incapably illustrate the impact of further restoration under climate change if the climate on the loess plateau suffers from large changes due to global warming second land cover in clm is described via fractional cover of pfts and the parametrization is uniform for a specific pft while the newly introduced vegetation on the lp includes black locust robinia pseudoacacia linn chinese pine pinus tabuliformis carr korshinsk peashrub caragana korshinskill kom and sea buckthorn hippophae rhamnoides linn and their phenology and physiology might not be accurately represented in the parametrization of the pft leading to the discrepancies between the simulation and the reality third the sensitivity simulation conducted in this study only considered natural succession of vegetation which is another potential source of uncertainty because management is also an important aspect of conducting vegetation restoration 5 conclusions in this study we quantified the spatiotemporal responses of sm to vegetation restoration on the lp in china sm in the surface layer had positive responses to vegetation restoration which was offset by the negative responses of sm in the subsurface soil layer above 100 cm thus the total sm in the top 100 cm had weak change due to vegetation restoration however sm in the 100 289 cm soil layer was significantly affected by vegetation restoration exhibiting a decreasing trend particularly on the southeastern lp where the forest coverage clearly increased additionally there were no clear seasonal changes associated with vegetation restoration which implied that the sm decline resulting from vegetation restoration occurred in all seasons regardless of how precipitation was distributed on the lp therefore to ensure sustainable ecological restoration future work should investigate water cycle components such as canopy interception and et to understand hydrological process

4411,in this closure we respond to the comments of ebtehaj et al 2020 and also provide additional details regarding several features of our study 1 introduction the discussion paper of ebtehaj et al 2020 hereafter referred to as ezb provided several comments related to our mehdizadeh et al 2019a paper in this closure we respond to the comments of ezb and further explain the aims and reasoning behind our approaches and models and show why our approaches and models are suitable based on the aims and scope of our study we also provide additional details regarding several features of our study ezb had five main points in their discussion paper that we address in this closure 1 individual linear time series models and hybrid linear arch models arch autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity we explain in more detail our aims scope reasoning and approach used to develop our individual linear time series and hybrid linear arch models and explain why our models were suitable given our aims 2 artificial intelligence models we explain why data preprocessing can be a useful step in artificial intelligence modeling and why it was used in our study 3 hybrid models we explain that comparing the performance of arch models alone with our other models as suggested by ezb did not make sense since our arch models were fitted to the residuals of the linear time series models to remove the arch effects in the residuals and build the hybrid linear arch models we also point out that developing hybrid time series artificial intelligence models and other possible types of hybrid models as suggested by ezb was outside the scope of our study which aimed to develop hybrid linear arch models 4 external analysis we explain why our external analysis approach was valid and useful 5 rmse mae and r we explain why our performance indices i e rmse mae and r were suitable to compare our models we want to point out that the data analysis and model results comparisons and comments provided by ezb in their discussion paper regarding their approaches and results and our approaches and results in our original study often used different data sets e g ezb used raw original data for their artificial intelligence models while we used preprocessed transformed data in our original study or different model development approaches e g ezb used different and more than twice the number of inputs for their artificial intelligence models compared to our artificial intelligence model inputs in our original study or different methods e g ezb used the kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin mann kendall and mann whitney tests for their data analysis of the port elgin study site data although we believe these tests are not appropriate given the nature of our data or included inaccurate assumptions e g ezb assumed that we could compare the performance of our arch models alone with our other models while this did not make sense given that the arch models in our study were fitted to the residuals of the linear time series models to remove the arch effects in the residuals and develop hybrid linear arch models all of which make simple effective comparisons between the suggestions approaches results of ezb and our approaches and results not straightforward in some cases this closure is organized point by point to address the comments of ezb it should be noted that because our aims and overall approach were the same in all four study sites in the original paper and because ezb focused on one of our study sites port elgin for points 1 and 2 we do the same and focus on the port elgin study site in points 1 and 2 of our closure to also avoid making an already long closure longer also in this closure when we refer to individual linear time series models we are referring to models such as ar autoregressive and ma moving average when we refer to hybrid linear arch models arch autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity we are referring to models such as ar arch and ma arch and when we refer to artificial intelligence models we are referring to a general class of models that encompass non parametric regression methods such as mars multivariate adaptive regression splines and evolutionary methods such as gep gene expression programming developed in our study 2 point 1 individual linear time series models and hybrid linear arch models we first want to provide some additional details regarding our aims and overall approach to develop our individual linear time series models and hybrid linear arch models the latter of which were one of the main topics of our original study following this we respond to the specific points raised by ezb regarding our individual linear time series models which ezb focus on in point 1 in our original study for each study site we transformed the original data via our normalization and standardization process which included de seasonalization of the data with the aim of providing us with the ability to explore the use of the simplest possible model classes in linear time series analysis for our individual linear time series models and to form our hybrid linear arch models the use of the original i e not preprocessed transformed data in the study sites would have necessitated the use of complex model classes in time series analysis for example the seasonal arima model class given the nature of the original monthly streamflow data and given our aim to also incorporate conditional heteroscedasticity given the arch type effects in the residuals i e significant autocorrelations in the squares of the residuals this would have resulted in even more complex models on the other hand following our data transformation in each study site we were able to focus on the simplest model classes in linear time series analysis i e the ar and ma classes of time series models for our individual linear time series models and to form our hybrid linear arch models given the nature of the transformed data and seeing that our selected models in each study site which adhered to our aim of focusing on the simplest possible model classes in linear time series analysis for our individual linear time series models and to form our hybrid linear arch models offered a good fit to the data in the sense of the residuals having a white noise structure and practically zero autocorrelation we developed hybrid linear arch models i e ar arch and ma arch in our case since we observed arch type effects in the residuals of the ar and ma models i e significant autocorrelations in the squares of the residuals the simplest model classes in linear time series analysis for example the ar model class have a simple structure are easy to use and interpret are widely used in hydrology e g by practitioners and have a long and well developed literature salas et al 1988 rajagopalan et al 2010 arch models which are a class of non linear time series models are an approach that can remove arch effects in the residuals of linear time series models we explored simple hybrid linear arch models i e ar arch and ma arch for the reasons we have explained and also because hybrid linear arch models have not been investigated extensively in the hydrological literature and we were interested to see how these simple hybrid linear arch models performed and compared with simple individual linear time series models i e ar and ma we want to mention that some of the authors of the original study previously explored various more complex model classes in time series analysis e g the sarima model class or the autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average arfima model class etc and also previously explored coupling different time series analysis models e g vector ar self exciting threshold ar sarima etc with arch and garch generalized arch models in for example fathian et al 2016 fathian et al 2019a fathian et al 2019b fathian et al 2019c and mehdizadeh et al 2020 so we were aware of other possible model options however for the reasons we have discussed we developed simple individual linear time series i e ar and ma and simple hybrid linear arch i e ar arch and ma arch models in our original study we now respond to the specific points raised by ezb who focus on our individual linear ar and ma models in point 1 ezb first comment that the transformed data for the port elgin study site which is the study site ezb focus on in point 1 is not stationary based on their use of the kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin test and has trend based on their use of the mann kendall test and jump based on their use of the mann whitney test ezb then comment that because of these points our use of individual linear ar and ma time series models was not appropriate for the port elgin study site we respectfully disagree we show below that the transformed data recall that our transformation included de seasonalization is stationary and has no trend or jump and our use of ar and ma time series models was suitable fig 1 shows the transformed port elgin data after our preprocessing process described in the original paper it is clear that the port elgin transformed data can suitably be modelled as a stationary process there do not appear to be any clear non stationarities therein according to fig 1 we used an advanced change point detection methodology wild energy maximization and gappy schwarz criterion wem gsc cho and fryzlewicz 2021 for detecting possibly multiple change points in the mean of an autocorrelated time series both our original and transformed time series exhibit clear serial correlation the wem gsc change point detection methodology is comprised of two procedures that are combined i a solution path generation procedure that is based on the principle of wild energy maximisation i e the wem component which is useful to separate shifts in the mean from fluctuations stemming from serial correlations and ii an information criterion based model selection strategy labelled gappy schwarz criterion i e the gsc component which estimates the dependence structure as well as the number of change points simultaneously cho and fryzlewicz 2021 we ran the wem gsc technique from cho and fryzlewicz 2021 appropriate for detecting changes in the mean in the presence of serial correlations in time series data which did not detect any change points in the transformed data fig 1 in other words this means that our transformed data is stationary and has no trend or jump we want to highlight that in their discussion paper ezb used the kpss kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin test to test for stationarity but this does not appear appropriate in this setting as this tests against the presence of a deterministic trend in the direction of a unit root alternative while our port elgin data do not display either feature in addition ezb used the mann kendall test to test for trend and the mann whitney test to test for jump but this also does not appear appropriate in this instance as both tests are designed for uncorrelated independent time series while our data both original and transformed exhibit clear serial correlation below we show a brief example in the r language for statistical computing of how the mann kendall test can be fooled by the presence of serial correlation the kendall r package mcleod 2011 is adopted install packages kendall repos http cran us r project org library kendall set seed 1 mannkendall arima sim list ar 0 9 n 1000 tau 0 0647 2 sided pvalue 0 0021775 this performs the mann kendall test on a realization of a stationary ar 1 process and incorrectly strongly rejects stationarity in the presence of serial correlation other approaches such as wem gsc cho and fryzlewicz 2021 should be used we also present the autocorrelation function acf structure of our original and transformed data for the port elgin study site in fig 2 the acf behavior of the transformed data shows that using our data preprocessing approach which included de seasonalization as we subtracted the means of each month separately the seasonality is removed from the original data and no statistically significant seasonal autocorrelation exists in the transformed data based on all of the above points to re iterate what we mentioned earlier and in contrast to what ezb state our transformed data for the port elgin study site is stationary and has no trend or jump and our use of ar and ma time series models was suitable for our individual linear time series models as well as to form our hybrid linear arch models on a different note regarding ezb s comment on the port elgin test phase results for the individual linear time series models i e ar and ma upon re examining the model results in our original study we discovered that we had made an error in reporting the performance index values i e rmse mae and r values for a sub set of individual linear time series and hybrid linear arch models for the port elgin as well as walkerton study sites for this sub set of models the fitted models themselves and their orders are correct however we had made a small error when re scaling the data to the original scale prior to calculating the performance indices hence the error in reporting the performance index values for this sub set of models the corrected results for this sub set of models is as follows i port elgin rmse m3 s mae m3 s r ar 1 test phase 37 65 23 86 0 709 ar 1 arch 1 train phase 10 74 4 95 0 99 ma 4 test phase 37 62 23 87 0 715 ma 4 arch 1 train phase 10 15 4 76 0 991 ii walkerton rmse m3 s mae m3 s r ar 1 test phase 19 24 12 35 0 704 ar 1 arch 1 train phase 5 89 2 73 0 99 all other results for all other models and all other study sites in our original paper are correct and are not affected and our overall conclusions in the original study are not affected and remain the same on a final note ezb comment on our individual linear ar and ma models for the beinerahe roodbar study site and state that it is very rare to find practical usages of ar n and ma n where n is larger than two we respectfully disagree in contrast to what ezb state we want to point out that numerous studies in the streamflow modeling literature have detailed the development and use of ar and ma models including for monthly data where n 2 e g salas et al 1988 wang and salas 1991 ki≈üi 2004 wang et al 2005 myronidis et al 2018 etc regarding ezb s suggestion on the use of seasonal arma sarma models for the beinerahe roodbar study site instead of our individual ar and ma models we want to point out that seasonal ar models sar a sub class of sarma sarima have an ar representation where the ar lag has to be at least as long as the seasonal period so for example for modeling monthly data with a yearly season it would be reasonable to use a seasonal ar model for which the ar representation is ar 12 having said this regarding our individual ar and ma models for the beinerahe roodbar study site we emphasize again that our data preprocessing transformation in the original study included de seasonalization as we subtract the means of each month separately which is why our transformed data for all study sites in the original study no longer displayed seasonality in the acf and so we respectfully disagree with ezb s point regarding the possible use of sarma models when applied to our transformed data for the beinerahe roodbar study site we were satisfied with our ar and ma models for the beinerahe roodbar study site given the goodness of fit of our selected models i e the residuals had a white noise structure and practically zero autocorrelation in conjunction with the fact that our use of ar and ma models adhered to our aim of focusing on the simplest possible model classes in linear time series analysis for our individual linear time series models and to form our hybrid linear arch models take our ar model for the beinerahe roodbar study site as an example in our original research as with each of our models we had assessed the goodness of fit of this model fitted to the transformed beinerahe roodbar data by testing the residuals of the ar model the residuals from this model are shown in fig 3 visually they have a white noise structure which is further confirmed in their acf plot shown in fig 4 they do also display arch effects in the squares not shown which as already mentioned earlier explains our arch modeling of the residuals in the hybrid linear arch i e ar arch model the most important point is that both figures provide strong visual evidence for the goodness of fit of the ar model the residuals from this fit have a stationary white noise structure which is what should be expected from residuals from an adequate time series fit 3 point 2 artificial intelligence models before we respond to the comments of ezb in point 2 we want to mention that for ease of reference in our original paper we referred to and grouped the mars and gep methods as artificial intelligence models in the sense that we are referring to a general class of models that encompass non parametric regression methods such as mars and evolutionary methods such as gep in point 2 ezb first comment that our data preprocessing procedures are not necessary to develop our artificial intelligence ai models we respectfully disagree first we want to mention that to conduct a fair performance comparison of the individual linear time series and hybrid linear arch models with the artificial intelligence models i e gep and mars in our original study we believe it was important to use the same preprocessed transformed data to develop the individual linear time series hybrid linear arch and artificial intelligence models to allow us to maintain the same conditions when conducting our performance comparison of models since preprocessed transformed data were used to develop the individual linear time series and hybrid linear arch models in our original study for the reasons we discussed in point 1 of this closure we felt that the same preprocessed transformed data should be and was used to develop our gep and mars models to maintain the same conditions second and on a more general note we believe that data preprocessing procedures of which there are many different types ranging from simple to complex approaches that go well beyond our approach in the original study can often be useful to use before developing an artificial intelligence model and are common e g zhang and qi 2005 wu et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 kalteh 2016 quilty et al 2019 we believe that the many different data preprocessing approaches that are available can be useful to consider before developing artificial intelligence models for many reasons including 1 artificial intelligence models can sometimes have challenges to simultaneously deal with several components of the data appropriately and therefore data preprocessing can be useful quilty et al 2019 zuo et al 2020 hammad et al 2021 2 preprocessed data can help facilitate not only optimal model structure building processes but also alleviate potential overfitting problems of artificial intelligence models and can help improve the performance and stability of the model as well as speed up the training process and convergence during training nelson et al 1999 zhang and qi 2005 fijani et al 2019 zuo et al 2020 3 preprocessing of data can sometimes have a significant effect on the performance of artificial intelligence models and can help to deal with the impacts of for example noisy and unreliable data errors and outliers kotsiantis et al b 2006a garcia et al 2015 chitsaz et al 2016 fijani et al 2019 hammad et al 2021 the above are just some examples of reasons why data preprocessing of which there are many different types is often considered to be useful before developing artificial intelligence models ezb then comment that for the local analysis approach in the port elgin study site which is the only study site and type of analysis ezb provide gep and mars model results for in point 2 using the original raw data rather than the preprocessed transformed data results in more accurate mars and gep models in the port elgin study site we want to first mention an important point in their discussion paper ezb used nine inputs to develop their one mars model and one gep model which they developed using the original raw data for the port elgin study site in contrast our mars and gep models in the original study which were developed using our preprocessed transformed data used less than half the number of inputs i e one to four inputs with our best mars model using four inputs and our best gep model using three inputs we now want to mention a second important point if we compare our best mars model developed using our preprocessed data for the port elgin study site in our original study i e mars4 which has four inputs and has for the test phase r 0 731 rmse 36 69 m3 s mae 23 33 m3 s with the one mars model developed by ezb in their discussion paper developed using the original raw data for the port elgin study site which has nine inputs and has for the test phase r 0 714 rmse 36 38 m3 s and no mae result reported our r is actually 2 3 better while our rmse is 0 85 worse compared to the model of ezb so comparing our best mars model with the one mars model developed by ezb shows that our r was actually better and our rmse marginally worse less than 1 compared to the model developed by ezb these are very marginal differences and importantly our model used less than half the number of inputs following the important principle of parsimony in modeling we believe that this shows that our approach in our original study was suitable in that our model provided good results with few inputs e g basically the same results as the model of ezb but with less than half the model inputs and importantly our approach for the mars and gep model used the same preprocessed data that was used to develop our other models in the original study which we believe was important to allow us to maintain the same conditions when conducting our performance comparison of models for the one gep model that ezb developed that had a better performance compared to our best gep model we believe this was likely due in part to ezb using three times the number of inputs for their one gep model nine inputs for their gep model versus three inputs for our best gep model this implication is also clear in the results of our original study where our models with more inputs generally had better results e g our best gep model gep3 with three inputs had better results than our gep1 with one input or our best mars model mars4 with four inputs had better results than our mars1 with one input which is to be expected the decision of selecting what modeling approach to pursue depends on among other things the aims of the modeller and we want to re iterate that in our original study our overall aim and approach for our models i e individual linear time series hybrid linear arch and artificial intelligence was to develop simple and adequate models and also use the same data set i e preprocessed transformed in our case to develop all the models since we believe using the same data set was important in order to conduct a fair performance comparison of models as such our gep and mars models with few inputs but good results which were developed using the same preprocessed data as the other models in our original study adhered to our aims based on what we have discussed and keeping in mind our aims and the important principle of parsimony in modeling the above described approach that we selected in our original study to develop our mars and gep models was suitable on a final note ezb comment on the gep parameter values e g number of chromosomes mutation rate etc that we used for our gep models and then provide what they state are the optimum gep parameter values which they found through a trial and error process we want to point out that the use of our gep parameter values in the original study was suitable many other hydrological and environmental modeling studies have used the same or a very similar approach to ours with respect to the gep parameter values e g kisi and shiri 2012 hashmi and shamseldin 2014 zorn and shamseldin 2015 kisi et al 2015 al juboori and guven 2016 samadianfard et al 2018 bateni et al 2019 wang et al 2019 on a related note we want to point out that the gep parameter values provided by ezb were found through a trial and error process a trial and error approach contains variability especially one involving optimizing eleven different parameters as is the case for the gep model and different researchers undertaking a trial and error approach may each find a different set of optimal model parameter values we also want to point out that ezb did not provide any results of a gep model that used their optimal gep parameter values to assess if these gep model results differ very significantly from our gep model results using the same preprocessed data and the same set of model inputs as we used in the original paper however we believe it is quite likely that the different gep model parameter values that ezb suggest would not result in very significant important differences in gep model performance e g as was the case with the earlier described marginal differences in model results between using raw original data and processed data for the mars model having said all of this we want to emphasize again the most important point which is that the use of our gep parameter values in the original study was suitable as mentioned earlier many other hydrological and environmental modeling studies have used the same or a very similar approach to ours with respect to the gep parameter values 4 point 3 hybrid models ezb first comment that no results are given for arch and that using arch may provide results close to the hybrid models ar arch and ma arch ezb are stating that we should have compared the arch models alone with our other models e g ar arch and ma arch we respectfully disagree we want to point out that it did not make sense to compare the performance of arch models alone with our other models e g ar arch ma arch since the arch models in our study were fitted to the residuals of the linear ar and ma models to remove the arch effects in the residuals of the linear ar and ma models and build the hybrid ar arch and ma arch models ezb also comment that combining stochastic methods with gep can also yield good results we were aware that such hybrid models can be developed and may also provide good results coupling stochastic or time series models with artificial intelligence models for streamflow modeling has already been investigated in other studies e g moeeni et al 2017 including by the authors of the original paper e g mehdizadeh et al 2019b fathian et al 2019c however developing these types of hybrid time series artificial intelligence models and other possible types of hybrid models was outside the scope of our original study our aim was to develop hybrid linear arch models 5 point 4 external analysis ezb state that in our external analysis approach no value for q t at station 2 is recorded that can serve as a model input to predict q t at station 1 and comment that our external analysis approach is not valid we respectfully disagree ezb misinterpreted what we did in our external analysis approach in our valid external analysis approach we developed a procedure to estimate missing streamflow data at a target station station 1 using streamflow data from a neighboring station station 2 where we assumed that q t as well as q t 1 etc is observed available at the neighboring station but where q t is missing at the target station for any reason more specifically in our external analysis approach in the original study we had developed artificial intelligence models that could be used in our study sites to estimate missing monthly streamflow data at a target station q t using streamflow data that is observed available for the same time i e q t as well as for the past i e q t 1 etc from a neighboring station in the same river geographically near and with temporally similar characteristics when the target station streamflow data q t is not available which can be a common issue in practice e g if the target station has missing data due to a malfunction in the streamflow gauge in the original paper we state that under the external analysis approach the data of a neighboring station is used to estimate streamflow at each target station and for example that for the mars1 and gep1 models under the external analysis approach the streamflow data of the same month q t at a nearby station were used to estimate the streamflow q t at the target station in the same river we want to point out that a similar external analysis approach was successfully used by sanikhani and kisi 2012 in the context of estimating missing monthly streamflow data at a target station we obtained accurate results using our above described external analysis approach in the original study and this valid and suitable approach was useful to have explored 6 point 5 rmse mae and r regarding ezb s comments on our use of the aic we had used the aic as a suitable criterion e g salas et al 1988 hipel and mcleod 1994 to help select the optimum model i e best fitted model with optimum order among satisfactory candidates for each type class of individual linear time series model i e ar ma and each type class of hybrid linear arch model i e ar arch ma arch that we used and then compared based on their performance as explained below however we did not show the details of the selection process based on aic results since the original paper was already overly long after using the aic to select the optimum model for each type class of time series model i e ar ma ar arch ma arch we compared these selected models based on their performance via the rmse mae and r performance indices we respectfully disagree with ezb s comment that our approach described above to compare our selected individual linear time series models and hybrid linear arch models based on their performance via in our case the rmse mae and r performance indices is not appropriate and that we must instead use the aic to compare these selected time series models our approach which is valid and suitable was to compare our selected individual linear time series models and hybrid linear arch models based on their performance and we used the rmse mae and r performance indices as a suitable approach to do this 7 conclusion in this closure we responded to the comments of ezb and further explained the aims and reasoning behind our approaches and models and showed why our approaches and models are suitable based on the aims and scope of our study we also included additional details regarding several features of our study that we did not provide in the original paper since it was already overly lengthy to summarize the main points we discussed in this closure 1 individual linear time series and hybrid linear arch models we explained in more detail our aims scope reasoning and approach used to develop our individual linear time series and hybrid linear arch models and explained why our models were suitable given our aims 2 artificial intelligence models we explained why data preprocessing can be useful in artificial intelligence modeling and why it was used in our study 3 hybrid models we explained that comparing the performance of arch models alone with our other models as suggested by ezb did not make sense since our arch models were fitted to the residuals of the linear time series models to remove the arch effects in the residuals and build the hybrid linear arch models we also pointed out that developing hybrid time series artificial intelligence models and other possible types of hybrid models as suggested by ezb was outside the scope of our study which aimed to develop hybrid linear arch models 4 external analysis we explained why our external analysis approach was valid and useful 5 rmse mae and r we explained why our performance indices i e rmse mae and r were suitable to compare our models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements we want to thank prof geoff syme editor journal of hydrology the covid 19 pandemic had significant and very negative impacts on several authors of this closure

4411,in this closure we respond to the comments of ebtehaj et al 2020 and also provide additional details regarding several features of our study 1 introduction the discussion paper of ebtehaj et al 2020 hereafter referred to as ezb provided several comments related to our mehdizadeh et al 2019a paper in this closure we respond to the comments of ezb and further explain the aims and reasoning behind our approaches and models and show why our approaches and models are suitable based on the aims and scope of our study we also provide additional details regarding several features of our study ezb had five main points in their discussion paper that we address in this closure 1 individual linear time series models and hybrid linear arch models arch autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity we explain in more detail our aims scope reasoning and approach used to develop our individual linear time series and hybrid linear arch models and explain why our models were suitable given our aims 2 artificial intelligence models we explain why data preprocessing can be a useful step in artificial intelligence modeling and why it was used in our study 3 hybrid models we explain that comparing the performance of arch models alone with our other models as suggested by ezb did not make sense since our arch models were fitted to the residuals of the linear time series models to remove the arch effects in the residuals and build the hybrid linear arch models we also point out that developing hybrid time series artificial intelligence models and other possible types of hybrid models as suggested by ezb was outside the scope of our study which aimed to develop hybrid linear arch models 4 external analysis we explain why our external analysis approach was valid and useful 5 rmse mae and r we explain why our performance indices i e rmse mae and r were suitable to compare our models we want to point out that the data analysis and model results comparisons and comments provided by ezb in their discussion paper regarding their approaches and results and our approaches and results in our original study often used different data sets e g ezb used raw original data for their artificial intelligence models while we used preprocessed transformed data in our original study or different model development approaches e g ezb used different and more than twice the number of inputs for their artificial intelligence models compared to our artificial intelligence model inputs in our original study or different methods e g ezb used the kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin mann kendall and mann whitney tests for their data analysis of the port elgin study site data although we believe these tests are not appropriate given the nature of our data or included inaccurate assumptions e g ezb assumed that we could compare the performance of our arch models alone with our other models while this did not make sense given that the arch models in our study were fitted to the residuals of the linear time series models to remove the arch effects in the residuals and develop hybrid linear arch models all of which make simple effective comparisons between the suggestions approaches results of ezb and our approaches and results not straightforward in some cases this closure is organized point by point to address the comments of ezb it should be noted that because our aims and overall approach were the same in all four study sites in the original paper and because ezb focused on one of our study sites port elgin for points 1 and 2 we do the same and focus on the port elgin study site in points 1 and 2 of our closure to also avoid making an already long closure longer also in this closure when we refer to individual linear time series models we are referring to models such as ar autoregressive and ma moving average when we refer to hybrid linear arch models arch autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity we are referring to models such as ar arch and ma arch and when we refer to artificial intelligence models we are referring to a general class of models that encompass non parametric regression methods such as mars multivariate adaptive regression splines and evolutionary methods such as gep gene expression programming developed in our study 2 point 1 individual linear time series models and hybrid linear arch models we first want to provide some additional details regarding our aims and overall approach to develop our individual linear time series models and hybrid linear arch models the latter of which were one of the main topics of our original study following this we respond to the specific points raised by ezb regarding our individual linear time series models which ezb focus on in point 1 in our original study for each study site we transformed the original data via our normalization and standardization process which included de seasonalization of the data with the aim of providing us with the ability to explore the use of the simplest possible model classes in linear time series analysis for our individual linear time series models and to form our hybrid linear arch models the use of the original i e not preprocessed transformed data in the study sites would have necessitated the use of complex model classes in time series analysis for example the seasonal arima model class given the nature of the original monthly streamflow data and given our aim to also incorporate conditional heteroscedasticity given the arch type effects in the residuals i e significant autocorrelations in the squares of the residuals this would have resulted in even more complex models on the other hand following our data transformation in each study site we were able to focus on the simplest model classes in linear time series analysis i e the ar and ma classes of time series models for our individual linear time series models and to form our hybrid linear arch models given the nature of the transformed data and seeing that our selected models in each study site which adhered to our aim of focusing on the simplest possible model classes in linear time series analysis for our individual linear time series models and to form our hybrid linear arch models offered a good fit to the data in the sense of the residuals having a white noise structure and practically zero autocorrelation we developed hybrid linear arch models i e ar arch and ma arch in our case since we observed arch type effects in the residuals of the ar and ma models i e significant autocorrelations in the squares of the residuals the simplest model classes in linear time series analysis for example the ar model class have a simple structure are easy to use and interpret are widely used in hydrology e g by practitioners and have a long and well developed literature salas et al 1988 rajagopalan et al 2010 arch models which are a class of non linear time series models are an approach that can remove arch effects in the residuals of linear time series models we explored simple hybrid linear arch models i e ar arch and ma arch for the reasons we have explained and also because hybrid linear arch models have not been investigated extensively in the hydrological literature and we were interested to see how these simple hybrid linear arch models performed and compared with simple individual linear time series models i e ar and ma we want to mention that some of the authors of the original study previously explored various more complex model classes in time series analysis e g the sarima model class or the autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average arfima model class etc and also previously explored coupling different time series analysis models e g vector ar self exciting threshold ar sarima etc with arch and garch generalized arch models in for example fathian et al 2016 fathian et al 2019a fathian et al 2019b fathian et al 2019c and mehdizadeh et al 2020 so we were aware of other possible model options however for the reasons we have discussed we developed simple individual linear time series i e ar and ma and simple hybrid linear arch i e ar arch and ma arch models in our original study we now respond to the specific points raised by ezb who focus on our individual linear ar and ma models in point 1 ezb first comment that the transformed data for the port elgin study site which is the study site ezb focus on in point 1 is not stationary based on their use of the kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin test and has trend based on their use of the mann kendall test and jump based on their use of the mann whitney test ezb then comment that because of these points our use of individual linear ar and ma time series models was not appropriate for the port elgin study site we respectfully disagree we show below that the transformed data recall that our transformation included de seasonalization is stationary and has no trend or jump and our use of ar and ma time series models was suitable fig 1 shows the transformed port elgin data after our preprocessing process described in the original paper it is clear that the port elgin transformed data can suitably be modelled as a stationary process there do not appear to be any clear non stationarities therein according to fig 1 we used an advanced change point detection methodology wild energy maximization and gappy schwarz criterion wem gsc cho and fryzlewicz 2021 for detecting possibly multiple change points in the mean of an autocorrelated time series both our original and transformed time series exhibit clear serial correlation the wem gsc change point detection methodology is comprised of two procedures that are combined i a solution path generation procedure that is based on the principle of wild energy maximisation i e the wem component which is useful to separate shifts in the mean from fluctuations stemming from serial correlations and ii an information criterion based model selection strategy labelled gappy schwarz criterion i e the gsc component which estimates the dependence structure as well as the number of change points simultaneously cho and fryzlewicz 2021 we ran the wem gsc technique from cho and fryzlewicz 2021 appropriate for detecting changes in the mean in the presence of serial correlations in time series data which did not detect any change points in the transformed data fig 1 in other words this means that our transformed data is stationary and has no trend or jump we want to highlight that in their discussion paper ezb used the kpss kwiatkowski phillips schmidt shin test to test for stationarity but this does not appear appropriate in this setting as this tests against the presence of a deterministic trend in the direction of a unit root alternative while our port elgin data do not display either feature in addition ezb used the mann kendall test to test for trend and the mann whitney test to test for jump but this also does not appear appropriate in this instance as both tests are designed for uncorrelated independent time series while our data both original and transformed exhibit clear serial correlation below we show a brief example in the r language for statistical computing of how the mann kendall test can be fooled by the presence of serial correlation the kendall r package mcleod 2011 is adopted install packages kendall repos http cran us r project org library kendall set seed 1 mannkendall arima sim list ar 0 9 n 1000 tau 0 0647 2 sided pvalue 0 0021775 this performs the mann kendall test on a realization of a stationary ar 1 process and incorrectly strongly rejects stationarity in the presence of serial correlation other approaches such as wem gsc cho and fryzlewicz 2021 should be used we also present the autocorrelation function acf structure of our original and transformed data for the port elgin study site in fig 2 the acf behavior of the transformed data shows that using our data preprocessing approach which included de seasonalization as we subtracted the means of each month separately the seasonality is removed from the original data and no statistically significant seasonal autocorrelation exists in the transformed data based on all of the above points to re iterate what we mentioned earlier and in contrast to what ezb state our transformed data for the port elgin study site is stationary and has no trend or jump and our use of ar and ma time series models was suitable for our individual linear time series models as well as to form our hybrid linear arch models on a different note regarding ezb s comment on the port elgin test phase results for the individual linear time series models i e ar and ma upon re examining the model results in our original study we discovered that we had made an error in reporting the performance index values i e rmse mae and r values for a sub set of individual linear time series and hybrid linear arch models for the port elgin as well as walkerton study sites for this sub set of models the fitted models themselves and their orders are correct however we had made a small error when re scaling the data to the original scale prior to calculating the performance indices hence the error in reporting the performance index values for this sub set of models the corrected results for this sub set of models is as follows i port

affected and our overall conclusions in the original study are not affected and remain the same on a final note ezb comment on our individual linear ar and ma models for the beinerahe roodbar study site and state that it is very rare to find practical usages of ar n and ma n where n is larger than two we respectfully disagree in contrast to what ezb state we want to point out that numerous studies in the streamflow modeling literature have detailed the development and use of ar and ma models including for monthly data where n 2 e g salas et al 1988 wang and salas 1991 ki≈üi 2004 wang et al 2005 myronidis et al 2018 etc regarding ezb s suggestion on the use of seasonal arma sarma models for the beinerahe roodbar study site instead of our individual ar and ma models we want to point out that seasonal ar models sar a sub class of sarma sarima have an ar representation where the ar lag has to be at least as long as the seasonal period so for example for modeling monthly data with a yearly season it would be reasonable to use a seasonal ar model for which the ar representation is ar 12 having said this regarding our individual ar and ma models for the beinerahe roodbar study site we emphasize again that our data preprocessing transformation in the original study included de seasonalization as we subtract the means of each month separately which is why our transformed data for all study sites in the original study no longer displayed seasonality in the acf and so we respectfully disagree with ezb s point regarding the possible use of sarma models when applied to our transformed data for the beinerahe roodbar study site we were satisfied with our ar and ma models for the beinerahe roodbar study site given the goodness of fit of our selected models i e the residuals had a white noise structure and practically zero autocorrelation in conjunction with the fact that our use of ar and ma models adhered to our aim of focusing on the simplest possible model classes in linear time series analysis for our individual linear time series models and to form our hybrid linear arch models take our ar model for the beinerahe roodbar study site as an example in our original research as with each of our models we had assessed the goodness of fit of this model fitted to the transformed beinerahe roodbar data by testing the residuals of the ar model the residuals from this model are shown in fig 3 visually they have a white noise structure which is further confirmed in their acf plot shown in fig 4 they do also display arch effects in the squares not shown which as already mentioned earlier explains our arch modeling of the residuals in the hybrid linear arch i e ar arch model the most important point is that both figures provide strong visual evidence for the goodness of fit of the ar model the residuals from this fit have a stationary white noise structure which is what should be expected from residuals from an adequate time series fit 3 point 2 artificial intelligence models before we respond to the comments of ezb in point 2 we want to mention that for ease of reference in our original paper we referred to and grouped the mars and gep methods as artificial intelligence models in the sense that we are referring to a general class of models that encompass non parametric regression methods such as mars and evolutionary methods such as gep in point 2 ezb first comment that our data preprocessing procedures are not necessary to develop our artificial intelligence ai models we respectfully disagree first we want to mention that to conduct a fair performance comparison of the individual linear time series and hybrid linear arch models with the artificial intelligence models i e gep and mars in our original study we believe it was important to use the same preprocessed transformed data to develop the individual linear time series hybrid linear arch and artificial intelligence models to allow us to maintain the same conditions when conducting our performance comparison of models since preprocessed transformed data were used to develop the individual linear time series and hybrid linear arch models in our original study for the reasons we discussed in point 1 of this closure we felt that the same preprocessed transformed data should be and was used to develop our gep and mars models to maintain the same conditions second and on a more general note we believe that data preprocessing procedures of which there are many different types ranging from simple to complex approaches that go well beyond our approach in the original study can often be useful to use before developing an artificial intelligence model and are common e g zhang and qi 2005 wu et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 kalteh 2016 quilty et al 2019 we believe that the many different data preprocessing approaches that are available can be useful to consider before developing artificial intelligence models for many reasons including 1 artificial intelligence models can sometimes have challenges to simultaneously deal with several components of the data appropriately and therefore data preprocessing can be useful quilty et al 2019 zuo et al 2020 hammad et al 2021 2 preprocessed data can help facilitate not only optimal model structure building processes but also alleviate potential overfitting problems of artificial intelligence models and can help improve the performance and stability of the model as well as speed up the training process and convergence during training nelson et al 1999 zhang and qi 2005 fijani et al 2019 zuo et al 2020 3 preprocessing of data can sometimes have a significant effect on the performance of artificial intelligence models and can help to deal with the impacts of for example noisy and unreliable data errors and outliers kotsiantis et al b 2006a garcia et al 2015 chitsaz et al 2016 fijani et al 2019 hammad et al 2021 the above are just some examples of reasons why data preprocessing of which there are many different types is often considered to be useful before developing artificial intelligence models ezb then comment that for the local analysis approach in the port elgin study site which is the only study site and type of analysis ezb provide gep and mars model results for in point 2 using the original raw data rather than the preprocessed transformed data results in more accurate mars and gep models in the port elgin study site we want to first mention an important point in their discussion paper ezb used nine inputs to develop their one mars model and one gep model which they developed using the original raw data for the port elgin study site in contrast our mars and gep models in the original study which were developed using our preprocessed transformed data used less than half the number of inputs i e one to four inputs with our best mars model using four inputs and our best gep model using three inputs we now want to mention a second important point if we compare our best mars model developed using our preprocessed data for the port elgin study site in our original study i e mars4 which has four inputs and has for the test phase r 0 731 rmse 36 69 m3 s mae 23 33 m3 s with the one mars model developed by ezb in their discussion paper developed using the original raw data for the port elgin study site which has nine inputs and has for the test phase r 0 714 rmse 36 38 m3 s and no mae result reported our r is actually 2 3 better while our rmse is 0 85 worse compared to the model of ezb so comparing our best mars model with the one mars model developed by ezb shows that our r was actually better and our rmse marginally worse less than 1 compared to the model developed by ezb these are very marginal differences and importantly our model used less than half the number of inputs following the important principle of parsimony in modeling we believe that this shows that our approach in our original study was suitable in that our model provided good results with few inputs e g basically the same results as the model of ezb but with less than half the model inputs and importantly our approach for the mars and gep model used the same preprocessed data that was used to develop our other models in the original study which we believe was important to allow us to maintain the same conditions when conducting our performance comparison of models for the one gep model that ezb developed that had a better performance compared to our best gep model we believe this was likely due in part to ezb using three times the number of inputs for their one gep model nine inputs for their gep model versus three inputs for our best gep model this implication is also clear in the results of our original study where our models with more inputs generally had better results e g our best gep model gep3 with three inputs had better results than our gep1 with one input or our best mars model mars4 with four inputs had better results than our mars1 with one input which is to be expected the decision of selecting what modeling approach to pursue depends on among other things the aims of the modeller and we want to re iterate that in our original study our overall aim and approach for our models i e individual linear time series hybrid linear arch and artificial intelligence was to develop simple and adequate models and also use the same data set i e preprocessed transformed in our case to develop all the models since we believe using the same data set was important in order to conduct a fair performance comparison of models as such our gep and mars models with few inputs but good results which were developed using the same preprocessed data as the other models in our original study adhered to our aims based on what we have discussed and keeping in mind our aims and the important principle of parsimony in modeling the above described approach that we selected in our original study to develop our mars and gep models was suitable on a final note ezb comment on the gep parameter values e g number of chromosomes mutation rate etc that we used for our gep models and then provide what they state are the optimum gep parameter values which they found through a trial and error process we want to point out that the use of our gep parameter values in the original study was suitable many other hydrological and environmental modeling studies have used the same or a very similar approach to ours with respect to the gep parameter values e g kisi and shiri 2012 hashmi and shamseldin 2014 zorn and shamseldin 2015 kisi et al 2015 al juboori and guven 2016 samadianfard et al 2018 bateni et al 2019 wang et al 2019 on a related note we want to point out that the gep parameter values provided by ezb were found through a trial and error process a trial and error approach contains variability especially one involving optimizing eleven different parameters as is the case for the gep model and different researchers undertaking a trial and error approach may each find a different set of optimal model parameter values we also want to point out that ezb did not provide any results of a gep model that used their optimal gep parameter values to assess if these gep model results differ very significantly from our gep model results using the same preprocessed data and the same set of model inputs as we used in the original paper however we believe it is quite likely that the different gep model parameter values that ezb suggest would not result in very significant important differences in gep model performance e g as was the case with the earlier described marginal differences in model results between using raw original data and processed data for the mars model having said all of this we want to emphasize again the most important point which is that the use of our gep parameter values in the original study was suitable as mentioned earlier many other hydrological and environmental modeling studies have used the same or a very similar approach to ours with respect to the gep parameter values 4 point 3 hybrid models ezb first comment that no results are given for arch and that using arch may provide results close to the hybrid models ar arch and ma arch ezb are stating that we should have compared the arch models alone with our other models e g ar arch and ma arch we respectfully disagree we want to point out that it did not make sense to compare the performance of arch models alone with our other models e g ar arch ma arch since the arch models in our study were fitted to the residuals of the linear ar and ma models to remove the arch effects in the residuals of the linear ar and ma models and build the hybrid ar arch and ma arch models ezb also comment that combining stochastic methods with gep can also yield good results we were aware that such hybrid models can be developed and may also provide good results coupling stochastic or time series models with artificial intelligence models for streamflow modeling has already been investigated in other studies e g moeeni et al 2017 including by the authors of the original paper e g mehdizadeh et al 2019b fathian et al 2019c however developing these types of hybrid time series artificial intelligence models and other possible types of hybrid models was outside the scope of our original study our aim was to develop hybrid linear arch models 5 point 4 external analysis ezb state that in our external analysis approach no value for q t at station 2 is recorded that can serve as a model input to predict q t at station 1 and comment that our external analysis approach is not valid we respectfully disagree ezb misinterpreted what we did in our external analysis approach in our valid external analysis approach we developed a procedure to estimate missing streamflow data at a target station station 1 using streamflow data from a neighboring station station 2 where we assumed that q t as well as q t 1 etc is observed available at the neighboring station but where q t is missing at the target station for any reason more specifically in our external analysis approach in the original study we had developed artificial intelligence models that could be used in our study sites to estimate missing monthly streamflow data at a target station q t using streamflow data that is observed available for the same time i e q t as well as for the past i e q t 1 etc from a neighboring station in the same river geographically near and with temporally similar characteristics when the target station streamflow data q t is not available which can be a common issue in practice e g if the target station has missing data due to a malfunction in the streamflow gauge in the original paper we state that under the external analysis approach the data of a neighboring station is used to estimate streamflow at each target station and for example that for the mars1 and gep1 models under the external analysis approach the streamflow data of the same month q t at a nearby station were used to estimate the streamflow q t at the target station in the same river we want to point out that a similar external analysis approach was successfully used by sanikhani and kisi 2012 in the context of estimating missing monthly streamflow data at a target station we obtained accurate results using our above described external analysis approach in the original study and this valid and suitable approach was useful to have explored 6 point 5 rmse mae and r regarding ezb s comments on our use of the aic we had used the aic as a suitable criterion e g salas et al 1988 hipel and mcleod 1994 to help select the optimum model i e best fitted model with optimum order among satisfactory candidates for each type class of individual linear time series model i e ar ma and each type class of hybrid linear arch model i e ar arch ma arch that we used and then compared based on their performance as explained below however we did not show the details of the selection process based on aic results since the original paper was already overly long after using the aic to select the optimum model for each type class of time series model i e ar ma ar arch ma arch we compared these selected models based on their performance via the rmse mae and r performance indices we respectfully disagree with ezb s comment that our approach described above to compare our selected individual linear time series models and hybrid linear arch models based on their performance via in our case the rmse mae and r performance indices is not appropriate and that we must instead use the aic to compare these selected time series models our approach which is valid and suitable was to compare our selected individual linear time series models and hybrid linear arch models based on their performance and we used the rmse mae and r performance indices as a suitable approach to do this 7 conclusion in this closure we responded to the comments of ezb and further explained the aims and reasoning behind our approaches and models and showed why our approaches and models are suitable based on the aims and scope of our study we also included additional details regarding several features of our study that we did not provide in the original paper since it was already overly lengthy to summarize the main points we discussed in this closure 1 individual linear time series and hybrid linear arch models we explained in more detail our aims scope reasoning and approach used to develop our individual linear time series and hybrid linear arch models and explained why our models were suitable given our aims 2 artificial intelligence models we explained why data preprocessing can be useful in artificial intelligence modeling and why it was used in our study 3 hybrid models we explained that comparing the performance of arch models alone with our other models as suggested by ezb did not make sense since our arch models were fitted to the residuals of the linear time series models to remove the arch effects in the residuals and build the hybrid linear arch models we also pointed out that developing hybrid time series artificial intelligence models and other possible types of hybrid models as suggested by ezb was outside the scope of our study which aimed to develop hybrid linear arch models 4 external analysis we explained why our external analysis approach was valid and useful 5 rmse mae and r we explained why our performance indices i e rmse mae and r were suitable to compare our models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

4412,nitrogen source identification is critical to effectively govern nitrogen contamination as excessive nitrogen content in groundwater has become a crucial global environmental problem the traditional stable isotope approach Œ¥15n no3 Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥15n nh4 has been widely used to identify nitrogen sources by comparing the isotopic signals between groundwater samples and the possible nitrogen source however nitrogen source apportionment based only on that method would be inaccurate because isotopic signals overlap between the nitrogen sources and nitrogen that has undergone biochemical reactions to solve the shortcomings of the traditional stable isotope approach the isotope ratios of n2o the sp Œ¥18o model and the traditional stable isotope approach were combined to depict the nitrogen transformation processes and reconstruct the initial isotopic compositions of nitrogen sources a total of 58 groundwater samples were collected in the dongguan basin and were analysed during june july 2018 no3 n was the dominant species of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in most of the groundwater samples in the groundwater flow direction no3 contents decreased while the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values increased the positive relationship between Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 and the calculation results of the sp Œ¥18o model indicated that both denitrification and nitrification processes occurred in the groundwater and denitrification acted as the dominant nitrogen transformation process the initial isotope ratio of nitrogen obtained from the combined use of the calculation results of the sp Œ¥18o model and Œ¥15n no3 or Œ¥15n nh4 value suggested that manure and septic wastes were the primary sources of no3 and nh4 in the groundwater the redox sensitive components and the calculation results of the sp Œ¥18o model depicted the reductive level of no3 in the groundwater flow direction no3 reduction did not occur in the upstream area no3 reduction was strong in the intermediate transition zone and no3 contents were completely consumed and ch4 occurred in the downstream region this study demonstrated that the combination of the traditional stable isotope approach and the isotope ratios of n2o are useful tools for revealing the source and transformation of nitrogen in groundwater the method used in this study provides new insight for nitrogen source identification keywords nitrous oxide stable isotopes nitrogen transformation initial isotope ratios source apportionment 1 introduction a comprehensive understanding of the source and transformation of nitrogen is critical to effective governance of groundwater resources as excessive nitrogen content in groundwater has become a crucial global environmental problem rivett et al 2008 the traditional stable isotope approach Œ¥15n no3 Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥15n nh4 has been widely used to identify nitrogen sources by comparing the isotopic signals between groundwater samples and the possible nitrogen sources as the major nitrogen sources show distinctly different isotopic signatures kendall 1998 this isotope approach can also be used to illustrate the transformation of nitrogen as the isotope fractionation effect is different in various biochemical reactions denk et al 2017 fenech et al 2012 nikolenko et al 2018 xue et al 2009 as a nonconservative element nitrogen easily participates in some biochemical reactions such as nitrification and denitrification that can significantly alter the original nitrogen isotope characteristics as a result nitrogen source apportionment obtained through the traditional isotope approach is inaccurate when the nitrogen participates in biochemical reactions especially when the isotopic signals overlap between nitrogen sources and nitrogen that has undergone biochemical reactions additional tools are therefore required to solve the shortcomings of the traditional stable isotope approach and to assist in identifying the nitrogen source and transformation processes in groundwater recently the traditional stable isotope approach Œ¥15n no3 Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥15n nh4 was combined with groundwater flow dynamics hosono et al 2013 some source identification models davis et al 2015 kim et al 2015 meghdadi and javar 2018 xue et al 2015 hydrochemical parameters minet et al 2017 past√©n zapata et al 2014 isotopic compositions of non n species seiler 2005 stoewer et al 2015 and or Œ¥15n values of n2o koba et al 2009 li et al 2014 well et al 2012 to reduce the uncertainties over source apportionment and nitrogen transformation in groundwater and the approach made some progress among those indicators the application of the most frequently used model the bayesian mixing model was based on knowing the Œ¥15n values of end members the hydrochemical parameters and isotopic compositions of non n species that acted as indirect indicators did not always appear together with nitrogen sources however n2o acted as the intermediate product or by product of nitrogen transformation and has extensive application potential different biochemical processes such as denitrification no3 no2 no n2o n2 nitrification nh4 nh2oh no2 n2o and nitrifier denitrification nh4 nh2oh no2 no n2o have been well documented in natural groundwater environments denk et al 2017 fenech et al 2012 nikolenko et al 2018 and the nitrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios of n2o have been proven to be powerful tools to differentiate these nitrogen pathways because the isotope enrichment factor for each reaction pathway is usually unique kim and craig 1993 rahn and wahlen 2000 toyoda et al 2011 yoshida and matsuo 1983 the nitrogen site preference sp values defined as the difference in Œ¥15n between the central and peripheral n atoms of linear n2o molecules has also been shown to be an effective way to distinguish different n2o production processes such as nitrification and denitrification without knowing the isotopic signature of the precursors garbeva et al 2007 ostrom and ostrom 2012 schmidt et al 2004 sutka et al 2006 sutka et al 2003 sutka et al 2004 toyoda et al 2005 yoshida and toyoda 2000 moreover with the knowledge of n2o isotopic fractionation and distinct sp values three kinds of isotopomer mixing approaches sp Œ¥Œ¥15n Œ¥Œ¥18o sp Œ¥15nbulk and sp Œ¥18o mapping approaches have been proposed and successfully applied to quantitatively calculate the relative contribution of nitrification denitrification to n2o production and the reduction ratios of n2o deppe et al 2017 koba et al 2009 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 toyoda et al 2011 well et al 2012 zou et al 2014 nevertheless there are some limitations in the application of the isotopomer mixing approach for the sp Œ¥Œ¥15n Œ¥Œ¥18o mapping approach the measured Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 values for natural samples generally undergo nitrate reduction and the measured values cannot represent the Œ¥15n signal of the original nitrate sources for the sp Œ¥15nbulk mapping approach the end member for nitrification or denitrification nitrifier denitrification was calculated through the observed Œ¥15n of the substrate soil culture experiment plus the literature values for Œµ 15n toyoda et al 2011 while Œµ 15n showed considerable variation and was affected by various factors denk et al 2017 the potential for oxygen exchange between no2 and h2o should be taken into account when applying the sp Œ¥18o mapping approach in an unsaturated soil environment ostrom et al 2010 unlike the unsaturated soil environment the saturated soil groundwater surface water and ocean environments generally show the lowest amounts of oxygen exchange and the highest apparent oxygen isotope enrichment menyailo and hungate 2006 snider et al 2013 wrage et al 2005 hence the sp Œ¥18o mapping approach was suitable in those environments even so the isotopologue ratios and isotopomer mixing approach of n2o are mainly applied in the soil environment to explore the total n2o flux and n2o source apportionment deppe et al 2017 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 toyoda et al 2011 zou et al 2014 and are seldom used in the groundwater environment in the present study the sp Œ¥18o mapping approach combined with the traditional multi isotope method was first applied in the regional groundwater environment to depict the nitrogen transformation processes and reconstruct the baseline of the isotopic composition of the nitrogen sources this was done to 1 identify the main microbial pathways of n2o production and consumption 2 calculate the relative contributions of those processes to n2o production in the groundwater and 3 reconstruct the baseline of the isotopic values of the major sources of no3 and nh4 through the combination of the relative contribution of denitrification nitrification and the Œ¥15n value of no3 nh4 overall this method could provide essential guidance for future studies on nitrogen sources and dynamics in groundwater 2 study area 2 1 general setting the field study was carried out in dongguan in the eastern part of the pearl river delta southern china over an area of 2465 km2 fig 1 the region is bounded to the north by the east river to the west by the pearl river and to the southeast by low hills the altitude of this region tends to decrease westward from the hilly area to the alluvial plain the dongguan basin has a southern subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 22 7 c and annual mean precipitation of 1842 mm during 1980 2018 the rainy season occurs from april to september with approximately 80 of the total annual precipitation occurring in this period 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the rock types outcropping in the study area are predominantly of terrestrial sedimentary origin representing geological intervals from the sinian to quaternary fig 1a guo et al 2012 the sinian sediments crop out in the northern part of the study area and consist of gneiss schist metasandstone and migmatites carboniferous to permian strata crop out in the eastern part of the study area cover 2 of the total region and are composed of limestone and dolomite ordovician to silurian strata and upper triassic to palaeogene strata widely distributed in the southeastern part of the study area are composed of red siltstone sandstone glutenite and conglomerate and have thicknesses ranging from 300 1500 m zhu et al 2010 the quaternary sediments are mainly found in the river network area northwest of the study area consisting of sand and gravel with interbedded silty sand and clay and thicknesses varying from 20 to 30 m huang et al 2013 yanshanian intrusive rocks formed during the early ordovician to middle late jurassic periods also crop out in the northwestern part of the study area and consist of granite and granodiorite song et al 2011 the study region can be divided into four hydrostratigraphic groups according to lithology and pore structure the pore fissure water stored in the siltstone sandstone and glutenite of the ordovician to silurian strata and the upper triassic to palaeogene strata represents the first hydrostratigraphic group the fissure water in the schist gneiss metasandstone and migmatites of the sinian strata and in the granite and granodiorite of the yanshanian intrusive rocks is the second hydrostratigraphic group the rocks in the first and second groups are characterized by low permeability except in fractures and faults and the groundwater is mainly recharged by precipitation and lateral inflow from bedrock mao et al 2015 the karstic fissure water in the limestones and dolomites of the carboniferous to permian strata represents the third hydrostratigraphic group the strata in this group is characterized by moderate permeability the groundwater stored in the quaternary sediments acts as the fourth hydrostratigraphic group these sediments show low to moderate permeability the groundwater in the four hydrostratigraphic groups is shallow groundwater due to its unconfined nature and shallow burial depth mao et al 2018 the four hydrostratigraphic groups are connected via pores and fractures the groundwater flows from southeast to northwest and eventually enters the pearl river fig 1b 2 3 land use the study area has experienced rapid urbanization and industrialization since the reform and opening up of china in 1978 wong et al 2002 the information from the dongguan statistical yearbook shows that the permanent resident population in this region has increased from 1 15 million to 8 39 million in the past 32 years 1982 2018 and 44 04 of farmland and 42 89 of woodland have been converted into construction land fig 2 the newly formed construction land represents the newly formed urbanization region which has been widely used for industrial production and residences for the nonlocal population septic tanks containing faeces and domestic wastewater are the most common sewage systems in these regions the septic tanks generally lack a proper seepage control facility thus sewage and septic waste commonly infiltrates into the groundwater sun et al 2009 based on the data obtained from the national geoscience data sharing platform land use in the area in 2018 was mainly construction land which accounts for nearly 47 04 of the total area followed by woodland with 20 05 coverage and farmland with 19 58 coverage the remaining area included surface water 9 25 grassland 2 18 shrubwood 1 53 and wetland 0 21 fig 2b the most frequent crops in farmland are paddy tuber crops and sugarcane and pig manure is the most commonly used fertilizer 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling a total of 58 unconfined groundwater samples were collected from domestic wells which sidewall is permeable in june 2018 before sampling the well depths and groundwater burial depths were measured using a water level meter and the groundwater levels were calculated on a gis platform by subtracting the groundwater burial depths from the topographic elevations then water totalling more than 3 borehole volumes was pumped from the domestic wells temperature t ph oxidizing reducing potential orp and dissolved oxygen do were measured in

bubbles and were preserved with 0 1 ml of saturated hgcl2 samples used to measure the concentrations of dissolved gases ch4 and n2o and the stable isotope values of n2o were collected in 20 ml head space bottles and 120 ml wheaton glass serum vials respectively using a peristaltic pump briefly after an overflow of groundwater the tubing of the peristaltic pump was carefully removed and the bottles were immediately sealed using butyl rubber septa and aluminium crimp caps without trapping air bubbles on site those samples were preserved with 0 1 ml of saturated hgcl2 solution for groundwater samples that used for the determination of those indicators 2 to 3 replications per sampling points were collected all samples were brought back to the laboratory of the school of environmental science and engineering sun yat sen university and stored at 4 c before analysis 3 2 laboratory analysis the cl contents were determined by ion chromatography thermo ics 900 with a 5

elementar the concentrations of dissolved gases ch4 and n2o were measured by the headspace method using gas chromatography shimadzu gc 2014 sample preparation for the gas analyses included removing 10 ml of groundwater and injecting 10 ml of pure helium and subsequent equilibration of the gas phase and liquid at a constant temperature 25 c the denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 sigman et al 2001 was used to determine the isotope values of no3 in the groundwater samples briefly no3 was converted to n2o and n2o was extracted and purified through a precon system and analysed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermal fisher delta v the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values were calibrated using three international standards namely iaea no 3 usgs34 and usgs35 according to the results of replicate measurements of the standards and samples the analytical precision standard deviation for Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 was 0 4 and 0 5 respectively the acidified disk diffusion method was used to analyse the isotope composition of nh4 in brief the dissolved nh4 in the groundwater was converted to nh3 gas by adjusting the ph values to 8 9 and was subsequently trapped on an acidified quartz disk on which a few drops of 1 m sulfate were placed and packed by a gas permeable hydrophobic membrane the formed nh4 2so4 on the quartz disk was then measured by ea irms flash 2000 delta v advantage samples were prepared in duplicate in batches including internal lab standards nh4cl Œ¥15n of 1 20 and water blanks the Œ¥15n nh4 values were calibrated by the working standard urea Œ¥15n of

equilibrium method was the pretreatment method for the determination of the isotope values of dissolved n2o in the groundwater its processing procedures include drawing 30 ml of groundwater from the sampling vials and simultaneously injecting 30 ml of pure helium into the sampling vials by syringe and then equilibrating the gas phase and liquid at a constant temperature 25 c after the gas liquid equilibrium 20 ml of the headspace gas was extracted and introduced into an evacuated airbag then 20 ml of pure helium was once again injected into the sampling vials to the gas liquid equilibrium this procedure was repeated to achieve the optimum concentration for analysis by a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime 100 the prepared water ultra pure water after aeration was injected with certified gas internal lab standard gas n2o huate gas guangdong and achieved water gas equilibrium the same experimental processes were also conducted to check whether the equilibrium method will cause obvious isotopic fractionation between dissolved and gaseous n2o the Œ¥ values of the processed lab gas 3 85 for Œ¥15nbulk and 44 08 for Œ¥18o n2o were close to those of the original internal lab gas 3 98 for Œ¥15nbulk and 43 92 for Œ¥18o n2o indicating that no significant isotope fractionation occurs during the n2o diffusion process the investigation of the kinetic stable nitrogen and oxygen isotope fractionations between aqueous dissolved and gaseous n2o conducted by inoue also showed minimal fractionation and the changes in Œ¥ values from water to gas were 0 7 for n and 1 1 for o inoue and mook 1994 the isotopomer ratios of Œ¥15nbulk Œ¥18o n2o and Œ¥15nŒ± were determined and Œ¥15nŒ≤ was obtained from eq 1 the Œ¥15nŒ± eq 2 and Œ¥15nŒ≤ eq 3 represent the nitrogen isotopic

and sustainable development chinese academy of agricultural sciences 3 3 sp Œ¥18o mapping approach as described in the introduction the 15n site preference of n2o sp is a powerful tool for n2o source identification because sp values are independent of the substrate isotopic composition and differ according to different pathways park et al 2011 sutka et al 2006 sutka et al 2003 sutka et al 2004 yoshida and toyoda 2000 the reported sp values for n2o produced by nitrifier denitrification bacterial denitrification nitrification and fungal denitrification are 0 8 5 8 0 5 1 9 33 5 1 2 and 35 6 3 1 respectively denk et al 2017 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 sutka et al 2006 sutka et al 2003 sutka et al 2004 accordingly to estimate the relative contributions of different processes to n2o production one higher sp value group nitrification or fungal denitrification and one lower sp value group bacterial denitrification or nitrifier denitrification were chosen as the end members fig 3 the common Œ¥18o end member values which were also chosen from the known most relevant literature data varied from 17 4 to 21 4 from 19 8 to 26 5 from 40 6 to 51 9 and from 36 5 to 55 2 for bacterial denitrification nitrifier denitrification fungal denitrification and nitrification respectively deppe et al 2017 frame and casciotti 2010 heil et al 2014 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 rohe et al 2014 sutka et al 2008 sutka et al 2006 the individual wide range of Œ¥18o n2o values obtained from pure culture studies were not considered here as the various degrees of oxygen exchange with ambient water for pure culture studies whereas groundwater has a stable environment and generally shows the relatively low amounts of oxygen exchange lewicka szczebak et al 2017 lewicka szczebak et al 2016 snider et al 2013 consequently if n2o reduction is not occurring the isotope two terminal mixing model eq 5 can be used to estimate the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification on n2o production toyoda et al 2011 well et al 2012 5 sp0 x spnit 1 x spdenit 6 spobs sp0 Œµred ln c c0 where spobs sp0 spnit and spdenit indicate the observed sp values sp values before n2o reduction and sp values produced by nitrification and denitrification respectively variables x and 1 x represent the relative contributions of nitrification and denitrification respectively however the occurrence of n2o reduction can lead to 15n and 18o being more enriched in residual n2o furthermore sp values will increase as Œ¥18o n2o increases thus the sp sp0 and Œ¥18o n2o values without n2o reduction need to be calculated through eq 6 parameters Œµred and c c0 represent the enrichment factors for reduction and the residue ratios of n2o the slope of the n2o reduction vector 0 35 for sp Œ¥18o n2o jinuntuya

used to calculate the sp0 values and n2o reduction ratios eq 6 4 results 4 1 field parameters and redox sensitive components the field parameters and the contents of the redox sensitive components no3 nh4 mn2 fe2 n2o and ch4 of the groundwater are summarized in table 1 groundwater burial depths were shallow with values varying from 0 00 to 8 00 m and 75 of them were 2 m groundwater levels suggested that the groundwater flows from the southeast to the northwest fig 1b the do contents ranged between 0 31 and 7 69 mg l and 25 samples among the total analysed samples were lower than 2 mg l fig 4 a the orp values varied over a wide range 217 0 274 4 mv and the negative values mostly occurred in the northeastern part of the study area and the downstream region and decreased over the flow path fig 4b the do contents and orp values indicated that both oxidizing and reducing environments were present in the groundwater as redox sensitive components the distributions of no3 nh4 mn2 and ch4 follow the variations in orp values the highest no3 concentrations were found in the southwestern part of the study area the oxidation zone while the lower contents were in the northeastern part the reduction zone it was also observed that no3 contents generally decreased along the groundwater flow path fig 4f the relatively higher nh4 and ch4 content mostly existed in the wells with negative orp values fig 4d and fig s1 the nh4 n contents in most samples ranged from undetectable to 0 32 mg l except for dg33 7 28 mg l and dg46 12 81 mg l the mn2 concentrations were detected in some wells and varied from 0 01 to 1 08 mg l the highest ch4 contents reached 5993 57 Œºg l and samples with high ch4 contents were mostly located in the northeastern part of the study area fig 4d the existence of ch4 also suggested a stronger reducing environment in this region the existence of n2o indicated the occurrence of nitrification or denitrification in the groundwater samples with high n2o concentrations generally showed lower ch4 contents fig 4d 4e and fig s2 no ordered distribution was observed for n2o content along the groundwater flow path 4 2 isotopic values the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values of the groundwater samples ranged from 6 68 to 26 23 and from 6 59 to 13 72 respectively samples with higher no3 contents generally have lower isotope compositions in contrast samples with lower no3 contents were characterized by higher isotope compositions fig 4f 4 g 4 h the Œ¥15n no3 values exhibited a positive correlation r2 0 33 p 0 01 with those of Œ¥18o no3 fig 5 a the nh4 n content only existed in a few wells and the Œ¥15n nh4 values ranged from 10 10 to 26 24 with a mean value of 16 79 fig 6 large variations in Œ¥15nbulk 19 43 22 76 Œ¥18o n2o 28 93 59 76 and sp 1 55 36 02 were observed both Œ¥15nbulk r2 0 44 p 0 05 and sp r2 0 72 p 0 01 exhibited a positive correlation with Œ¥18o n2o fig 7 5 discussion 5 1 dilemma of n source apportionment under n transformation 5 1 1 disturbance of denitrification on nitrate source apportionment nitrate source identification based on the dual isotope approach Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 was generally conducted by comparing the isotopic signals between the groundwater samples and the possible nitrogen source the observed Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values of most samples were located in the expected ranges of manure and septic waste zones fig 5a possibly indicating the manure and septic waste sources of the nitrate in the groundwater however nitrate source identification should take into account the occurrence of the overall denitrification line that probably started from the ammonium fertilizer zone or soil nitrate zone fig 5a the isotope signatures and concentrations of nitrate are commonly used to identify denitrification processes in groundwater several studies have suggested that Œ¥Œ¥15n Œ¥Œ¥18o ratios associated with denitrification are close to the range of 1 3 to 2 1 fukada et al 2003 mengis et al 1999 the Œ¥15n values of the residual no3 generally increase with a decrease in no3 content the no3 n cl ratio rather than no3 n is used to identify denitrification processes because the dilution effect obscures the linear relationship between ln no3 n and Œ¥15n no3 fenton et al 2009 as shown in fig 5 Œ¥15n no3 was positively associated with Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥Œ¥15n Œ¥Œ¥18o 2 0 and was negatively associated with ln no3 n cl proving that denitrification occurred in the groundwater according to the analysis above the change in the nitrate isotope signals during denitrification complicates identification of the nitrate source 5 1 2 disturbance of nitrification on ammonium source apportionment fig 6 shows the map of Œ¥15n nh4 versus nh4 n concentrations and the measured Œ¥15n nh4 values are also compared to the typical ranges of Œ¥15n nh4 values in various ammonium sources the negative correlation between Œ¥15n nh4 and nh4 n content implied that nitrification or volatilization might exist in the groundwater because both nitrification and volatilization result in a decrease in nh4 n content and an increase in Œ¥15n nh4 values denk et al 2017 nikolenko et al 2018 the acidic groundwater environment with an average ph value of 5 99 indicated that volatilization could be ignored however it was difficult to judge whether nitrification occurs as the nh4 n concentrations in most of the groundwater samples are lower than the detection limit it seems that ammonium in the groundwater possibly originated from manure septic effluents or feedlot runoff fig 6 in brief it was difficult to identify the source and transformation of ammonium only by the isotope compositions and contents of ammonium 5 2 simultaneous identification of n transformation processes and baseline nitrogen isotope values by nitrogen isotope and n2o isotopologue ratios 5 2 1 n2o production n2o in groundwater generally originates from soil n2o that is produced in the unsaturated zone and dissolved in the groundwater via diffusion and seepage or is produced in the groundwater groffman et al 2002 hiscock et al 2003 m√ºhlherr and hiscock 1998 well et al 2005 the n2o concentrations in the groundwater table 1 are highly elevated compared to the n2o concentrations in the unsaturated zone of this region which varied from 0 00 to 8 51 Œºg l with a mean of 0 92 Œºg l indicating that n2o diffusion from the unsaturated zone to the groundwater was negligible within the saturated zone denitrification was supposed to be the predominant process for n2o production because organic matter as the electron donor was present and nitrate was the dominant species of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in most of the wells in the study area table 1 n2o production by nitrification was also possible as ammonium was the dominant species of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in a few wells dg33 dg46 and the dissolved oxygen contents in part of the aquifer do not inhibit nitrification ueda et al 1991 in addition n2o production by nitrification could also occur in wells with nh4 n concentrations below detection because the immediate nitrification of organic n is possible and nh4 n will not accumulate bateman and baggs 2005 5 2 2 evidence for n transformation from isotopologue ratios of n2o the sp Œ¥18o mapping approach has been used to differentiate between processes deppe et al 2017 li et al 2020 or to identify n2o reduction to n2 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 lin et al 2018 well et al 2012 in soil or groundwater environment the research shows that sp Œ¥18o mapping approach is suitable to identify and quantify n2o reduction or the contribution of different processes to the total n2o content lewicka szczebak et al 2017 however it has been pointed out that the Œ¥18o n2o value was crucial to support better quantitative estimation of the processes of n2o production and consumption because the control of Œ¥18o n2o value is more complex koba et al 2009 the Œ¥18o n2o value depends on Œ¥18o no3 and o exchange it has been found that the extent of o exchange was almost complete in some unsaturated soil kool et al 2009 well et al 2012 hence the potential for o exchange between no2 and h2o should be taken into account when applying the sp Œ¥18o mapping approach in an unsaturated soil environment kool et al 2009 anyway the sp Œ¥18o mapping approach was suitable in saturated soil or groundwater as the lowest amounts of oxygen exchange occurred in these situations snider et al 2013 wrage et al 2005 here the sp Œ¥18o mapping approach fig 2 was applied to distinguish between nitrification and denitrification as the sources of n2o in the groundwater however the overlap of sp values for bacterial denitrification and nitrifier denitrification or for fungal denitrification and nitrification make n2o source partitioning difficult fungal denitrification has been identified as the dominant process for n2o emission in grassland and desert soils laughlin et al 2009 marusenko et al 2013 however it is uncommon in the natural environment thus fungal denitrification was not considered here as the dominant land use categories of the study area are construction land farmland and woodland fig 2b n2o formation during nh4 oxidation was likely to proceed via the nh2oh to n2o pathway rather than through nitrifier denitrification because of the relatively high do concentrations in some wells the relatively high sp values also implied the pathway of nh4 oxidation nh2oh n2o because the n2o produced from bacterial denitrification and nitrifier denitrification both showed low sp values 0 5 1 9 and 0 8 5 8 therefore bacterial denitrification and nitrification have been taken as the major processes for n2o formation in the study area as shown in fig 7a the n2o sources of all samples could be explained as resulting from the mixing of denitrification n2o and nitrification n2o followed by n2o reduction the maximum and minimum contributions of denitrification are shown in table 2 the average maximum and minimum contributions of denitrification to the total n2o were 87 17 and 55 71 respectively while the average maximum and minimum contributions of nitrification to the total n2o were 44 29 and 12 83 respectively the corresponding average reduction ratios were 74 99 and 30 53 respectively the results of the computation showed that the high contribution of denitrification together with strong n2o reduction was common in the groundwater accordingly denitrification acted as the dominant process for nitrogen transformation and the produced n2o was strongly reduced to n2 in the groundwater the n2o reduction process can also be identified through the isotope signals of n2o because the process could lead to an increase in Œ¥15nbulk Œ¥18o n2o and sp values in the residual n2o koba et al 2009 well et al 2012 well and flessa 2010 accordingly most of the groundwater samples are located outside the shaded region and the significant positive correlations between sp and Œ¥18o n2o fig 7a and between Œ¥15nbulk n2o and Œ¥18o n2o fig 7b suggested the occurrence of n2o reduction in the groundwater in addition to n2o reduction n2o diffusion also influences n2o consumption research on the kinetic stable nitrogen and oxygen isotope fractionations between aqueous dissolved and gaseous n2o revealed that the isotope effect for n2o diffusion was small and the changes in Œ¥ values from water to gas were 0 7 for n and 1 1 for o inoue and mook 1994 thus the n2o diffusion processes will not be discussed here 5 2 3 reconstruction of baseline isotope ratios and source apportionment of no3 and nh4 as previously described chemical and isotopic data indicated that nitrification and denitrification altered the no3 and nh4 isotope ratios and complicated nitrogen source apportionment for each groundwater sample the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification to n2o production was estimated from the sp Œ¥18o model table 2 the isotopic composition of the nitrate was not affected by denitrification when the relative contribution of denitrification was 0 consequently the calculated relative contribution of denitrification was combined with the measured values of Œ¥15n no3 to reconstruct the initial Œ¥15n values for nitrate the Œ¥15n no3 values 10 19 14 14 in three samples with the contribution of denitrification ratios of 0 represented the isotopic composition of the nitrate sources similarly the intercept of the linear regression line 10 36 9 25 for the min max contribution of denitrification fig 8 a 8b also represented the initial isotopic signals of the nitrate source generally nitrate pollution in groundwater is mostly caused by ammonium fertilizer nitrate fertilizer soil ammonium atmospheric deposits or manure and septic waste xue et al 2009 the initial isotopic signals of no3 9 25 14 14 fell within the expected ranges of manure and septic waste 4 25 fig 5 indicating that manure and septic waste were the primary sources of nitrate in the groundwater the nitrate source identification was in accordance with the actual situation because of the frequent use of manure and the universal existence of septic tanks in the study area similar to nitrate the initial Œ¥15n values of ammonium were reconstructed by the calculated relative contribution of nitrification and the measured values of Œ¥15n nh4 the Œ¥15n nh4 value in sample dg46 with a contribution of nitrification ratios of 0 was 14 01 and the intercept of the fitting line was 14 22 10 71 fig 8c 8d which provided the initial isotopic compositions of the ammonium sources these initial Œ¥15n values fall in the isotopic range of manure and septic effluent 10 20 xue et al 2009 suggesting the manure and septic effluent sources of ammonium in the groundwater the occurrence of nitrification also complicated nitrate source identification the Œ¥15n no3 value should be similar to the Œ¥15n value of the precursors when nh4 n was almost completely converted into no3 n during the nitrification process the Œ¥18o value of no3 produced by nitrification was determined by Œ¥18o h2o and Œ¥18o o2 in theory 2 3 of o no3 was derived from o h2o and 1 3 of o no3 was incorporated from o o2 23 5 accordingly the no3 derived from nitrification should have Œ¥18o no3 values ranging from 2 31 to 4 82 overall even though the measured Œ¥18o values of approximately a quarter of the samples were in the range of these calculated values it was hard to confirm that the calculated Œ¥18o values were the initial Œ¥18o values of no3 produced by nitrification because 1 significant isotopic fractionation could occur during the incorporation of o h2o and o o2 into no3 2 the incorporation of h2o and o2 into no3 generally did not work at ratios of 2 1 kendall 1998 xue et al 2009 and 3 denitrification increased the Œ¥18o values of no3 fig 5a both the nitrate and ammonium originated from manure and septic effluents and the overlap of Œ¥18o values in no3 derived from nitrification and manure septic effluents makes it hard to distinguish the two sources in summary considering the high contribution of denitrification to the total n2o nitrate in the groundwater mainly originated from manure and septic wastes while part of it was derived from the mixing of no3 produced from nitrification and no3 in manure septic effluents 5 3 type of denitrification and data interpretation in the groundwater flow direction 5 3 1 assessment of the denitrification type in the groundwater the results calculated by the sp Œ¥18o model showed that denitrification was the dominant process for nitrogen transformation in the groundwater generally denitrification processes are linked either to organic matter oxidation heterotrophic denitrification or to reduced state element oxidation autotrophic denitrification no dissolved fe contents were detected table 1 and the isotope signals of sulphate fell within the expected ranges of the atmospheric deposition region rather than within the range of the sulphide oxidation region fig s3 suggesting that both reduced iron and reduced sulphur were not electron donors during the denitrification process the detected ch4 contents in some wells indicated the occurrence of methanogenesis methane formation a heterotrophic microbial reaction requires organic matter to act as the electron donor it is the final stage of the reductive sequence that generally begins with the reduction of o2 followed by the reduction of no3 mn oxide fe oxide and so4 2 appelo and postma 2005 its occurrence demonstrated that the groundwater environment contains a certain quality of organic matter that acted as the reductant for oxygen reduction denitrification mn oxide reduction and methanogenesis processes and heterotrophic denitrification was the denitrification type in this aquifer as a result o2 no3 mn oxide and organic matter as the reactant decreased while mn2 and ch4 as the products appeared in part of the aquifer after participating in the redox reactions 5 3 2 data interpretation in the groundwater flow direction the distributions of o2 no3 n mn2 and ch4 contents along the groundwater flow path broadly fit the changes in reactants and products in the ideal redox sequence accordingly the aquifer can be divided into 3 zones fig 4 zone 1 acted as the recharge area and was characterized by an oxidizing or micro anaerobic environment the groundwater samples in this zone showed moderate to high no3 n contents low n2o contents low mn2 contents and low ch4 contents the three samples with denitrification ratios of 0 were also located in this region fig 9 a all these observations demonstrated that the groundwater samples in this zone were not affected or were slightly affected by denitrification as a result lower isotope compositions of no3 and minimal reduction ratios of n2o were detected fig 4g fig 9b the dissolved o2 contents were consumed in zone 2 the intermediate flow area and the highest n2o contents in this region indicated that denitrification was the dominant redox reaction accordingly lower no3 n contents and wide variations in no3 isotopic compositions were observed after the groundwater passed zone 2 the n2o contents returned to low values in zone 3 near the groundwater discharge area the stronger reducing environment combined with higher n2o reduction ratios indicated that the n2o was consumed and converted to n2 in this region the occurrence of dissolved mn2 contents and ch4 contents also suggested that large amounts of no3 were consumed and the reduction of mn oxide and methanogenesis was the dominant redox reaction thus samples with low no3 contents in this zone have higher no3 isotopic signals and a higher contribution of denitrification 6 conclusion to overcome the shortcoming that the traditional stable isotope approach Œ¥15n no3 Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥15n nh4 could not simultaneously recognize the source and transformation of nitrogen the isotope ratios of n2o the sp Œ¥18o model and the traditional stable isotope approach were combined to depict the nitrogen transformation processes and reconstruct the initial isotopic compositions of the nitrogen sources in dongguan basin the key conclusions include the following 1 both denitrification and nitrification processes occurred in the groundwater while denitrification acted as the dominant nitrogen transformation process 2 the average maximum and minimum reduction ratios of n2o were 74 99 and 30 53 respectively indicating that n2o reduction was common in the groundwater 3 the initial isotope ratio of nitrogen obtained from the combined use of the calculation results of the sp Œ¥18o model and Œ¥15n no3 or Œ¥15n nh4 value suggested that manure and septic wastes were the primary sources of no3 and nh4 in the groundwater 4 the reductive level of no3 changed in the groundwater flow direction no3 reduction did not occur in the upstream area no3 reduction was strong in the intermediate transition zone and no3 contents were completely consumed and ch4 occurred in the downstream region overall the current study revealed that the method used in this study was useful for exactly depicting the sources and transformation processes of nitrogen in the groundwater environment the method emphasized here can be of use in various other areas credit authorship contribution

4412,nitrogen source identification is critical to effectively govern nitrogen contamination as excessive nitrogen content in groundwater has become a crucial global environmental problem the traditional stable isotope approach Œ¥15n no3 Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥15n nh4 has been widely used to identify nitrogen sources by comparing the isotopic signals between groundwater samples and the possible nitrogen source however nitrogen source apportionment based only on that method would be inaccurate because isotopic signals overlap between the nitrogen sources and nitrogen that has undergone biochemical reactions to solve the shortcomings of the traditional stable isotope approach the isotope ratios of n2o the sp Œ¥18o model and the traditional stable isotope approach were combined to depict the nitrogen transformation processes and reconstruct the initial isotopic compositions of nitrogen sources a total of 58 groundwater samples were collected in the dongguan basin and were analysed during june july 2018 no3 n was the dominant species of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in most of the groundwater samples in the groundwater flow direction no3 contents decreased while the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values increased the positive relationship between Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 and the calculation results of the sp Œ¥18o model indicated that both denitrification and nitrification processes occurred in the groundwater and denitrification acted as the dominant nitrogen transformation process the initial isotope ratio of nitrogen obtained from the combined use of the calculation results of the sp Œ¥18o model and Œ¥15n no3 or Œ¥15n nh4 value suggested that manure and septic wastes were the primary sources of no3 and nh4 in the groundwater the redox sensitive components and the calculation results of the sp Œ¥18o model depicted the reductive level of no3 in the groundwater flow direction no3 reduction did not occur in the upstream area no3 reduction was strong in the intermediate transition zone and no3 contents were completely consumed and ch4 occurred in the downstream region this study demonstrated that the combination of the traditional stable isotope approach and the isotope ratios of n2o are useful tools for revealing the source and transformation of nitrogen in groundwater the method used in this study provides new insight for nitrogen source identification keywords nitrous oxide stable isotopes nitrogen transformation initial isotope ratios source apportionment 1 introduction a comprehensive understanding of the source and transformation of nitrogen is critical to effective governance of groundwater resources as excessive nitrogen content in groundwater has become a crucial global environmental problem rivett et al 2008 the traditional stable isotope approach Œ¥15n no3 Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥15n nh4 has been widely used to identify nitrogen sources by comparing the isotopic signals between groundwater samples and the possible nitrogen sources as the major nitrogen sources show distinctly different isotopic signatures kendall 1998 this isotope approach can also be used to illustrate the transformation of nitrogen as the isotope fractionation effect is different in various biochemical reactions denk et al 2017 fenech et al 2012 nikolenko et al 2018 xue et al 2009 as a nonconservative element nitrogen easily participates in some biochemical reactions such as nitrification and denitrification that can significantly alter the original nitrogen isotope characteristics as a result nitrogen source apportionment obtained through the traditional isotope approach is inaccurate when the nitrogen participates in biochemical reactions especially when the isotopic signals overlap between nitrogen sources and nitrogen that has undergone biochemical reactions additional tools are therefore required to solve the shortcomings of the traditional stable isotope approach and to assist in identifying the nitrogen source and transformation processes in groundwater recently the traditional stable isotope approach Œ¥15n no3 Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥15n nh4 was combined with groundwater flow dynamics hosono et al 2013 some source identification models davis et al 2015 kim et al 2015 meghdadi and javar 2018 xue et al 2015 hydrochemical parameters minet et al 2017 past√©n zapata et al 2014 isotopic compositions of non n species seiler 2005 stoewer et al 2015 and or Œ¥15n values of n2o koba et al 2009 li et al 2014 well et al 2012 to reduce the uncertainties over source apportionment and nitrogen transformation in groundwater and the approach made some progress among those indicators the application of the most frequently used model the bayesian mixing model was based on knowing the Œ¥15n values of end members the hydrochemical parameters and isotopic compositions of non n species that acted as indirect indicators did not always appear together with nitrogen sources however n2o acted as the intermediate product or by product of nitrogen transformation and has extensive application potential different biochemical processes such as denitrification no3 no2 no n2o n2 nitrification nh4 nh2oh no2 n2o and nitrifier denitrification nh4 nh2oh no2 no n2o have been well documented in natural groundwater environments denk et al 2017 fenech et al 2012 nikolenko et al 2018 and the nitrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios of n2o have been proven to be powerful tools to differentiate these nitrogen pathways because the isotope enrichment factor for each reaction pathway is usually unique

of linear n2o molecules has also been shown to be an effective way to distinguish different n2o production processes such as nitrification and denitrification without knowing the isotopic signature of the precursors garbeva et al 2007 ostrom and ostrom 2012 schmidt et al 2004 sutka et al 2006 sutka et al 2003 sutka et al 2004 toyoda et al 2005 yoshida and toyoda 2000 moreover with the knowledge of n2o isotopic fractionation and distinct sp values three kinds of isotopomer mixing approaches sp Œ¥Œ¥15n Œ¥Œ¥18o sp Œ¥15nbulk and sp Œ¥18o mapping approaches have been proposed and successfully applied to quantitatively calculate the relative contribution of nitrification denitrification to n2o production and the reduction ratios of n2o deppe et al 2017 koba et al 2009 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 toyoda et al 2011 well et al 2012 zou et al 2014 nevertheless there are some limitations in the application of the isotopomer mixing approach for the sp Œ¥Œ¥15n Œ¥Œ¥18o mapping approach the measured Œ¥15n Œ¥18o no3 values for natural samples generally undergo nitrate reduction and the measured values cannot represent the Œ¥15n signal of the original nitrate sources for the sp Œ¥15nbulk mapping approach the end member for nitrification or denitrification nitrifier denitrification was calculated through the observed Œ¥15n of the substrate soil culture experiment plus the literature values for Œµ 15n toyoda et al 2011 while Œµ 15n showed considerable variation and was affected by various factors denk et al 2017 the potential for oxygen exchange between no2 and h2o should be taken into account when applying the sp Œ¥18o mapping approach in an unsaturated soil environment ostrom et al 2010 unlike the unsaturated soil environment the saturated soil groundwater surface water and ocean environments generally show the lowest amounts of oxygen exchange and the highest apparent oxygen isotope enrichment menyailo and hungate 2006 snider et al 2013 wrage et al 2005 hence the sp Œ¥18o mapping approach was suitable in those environments even so the isotopologue ratios and isotopomer mixing approach of n2o are mainly applied in the soil environment to explore the total n2o flux and n2o source apportionment deppe et al 2017 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 toyoda et al 2011 zou et al 2014 and are seldom used in the groundwater environment in the present study the sp Œ¥18o mapping approach combined with the traditional multi isotope method was first applied in the regional groundwater environment to depict the nitrogen transformation processes and reconstruct the baseline of the isotopic composition of the nitrogen sources this was done to 1 identify the main microbial pathways of n2o production and consumption 2 calculate the relative contributions of those processes to n2o production in the groundwater and 3 reconstruct the baseline of the isotopic values of the major sources of no3 and nh4 through the combination of the relative contribution of denitrification nitrification and the Œ¥15n value of no3 nh4 overall this method could provide essential guidance for future studies on nitrogen sources and dynamics in groundwater 2 study area 2 1 general setting the field study was carried out in dongguan in the eastern part of the pearl river delta southern china over an area of 2465 km2 fig 1 the region is bounded to the north by the east river to the west by the pearl river and to the southeast by low hills the altitude of this region tends to decrease westward from the hilly area to the alluvial plain the dongguan basin has a southern subtropical monsoon climate with an annual mean temperature of 22 7 c and annual mean precipitation of 1842 mm during 1980 2018 the rainy season occurs from april to september with approximately 80 of the total annual precipitation occurring in this period 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the rock types outcropping in the study area are predominantly of terrestrial sedimentary origin representing geological intervals from the sinian to quaternary fig 1a guo et al 2012 the sinian sediments crop out in the northern part of the study area and consist of gneiss schist metasandstone and migmatites carboniferous to permian strata crop out in the eastern part of the study area cover 2 of the total region and are composed of limestone and dolomite ordovician to silurian strata and upper triassic to palaeogene strata widely distributed in the southeastern part of the study area are composed of red siltstone sandstone glutenite and conglomerate and have thicknesses ranging from 300 1500 m zhu et al 2010 the quaternary sediments are mainly found in the river network area northwest of the study area consisting of sand and gravel with interbedded silty sand and clay and thicknesses varying from 20 to 30 m huang et al 2013 yanshanian intrusive rocks formed during the early ordovician to middle late jurassic periods also crop out in the northwestern part of the study area and consist of granite and granodiorite song et al 2011 the study region can be divided into four hydrostratigraphic groups according to lithology and pore structure the pore fissure water stored in the siltstone sandstone and glutenite of the ordovician to silurian strata and the upper triassic to palaeogene strata represents the first hydrostratigraphic group the fissure water in the schist gneiss metasandstone and migmatites of the sinian strata and in the granite and granodiorite of the yanshanian intrusive rocks is the second hydrostratigraphic group the rocks in the first and second groups are characterized by low permeability except in fractures and faults and the groundwater is mainly recharged by precipitation and lateral inflow from bedrock mao et al 2015 the karstic fissure water in the limestones and dolomites of the carboniferous to permian strata represents the third hydrostratigraphic group the strata in this group is characterized by moderate permeability the groundwater stored in the quaternary sediments acts as the fourth hydrostratigraphic group these sediments show low to moderate permeability the groundwater in the four hydrostratigraphic groups is shallow groundwater due to its unconfined nature and shallow burial depth mao et al 2018 the four hydrostratigraphic groups are connected via pores and fractures the groundwater flows from southeast to northwest and eventually enters the pearl river fig 1b 2 3 land use the study area has experienced rapid urbanization and industrialization since the reform and opening up of china in 1978 wong et al 2002 the information from the dongguan statistical yearbook shows that the permanent resident population in this region has increased from 1 15 million to 8 39 million in the past 32 years 1982 2018 and 44 04 of farmland and 42 89 of woodland have been converted into construction land fig 2 the newly formed construction land represents the newly formed urbanization region which has been widely used for industrial production and residences for the nonlocal population septic tanks containing faeces and domestic wastewater are the most common sewage systems in these regions the septic tanks generally lack a proper seepage control facility thus sewage and septic waste commonly infiltrates into the groundwater sun et al 2009 based on the data obtained from the national geoscience data sharing platform land use in the area in 2018 was mainly construction land which accounts for nearly 47 04 of the total area followed by woodland with 20 05 coverage and farmland with 19 58 coverage the remaining area included surface water 9 25 grassland 2 18 shrubwood 1 53 and wetland 0 21 fig 2b the most frequent crops in farmland are paddy tuber crops and sugarcane and pig manure is the most commonly used fertilizer 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling a total of 58 unconfined groundwater samples were collected from domestic wells which sidewall is permeable in june 2018 before sampling the well depths and groundwater burial depths were measured using a water level meter and the groundwater levels were calculated on a gis platform by subtracting the groundwater burial depths from the topographic elevations then water totalling more than 3 borehole volumes was pumped from the domestic wells temperature t ph oxidizing reducing potential orp and dissolved oxygen do were measured in situ using a multiparameter probe ysi exo2 alkalinity was measured in situ by the gran titration method samples used to measure the concentrations of cl no3 nh4 fe mn and dissolved organic carbon doc and the isotopic compositions of no3 and nh4 were filtered through 0 45 Œºm membranes whateman gf f 47 mm in diameter on site and collected separately specifically samples for the determination of nh4 and Œ¥15n nh4 were acidified with reagent quality hcl to a ph of approximately 4 0 samples for analyses of cl no3 Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 were collected in 100 ml polyethylene bottles without special treatment samples for the determination of dissolved fe and mn contents were acidified with reagent quality hno3 to ph 2 samples for the analyses of doc were collected in 100 ml glass bottles without bubbles and were preserved with 0 1 ml of saturated hgcl2 samples used to measure the concentrations of dissolved gases ch4 and n2o and the stable isotope values of n2o were collected in 20 ml head space bottles and 120 ml wheaton glass serum vials respectively using a peristaltic pump briefly after an overflow of groundwater the tubing of the peristaltic pump was carefully removed and the bottles were immediately sealed using butyl rubber septa and aluminium crimp caps without trapping air bubbles on site those samples were preserved with 0 1 ml of saturated hgcl2 solution for groundwater samples that used for the determination of those indicators 2 to 3 replications per sampling points were collected all samples were brought back to the laboratory of the school of environmental science and engineering sun yat sen university and stored at 4 c before analysis 3 2 laboratory analysis the cl contents were determined by ion chromatography thermo ics 900 with a 5 ionic mass balance error the no3 and nh4 concentrations were measured by a continuous flow injection analyser ams alliance integral futura frepillon france within a detection limit of 0 01 mg l n the dissolved fe and mn contents were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes nexion 350d the doc concentrations were analysed by a toc analyser vario toc select elementar the concentrations of dissolved gases ch4 and n2o were measured by the headspace method using gas chromatography shimadzu gc 2014 sample preparation for the gas analyses included removing 10 ml of groundwater and injecting 10 ml of pure helium and subsequent equilibration of the gas phase and liquid at a constant temperature 25 c the denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 sigman et al 2001 was used to determine the isotope values of no3 in the groundwater samples briefly no3 was converted to n2o and n2o was extracted and purified through a precon system and analysed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermal fisher delta v the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values were calibrated using three international standards namely iaea no 3 usgs34 and usgs35 according to the results of replicate measurements of the standards and samples the analytical precision standard deviation for Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 was 0 4 and 0 5 respectively the acidified disk diffusion method was used to analyse the isotope composition of nh4 in brief the dissolved nh4 in the groundwater was converted to nh3 gas by adjusting the ph values to 8 9 and was subsequently trapped on an acidified quartz disk on which a few drops of 1 m sulfate were placed and packed by a gas permeable hydrophobic membrane the formed nh4 2so4 on the quartz disk was then measured by ea irms flash 2000 delta v advantage samples were prepared in duplicate in batches including internal lab standards nh4cl Œ¥15n of 1 20 and water blanks the Œ¥15n nh4 values were calibrated by the working standard urea Œ¥15n of 0 45 and the results of the replicate measurements of samples internal lab standards and working standards showed that the analytical precision standard deviation of Œ¥15n nh4 was 0 4 the gas liquid equilibrium method was the pretreatment method for the determination of the isotope values of dissolved n2o in the groundwater its processing procedures include drawing 30 ml of groundwater from the sampling vials and simultaneously injecting 30 ml of pure helium into the sampling vials by syringe and then equilibrating the gas phase and liquid at a constant temperature 25 c after the gas liquid equilibrium 20 ml of the headspace gas was extracted and introduced into an evacuated airbag then 20 ml of pure helium was once again injected into the sampling vials to the gas liquid equilibrium this procedure was repeated to achieve the optimum concentration for analysis by a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime 100 the prepared water ultra pure water after aeration was injected with certified gas internal lab standard gas n2o huate gas guangdong and achieved water gas equilibrium the same experimental processes were also conducted to check whether the equilibrium method will cause obvious isotopic fractionation between dissolved and gaseous n2o the Œ¥ values of the processed lab gas 3 85 for Œ¥15nbulk and 44 08 for Œ¥18o n2o were close to those of the original internal lab gas 3 98 for Œ¥15nbulk and 43 92 for Œ¥18o n2o indicating that no significant isotope fractionation occurs during the n2o diffusion process the investigation of the kinetic stable nitrogen and oxygen isotope fractionations between aqueous dissolved and gaseous n2o conducted by inoue also showed minimal fractionation and the changes in Œ¥ values from water to gas were 0 7 for n and 1 1 for o inoue and mook 1994 the isotopomer ratios of Œ¥15nbulk Œ¥18o n2o and Œ¥15nŒ± were determined and Œ¥15nŒ≤ was obtained from eq 1 the Œ¥15nŒ± eq 2 and Œ¥15nŒ≤ eq 3 represent the nitrogen isotopic composition at the centre and end sites of nitrogen atoms the site preference sp was defined as an illustrative parameter of the intramolecular distribution of 15n and could be calculated from eq 4 isotopologue ratios of a sample rsample were expressed as relative to 15n 14n and 18o 16o ratios of the standard materials rstd atmospheric n2 and vienna standard mean ocean water v smow respectively

school of environmental science and engineering sun yat sen university whereas Œ¥15nbulk Œ¥15nŒ± and Œ¥18o were determined in the environmental stable isotope lab institute of agricultural environment and sustainable development chinese academy of agricultural sciences 3 3 sp Œ¥18o mapping approach as described in the introduction the 15n site preference of n2o sp is a powerful tool for n2o source identification because sp values are independent of the substrate isotopic composition and differ according to different pathways park et al 2011 sutka et al 2006 sutka et al 2003 sutka et al 2004 yoshida and toyoda 2000 the reported sp values for n2o produced by nitrifier denitrification bacterial denitrification nitrification and fungal denitrification are 0 8 5 8 0 5 1 9 33 5 1 2 and 35 6 3 1 respectively denk et al 2017 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 sutka et al 2006 sutka et al 2003 sutka et al 2004 accordingly to estimate the relative contributions of different processes to n2o production one higher sp value group nitrification or fungal denitrification and one lower sp value group bacterial denitrification or nitrifier denitrification were chosen as the end members fig 3 the common Œ¥18o end member values which were also chosen from the known most relevant literature data varied from 17 4 to 21 4 from 19 8 to 26 5 from 40 6 to 51 9 and from 36 5 to 55 2 for bacterial denitrification nitrifier denitrification fungal denitrification and nitrification respectively deppe et al 2017 frame and casciotti 2010 heil et al 2014 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 rohe et al 2014 sutka et al 2008 sutka et al 2006 the individual wide range of Œ¥18o n2o values obtained from pure culture studies were not considered here as the various degrees of oxygen exchange with ambient water for pure culture studies whereas groundwater has a stable environment and generally shows the relatively low amounts of oxygen exchange lewicka szczebak et al 2017 lewicka szczebak et al 2016 snider et al 2013 consequently if n2o reduction is not occurring the isotope two terminal mixing model eq 5 can be used to estimate the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification on n2o production toyoda et al 2011 well et al 2012 5 sp0 x spnit 1 x spdenit 6 spobs sp0 Œµred ln c c0 where spobs sp0 spnit and spdenit indicate the observed sp values sp values before n2o reduction and sp values produced by nitrification and denitrification respectively variables x and 1 x represent the relative contributions of nitrification and denitrification respectively however the occurrence of n2o reduction can lead to 15n and 18o being more enriched in residual n2o furthermore sp values will increase as Œ¥18o n2o increases thus the sp sp0 and Œ¥18o n2o values without n2o reduction need to be calculated through eq 6 parameters Œµred and c c0 represent the enrichment factors for reduction and the residue ratios of n2o the slope of the n2o reduction vector 0 35 for sp Œ¥18o n2o jinuntuya nortman et al 2008 lewicka szczebak et al 2015 ostrom et al 2007 well and flessa 2009 and the isotope fractionation factor 5 9 for Œµred lewicka szczebak et al 2017 lewicka szczebak et al 2015 are used to calculate the sp0 values and n2o reduction ratios eq 6 4 results 4 1 field parameters and redox sensitive components the field parameters and the contents of the redox sensitive components no3 nh4 mn2 fe2 n2o and ch4 of the groundwater are summarized in table 1 groundwater burial depths were shallow with values varying from 0 00 to 8 00 m and 75 of them were 2 m groundwater levels suggested that the groundwater flows from the southeast to the northwest fig 1b the do contents ranged between 0 31 and 7 69 mg l and 25 samples among the total analysed samples were lower than 2 mg l fig 4 a the orp values varied over a wide range 217 0 274 4 mv and the negative values mostly occurred in the northeastern part of the study area and the downstream region and decreased over the flow path fig 4b the do contents and orp values indicated that both oxidizing and reducing environments were present in the groundwater as redox sensitive components the distributions of no3 nh4 mn2 and ch4 follow the variations in orp values the highest no3 concentrations were found in the southwestern part of the study area the oxidation zone while the lower contents were in the northeastern part the reduction zone it was also observed that no3 contents generally decreased along the groundwater flow path fig 4f the relatively higher nh4 and ch4 content mostly existed in the wells with negative orp values fig 4d and fig s1 the nh4 n contents in most samples ranged from undetectable to 0 32 mg l except for dg33 7 28 mg l and dg46 12 81 mg l the mn2 concentrations were detected in some wells and varied from 0 01 to 1 08 mg l the highest ch4 contents reached 5993 57 Œºg l and samples with high ch4 contents were mostly located in the northeastern part of the study area fig 4d the existence of ch4 also suggested a stronger reducing environment in this region the existence of n2o indicated the occurrence of nitrification or denitrification in the groundwater samples with high n2o concentrations generally showed lower ch4 contents fig 4d 4e and fig s2 no ordered distribution was observed for n2o content along the groundwater flow path 4 2 isotopic values the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values of the groundwater samples ranged from 6 68 to 26 23 and from 6 59 to 13 72 respectively samples with higher no3 contents generally have lower isotope compositions in contrast samples with lower no3 contents were characterized by higher isotope compositions fig 4f 4 g 4 h the Œ¥15n no3 values exhibited a positive correlation r2 0 33 p 0 01 with those of Œ¥18o no3 fig 5 a the nh4 n content only existed in a few wells and the Œ¥15n nh4 values ranged from 10 10 to 26 24 with a mean value of 16 79 fig 6 large variations in Œ¥15nbulk 19 43 22 76 Œ¥18o n2o 28 93 59 76 and sp 1 55 36 02 were observed both Œ¥15nbulk r2 0 44 p 0 05 and sp r2 0 72 p 0 01 exhibited a positive correlation with Œ¥18o n2o fig 7 5 discussion 5 1 dilemma of n source apportionment under n transformation 5 1 1 disturbance of denitrification on nitrate source apportionment nitrate source identification based on the dual isotope approach Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 was generally conducted by comparing the isotopic signals between the groundwater samples and the possible nitrogen source the observed Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values of most samples were located in the expected ranges of manure and septic waste zones fig 5a possibly indicating the manure and septic waste sources of the nitrate in the groundwater however nitrate source identification should take into account the occurrence of the overall denitrification line that probably started from the ammonium fertilizer zone or soil nitrate zone fig 5a the isotope signatures and concentrations of nitrate are commonly used to identify denitrification processes in groundwater several studies have suggested that Œ¥Œ¥15n Œ¥Œ¥18o ratios associated with denitrification are close to the range of 1 3 to 2 1 fukada et al 2003 mengis et al 1999 the Œ¥15n values of the residual no3 generally increase with a decrease in no3 content the no3 n cl ratio rather than no3 n is used to identify denitrification processes because the dilution effect obscures the linear relationship between ln no3 n and Œ¥15n no3 fenton et al 2009 as shown in fig 5 Œ¥15n no3 was positively associated with Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥Œ¥15n Œ¥Œ¥18o 2 0 and was negatively associated with ln no3 n cl proving that denitrification occurred in the groundwater according to the analysis above the change in the nitrate isotope signals during denitrification complicates identification of the nitrate source 5 1 2 disturbance of nitrification on ammonium source apportionment fig 6 shows the map of Œ¥15n nh4 versus nh4 n concentrations and the measured Œ¥15n nh4 values are also compared to the typical ranges of Œ¥15n nh4 values in various ammonium sources the negative correlation between Œ¥15n nh4 and nh4 n content implied that nitrification or volatilization might exist in the groundwater because both nitrification and volatilization result in a decrease in nh4 n content and an increase in Œ¥15n nh4 values denk et al 2017 nikolenko et al 2018 the acidic groundwater environment with an average ph value of 5 99 indicated that volatilization could be ignored however it was difficult to judge whether nitrification occurs as the nh4 n concentrations in most of the groundwater samples are lower than the detection limit it seems that ammonium in the groundwater possibly originated from manure septic effluents or feedlot runoff fig 6 in brief it was difficult to identify the source and transformation of ammonium only by the isotope compositions and contents of ammonium 5 2 simultaneous identification of n transformation processes and baseline nitrogen isotope values by nitrogen isotope and n2o isotopologue ratios 5 2 1 n2o production n2o in groundwater generally originates from soil n2o that is produced in the unsaturated zone and dissolved in the groundwater via diffusion and seepage or is produced in the groundwater groffman et al 2002 hiscock et al 2003 m√ºhlherr and hiscock 1998 well et al 2005 the n2o concentrations in the groundwater table 1 are highly elevated compared to the n2o concentrations in the unsaturated zone of this region which varied from 0 00 to 8 51 Œºg l with a mean of 0 92 Œºg l indicating that n2o diffusion from the unsaturated zone to the groundwater was negligible within the saturated zone denitrification was supposed to be the predominant process for n2o production because organic matter as the electron donor was present and nitrate was the dominant species of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in most of the wells in the study area table 1 n2o production by nitrification was also possible as ammonium was the dominant species of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in a few wells dg33 dg46 and the dissolved oxygen contents in part of the aquifer do not inhibit nitrification ueda et al 1991 in addition n2o production by nitrification could also occur in wells with nh4 n concentrations below detection because the immediate nitrification of organic n is possible and nh4 n will not accumulate bateman and baggs 2005 5 2 2 evidence for n transformation from isotopologue ratios of n2o the sp Œ¥18o mapping approach has been used to differentiate between processes deppe et al 2017 li et al 2020 or to identify n2o reduction to n2 lewicka szczebak et al 2017 lin et al 2018 well et al 2012 in soil or groundwater environment the research shows that sp Œ¥18o mapping approach is suitable to identify and quantify n2o reduction or the contribution of different processes to the total n2o content lewicka szczebak et al 2017 however it has been pointed out that the Œ¥18o n2o value was crucial to support better quantitative estimation of the processes of n2o production and consumption because the control of Œ¥18o n2o value is more complex koba et al 2009 the Œ¥18o n2o value depends on Œ¥18o no3 and o exchange it has been found that the extent of o exchange was almost complete in some unsaturated soil kool et al 2009 well et al 2012 hence the potential for o exchange between no2 and h2o should be taken into account when applying the sp Œ¥18o mapping approach in an unsaturated soil environment kool et al 2009 anyway the sp Œ¥18o mapping approach was suitable in saturated soil or groundwater as the lowest amounts of oxygen exchange occurred in these situations snider et al 2013 wrage et al 2005 here the sp Œ¥18o mapping approach fig 2 was applied to distinguish between nitrification and denitrification as the sources of n2o in the groundwater however the overlap of sp values for bacterial denitrification and nitrifier denitrification or for fungal denitrification and nitrification make n2o source partitioning difficult fungal denitrification has been identified as the dominant process for n2o emission in grassland and desert soils laughlin et al 2009 marusenko et al 2013 however it is uncommon in the natural environment thus fungal denitrification was not considered here as the dominant land use categories of the study area are construction land farmland and woodland fig 2b n2o formation during nh4 oxidation was likely to proceed via the nh2oh to n2o pathway rather than through nitrifier denitrification because of the relatively high do concentrations in some wells the relatively high sp values also implied the pathway of nh4 oxidation nh2oh n2o because the n2o produced from bacterial denitrification and nitrifier denitrification both showed low sp values 0 5 1 9 and 0 8 5 8 therefore bacterial denitrification and nitrification have been taken as the major processes for n2o formation in the study area as shown in fig 7a the n2o sources of all samples could be explained as resulting from the mixing of denitrification n2o and nitrification n2o followed by n2o reduction the maximum and minimum contributions of denitrification are shown in table 2 the average maximum and minimum contributions of denitrification to the total n2o were 87 17 and 55 71 respectively while the average maximum and minimum contributions of nitrification to the total n2o were 44 29 and 12 83 respectively the corresponding average reduction ratios were 74 99 and 30 53 respectively the results of the computation showed that the high contribution of denitrification together with strong n2o reduction was common in the groundwater accordingly denitrification acted as the dominant process for nitrogen transformation and the produced n2o was strongly reduced to n2 in the groundwater the n2o reduction process can also be identified through the isotope signals of n2o because the process could lead to an increase in Œ¥15nbulk Œ¥18o n2o and sp values in the residual n2o koba et al 2009 well et al 2012 well and flessa 2010 accordingly most of the groundwater samples are located outside the shaded region and the significant positive correlations between sp and Œ¥18o n2o fig 7a and between Œ¥15nbulk n2o and Œ¥18o n2o fig 7b suggested the occurrence of n2o reduction in the groundwater in addition to n2o reduction n2o diffusion also influences n2o consumption research on the kinetic stable nitrogen and oxygen isotope fractionations between aqueous dissolved and gaseous n2o revealed that the isotope effect for n2o diffusion was small and the changes in Œ¥ values from water to gas were 0 7 for n and 1 1 for o inoue and mook 1994 thus the n2o diffusion processes will not be discussed here 5 2 3 reconstruction of baseline isotope ratios and source apportionment of no3 and nh4 as previously described chemical and isotopic data indicated that nitrification and denitrification altered the no3 and nh4 isotope ratios and complicated nitrogen source apportionment for each groundwater sample the relative contribution of nitrification and denitrification to n2o production was estimated from the sp Œ¥18o model table 2 the isotopic composition of the nitrate was not affected by denitrification when the relative contribution of denitrification was 0 consequently the calculated relative contribution of denitrification was combined with the measured values of Œ¥15n no3 to reconstruct the initial Œ¥15n values for nitrate the Œ¥15n no3 values 10 19 14 14 in three samples with the contribution of denitrification ratios of 0 represented the isotopic composition of the nitrate sources similarly the intercept of the linear regression line 10 36 9 25 for the min max contribution of denitrification fig 8 a 8b also represented the initial isotopic signals of the nitrate source generally nitrate pollution in groundwater is mostly caused by ammonium fertilizer nitrate fertilizer soil ammonium atmospheric deposits or manure and septic waste xue et al 2009 the initial isotopic signals of no3 9 25 14 14 fell within the expected ranges of manure and septic waste 4 25 fig 5 indicating that manure and septic waste were the primary sources of nitrate in the groundwater the nitrate source identification was in accordance with the actual situation because of the frequent use of manure and the universal existence of septic tanks in the study area similar to nitrate the initial Œ¥15n values of ammonium were reconstructed by the calculated relative contribution of nitrification and the measured values of Œ¥15n nh4 the Œ¥15n nh4 value in sample dg46 with a contribution of nitrification ratios of 0 was 14 01 and the intercept of the fitting line was 14 22 10 71 fig 8c 8d which provided the initial isotopic compositions of the ammonium sources these initial Œ¥15n values fall in the isotopic range of manure and septic effluent 10 20 xue et al 2009 suggesting the manure and septic effluent sources of ammonium in the groundwater the occurrence of nitrification also complicated nitrate source identification the Œ¥15n no3 value should be similar to the Œ¥15n value of the precursors when nh4 n was almost completely converted into no3 n during the nitrification process the Œ¥18o value of no3 produced by nitrification was determined by Œ¥18o h2o and Œ¥18o o2 in theory 2 3 of o no3 was derived from o h2o and 1 3 of o no3 was incorporated from o o2 23 5 accordingly the no3 derived from nitrification should have Œ¥18o no3 values ranging from 2 31 to 4 82 overall even though the measured Œ¥18o values of approximately a quarter of the samples were in the range of these calculated values it was hard to confirm that the calculated Œ¥18o values were the initial Œ¥18o values of no3 produced by nitrification because 1 significant isotopic fractionation could occur during the incorporation of o h2o and o o2 into no3 2 the incorporation of h2o and o2 into no3 generally did not work at ratios of 2 1 kendall 1998 xue et al 2009 and 3 denitrification increased the Œ¥18o values of no3 fig 5a both the nitrate and ammonium originated from manure and septic effluents and the overlap of Œ¥18o values in no3 derived from nitrification and manure septic effluents makes it hard to distinguish the two sources in summary considering the high contribution of denitrification to the total n2o nitrate in the groundwater mainly originated from manure and septic wastes while part of it was derived from the mixing of no3 produced from nitrification and no3 in manure septic effluents 5 3 type of denitrification and data interpretation in the groundwater flow direction 5 3 1 assessment of the denitrification type in the groundwater the results calculated by the sp Œ¥18o model showed that denitrification was the dominant process for nitrogen transformation in the groundwater generally denitrification processes are linked either to organic matter oxidation heterotrophic denitrification or to reduced state element oxidation autotrophic denitrification no dissolved fe contents were detected table 1 and the isotope signals of sulphate fell within the expected ranges of the atmospheric deposition region rather than within the range of the sulphide oxidation region fig s3 suggesting that both reduced iron and reduced sulphur were not electron donors during the denitrification process the detected ch4 contents in some wells indicated the occurrence of methanogenesis methane formation a heterotrophic microbial reaction requires organic matter to act as the electron donor it is the final stage of the reductive sequence that generally begins with the reduction of o2 followed by the reduction of no3 mn oxide fe oxide and so4 2 appelo and postma 2005 its occurrence demonstrated that the groundwater environment contains a certain quality of organic matter that acted as the reductant for oxygen reduction denitrification mn oxide reduction and methanogenesis processes and heterotrophic denitrification was the denitrification type in this aquifer as a result o2 no3 mn oxide and organic matter as the reactant decreased while mn2 and ch4 as the products appeared in part of the aquifer after participating in the redox reactions 5 3 2 data interpretation in the groundwater flow direction the distributions of o2 no3 n mn2 and ch4 contents along the groundwater flow path broadly fit the changes in reactants and products in the ideal redox sequence accordingly the aquifer can be divided into 3 zones fig 4 zone 1 acted as the recharge area and was characterized by an oxidizing or micro anaerobic environment the groundwater samples in this zone showed moderate to high no3 n contents low n2o contents low mn2 contents and low ch4 contents the three samples with denitrification ratios of 0 were also located in this region fig 9 a all these observations demonstrated that the groundwater samples in this zone were not affected or were slightly affected by denitrification as a result lower isotope compositions of no3 and minimal reduction ratios of n2o were detected fig 4g fig 9b the dissolved o2 contents were consumed in zone 2 the intermediate flow area and the highest n2o contents in this region indicated that denitrification was the dominant redox reaction accordingly lower no3 n contents and wide variations in no3 isotopic compositions were observed after the groundwater passed zone 2 the n2o contents returned to low values in zone 3 near the groundwater discharge area the stronger reducing environment combined with higher n2o reduction ratios indicated that the n2o was consumed and converted to n2 in this region the occurrence of dissolved mn2 contents and ch4 contents also suggested that large amounts of no3 were consumed and the reduction of mn oxide and methanogenesis was the dominant redox reaction thus samples with low no3 contents in this zone have higher no3 isotopic signals and a higher contribution of denitrification 6 conclusion to overcome the shortcoming that the traditional stable isotope approach Œ¥15n no3 Œ¥18o no3 Œ¥15n nh4 could not simultaneously recognize the source and transformation of nitrogen the isotope ratios of n2o the sp Œ¥18o model and the traditional stable isotope approach were combined to depict the nitrogen transformation processes and reconstruct the initial isotopic compositions of the nitrogen sources in dongguan basin the key conclusions include the following 1 both denitrification and nitrification processes occurred in the groundwater while denitrification acted as the dominant nitrogen transformation process 2 the average maximum and minimum reduction ratios of n2o were 74 99 and 30 53 respectively indicating that n2o reduction was common in the groundwater 3 the initial isotope ratio of nitrogen obtained from the combined use of the calculation results of the sp Œ¥18o model and Œ¥15n no3 or Œ¥15n nh4 value suggested that manure and septic wastes were the primary sources of no3 and nh4 in the groundwater 4 the reductive level of no3 changed in the groundwater flow direction no3 reduction did not occur in the upstream area no3 reduction was strong in the intermediate transition zone and no3 contents were completely consumed and ch4 occurred in the downstream region overall the current study revealed that the method used in this study was useful for exactly depicting the sources and transformation processes of nitrogen in the groundwater environment the method emphasized here can be of use in various other areas credit authorship contribution

4413,coastal reservoirs can alleviate the shortage of freshwater in the nearshore zone inland groundwater and tides can cause hydraulic gradients between seawater and reservoir water and affect the salt concentration of coastal reservoirs however the mechanism is poorly understood laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the combined effect of inland groundwater inputs and tides on the surface subsurface flow and salinization dynamics of the coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer the results indicated that inland groundwater followed two pathways before discharging into the sea regardless of the tidal conditions the predominant pathway led inland groundwater to be discharged to the coastal reservoir and then to sea the other pathway encompassed the entire aquifer underlying the reservoir bed and terminated at the aquifer sea interface as the inland groundwater input increased the groundwater entering the reservoir also increased whereas the ratio of the fresh groundwater transported through the reservoir to the total groundwater input decreased tidal pumping allowed more seawater to intrude into the coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer compared with nontidal conditions this caused a larger proportion of groundwater to be discharged to the coastal reservoir with the density driven flow and water salt exchange across the aquifer reservoir interface also enhanced as the inland groundwater input increased salinization of the coastal reservoir decreased and the inhibition of the inland groundwater input on salinization also decreased this study contributes to the improved management of such coastal infrastructures keywords coastal reservoir groundwater flow tide salinization 1 introduction water scarcity has become increasingly pronounced in coastal areas owing to economic development and population growth neumann et al 2015 phan et al 2018 coastal reservoirs that are created by enclosing a section of the coast through the construction of impermeable dams to store freshwater fig 1 can alleviate the shortage of freshwater in such areas jin et al 2019 yang 2018 salinization of reservoir water due to seawater intrusion through the adjacent aquifer can greatly threaten the functionality of coastal reservoirs lin and gong 2019 sitharam and kolathayar 2020 salinization seawater intrusion of coastal reservoirs depends largely on the hydrodynamic processes in the surrounding aquifer among which inland groundwater inputs kuan et al 2019 and tides robinson et al 2007 are the most important factors controlling the exchange of water and salt driven by hydraulic gradients inland groundwater can be discharged into the sea and is considered an important source of freshwater to coastal reservoirs and or the sea moore 1996 recently luijendijk et al 2020 further quantified inland groundwater inputs on a global scale and indicated that the total inland groundwater input through aquifers exceeded 25 of the river flux in coastal unconfined aquifers inland groundwater flows above the offshore saltwater wedge under nontidal conditions kuan et al 2012 in a coastal aquifer affected by the construction of a coastal reservoir the inland groundwater input may be intercepted by the coastal reservoir before it discharges into the sea jin et al 2019 thus affecting the salinization of the coastal reservoir the hydraulic gradients between inland groundwater reservoir water and seawater control the total influx of fresh groundwater to a coastal reservoir and the salt distribution in the adjacent aquifer such hydraulic gradients remain constant after several years of operating a coastal reservoir resulting in a stable salt concentration in the reservoir water however any process resulting in the imbalance of the above mentioned hydraulic head may affect the salinization of a coastal reservoir for instance a decreased inland groundwater input can cause increased salinity in coastal reservoirs wang and zhu 2014 in contrast an increased inland groundwater input pushes the saltwater freshwater interface seaward and reduces salinization in a coastal reservoir sun et al 2008 overall inland groundwater inputs have a significant impact on the water salt exchange between a coastal reservoir and the adjacent aquifer thus affecting the salt distribution in both tides are the most important oceanic forcing in coastal aquifers coastal reservoirs are normally constructed within estuaries close to the offshore region thus tide induced flow can greatly affect salinization in reservoir water tides create varying hydraulic gradients and affect flows and salt transport jin et al 2019 resulting in seawater circulation through the aquifer sea interface whereby seawater enters an aquifer at high tide and leaves the aquifer coastal reservoir at low tide kuan et al 2012 mulligan et al 2011 in coastal aquifer the tide induced flow has much shorter transit times as compared with the inland groundwater flow and creates a more reactive zone as an upper saline plume in addition to the lower saltwater wedge robinson et al 2007 as such inland groundwater flows into the sea through the freshwater discharge zone between the upper saline plume and the lower salt wedge heiss and michael 2014 tide induced flow also contributes to an increased water exchange between groundwater and seawater li et al 1999 yu et al 2019 for instance kuan et al 2019 found that tides increased the total groundwater discharge by 100 owing to the modified groundwater dynamics in a coastal aquifer after the construction of a coastal reservoir seawater intrusion driven by tide induced flow can only occur through the aquifer under the cut off wall because the dam cut off wall can prevent direct seawater intrusion into the coastal reservoir this situation contributes to the unclear and complex impacts of tides on groundwater pathways and salinization in coastal reservoirs and adjacent aquifers seawater driven by tide induced flow mixes with fresh inland groundwater resulting in salt movement toward the freshwater zone this forms a convective circulation within the dispersion zone in the saltwater wedge that is density driven flow cooper 1959 the density driven flow influenced by inland groundwater and tides can affect the water salt exchange between surface water reservoir water and groundwater destouni and prieto 2003 and thus the salinization of a coastal reservoir smith 2004 found that density driven flow was the largest under a medium input of inland groundwater because a low input of inland groundwater resulted in a wide dispersion zone with reduced density gradients whereas a high input of inland groundwater restricted seawater intrusion gonneea et al 2013 showed that density driven flow was very sensitive to seawater level fluctuations driven by tides therefore density driven flow was rarely at a steady state in comparison to individual forcing the combined effect of inland groundwater inputs and tides would contribute to a more complex density driven flow and hydraulic dynamics in a coastal aquifer werner et al 2013 for example robinson et al 2007 suggested that tides can increase the density driven circulation and total saltwater exchange between groundwater and seawater xin et al 2010 found that the total groundwater discharge flux under the combined effect of tides and waves was less than that induced by these two forces separately therefore to better predict the salinization of coastal reservoirs the combined effect of inland groundwater inputs and tides should be investigated previous studies have revealed that inland groundwater and tides are important hydrodynamic factors in coastal aquifers however few studies have focused on the impacts of inland groundwater and tides on the salinization of coastal reservoirs in particular the hydrodynamic processes driven by the combined effect of inland groundwater inputs and tides in aquifers adjacent to coastal reservoirs are poorly understood in this study laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to unravel three key questions 1 how do inland groundwater inputs and tides alter the subsurface flow pathways in aquifers adjacent to coastal reservoirs 2 how are reservoir water porewater and seawater exchanged through the aquifer reservoir interface and aquifer sea interface 3 how do inland groundwater inputs and tides affect the salt distribution and salinization in coastal reservoirs and adjacent aquifers 2 methodology 2 1 laboratory experiments 2 1 1 experimental setup and measurements laboratory experiments were carried out in a sand flume with lengths heights and widths of 3 5 m 0 8 m and 0 02 m respectively the sidewalls of the sand flume were made using tempered glass to visualize the salt distribution movement in the laboratory scale coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer the flume was set up to replicate the flow dynamics and salt transport in the cross section perpendicular to the cut off wall for a typical coastal reservoir on a laboratory scale this configuration assumes uniform water flow and salt transport along the cross section of the cut off wall the sand flume consisted of three components based on its function a freshwater tank and peristaltic pumps were set up at the landward boundary to provide a fixed groundwater input the middle section was packed with freshwater and quartz sand to represent coastal and adjacent aquifers the right section was set to replicate tidal fluctuations by pumping saltwater from a saltwater tank via a variable height overflow vho column the neighboring sections were separated by a fine stainless steel screen to allow water exchange and prevent sand movement across the sections an impermeable plate was inserted between the reservoir and seawater sections as a dam and was partially buried into the reservoir bed to replicate the cut off wall of the coastal reservoir blue line in fig 2 b four vertical arrays a1 a4 of micro ports for water groundwater and reservoir water sampling were located near the bottom of the coastal reservoir fig 2a these vertical arrays were denoted as ai where i is a number representing the location of an array the higher the value of i the closer the vertical array was to the cut off wall vertical arrays were set at equal intervals of 0 1 m and the length from a4 to the cut off wall was 0 05 m each vertical array contained five sampling ports and the elevation for these five sampling ports was set as 0 05 m 0 15 m 0 25 m 0 35 m and 0 4 m above the model base bc in fig 2b the particle size distribution of the sand used in the experiments was relatively uniform with d 50 0 24 mm and d 90 d 10 2 86 the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the experimental sand was 4 78 10 3 m s 1 and the porosity was 0 46 fd c red food dye roha dyecem pvt ltd was chosen as the saltwater tracer as it has been successfully used in previous studies of groundwater dynamics in coastal aquifers shen et al 2015 2020 artificial seawater was prepared by mixing 33 4 g of sodium chloride nacl analytical grade reagent and 1 6 g of fd c per liter of deionized water high resolution photographs were taken using a digital camera to track the salt distribution during the experiments 2 1 2 experimental procedures the sand was rinsed with deionized water before the experiment and sieved according to the procedure of jin et al 2010 to avoid impurities the treatment sand was covered with deionized water and laid into a sink to minimize air trapping and ensure the freshness of the initial coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer the impermeable panel was placed between the seawater and reservoir sections to prevent seawater intrusion as soon as the sand was filled with a pre designed profile a constant reservoir water level 0 45 m above the flume base was controlled by a freshwater outlet before the experiment the experiments were started by turning off the freshwater outlet and removing the impervious panels a tide with an amplitude of 0 055 m and a period of 120 s was used in the experiments under tidal influence for the cases without a tidal influence the sea level was controlled at 0 446 m above the flume base owing to the inflow of fresh inland groundwater the salinity of the seawater section may decrease slightly during such experiments thus we monitored the salinity in the seawater section using a ysi pro30 conductivity meter every 30 min to ensure a stable tidal signal with the same salt concentration during the experiments six experimental cases with fixed inland groundwater fluxes for tidal and nontidal conditions were conducted in the sand flume the experiments were conducted until the salt distribution in the aquifer reached a steady state under nontidal conditions or a quasi steady state under tidal conditions specifically we considered the experiment to have reached a quasi steady state when the salinity of the water and the location of the horizontal toe of the saltwater wedge at a certain point in time did not change by 1 compared with the values recorded 30 min ago the fixed inland groundwater input rates were set as 12 ml min 1 20 ml min 1 and 30 ml min 1 and the corresponding darcy velocities specific discharge rates were calculated as 1 47 10 5 m s 1 2 45 10 5 m s 1 and 3 68 10 5 m s 1 respectively accordingly the experimental cases were named nt q12 nt q20 and nt q30 for nontidal conditions and t q12 t q20 and t q30 for tidal conditions respectively 2 2 numerical model sutra voss and provost 2002 is a variably saturated variable density groundwater flow and solute transport model and was used to investigate the dynamics and salt transport in the experimental coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer under the combined effect of an inland groundwater input and tides previous studies have successfully used sutra in the study of water and solute transport in coastal aquifers at laboratory and field scales kuan et al 2012 shen et al 2015 xin et al 2010 2 2 1 initial and boundary conditions numerical simulations were conducted to replicate the flow dynamics and salt distribution in the laboratory experiments fig 2b the x and z coordinates were oriented inland and upward respectively and were intersected at the bottom of the seawater boundary point c no water or salt flux occurred at the bottom bc and upper ae sides of the sand and the cut off wall de thus no flow boundary was applied at the boundary of ae bc and de the inland boundary ab was applied by a fixed flux with a background salt concentration of 0 001 ppt to simulate inland groundwater inflow the seawater boundary cd was set as a time varied specified pressure boundary at a constant salt concentration according to the seawater fluctuation in the experiments as follows 1 h t z msl a t sin œâ t where h l is the seawater level at time t t zmsl is the mean sea level at l is the amplitude of the tide and œâ 1 s is the tidal angular frequency 2 2 2 utilization of the richards equation for surface water modeling the simulation of the flow and salt transport in the experimental coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer required an exchange between the aquifer groundwater and coastal reservoir surface water the richards equation is normally used in the investigation of groundwater dynamics the high k approach chui and freyberg 2008 winter 1976 can represent simulated surface water by setting the high k zone as a hyper porous medium with a much higher hydraulic conductivity a porosity of 1 and a steep water retention curve xiao et al 2019 xin et al 2009 successfully used this method to represent surface water when studying water and salt transport in coastal aquifers therefore this approach was used in the present study to simulate the salt transport between the experimental reservoir water and groundwater the laminar representation of the simulated reservoir water surface water was considered sufficient because of the slow salt transport and small reservoir water fluctuation during the experiments 2 2 3 parameters for the numerical simulations the model had two components 1 a reservoir zone high k zone to represent the surface water and 2 aquifer zone representing the aquifer adjacent to the coastal reservoir the water levels of the coastal reservoirs in cases t q12 t q30 nt q12 and nt q30 over two tidal cycles at a quasi steady state were used to calibrate the numerical model the validation of the numerical model was conducted by comparing the salinity data along the four sampling arrays in all experimental cases to those in the numerical results this ensured that the numerical model could successfully reproduce the groundwater dynamics and salt transport processes in laboratory experiments the parameters used in the numerical simulations are listed in table 1 the assumption of homogeneous and isotropic soil was used in the model the model was discretized according to a common criterion voss and souza 1987 the uniform mesh size with Œ¥x 0 007 m and Œ¥z 0 005 m resulted in 67 821 nodes and 67 200 elements the peclet number pe was set to 3 54 and the courant number cr was set to 0 6 to ensure that the simulation results were irrelevant to grid discretization we also conducted a grid dependency test by comparing the simulation results between two different refined meshes in the same case 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow dynamics at a quasi steady state fig 3 shows the reservoir water levels measured and simulated for cases t q12 t q30 nt q12 and nt q30 over two tidal cycles at a quasi steady state under nontidal conditions the reservoir water level remained constant 0 453 m and 0 456 m for cases nt q12 and nt q30 respectively under tidal conditions the reservoir water level fluctuated following the oscillation of the seawater level a distinct phase shift of the reservoir water level 27 s delay of the signal was observed for cases t q12 and t q30 although the fluctuation periods for the reservoir water and seawater were identical 120 s atlabachew et al 2018 and yi et al 2012 also found such a delay in nearshore aquifers and suggested that the aquifer properties could have affected the delay the fluctuation amplitude of the reservoir water level was reduced by 83 6 0 009 m for cases t q12 and t q30 and the mean water level was increased 0 450 and 0 454 m for cases t q12 and t q30 compared with the seawater level amplitude of 0 055 m and mean seawater level of 0 446 m regardless of the tide the mean reservoir water level rose as the inland groundwater input increased this may have been due to the limited water exchange capacity between the reservoir and adjacent aquifer resulting in a portion of the inland groundwater being stored in the reservoir instead of being discharged offshore these indicate that the model could successfully reproduce the fluctuation of the reservoir water level thus capturing the groundwater dynamics in the adjacent aquifer the simulated flow field within the aquifer adjacent to the coastal reservoir for cases t q20 and nt q20 at a quasi steady state is shown in fig 4 based on the results in fig 4 three flow patterns were observed 1 tide induced flow 2 inland groundwater flow and 3 density driven flow which were also found in the coastal aquifers evans and wilson 2016 robinson et al 2018 shen et al 2019 the tide induced flow was clearly observed at the low fig 4a and high fig 4c tides it was mainly driven by the head difference between the seawater and reservoir water and induced porewater circulation aquifer to the reservoir at high tide and reservoir to the aquifer at low tide underneath the reservoir bed near the aquifer sea interface in the nontidal case inland groundwater flow fig 4f gray line with arrows was considered to have two components one component of the inland groundwater input was discharged into the sea directly while the other component was first discharged into the coastal reservoir and then into the sea under the influence of tides the inland groundwater flow fig 4e started from the inland boundary and flowed to the reservoir dominating the majority of the landward aquifer density driven flow fig 4e and f yellow line with arrows was also significantly different between the two cases with and without the tide in the nontidal case particles initially proceeded from the inland aquifer sea interface near the base of the model and returned to the sea from the lower part of the aquifer sea interface fig 4f in the tidal case particles travelled from the reservoir bed to the sloping beach fig 4e we further investigated the combined effect of the inland groundwater input and tides on the flow pathways and associated transit time based on the tidally averaged flow field at a quasi steady state right column of fig 5 the transit time was defined as the time interval required for a particle to move from entry position to the boundary of the model zimmerman 1976 more specifically it was calculated by integrating the unit time unit length by the unit velocity on each pass by cell on its corresponding streamline as mentioned above inland groundwater flow qf consists of two components based on its termination 2 q f q fr q fs where qfr is calculated to quantify the inland groundwater flow from the aquifer to the reservoir through the sloping beach of the reservoir and qfs is the fresh groundwater directly discharged into the sea through the aquifer sea interface Œµ was set as the ratio of qfr to qf to indicate the proportion of water flowing into the coastal reservoir to the total inland groundwater input under nontidal conditions qfr increased from 10 84 ml min 1 to 23 67 ml min 1 as the inland groundwater input increased from 12 ml min 1 to 30 ml min 1 while Œµ decreased from 90 3 to 78 9 these results indicate that a majority of the inland groundwater input was discharged into the coastal reservoir and that this portion decreased although the value increased as the inland groundwater input increased under tidal conditions Œµ was 100 for the cases with qf set to 12 ml min 1 and 20 ml min 1 but was 95 3 for the case with qf set to 30 ml min 1 these results suggest that the tides pushed more inland groundwater to enter the coastal reservoir in comparison to the nontidal condition density driven flow also changed as the inland groundwater input varied in the cases with and without tidal influence the transit times for density driven flow were significantly higher nearly two orders of magnitude than those of inland groundwater flow and tide induced flow the right column of fig 5 which was consistent with the findings of robinson et al 2007 and xin et al 2010 under nontidal conditions the density driven flow fig 5c f and i transit time 1000 tidal cycles was found near the model base close to the aquifer sea interface and the toe of that area retreated seaward as the inland groundwater flux increased in the cases with a tidal influence the density driven flow was located below the reservoir bed above the model base whereas inland groundwater flow was weak fig 5l o and formed as a circulation near the model base when a large inland groundwater flux occurred fig 5r these results suggest that in the absence or presence of tides with a high groundwater input the density driven flow does not contribute to the water exchange across the reservoir aquifer interface 3 2 distribution of salt at quasi steady state predicting the salt distribution in coastal reservoirs and adjacent aquifers under complex dynamic forcing can contribute to the accuracy assessment of freshwater sources in coastal aquifers and is vital for improving the management of coastal reservoirs the experimental and numerical results for the salt distribution in the laboratory scale coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer at a quasi steady state are shown in the left and middle columns of fig 5 although the dye tracking method allowed the saltwater freshwater interface to be visualized it failed to capture the mixing zone because the salinity of saltwater could not be clearly distinguished by the shade of the dye chang and clement 2012 morgan et al 2013 yu et al 2019 the tides induced seawater infiltration into the experimental coastal reservoir resulting in a more landward toe of the salt distribution in the adjacent aquifer for the nontidal cases the salinity near the reservoir bed was nearly zero and the shape of the salt distribution formed as a wedge near the model base the horizontal toe of the saltwater wedge moved seaward from 1 38 m to 0 72 m and then to 0 45 m as qf increased from 12 ml min 1 to 20 ml min 1 and then to 30 ml min 1 fig 5b e and h respectively an increase in the inland groundwater input pushed the saltwater freshwater interface to retreat seaward which is consistent with the findings of kuan et al 2019 and liu et al 2016 for the cases with a tidal influence the horizontal toe locations retreated seaward from 1 66 m to 0 97 m and then to 0 55 m as qf increased from 12 ml min 1 to 20 ml min 1 and then to 30 ml min 1 fig 5k n and g respectively such results for the toe location also imply a nonlinear interaction between inland groundwater flow and tides as the tide accelerated the salt distribution declined in response to an increased inland groundwater flux another interesting finding is that the saltwater freshwater interface failed to maintain its classic shape in case t q30 compared with the other cases the saltwater wedge in the aquifer was partly separated into two salt wedges one near the bottom of the reservoir and the other close to the model base which have may been due to a portion of the fresh groundwater discharging directly into the aquifer sea interface fig 5q and r overall the modeled salt distribution agreed well with the experimental results we also compared the experimental and numerical salinities along the four vertical sampling arrays fig 2a a1 a2 a3 and a4 at the high tide level at a quasi steady state fig 6 the salinity distribution indicates the mixing zone in the adjacent aquifer across the mixing zone the salt concentration and fluid density gradually increase from the freshwater zone to the saltwater zone wicks and herman 1996 tides enhance the mixing of freshwater and saltwater and enlarge the associated mixing zone with the saltwater wedge finally dominating the aquifer under the reservoir bed the thickness of the mixing zone in each profile was considered as the length from the 95 isohaline to the 5 isohaline watson et al 2010 which varied from 0 02 m profile a4 in case nt q30 to 0 10 m profile a1 in case nt q12 for the nontidal cases whereas it was 0 35 m for all tidal cases this have may been because tide induced flow increased the salinity in the coastal reservoir and formed a recirculation from the bottom to the sloping beach or a recirculation near the model base fig 5l o r thus the associated mixing zone was much thicker the salinity of the reservoir water and adjacent aquifer based on numerical simulation results were integrated to indicate the evolution of the salt mass in both zones fig 7 a and b for the nontidal cases no salt was found in the reservoir which was consistent with the results in figs 5 and 6 in the tidal cases a nonlinear increase in the salt mass of the reservoir water was observed as the inland groundwater flux decreased for instance when qf decreased from 30 ml min 1 to 20 ml min 1 the salt mass in the reservoir increased by 0 086 kg m 1 from 0 060 to 0 146 kg m 1 a reduction in qf from 20 ml min 1 to 12 ml min 1 increased the salt mass in the reservoir by 0 18 kg m 1 from 0 146 kg m 1 to 0 326 kg m 1 this nonlinear increase suggests that the enhancement of salt mass would be accelerated as the inland groundwater flux decreased compared with the reservoir water more salt was stored in the aquifer the evolution of the salt mass in the reservoir under a high inland groundwater flux 30 ml min 1 was relatively rapid with the quasi steady state reaching 35 tidal cycles in contrast the increased salt mass for a low inland groundwater flux 12 ml min 1 was more gradual with the steady state achieved at 1000 tidal cycles these results indicate that a larger inland groundwater input would shorten the time required for the groundwater flow and associated salt transport system to reach the quasi steady state 3 3 water and salt exchange between the coastal reservoir and aquifer the local water salt influx and efflux across the aquifer reservoir interface were calculated by integrating the fluxes over a tidal cycle based on the simulation results fig 8 under nontidal conditions the water and salt flux patterns were relatively simple with the water influxes from the aquifer to the reservoir occurring at the sloping beach and effluxes found through the reservoir bed from the reservoir to the aquifer the water influxes and effluxes decreased as the inland groundwater input increased as expected no salt exchange between the reservoir and aquifer was observed in the nontidal cases for the tidal cases the water influxes and effluxes were nearly identical through the reservoir aquifer interface except for the inland groundwater input zone 0 6 m x 0 8 m where significant water influxes with no efflux were observed the salt exchange was concentrated on the reservoir bed with salt influx aquifer to the reservoir rates reaching their maximum near the cut off wall x 0 m which were calculated as 8 73 10 5 kg s 1 m 1 7 58 10 5 kg s 1 m 1 and 6 64 10 5 kg s 1 m 1 for cases t q12 t q20 and t q30 respectively these results indicate that the salt influxes driven by tide induced flow contributed to the salinization of the reservoir water and decreased as the inland groundwater input increased the total water influx qtotal was calculated by integrating the water influxes along the aquifer reservoir interface table 2 which were enhanced by the presence of tides and increased inland groundwater input qf for example when qf was fixed at 12 ml min 1 qtotal increased 12 8 fold by the effect of tides 9 03 10 6 m3 s 1 m 1 and 1 16 10 4 m3 s 1 m 1 in cases nt q12 and t q12 respectively when the tidal effect was considered qtotal increased from 1 16 10 4 m3 s 1 m 1 to 1 20 10 4 m3 s 1 m 1 as qf increased from 12 ml min 1 to 30 ml min 1 thus the percentage increase in qtotal 3 5 was significantly lower than the percentage increase in qf 150 in addition the qtotal value across the reservoir aquifer interface was almost a simple linear sum of the inland groundwater flow from the aquifer to the reservoir qfr density driven flow qd and tide induced flow qt which is consistent with the results of xin et al 2010 and taniguchi et al 2002 this almost simple linear sum was mainly because the adjacent aquifer could rapidly respond to the varying boundary conditions such that the influxes and effluxes regulated each other across the reservoir aquifer interface based on the local water fluxes and tidally averaged flow fields we also calculated the recirculation rates for these three flow patterns table 2 regardless of the tidal conditions the density driven flux qd decreased as qf increased specifically the density driven flux qd decreased from 2 00 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 to 1 83 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 under nontidal conditions and from 6 91 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 to 2 08 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 under tidal conditions as qf increased from 12 ml min 1 to 30 ml min 1 accordingly the rate of decrease under nontidal conditions 0 17 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 was significantly smaller than that under tidal conditions 4 83 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 furthermore density driven flow was enhanced under tidal conditions for example with qf set to 12 ml min 1 the density driven flux increased from 2 00 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 without tides to 6 91 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 with tides i e a 3 5 fold increase this suggests that the water exchange was different between the cases driven by individual forcing alone or multiple forcing as qf increased from 12 ml min 1 to 20 ml min 1 and then to 30 ml min 1 the tide induced flux qt decreased from 1 06 10 4 m3 s 1 m 1 to 1 01 10 4 m3 s 1 m 1 and then to 9 63 10 5 m3 s 1 m 1 respectively these results indicate that the interaction between the inland groundwater and the tide was nonlinear for example an increase of 66 7 in qf from 12 ml min 1 to 20 ml min 1 resulted in a 4 7 reduction in the tide induced flux and an increase of 50 in qf from 20 ml min 1 to 30 ml min 1 resulted in a 4 6 reduction in the tide induced flux this nonlinear interaction suggests that the inhibition of the inland groundwater input on tide induced flow was slightly accelerated furthermore tide induced flow dominated the water exchange across the reservoir aquifer interface the contributions of tide induced flow to the total water inflow varied from 91 4 to 80 5 as qf increased from 12 ml min 1 to 30 ml min 1 3 4 effects of inland groundwater flux and tides on flow pathways and salinization two dimensionless indices Œµ and c were used to indicate the flow pathways and salinization respectively c was calculated as the ratio of the average salinity of reservoir water to that of seawater as a salinization index in the coastal reservoir as follows 3 c ave c œÅ d v œÅ d v 4 œÅ œÅ 0 c œÅ c 5 c c ave c sea where c is the salinity of the reservoir water at each spatial volume v l3 c 0 is the salinity of freshwater œÅ 0 ml 3 is the density of freshwater œÅ 0 1000 kg m 3 œÅ c ml 3 is the change rate of density proportional to the salt concentration 714 3 kg m 3 c sea is the salinity of seawater c sea 0 035 we conducted 44 additional numerical simulations to further test the importance of the inland groundwater input on the flow and salinization of the coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer in the cases with and without tides the inland groundwater fluxes were adjusted from 8 ml min 1 to 56 ml min 1 to ensure the validity of darcy s law bramhall 1971 tides modified the inland groundwater pathways particularly in the cases with a lower inland groundwater flux fig 9 in the nontidal cases Œµ achieved the highest value 0 921 at the lowest qf 8 ml min 1 and decreased steadily as qf increased the slope of the trend flattened out when qf was 32 ml min 1 in the tidal cases the inland groundwater totally Œµ 100 flowed into the reservoir for cases with a qf value of 24 ml min 1 in addition Œµ decreased rapidly as the value of qf increased for cases with qf set to 26 ml min 1 the largest 0 184 and smallest 0 0062 differences in Œµ between the cases with and without tides were found for a qf value of 24 ml min 1 and 56 ml min 1 respectively these results indicate that tides pushed more inland groundwater into the coastal reservoir in the cases with a lower inland groundwater input 24 ml min 1 compared with the nontidal cases however in the case with a very high inland groundwater input 56 ml min 1 the influxes of inland groundwater to the coastal reservoir were nearly identical between the two cases with and without tides as the inland groundwater input increased more groundwater was discharged into the coastal reservoir but the contribution of this portion decreased rapidly when the inland groundwater input exceeded 24 ml min 1 this may have been due to the limited water storage capacity in the laboratory scale coastal reservoir understanding inland groundwater input pathways might also have important implications for studies on the eutrophication of reservoir water lin and sun 2008 because inland groundwater can contain large quantities of land sourced chemicals paytan et al 2006 fig 10 under nontidal conditions the salinization index of the coastal reservoir was calculated as 0 regardless of the amount of inland groundwater flow under tidal conditions the case with the lowest inland groundwater flux had the highest c 0 345 and c decreased as the inland groundwater flux increased in a nonlinear fashion the same 2 ml min 1 increment in qf reduced the salinization index by 0 061 for the cases with a small inland groundwater input from 8 ml min 1 to 10 ml min 1 and by 0 003 for the cases with large inland groundwater input from 44 ml min 1 to 46 ml min 1 the reduction of the former was almost 20 fold than that of the latter which suggests that the reduction of salinization was greatly decelerated as the inland groundwater flux increased this may have been due to the accelerated reduction in tide induced flow by the inland groundwater input 3 5 field scale numerical simulations to generalize the results we conducted simulations on a field scale coastal reservoir the dimensions of the field scale model were based on normal coastal reservoir in the nearshore area e g liujiang coastal reservoir shown in fig s1 a key scale factor was given by the non dimensional number √Æ which governs the groundwater dynamics and salt transport in coastal reservoirs and adjacent aquifers this was considered in the design of the laboratory scale and field scale models in this study √Æ h √Æ where h h dc h at is the ratio of the length of the cut off wall hdc to the aquifer thickness hat mentioned in the supplementary material and Œª œâ n e h at 2 k is the ratio of the aquifer thickness hat to the tidal propagation distance li et al 1999 where k and ne are the hydraulic conductivity and porosity of the aquifer respectively and œâ is the tidal angular frequency the 2 d cross dam slice of the coastal reservoir was simulated using the key parameters following xin 2010 as listed in table s1 based on the values of key parameters √Æ was calculated to be 0 27 for laboratory scale within the range of real life coastal reservoir √Æ 0 20 for field scale model six field scale modeling cases were conducted the fixed inland groundwater input was set to 0 864 m3 s 1 m 1 case fs nt q0 864 2 592 m3 s 1 m 1 case fs nt q2 592 and 4 32 m3 s 1 m 1 case fs nt q4 320 for nontidal conditions and cases fs t q0 864 fs t q2 592 and fs t q4 320 for tidal cases respectively results from the field scale model showed that the tide modified the groundwater dynamics pathways of inland groundwater flow and density driven flow and contributed to the salinization of the coastal reservoir the salinization index was calculated as 0 under nontidal conditions in addition increased inland groundwater input contributed to the decreased salinization in the coastal reservoir as the inland groundwater input increased from 0 864 to 4 320 m3 s 1 m 1 the salinization index c decreased from 0 03 to 0 004 for the tidal cases overall the results of the field scale model were consistent with those observed in the laboratory scale experiments and simulations 4 conclusion coastal reservoirs contribute to the alleviation of water shortages in coastal zones and their water quality is greatly affected by inland groundwater flow and tides we conducted laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to examine the combined effect of inland groundwater and tides on the flow and salinization in a laboratory scale coastal reservoir and aquifer and concluded the following key findings 1 inland groundwater consisted of two components prior to discharging into the sea the majority of the inland groundwater 75 was first discharged into the coastal reservoir and then into the sea while the remaining portion was discharged directly into the sea through the aquifer underneath the reservoir bed 2 tides contributed to a higher inland groundwater discharge into the coastal reservoir under a low inland groundwater input but had little influence on the inland groundwater pathway under a high inland groundwater input furthermore an increased inland groundwater input also led to more inland groundwater entering the coastal reservoir while the proportion of the inland groundwater discharged across the aquifer reservoir interface relative to the total inland groundwater input decreased 3 tides significantly enhanced the water exchange between the reservoir and aquifer not only by generating tide induced flow seawater circulation but also by increasing density driven flow tide induced flow dominated the salt exchange through the reservoir aquifer interface and was the major source of salt in the coastal reservoir the interactions between tide induced flow and the inland groundwater flow were nonlinear 4 an increase in the inland groundwater input made the freshwater seawater interface within the adjacent aquifer retreat seaward while the tide enlarged the mixing zone and pushed the freshwater seawater interface landward salinization of the coastal reservoir decreased nonlinearly as the inland groundwater input increased specifically salinization decreased rapidly when the inland groundwater input was relatively small but decreased slowly when the inland groundwater input was large this study assumed aquifer homogeneity simple sinusoidal tidal signals and flat reservoir beds in reality the heterogeneity of adjacent aquifers multiple tidal constituents and the bedform of the reservoir bottom can perturb groundwater flow and play an important role in water and salt exchange across the reservoir aquifer interface geng and michael 2020 li and boufadel 2010 shen et al 2015 further studies are needed to consider these three factors to develop a better understanding of the flow and salinization of coastal reservoirs and adjacent aquifers the model and results could also be applied to understand the flow dynamics and associated salt transport between closed lagoons and coastal aquifers owing to the similarity in the boundary conditions between these two situation moran et al 2014 closed lagoons are found on coastlines worldwide and are considered to be systems with shallow brackish water and water quality that is highly dependent on inland groundwater inputs and tides f√©lix et al 2015 accordingly understanding the mixing processes of inland groundwater and seawater in coastal reservoir enclosed lagoons is important for protecting nearshore ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement

4413,coastal reservoirs can alleviate the shortage of freshwater in the nearshore zone inland groundwater and tides can cause hydraulic gradients between seawater and reservoir water and affect the salt concentration of coastal reservoirs however the mechanism is poorly understood laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the combined effect of inland groundwater inputs and tides on the surface subsurface flow and salinization dynamics of the coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer the results indicated that inland groundwater followed two pathways before discharging into the sea regardless of the tidal conditions the predominant pathway led inland groundwater to be discharged to the coastal reservoir and then to sea the other pathway encompassed the entire aquifer underlying the reservoir bed and terminated at the aquifer sea interface as the inland groundwater input increased the groundwater entering the reservoir also increased whereas the ratio of the fresh groundwater transported through the reservoir to the total groundwater input decreased tidal pumping allowed more seawater to intrude into the coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer compared with nontidal conditions this caused a larger proportion of groundwater to be discharged to the coastal reservoir with the density driven flow and water salt exchange across the aquifer reservoir interface also enhanced as the inland groundwater input increased salinization of the coastal reservoir decreased and the inhibition of the inland groundwater input on salinization also decreased this study contributes to the improved management of such coastal infrastructures keywords coastal reservoir groundwater flow tide salinization 1 introduction water scarcity has become increasingly pronounced in coastal areas owing to economic development and population growth neumann et al 2015 phan et al 2018 coastal reservoirs that are created by enclosing a section of the coast through the construction of impermeable dams to store freshwater fig 1 can alleviate the shortage of freshwater in such areas jin et al 2019 yang 2018 salinization of reservoir water due to seawater intrusion through the adjacent aquifer can greatly threaten the functionality of coastal reservoirs lin and gong 2019 sitharam and kolathayar 2020 salinization seawater intrusion of coastal reservoirs depends largely on the hydrodynamic processes in the surrounding aquifer among which inland groundwater inputs kuan et al 2019 and tides robinson et al 2007 are the most important factors controlling the exchange of water and salt driven by hydraulic gradients inland groundwater can be discharged into the sea and is considered an important source of freshwater to coastal reservoirs and or the sea moore 1996 recently luijendijk et al 2020 further quantified inland groundwater inputs on a global scale and indicated that the total inland groundwater input through aquifers exceeded 25 of the river flux in coastal unconfined aquifers inland groundwater flows above the offshore saltwater wedge under nontidal conditions kuan et al 2012 in a coastal aquifer affected by the construction of a coastal reservoir the inland groundwater input may be intercepted by the coastal reservoir before it discharges into the sea jin et al 2019 thus affecting the salinization of the coastal reservoir the hydraulic gradients between inland groundwater reservoir water and seawater control the total influx of fresh groundwater to a coastal reservoir and the salt distribution in the adjacent aquifer such hydraulic gradients remain constant after several years of operating a coastal reservoir resulting in a stable salt concentration in the reservoir water however any process resulting in the imbalance of the above mentioned hydraulic head may affect the salinization of a coastal reservoir for instance a decreased inland groundwater input can cause increased salinity in coastal reservoirs wang and zhu 2014 in contrast an increased inland groundwater input pushes the saltwater freshwater interface seaward and reduces salinization in a coastal reservoir sun et al 2008 overall inland groundwater inputs have a significant impact on the water salt exchange between a coastal reservoir and the adjacent aquifer thus affecting the salt distribution in both tides are the most important oceanic forcing in coastal aquifers coastal reservoirs are normally constructed within estuaries close to the offshore region thus tide induced flow can greatly affect salinization in reservoir water tides create varying hydraulic gradients and affect flows and salt transport jin et al 2019 resulting in seawater circulation through the aquifer sea interface whereby seawater enters an aquifer at high tide and leaves the aquifer coastal reservoir at low tide kuan et al 2012 mulligan et al 2011 in coastal aquifer the tide induced flow has much shorter transit times as compared with the inland groundwater flow and creates a more reactive zone as an upper saline plume in addition to the lower saltwater wedge robinson et al 2007 as such inland groundwater flows into the sea through the freshwater discharge zone between the upper saline plume and the lower salt wedge heiss and michael 2014 tide induced flow also contributes to an increased water exchange between groundwater and seawater li et al 1999 yu et al 2019 for instance kuan et al 2019 found that tides increased the total groundwater discharge by 100 owing to the modified groundwater dynamics in a coastal aquifer after the construction of a coastal reservoir seawater intrusion driven by tide induced flow can only occur through the aquifer under the cut off wall because the dam cut off wall can prevent direct seawater intrusion into the coastal reservoir this situation contributes to the unclear and complex impacts of tides on groundwater pathways and salinization in coastal reservoirs and adjacent aquifers seawater driven by tide induced flow mixes with fresh inland groundwater resulting in salt movement toward the freshwater zone this forms a convective circulation within the dispersion zone in the saltwater wedge that is density driven flow cooper 1959 the density driven flow influenced by inland groundwater and tides can affect the water salt exchange between surface water reservoir water and groundwater destouni and prieto 2003 and thus the salinization of a coastal reservoir smith 2004 found that density driven flow was the largest under a medium input of inland groundwater because a low input of inland groundwater resulted in a wide dispersion zone with reduced density gradients whereas a high input of inland groundwater restricted seawater intrusion gonneea et al 2013 showed that density driven flow was very sensitive to seawater level fluctuations driven by tides therefore density driven flow was rarely at a steady state in comparison to individual forcing the combined effect of inland groundwater inputs and tides would contribute to a more complex density driven flow and hydraulic dynamics in a coastal aquifer werner et al 2013 for example robinson et al 2007 suggested that tides can increase the density driven circulation and total saltwater exchange between groundwater and seawater xin et al 2010 found that the total groundwater discharge flux under the combined effect of tides and waves was less than that induced by these two forces separately therefore to better predict the salinization of coastal reservoirs the combined effect of inland groundwater inputs and tides should be investigated previous studies have revealed that inland groundwater and tides are important hydrodynamic factors in coastal aquifers however few studies have focused on the impacts of inland groundwater and tides on the salinization of coastal reservoirs in particular the hydrodynamic processes driven by the combined effect of inland groundwater inputs and tides in aquifers adjacent to coastal reservoirs are poorly understood in this study laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to unravel three key questions 1 how do inland groundwater inputs and tides alter the subsurface flow pathways in aquifers adjacent to coastal reservoirs 2 how are reservoir water porewater and seawater exchanged through the aquifer reservoir interface and aquifer sea interface 3 how do inland groundwater inputs and tides affect the salt distribution and salinization in coastal reservoirs and adjacent aquifers 2 methodology 2 1 laboratory experiments 2 1 1 experimental setup and measurements laboratory experiments were carried out in a sand flume with lengths heights and widths of 3 5 m 0 8 m and 0 02 m respectively the sidewalls of the sand flume were made using tempered glass to visualize the salt distribution movement in the laboratory scale coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer the flume was set up to replicate the flow dynamics and salt transport in the cross section perpendicular to the cut off wall for a typical coastal reservoir on a laboratory scale this configuration assumes uniform water flow and salt transport along the cross section of the cut off wall the sand flume consisted of three components based on its function a freshwater tank and peristaltic pumps were set up at the landward boundary to provide a fixed groundwater input the middle section was packed with freshwater and quartz sand to represent coastal and adjacent aquifers the right section was set to replicate tidal fluctuations by pumping saltwater from a saltwater tank via a variable height overflow vho column the neighboring sections were separated by a fine stainless steel screen to allow water exchange and prevent sand movement across the sections an impermeable plate was inserted between the reservoir and seawater sections as a dam and was partially buried into the reservoir bed to replicate the cut off wall of the coastal reservoir blue line in fig 2 b four vertical arrays a1 a4 of micro ports for water groundwater and reservoir water sampling were located near the bottom of the coastal reservoir fig 2a these vertical arrays were denoted as ai where i is a number representing the location of an array the higher the value of i the closer the vertical array was to the cut off wall vertical arrays were set at equal intervals of 0 1 m and the length from a4 to the cut off wall was 0 05 m each vertical array contained five sampling ports and the elevation for these five sampling ports was set as 0 05 m 0 15 m 0 25 m 0 35 m and 0 4 m above the model base bc in fig 2b the particle size distribution of the sand used in the experiments was relatively uniform with d 50 0 24 mm and d 90 d 10 2 86 the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the experimental sand was 4 78 10 3 m s 1 and the porosity was 0 46 fd c red food dye roha dyecem pvt ltd was chosen as the saltwater tracer as it has been successfully used in previous studies of groundwater dynamics in coastal aquifers shen et al 2015 2020 artificial seawater was prepared by mixing 33 4 g of sodium chloride nacl analytical grade reagent and 1 6 g of fd c per liter of deionized water high resolution photographs were taken using a digital camera to track the salt distribution during the experiments 2 1 2 experimental procedures the sand was rinsed with deionized water before the experiment and sieved according to the procedure of jin et al 2010 to avoid impurities the treatment sand was covered with deionized water and laid into a sink to minimize air trapping and ensure the freshness of the initial coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer the impermeable panel was placed between the seawater and reservoir sections to prevent seawater intrusion as soon as the sand was filled with a pre designed profile a constant reservoir water level 0 45 m above the flume base was controlled by a freshwater outlet before the experiment the experiments were started by turning off the freshwater outlet and removing the impervious panels a tide with an amplitude of 0 055 m and a period of 120 s was used in the experiments under tidal influence for the cases without a tidal influence the sea level was controlled at 0 446 m above the flume base owing to the inflow of fresh inland groundwater the salinity of the seawater section may decrease slightly during such experiments thus we monitored the salinity in the seawater section using a ysi pro30 conductivity meter every 30 min to ensure a stable tidal signal with the same salt concentration during the experiments six experimental cases with fixed inland groundwater fluxes for tidal and nontidal conditions were conducted in the sand flume the experiments were conducted until the salt distribution in the aquifer reached a steady state under nontidal conditions or a quasi steady state under tidal conditions specifically we considered the experiment to have reached a quasi steady state when the salinity of the water and the location of the horizontal toe of the saltwater wedge at a certain point in time did not change by 1 compared with the values recorded 30 min ago the fixed inland groundwater input rates were set as 12 ml min 1 20 ml min 1 and 30 ml min 1 and the corresponding darcy velocities specific discharge rates were calculated as 1 47 10 5 m s 1 2 45 10 5 m s 1 and 3 68 10 5 m s 1 respectively accordingly the experimental cases were named nt q12 nt q20 and nt q30 for nontidal conditions and t q12 t q20 and t q30 for tidal conditions respectively 2 2 numerical model sutra voss and provost 2002 is a variably saturated variable density groundwater flow and solute transport model and was used to investigate the dynamics and salt transport in the experimental coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer under the combined effect of an inland groundwater input and tides previous studies have successfully used sutra in the study of water and solute transport in coastal aquifers at laboratory and field scales kuan et al 2012 shen et al 2015 xin et al 2010 2 2 1 initial and boundary conditions numerical simulations were conducted to replicate the flow dynamics and salt distribution in the laboratory experiments fig 2b the x and z coordinates were oriented inland and upward respectively and were intersected at the bottom of the seawater boundary point c no water or salt flux occurred at the bottom bc and upper ae sides of the sand and the cut off wall de thus no flow boundary was applied at the boundary of ae bc and de the inland boundary ab was applied by a fixed flux with a background salt concentration of 0 001 ppt to simulate inland groundwater inflow the seawater boundary cd was set as a time varied specified pressure boundary at a constant salt concentration according to the seawater fluctuation in the experiments as follows 1 h t z msl a t sin œâ t where h l is the seawater level at time t t zmsl is the mean sea level at l is the amplitude of the tide and œâ 1 s is the tidal angular frequency 2 2 2 utilization of the richards equation for surface water modeling the simulation of the flow and salt transport in the experimental coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer required an exchange between the aquifer groundwater and coastal reservoir surface water the richards equation is normally used in the investigation of groundwater dynamics the high k approach chui and freyberg 2008 winter 1976 can represent simulated surface water by setting the high k zone as a hyper porous medium with a much higher hydraulic conductivity a porosity of 1 and a steep water retention curve xiao et al 2019 xin et al 2009 successfully used this method to represent surface water when studying water and salt transport in coastal aquifers therefore this approach was used in the present study to simulate the salt transport between the experimental reservoir water and groundwater the laminar representation of the simulated reservoir water surface water was considered sufficient because of the slow salt transport and small reservoir water fluctuation during the experiments 2 2 3 parameters for the numerical simulations the model had two components 1 a reservoir zone high k zone to represent the surface water and 2 aquifer zone representing the aquifer adjacent to the coastal reservoir the water levels of the coastal reservoirs in cases t q12 t q30 nt q12 and nt q30 over two tidal cycles at a quasi steady state were used to calibrate the numerical model the validation of the numerical model was conducted by comparing the salinity data along the four sampling arrays in all experimental cases to those in the numerical results this ensured that the numerical model could successfully reproduce the groundwater dynamics and salt transport processes in laboratory experiments the parameters used in the numerical simulations are listed in table 1 the assumption of homogeneous and isotropic soil was used in the model the model was discretized according to a common criterion voss and souza 1987 the uniform mesh size with Œ¥x 0 007 m and Œ¥z 0 005 m resulted in 67 821 nodes and 67 200 elements the peclet number pe was set to 3 54 and the courant number cr was set to 0 6 to ensure that the simulation results were irrelevant to grid discretization we also conducted a grid dependency test by comparing the simulation results between two different refined meshes in the same case 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow dynamics at a quasi steady state fig 3 shows the reservoir water levels measured and simulated for cases t q12 t q30 nt q12 and nt q30 over two tidal cycles at a quasi steady state under nontidal conditions the reservoir water level remained constant 0 453 m and 0 456 m for cases nt q12 and nt q30 respectively under tidal conditions the reservoir water level fluctuated following the oscillation of the seawater level a distinct phase shift of the reservoir water level 27 s delay of the signal was observed for cases t q12 and t q30 although the fluctuation periods for the reservoir water and seawater were identical 120 s atlabachew et al 2018 and yi et al 2012 also found such a delay in nearshore aquifers and suggested that the aquifer properties could have affected the delay the fluctuation amplitude of the reservoir water level was reduced by 83 6 0 009 m for cases t q12 and t q30 and the mean water level was increased 0 450 and 0 454 m for cases t q12 and t q30 compared with the seawater level amplitude of 0 055 m and mean seawater level of 0 446 m regardless of the tide the mean reservoir water level rose as the inland groundwater input increased this may have been due to the limited water exchange capacity between the reservoir and adjacent aquifer resulting in a portion of the inland groundwater being stored in the reservoir instead of being discharged offshore these indicate that the model could successfully reproduce the fluctuation of the reservoir water level thus capturing the groundwater dynamics in the adjacent aquifer the simulated flow field within the aquifer adjacent to the coastal reservoir for cases t q20 and nt q20 at a quasi steady state is shown in fig 4 based on the results in fig 4 three flow patterns were observed 1 tide induced flow 2 inland groundwater flow and 3 density driven flow which were also found in the coastal aquifers evans and wilson 2016 robinson et al 2018 shen et al 2019 the tide induced flow was clearly observed at the low fig 4a and high fig 4c tides it was mainly driven by the head difference between the seawater and reservoir water and induced porewater circulation aquifer to the reservoir at high tide and reservoir to the aquifer at low tide underneath the reservoir bed near the aquifer sea interface in the nontidal case inland groundwater flow fig 4f gray line with arrows was considered to have two components one component of the inland groundwater input was discharged into the sea directly while the other component was first discharged into the coastal reservoir and then into the sea under the influence of tides the inland groundwater flow fig 4e started from the inland boundary and flowed to the reservoir dominating the majority of the landward aquifer density driven flow fig 4e and f yellow line with arrows was also significantly different between the two cases with and without the tide in the nontidal case particles initially proceeded from the inland aquifer sea interface near the base of the model and returned to the sea from the lower part of the aquifer sea interface fig 4f in the tidal case particles travelled from the reservoir bed to the sloping beach fig 4e we further investigated the combined effect of the inland groundwater input and tides on the flow pathways and associated transit time based on the tidally averaged flow field at a quasi steady state right column of fig 5 the transit time was defined as the time interval required for a particle to move from entry position to the boundary of the model zimmerman 1976 more specifically it was calculated by integrating the unit time unit length by the unit velocity on each pass by cell on its corresponding streamline as mentioned above inland groundwater flow qf consists of two components based on its termination 2 q f q fr q fs where qfr is calculated to quantify the inland groundwater flow from the aquifer to the reservoir through the sloping beach of the reservoir and qfs is the fresh groundwater directly discharged into the sea through the aquifer sea interface Œµ was set as the ratio of qfr to qf to indicate the proportion of water flowing into the coastal reservoir to the total inland groundwater input under nontidal conditions qfr increased from 10 84 ml min 1 to 23 67 ml min 1 as the inland groundwater input increased from 12 ml min 1 to 30 ml min 1 while Œµ decreased from 90 3 to 78 9 these results indicate that a majority of the inland groundwater input was discharged into the coastal reservoir and that this portion decreased although the value increased as the inland groundwater input increased under tidal conditions Œµ was 100 for the cases with qf set to 12 ml min 1 and 20 ml min 1 but was 95 3 for the case with qf set to 30 ml min 1 these results suggest that the tides pushed more inland groundwater to enter the coastal reservoir in comparison to the nontidal condition density driven flow also changed as the inland groundwater input varied in the cases with and without tidal influence the transit times for density driven flow were significantly higher nearly two orders of magnitude than those of inland groundwater flow and tide induced flow the right column of fig 5 which was consistent with the findings of robinson et al 2007 and xin et al 2010 under nontidal conditions the density driven flow fig 5c f and i transit time 1000 tidal cycles was found near the model base close to the aquifer sea interface and the toe of that area retreated seaward as the inland groundwater flux increased in the cases with a tidal influence the density driven flow was located below the reservoir bed above the model base whereas inland groundwater flow was weak fig 5l o and formed as a circulation near the model base when a large inland groundwater flux occurred fig 5r these results suggest that in the absence or presence of tides with a high groundwater input the density driven flow does not contribute to the water exchange across the reservoir aquifer interface 3 2 distribution of salt at quasi steady state predicting the salt distribution in coastal reservoirs and adjacent aquifers under complex dynamic forcing can contribute to the accuracy assessment of freshwater sources in coastal aquifers and is vital for improving the management of coastal reservoirs the experimental and numerical results for the salt distribution in the laboratory scale coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer at a quasi steady state are shown in the left and middle columns of fig 5 although the dye tracking method allowed the saltwater freshwater interface to be visualized it failed to capture the mixing zone because the salinity of saltwater could not be clearly distinguished by the shade of the dye chang and clement 2012 morgan et al 2013 yu et al 2019 the tides induced seawater infiltration into the experimental coastal reservoir resulting in a more landward toe of the salt distribution in the adjacent aquifer for the nontidal cases the salinity near the reservoir bed was nearly zero and the shape of the salt distribution formed as a wedge near the model base the horizontal toe of the saltwater wedge moved seaward from 1 38 m to 0 72 m and then to 0 45 m as qf increased from 12 ml min 1 to 20 ml min 1 and then to 30 ml min 1 fig 5b e and h respectively an increase in the inland groundwater input pushed the saltwater freshwater interface to retreat seaward which is consistent with the findings of kuan et al 2019 and liu et al 2016 for the cases with a tidal influence the horizontal toe locations retreated seaward from 1 66 m to 0 97 m and then to 0 55 m as qf increased from 12 ml min 1 to 20 ml min 1 and then to 30 ml min 1 fig 5k n and g respectively such results for the toe location also imply a nonlinear interaction between inland groundwater flow and tides as the tide accelerated the salt distribution declined in response to an increased inland groundwater flux another interesting finding is that the saltwater freshwater interface failed to maintain its classic shape in case t q30 compared with the other cases the saltwater wedge in the aquifer was partly separated into two salt wedges one near the bottom of the reservoir and the other close to the model base which have may been due to a portion of the fresh groundwater discharging directly into the aquifer sea interface fig 5q and r overall the modeled salt distribution agreed well with the experimental results we also compared the experimental and numerical salinities along the four vertical sampling arrays fig 2a a1 a2 a3 and a4 at the high tide level at a quasi steady state fig 6 the salinity distribution indicates the mixing zone in the adjacent aquifer across the mixing zone the salt concentration and fluid density gradually increase from the freshwater zone to the saltwater zone wicks and herman 1996 tides enhance the mixing of freshwater and saltwater and enlarge the associated mixing zone with the saltwater wedge finally dominating the aquifer under the reservoir bed the thickness of the mixing zone in each profile was considered as the length from the 95 isohaline to the 5 isohaline watson et al 2010 which varied from 0 02 m profile a4 in case nt q30 to 0 10 m profile a1 in case nt q12 for the nontidal cases whereas it was 0 35 m for all tidal cases this have may been because tide induced flow increased the salinity in the coastal reservoir and formed a recirculation from the bottom to the sloping beach or a recirculation near the model base fig 5l o r thus the associated mixing zone was much thicker the salinity of the reservoir water and adjacent aquifer based on numerical simulation results were integrated to indicate the evolution of the salt mass in both zones fig 7 a and b for the nontidal cases no salt was found in the reservoir which was consistent with the results in figs 5 and 6 in the tidal cases a nonlinear increase in the salt mass of the reservoir water was observed as the inland groundwater flux decreased for instance when qf decreased from 30 ml min 1 to 20 ml min 1 the salt mass in the reservoir increased by 0 086 kg m 1 from 0 060 to 0 146 kg m 1 a reduction in qf from 20 ml min 1 to 12 ml min 1 increased the salt mass in the reservoir by 0 18 kg m 1 from 0 146 kg m 1 to 0 326 kg m 1 this nonlinear increase suggests that the enhancement of salt mass would be accelerated as the inland groundwater flux decreased compared with the reservoir water more salt was stored in the aquifer the evolution of the salt mass in the reservoir under a high inland groundwater flux 30 ml min 1 was relatively rapid with the quasi steady state reaching 35 tidal cycles in contrast the increased salt mass for a low inland groundwater flux 12 ml min 1 was more gradual with the steady state achieved at 1000 tidal cycles these results indicate that a larger inland groundwater input would shorten the time required for the groundwater flow and associated salt transport system to reach the quasi steady state 3 3 water and salt exchange between the coastal reservoir and aquifer the local water salt influx and efflux across the aquifer reservoir interface were calculated by integrating the fluxes over a tidal cycle based on the simulation results fig 8 under nontidal conditions the water and salt flux patterns were relatively simple with the water influxes from the aquifer to the reservoir occurring at the sloping beach and effluxes found through the reservoir bed from the reservoir to the aquifer the water influxes and effluxes decreased as the inland groundwater input increased as expected no salt exchange between the reservoir and aquifer was observed in the nontidal cases for the tidal cases the water influxes and effluxes were nearly identical through the reservoir aquifer interface except for the inland groundwater input zone 0 6 m x 0 8 m where significant water influxes with no efflux were observed the salt exchange was concentrated on the reservoir bed with salt influx aquifer to the reservoir rates reaching their maximum near the cut off wall x 0 m which were calculated as 8 73 10 5 kg s 1 m 1 7 58 10 5 kg s 1 m 1 and 6 64 10 5 kg s 1 m 1 for cases t q12 t q20 and t q30 respectively these results indicate that the salt influxes driven by tide induced flow contributed to the salinization of the reservoir water and decreased as the inland groundwater input increased the total water influx qtotal was calculated by integrating the water influxes along the aquifer reservoir interface table 2 which were enhanced by the presence of tides and increased inland groundwater input qf for example when qf was fixed at 12 ml min 1 qtotal increased 12 8 fold by the effect of tides 9 03 10 6 m3 s 1 m 1 and 1 16 10 4 m3 s 1 m 1 in cases nt q12 and t q12 respectively when the tidal effect was considered qtotal increased from 1 16 10 4 m3 s 1 m 1 to 1 20 10 4 m3 s 1 m 1 as qf increased from 12 ml min 1 to 30 ml min 1 thus the percentage increase in qtotal 3 5 was significantly lower than the percentage increase in qf 150 in addition the qtotal value across the reservoir aquifer interface was almost a simple linear sum of the inland groundwater flow from the aquifer to the reservoir qfr density driven flow qd and tide induced flow qt which is consistent with the results of xin et al 2010 and taniguchi et al 2002 this almost simple linear sum was mainly because the adjacent aquifer could rapidly respond to the varying boundary conditions such that the influxes and effluxes regulated each other across the reservoir aquifer interface based on the local water fluxes and tidally averaged flow fields we also calculated the recirculation rates for these three flow patterns table 2 regardless of the tidal conditions the density driven flux qd decreased as qf increased specifically the density driven flux qd decreased from 2 00 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 to 1 83 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 under nontidal conditions and from 6 91 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 to 2 08 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 under tidal conditions as qf increased from 12 ml min 1 to 30 ml min 1 accordingly the rate of decrease under nontidal conditions 0 17 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 was significantly smaller than that under tidal conditions 4 83 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 furthermore density driven flow was enhanced under tidal conditions for example with qf set to 12 ml min 1 the density driven flux increased from 2 00 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 without tides to 6 91 10 7 m3 s 1 m 1 with tides i e a 3 5 fold increase this suggests that the water exchange was different between the cases driven by individual forcing alone or multiple forcing as qf increased from 12 ml min 1 to 20 ml min 1 and then to 30 ml min 1 the tide induced flux qt decreased from 1 06 10 4 m3 s 1 m 1 to 1 01 10 4 m3 s 1 m 1 and then to 9 63 10 5 m3 s 1 m 1 respectively these results indicate that the interaction between the inland groundwater and the tide was nonlinear for example an increase of 66 7 in qf from 12 ml min 1 to 20 ml min 1 resulted in a 4 7 reduction in the tide induced flux and an increase of 50 in qf from 20 ml min 1 to 30 ml min 1 resulted in a 4 6 reduction in the tide induced flux this nonlinear interaction suggests that the inhibition of the inland groundwater input on tide induced flow was slightly accelerated furthermore tide induced flow dominated the water exchange across the reservoir aquifer interface the contributions of tide induced flow to the total water inflow varied from 91 4 to 80 5 as qf increased from 12 ml min 1 to 30 ml min 1 3 4 effects of inland groundwater flux and tides on flow pathways and salinization two dimensionless indices Œµ and c were used to indicate the flow pathways and salinization respectively c was calculated as the ratio of the average salinity of reservoir water to that of seawater as a salinization index in the coastal reservoir as follows 3 c ave c œÅ d v œÅ d v 4 œÅ œÅ 0 c œÅ c 5 c c ave c sea where c is the salinity of the reservoir water at each spatial volume v l3 c 0 is the salinity of freshwater œÅ 0 ml 3 is the density of freshwater œÅ 0 1000 kg m 3 œÅ c ml 3 is the change rate of density proportional to the salt concentration 714 3 kg m 3 c sea is the salinity of seawater c sea 0 035 we conducted 44 additional numerical simulations to further test the importance of the inland groundwater input on the flow and salinization of the coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifer in the cases with and without tides the inland groundwater fluxes were adjusted from 8 ml min 1 to 56 ml min 1 to ensure the validity of darcy s law bramhall 1971 tides modified the inland groundwater pathways particularly in the cases with a lower inland groundwater flux fig 9 in the nontidal cases Œµ achieved the highest value 0 921 at the lowest qf 8 ml min 1 and decreased steadily as qf increased the slope of the trend flattened out when qf was 32 ml min 1 in the tidal cases the inland groundwater totally Œµ 100 flowed into the reservoir for cases with a qf value of 24 ml min 1 in addition Œµ decreased rapidly as the value of qf increased for cases with qf set to 26 ml min 1 the largest 0 184 and smallest 0 0062 differences in Œµ between the cases with and without tides were found for a qf value of 24 ml min 1 and 56 ml min 1 respectively these results indicate that tides pushed more inland groundwater into the coastal reservoir in the cases with a lower inland groundwater input 24 ml min 1 compared with the nontidal cases however in the case with a very high inland groundwater input 56 ml min 1 the influxes of inland groundwater to the coastal reservoir were nearly identical between the two cases with and without tides as the inland groundwater input increased more groundwater was discharged into the coastal reservoir but the contribution of this portion decreased rapidly when the inland groundwater input exceeded 24 ml min 1 this may have been due to the limited water storage capacity in the laboratory scale coastal reservoir understanding inland groundwater input pathways might also have important implications for studies on the eutrophication of reservoir water lin and sun 2008 because inland groundwater can contain large quantities of land sourced chemicals paytan et al 2006 fig 10 under nontidal conditions the salinization index of the coastal reservoir was calculated as 0 regardless of the amount of inland groundwater flow under tidal conditions the case with the lowest inland groundwater flux had the highest c 0 345 and c decreased as the inland groundwater flux increased in a nonlinear fashion the same 2 ml min 1 increment in qf reduced the salinization index by 0 061 for the cases with a small inland groundwater input from 8 ml min 1 to 10 ml min 1 and by 0 003 for the cases with large inland groundwater input from 44 ml min 1 to 46 ml min 1 the reduction of the former was almost 20 fold than that of the latter which suggests that the reduction of salinization was greatly decelerated as the inland groundwater flux increased this may have been due to the accelerated reduction in tide induced flow by the inland groundwater input 3 5 field scale numerical simulations to generalize the results we conducted simulations on a field scale coastal reservoir the dimensions of the field scale model were based on normal coastal reservoir in the nearshore area e g liujiang coastal reservoir shown in fig s1 a key scale factor was given by the non dimensional number √Æ which governs the groundwater dynamics and salt transport in coastal reservoirs and adjacent aquifers this was considered in the design of the laboratory scale and field scale models in this study √Æ h √Æ where h h dc h at is the ratio of the length of the cut off wall hdc to the aquifer thickness hat mentioned in the supplementary material and Œª œâ n e h at 2 k is the ratio of the aquifer thickness hat to the tidal propagation distance li et al 1999 where k and ne are the hydraulic conductivity and porosity of the aquifer respectively and œâ is the tidal angular frequency the 2 d cross dam slice of the coastal reservoir was simulated using the key parameters following xin 2010 as listed in table s1 based on the values of key parameters √Æ was calculated to be 0 27 for laboratory scale within the range of real life coastal reservoir √Æ 0 20 for field scale model six field scale modeling cases were conducted the fixed inland groundwater input was set to 0 864 m3 s 1 m 1 case fs nt q0 864 2 592 m3 s 1 m 1 case fs nt q2 592 and 4 32 m3 s 1 m 1 case fs nt q4 320 for nontidal conditions and cases fs t q0 864 fs t q2 592 and fs t q4 320 for tidal cases respectively results from the field scale model showed that the tide modified the groundwater dynamics pathways of inland groundwater flow and density driven flow and contributed to the salinization of the coastal reservoir the salinization index was calculated as 0 under nontidal conditions in addition increased inland groundwater input contributed to the decreased salinization in the coastal reservoir as the inland groundwater input increased from 0 864 to 4 320 m3 s 1 m 1 the salinization index c decreased from 0 03 to 0 004 for the tidal cases overall the results of the field scale model were consistent with those observed in the laboratory scale experiments and simulations 4 conclusion coastal reservoirs contribute to the alleviation of water shortages in coastal zones and their water quality is greatly affected by inland groundwater flow and tides we conducted laboratory experiments and numerical simulations to examine the combined effect of inland groundwater and tides on the flow and salinization in a laboratory scale coastal reservoir and aquifer and concluded the following key findings 1 inland groundwater consisted of two components prior to discharging into the sea the majority of the inland groundwater 75 was first discharged into the coastal reservoir and then into the sea while the remaining portion was discharged directly into the sea through the aquifer underneath the reservoir bed 2 tides contributed to a higher inland groundwater discharge into the coastal reservoir under a low inland groundwater input but had little influence on the inland groundwater pathway under a high inland groundwater input furthermore an increased inland groundwater input also led to more inland groundwater entering the coastal reservoir while the proportion of the inland groundwater discharged across the aquifer reservoir interface relative to the total inland groundwater input decreased 3 tides significantly enhanced the water exchange between the reservoir and aquifer not only by generating tide induced flow seawater circulation but also by increasing density driven flow tide induced flow dominated the salt exchange through the reservoir aquifer interface and was the major source of salt in the coastal reservoir the interactions between tide induced flow and the inland groundwater flow were nonlinear 4 an increase in the inland groundwater input made the freshwater seawater interface within the adjacent aquifer retreat seaward while the tide enlarged the mixing zone and pushed the freshwater seawater interface landward salinization of the coastal reservoir decreased nonlinearly as the inland groundwater input increased specifically salinization decreased rapidly when the inland groundwater input was relatively small but decreased slowly when the inland groundwater input was large this study assumed aquifer homogeneity simple sinusoidal tidal signals and flat reservoir beds in reality the heterogeneity of adjacent aquifers multiple tidal constituents and the bedform of the reservoir bottom can perturb groundwater flow and play an important role in water and salt exchange across the reservoir aquifer interface geng and michael 2020 li and boufadel 2010 shen et al 2015 further studies are needed to consider these three factors to develop a better understanding of the flow and salinization of coastal reservoirs and adjacent aquifers the model and results could also be applied to understand the flow dynamics and associated salt transport between closed lagoons and coastal aquifers owing to the similarity in the boundary conditions between these two situation moran et al 2014 closed lagoons are found on coastlines worldwide and are considered to be systems with shallow brackish water and water quality that is highly dependent on inland groundwater inputs and tides f√©lix et al 2015 accordingly understanding the mixing processes of inland groundwater and seawater in coastal reservoir enclosed lagoons is important for protecting nearshore ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement

4414,negligence of environmental flow e flow has severe adverse impacts on wetlands additionally hydrological droughts compounded by mismanagement of available water resources and anthropogenic activities lead to water shortage and degrade wetland ecosystem however in dealing with reservoir operation re operation a few studies have addressed inflow uncertainty and hydrological drought state to improve the monthly operation performance of an upstream reservoir in coordination with downstream wetland needs hence the study objective is to adopt a linear nonlinear reservoir operation rule to hydrological drought states and e flow requirements so first the soil and water assessment swat model is applied to simulate the natural daily flow regime by eliminating human impacts then using the tennant e flow scheme the intra inter annual variability of e flow and the degree of alteration of the flow are measured afterward using the standardized hydrological drought index shdi the drought wet severity and duration are determined a linear nonlinear simulation model adopted for the presentation of reservoir policies and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii was employed to determine the optimal monthly operation of the upstream reservoir the simulated operation policies correspond to each hydrological drought state were evaluated with reliability resilience vulnerability and water deficit indices results indicated that incorporation of hydrological drought state could improve the overall system reliability by 23 over simply enforcing the monthly variable parameter nonlinear decision rules also the proposed methodology simultaneously maximized the downstream allocated water and e flow of the terminal wetland it also implicitly minimized the change in extreme flow metrics that are known to benefit ecosystem diversity the proposed framework supports reservoir re operation in regions subject to challenges in supplying water to different sectors while maintaining e flow during drought periods keywords hydrological drought natural flow regime monthly policy reservoir environmental flow zayandeh rud 1 introduction maintaining the ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems depends upon a variety of factors while such factors directly or indirectly interact with each other the natural flow regime nfr involving variation of hydrologic regimes must be satisfied to preserve the ecological integrity richter et al 1996 abdi and yasi 2015 up to now several e flow paradigms have been proposed for best preserving the ecosystem amongst them the tennant method tennant 1976 has received the most attention for the assessment of e flow requirements shaeri et al 2014 haghighi and kl√∏ve 2017 it is primarily due to its easy computation low cost dependency on historical flow records and convenient application to sustainable water resources management amrit et al 2018 goguen et al 2020 haghighi and kl√∏ve 2017 used the tennant method to design e flow regimes based on recommended flow distribution corresponding to good flow conditions they redistributed the monthly tennant s estimated e flow to overcome the water shortage associated with the periods with high water consumption the 7q10 flow the minimum average flow over seven consecutive days every ten years is the second most widely used hydrological criteria for the e flow evaluation tharme 2003 using the 7q10 as a lower threshold for e flow allocation ensures 10 of the average annual flow the lowest e flow recommended by the tennant method is not less than the threshold value of 7q10 the 7q10 flow is the minimum e flow throughout the year while it is far less than any minimum values calculated by alternate predictive methods and has been frequently used for water quality protection in the usa shaeri et al 2014 suggesting the e flow by this method makes no guarantee to preserve the optimum range of flow 60 100 average annual flow as the basis for water replenishment of a river ecological restoration so all monthly deviations from the natural state should aggregate into one reprehensive metric in this manner the hydrologic alteration factor supports sustainable watershed development by mimicking the pre impact flow regime reichold et al 2009 shiau and wu 2007 shiau and wu 2007 incorporated the intra and inter annual variability of the nfr to represent a pareto optimal solution for e flow schemes they used aggregated multi objective optimization by considering the overall degree of flow alteration dfa and shortage ratio and noted that the inclusion of the water year type in their proposed framework suggests a planning tool in real time applications dam construction has been controversial to allocate water to different uses such as irrigation industry drinking and the environment it also to some extent changes the climatic condition of the surrounding areas as dam construction is inevitable the ecosystem bears the burden of human needs and economic advances regarding the eco environmental values reservoir operation may minimize the impact of flow alteration in downstream areas to ensure the survival of existing wetlands safavi et al 2015 dutta et al 2020 adopting the e flow criteria in the development of reservoir policies has recently gained steam e g li et al 2018 ortiz partida et al 2016 the first step to consider both e flow and downstream demands is to determine a policy for reservoir operation purposes and to identify the range of possible decisions in this regard linear decision rules ldrs and non linear decision rules nldrs have long been used by researchers e g bhaskar and whitlach 1980 feng et al 2017 despite the introduction of other forms of operation rules it has been claimed that ldrs and nldrs are as good as or better than more complex rules in many cases bhaskar and whitlach 1980 liu et al 2014 simulation optimization models provide a powerful tool to allocate available water resources to downstream demands heydari et al 2016 support sustainable watershed development reichold et al 2009 and drive the adaptive operating rules feng et al 2017 using adaptable policies subject to different drought conditions may improve the operation rules in dry normal and wet periods li et al 2018 reddy and kumar 2006 used three inflow scenarios based on the deviation from mean monthly inflows to represent dry normal and wet periods and applied a bi objective optimization model in conjunction with inflow state scenarios thus containing 36 parameters to obtain the corresponding pareto optimal fronts similarly a study used different inflow classification methods to represent a unique linear reservoir response function for each defined cluster tegegne and kim 2020 they classified the reservoir inflows into distinct categories to provide the optimal operating policies associated with each class i e hydrological conditions hydrologic years and simulated outflows with the improvement assessment of reservoir operation performance however no study did incorporate different inflow states i e dry normal and wet to present a compromise solution with a comprehensive pareto optimal front the main contribution that differentiates the study from previous ones involves extracting the nfr to evaluate the e flow needs and to assess the hydrological drought condition in the natural state based on different time scales in this regard a suitable time lag of the proposed hydrological drought index that best correlates with the 12 month moving average precipitation 12mmap is determined 12 month rainfall may use to classify the moderate to severe hydrological droughts and specify the varying levels of reservoir response in the essence of the supply deficiencies changnon and easterling 1989 it also indicated that 12 month rainfall usually intermingled with streamflows and reservoir levels juliani and okawa 2017 svoboda et al 2012 while 6 month up to 24 month rainfall uses for hydrological drought analyses svoboda et al 2012 reported e flow studies on the zayandeh rud river basin zrrb focused on the e flow of gavkhuni marsh e g sarhadi and soltani 2013 safavi et al 2015 abou et al 2020 no specific study addressed a definite policy to supply the e flow of gavkhuni marsh based on its natural variability while considering hydrological drought state and reconsidering the zayandeh rud dam operation rules hence the n month hydrological drought index and the simulated e flow will be applied in the simulation optimization model to propose the reservoir policies in different drought severity conditions thus the main objective of this study is to develop a coupled monthly variable ldrs nldrs simulation optimization modeling framework for the extraction of reservoir operating rules as impacted by inflow uncertainty based on a hydrological drought index moreover the proposed methodology allocates water to different sectors while minimizing the dfa based on a subset of 12 monthly environmental water requirements besides a hydrological model e g swat is calibrated and validated to simulate the daily natural flow time series this time series converted to a monthly scale is used to derive the hydrological drought state finally adopting the shdi hydrological drought wet conditions within the simulation optimization of the reservoir operation scheme is explored and then the results are compared to those of the policies based on standard reservoir operation rules along with the originality and values of the proposed simulation optimization framework a few limitations are still present including 1 intensive computational effort is required 2 in tennant e flow estimation extreme flow conditions and timing of flow are not incorporated 3 in the nsga ii algorithm apart from usual parameters e g population size and iteration numbers tuning of mutation and crossover probabilities as well as reproduction parameters are required and 4 sediment concentration and water quality are not incorporated in the e flow policy 2 study area the zrrb is located in central iran fig 1 and drains an area of 41 500 km2 representing 2 5 of the total area of the country zayandeh rud river supplies irrigation drinking and industrial water to isfahan province one of the most important economic hubs of iran the zayandeh rud dam was constructed on the zayandeh rud river in 1971 with a storage capacity of 1450 million cubic meters mcm the reservoir release capacity is 380 cubic meters per second cms while the free spillway capacity is 1500 cms palasajan subbasin with an area of about 4 246 km2 is the main tributary of the zayandeh rud dam wheat barley sugar beet and alfalfa are the primary crops in the network of about 297000 ha of agricultural land in zrrb three diversion tunnels namely kuhrang 1 delivering 300 mcm of water annually kuhrang 2 delivering 250 mcm of water annually and cheshmeh langan delivering 120 mcm of water annually have been in operation since 1954 1985 and 2005 respectively a fourth tunnel will provide a further 250 mcm of water annually in the future 3 methodology the proposed simulation optimization

ecological states of the study marsh drought condition and reservoir operation 3 1 simulation of natural flow regime the scenario based hydrological modeling sbhm based swat model adopted by zolfagharpour et al 2020 was used to simulate the nfr using the sbhm the simulated daily runoff disentangled by determining anthropogenic impact in zrrb swat is a semi distributed model that simulates the watershed hydrological cycles on a daily monthly or yearly time scale arnold et al 1998 the arcswat an interface between swat and arcgis for preparing the swat inputs discretizes the basin into several homogeneous hydrologic response units hrus based on topography land use and soil maps in this study the calibrated swat model was used to simulate the nfr throughout the zayandeh rud river zolfagharpour et al 2020 calibrated and validated the swat model for the study basin using meteorological and daily streamflow data for the 1985 2013 period at five hydrometric stations throughout the zayandeh rud river the spatial resolution of the digital elevation model dem land use and soil maps quantified by 90 2000 and 5000 m respectively model calibration was performed via the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup swat cup encompasses several parameter calibration techniques amongst them sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 a semi automated inverse modeling procedure for combined calibration uncertainty analysis was adopted the p factor and r factor were used to evaluate the performance of the swat model the p factor is equal to the percentage of observations covered by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu between the 2 5th and 97 5th percentiles band while the r factor reflects the average thickness of the 95ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the measured data sufi 2 iterated until more than 90 of the measured data fall within the 95ppu while the average distance between 95ppu percentiles is smaller than the standard deviation of measured data abbaspour et al 2004 the swat model performance is measured by the nash sutcliffe coefficient and coefficient of determination r2 in this study a scenario was designed to isolate the impact of human activity on streamflow during the simulation period this scenario involved current land use but with zero agricultural water uses moreover the zayandeh rud dam was eliminated in this scenario to simulate the nfr from 1985 to 2013 further information is available in zolfagharpour et al 2020 3 2 quantification of environmental flow requirements in this study in the absence of ecological data the hydrology based tennant method tennant 1976 was used to evaluate the e flow in the zayandeh rud river in the tennant method calibration data from 11 streams in three states in the united states formed the basis tennant 1976 in this method 10 of average annual flow aaf for sustaining short term survival habitat 30 to preserve good survival condition for most aquatic life forms and general recreation and 60 for excellent to outstanding habitat state are recommended see supplementary information table s1 the tennant method has been practiced in numerous studies e g amrit et al 2018 goguen et al 2020 presuming that the hydrological regime is interconnected with the ecological condition of a river system ultimately the selection of the tennant method in this study is mainly due to access to required data and ease of computation within the proposed simulation optimization model the optimum range of flow conditions 60 100 aaf was used to calculate the e flow objective function drawing from shiau and wu 2007 the dfa of each month considering the pre and post impact flow is determined as follows 1 d m n o m n e m n e m 100 2 d f a 1 12 m 1 12 d m 1 where dm is the degree of flow alteration in month m no m is determined by the simulated releases using the generated rule curves for each iteration of the nsga ii and is identical to the observed number of post impact years in which the m th monthly value fell within its target range the target range varies between the 25th and 75th percentile of the m th monthly tennant s value ne m is calculated based on the nfr and is equal to the expected number of post impact years in which the tennant value fell within the target range and 12 represents the number of months to use the alterations calculated by eq 1 in planning stage all dm values may be aggregated into one representative metrics as in eq 2 in which dfa is the total degree of flow alteration in the most downstream hydrometric station varzanah before the zayandeh rud river drains into the marsh according to tennant method to evaluate monthly e flows through the nsga ii optimization process the average monthly nfr values at the varzanah station were used 3 3 quantification of hydrological drought as a standardized and normalized variable shdi quantifies hydrological drought severity and is analogous to the well known spi dehghani et al 2014 the shdi is an effective tool to quantify the streamflow deficit at multiple timescales rivera and penalba 2018 upstream areas of zrrb receive ample snowfall and have relatively abundant but declining surface and subsurface water resources the basin has been altered intensively by human activities zolfagharpour et al 2020 therefore proper consideration of hydrological drought state in reservoir operation should involve naturalized flow conditions by evaluating the impact of human interventions on the streamflow which is further significant in the downstream areas here we adopt shdi to monitor the naturalized drought wet state of the study basin nfr is used to calculate the shdi according to the following steps 1 selection of a suitable probability density function that adequately fits the monthly streamflow separately for each month of the year in different time scales i e 1 3 6 or 12 months 2 transformation of the probability density function into the standard normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance in this study the shdi was calculated on a 1 3 4 6 9 and 12 month time scale however we did not focus on the distributions that best fit the monthly streamflow data in the study basin additionally any selective probability distribution is no more than an approximation rivera and penalba 2018 the empirical distributions of streamflow data have inherent skewness and hence gamma distribution is a preferred choice e g medda and bhar 2019 thus to simplify gamma distribution is assumed to be suitable for the study area and was imposed on monthly stream records the gamma distribution suitability test at a 95 confidence level was assessed using the kolmogorov smirnov goodness of fit test massey jr 1951 three aggregated hydrological drought states in this study are wet shdi 0 5 dry shdi 0 5 and normal 0 5 shdi 0 5 in this study the shdi series associated with the nfr at qale shahrokh station was calculated as the streamflow upstream of qale shahrokh station constitutes the main inflow to zayandeh rud dam naturalized inflow simulated via sbhm zolfagharpour et al 2020 for evaluating drought conditions through shdi 1 3 4 6 9 and 12 month time scales were derived and compared with 12mmap based on the correlation coefficient it has believed that 12 to 24 month precipitation deficiency is well correlated with the streamflow conditions changnon and easterling 1989 3 4 reservoir operation rules in this study linear and nonlinear operation policies represented by monthly varying parameters eqs 3 to 6 were developed and compared through loss functions a general form of eqs 3 to 4 introduced by bhaskar and whitlatch in 1980 and the researchers found that eq 3 is more suitable than an extension of the other forms of equations they also resulted that nldrs in a quadratic form of r a i s b i s 2 c give the minimum average loss per year eq 3 was also used by karamouz and houck in 1982 to simulate monthly reservoir operating rules additionally in this study the demand variable was aggregated into the nonlinear equation developed by bhaskar and whitlatch 1980 to investigate monthly varying reservoir operating rules eq 4 using the shdi eqs 5 to 6 were developed for further extending the application of the proposed reservoir operation rules for different hydrological drought states at various drought target levels regression coefficients of linear or nonlinear models were derived by nsga ii for each month so the obtained rules represent the mutual benefit of water users including downstream demands and e flow requirements when storage is lower higher than the minimum maximum reservoir capacity the minimum maximum water release constraint is enforced a similar criterion was considered for the water release considering the maximum release capacity the following equations express the proposed monthly linear and nonlinear policies considering the shdi respectively 3 r k a i

suitable for two objectives optimization problems liu et al 2020 contrary to nsga ii the performance of moea in a bi objective problem with a complex pareto optimal front will degrade significantly fig 2 shows the flowchart of the study procedure nsga ii deb et al 2002 is applied to multi objective optimization and consists of four key parameters population size probability of crossover probability of mutation and mutation rate in nsga ii the production of each new generation s members is based on a selection algorithm with three main aspects non dominated sorting density estimation

substantial discrepancies between the two objectives and provide necessary information for the integrated watershed management the marginal rate of substitution a pioneering approach in explicit trade off analysis was used to select the optimal trade off a point in the pareto with the maximum marginal rate of substitution which corresponds to the maximum slope of the pareto front reddy and kumar 2006 was selected as the optimal point op this point represents the highest compromised net achievable benefits concerning both objectives 3 6 evaluation of policies reliability resiliency and vulnerability criteria were used as performance metrics of the proposed policies the reliability is equal to the probability Œ± that a system xt is in a satisfactory state s and is described as Œ± prob xt s hashimoto et al 1982 the resiliency Œ≤ is a measure of the ability of the system to bounce back from failure f to success s simonovic et al 1992 quantified resiliency by Œ≤ ns md nf where md is the maximum consecutive days of failure in a year ns is the length of the operating period and nf is the number of times the release enters a failure state in a year vulnerability is the likely magnitude of a failure here the maximum vulnerability œÖy is the maximum difference between the demand dt and the calculated value of release rt in time step t the mean long term vulnerability œÖm is defined as 14 œë m f 1 nf œë y nf œë y 0 i f r t d t m a x d t r t e l s e additionally the water deficit index wdi was used as a water availability performance indicator shiau and wu 2007 expressed by 15 wdi t 1 n m i n r t d t 0 t 1 n d t where n is the total number of months in the simulation period rt is the reservoir release mcm in month t and dt is the total water demand mcm 4 results and discussion swat links all factors impacting the basin water resources including precipitation temperature inflows reservoirs downstream water demands topography and many others here using the calibrated and validated swat model zolfagharpour et al 2020 the impact of shdi consideration and e flow allocation on the zayandeh rud dam was investigated the coefficient of determination r2 in the calibration stage at qale shahrokh and varzanah stations turned out to be 0 79 and 0 67 while nash sutcliffe of 0 75 and 0 65 were resulted respectively indicating overall satisfactory calibration furthermore the high p factor in qale shahrokh 0 85 and varzanah 0 66 stations indicate adequate bracketing of measured data within the 95ppu band the r factor was equal to 0 60 and 0 74 in qale shahrokh and varzanah stations respectively during model validation the 95ppu bracketed 61 and 69 of the observations in qale shahrokh and varzanah stations respectively illustrating that sufi2 can capture most of the historical streamflow series the r factor also varies from 0 20 to 0 13 during validation the model parameters with smaller p factor values are most sensitive the most sensitive swat parameter was ch k2 followed by ch n2 sol awc alpha bf sftmp smtmp smfmx smfmn and gwqmin the calibrated model parameters p factor values and sensitivity ranks are listed in supplementary information table s2 the monthly average the first and third quartiles of historical inflows to the zayandeh rud dam and the average monthly demands are listed in the supplementary information table s3 the assumptions in this study are as follows 1 gamma distribution is suitable to fit the monthly stream records 2 there are no substantial changes in agricultural land use and 3 the hydrological regime is intertwined with the river ecological condition comparison of monthly average values of the nfr and observed inflow into the gavkhuni marsh as measured in varzanah station shows that anthropogenic activities highly impacted the streamflow fig 3 assuming no irrigation the nfr of gavkhuni marsh during the baseline period 1985 1996 period i 1997 2006 period ii 2007 2013 and the entire simulation period 1997 2013 was simulated as 10 07 9 20 4 59 and 7 30 cms respectively moreover the values of the simulated evaporation from the reservoir and gavkhuni marsh were also extracted from the swat results see supplementary information table s3 the mean annual evaporation of the gavkhuni marsh is estimated to be 2676 6 mm which is 677 mm more than the evaporation of the surface of the zayandeh rud dam 1999 6 mm before performing the shdi calculation the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to assess the goodness of fit of a gamma distribution to monthly nfr time series accordingly the hypothesis that monthly time series follows gamma distribution was accepted at a 0 05 significance level for example the results for january and february streamflow are presented in the supplementary information fig s1 daily precipitation data covering the 1985 2013 period from 15 synoptic stations across the zrrb were provided by the iranian meteorological organization irimo four upstream synoptic stations namely shahre kord koohrang bon va saman and daran were analyzed because almost all streamflow in the zayandeh rud river originates from upstream parts specifically we sought to identify the lag time in months for which the correlation between the n month shdi e g 1 2 3 4 6 9 and 12 month at the qale shahrokh hydrometric station and m month moving average of precipitation e g 1 2 3 4 6 9 and 12 months at each of the four synoptic stations as well as the average of four stations was maximal the results showed that the highest correlation r2 0 63 occurs between 12mmap of four upstream stations and shdi 4 of the following month indicating that the accumulated precipitation of the antecedent 12 month period controls the 4 month hydrological drought state in the zrrb thus shdi 4 was selected for further drought assessment fig 4 c as expected the most frequently occurring drought was mild while the basin experienced its most severe droughts in 1997 2001 2008 2009 and 2011 the red colors in fig 4 a and b indicate severe drought while blue colors indicate wet conditions with different severity in the objective function a cost function is used to evaluate each criterion which provides a basis for the evolution of nsga ii selecting the appropriate penalty parameter value is important for handling the constraint violation in this study we imposed a value of 105 for every constraint violation out of the confidence interval the nsga ii operational parameters including population size generation numbers crossover probability and mutation rate directly impact the optimization process some researchers have previously evaluated the optimal population size of genetic algorithms according to literature it is common to set population size equal to 50 as it usually works well alander 1992 however some studies set the population size equal to the parameter s numbers huang 2014 in multi objective evolutionary algorithms tuning of mutation and crossover operators adds to the computational burden in nsga ii the mutation operator is the main mechanism of exploration as it introduces random changes in genes with the potential to drive local solutions to overall optimal solutions mirjalili and dong 2020 assuring the model results are optimal nsga ii parameter values are chosen based on their value s impact on the fitness values different combinations of population size 100 200 300 350 400 500 and 1000 mutation probability 0 05 0 02 0 01 0 005 crossover probability 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 mutation percentage 20 40 and 60 and iteration number 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 and 3500 were tested based on the best optimal fitness values of the two objective functions population size was set equal to 350 the crossover probability to 0 7 the mutation probability to 0 02 the mutation percentage to 40 and generation number to 3200 fig 5 presents the pareto fronts of the linear and nonlinear decision rules while there is an equal priority for all downstream demands and e flow of the gavkhuni marsh the developed model aims at concurrently maximizing the benefits from both objectives the tennant e flow approach didn t incorporate the magnitude duration and timing of annual extreme streamflow however environmental stress corresponding to extremes is expected richter et al 1996 davies et al 2014 surprisingly the results unveiled that the proposed simulation optimization framework minimally changes the extreme flow characteristics as 79 of the indices related to extreme flow conditions showed minor changes concerning nfr although this finding was out of the scope of the study the proposed methodology maximally allocated water to downstream demands and minimally changed the extreme flow metrics it appears that using dfa is beneficial to preserve extreme flow metrics extreme events can significantly impact upland rivers so erosion and re suspension cause higher concentrations of sediments although this will create new or disturbed habitats downstream this can be beneficial to upland stream ecology with natural formations of a wider range of habitats to support aquatic life whitehead et al 2009 future studies may further investigate the impact of sediment and water quality on operation policies in fig 5 the square boxes represent the optimal points for both ldrs and nldrs 4 1 scenario i results the optimized parameters of the nldrs derived from the optimal values of the first objective z1 the second objective z2 and two objectives in conjunction op are presented in the supplementary information table s4 within the optimization of s1n eq 4 all parameters except ci1 and di were derived as zero the derived policies applied to the zayandeh rud dam and the nfr hydrographs supplying maximum demand and minimizing the dfa are shown in fig 7 a and e in s1n the average long term allocated inflow to the gavkhuni marsh was 104 4 from 1 2 in dry years to 351 7 in wet years 187 57 403 range and 118 6 344 range of the total aaf concerning z1 z2 and op respectively fig 7 c in the s1l the corresponding values for z1 z2 and op are 115 7 range 0 395 182 range 33 411 and 121 range 2 391 respectively fig 6 a shows the periodic storage fluctuations that indicate the suitability of the selected model for optimal policy generation 4 2 scenario ii results the results of the s2n see supplementary information tables s5 s6 s7 are illustrated in fig 6 b as shown in fig 7 b d f and h incorporation of hydrological drought condition i e shdi 4 of qale shahrokh hydrometric station in the simulation optimization model eq 5 had a significant effect on the simulated release and the model could optimally meet the demand for both ldrs and nldrs for the ldrs the amount of long term average inflow to the gavkhuni marsh were 118 from 3 7 in dry years to 375 6 in wet years 175 range 52 418 and 122 range 10 364 of the total e flow needed to assure normal condition in the marsh when considering z1 z2 and op respectively fig 7 d the corresponding values for the nldrs were 105 range 1 95 348 9 171 range 26 395 and 140 range 30 355 respectively fig 7 h in this scenario nldrs are more consistent with the natural monthly variability of the marsh aaf fig 7 d and 7 h on the other hand in the s2n scenario while emphasis is on the z1 objective the model tends to allocate the e flow more parsimoniously in dry periods the white blue and pink regions in fig 6 indicate that the release in these regions is determined based on the policies developed for wet normal and drought conditions respectively concerning fig 7 b when minimizing the dfa in the marsh long term mean monthly release simulated with s2l over the 1985 2013 period comply with the mean monthly nfr on the other hand based on fig 7 f while minimizing the demand deficit the simulated release discrete green line with star marker entirely complies with the demand pattern fig 7 d shows the simulated inflow to the marsh in scenario ii when minimizing z2 the e flow of the marsh is more than in wet months or equal to the marsh aaf while it almost following the aaf corresponding to the normal condition 4 3 evaluating the performance of developed policies tables 1 and 2 show the performance of the developed policies the mean resiliency and the range of yearly resiliency generated in s2n are more than those obtained by the s1n when comparing the ldrs and nldrs s2n resulted in the highest mean resiliency and maximum yearly resiliency results from the base scenario also show that the mean resiliency is a bit higher than those of scenario i and lower than those of scenario ii in s2n when considering z2 or a compromised optimal point between the two objectives i e op the number of failure events 115 versus 116 are almost the same while all performance indices of the optimal point are better than the z2 point table 2 likely the total number of failure events remained almost the same while the magnitude and bouncing back from failure became the worst it indicates that using drought states in the development of reservoir operation rules will increase the ability of the reservoir to return to a satisfactory state this finding is consistent with those of tegegne and kim 2020 they suggested that compared to traditional reservoir operation approaches developing various reservoir operation rules for different hydrologic years improves the overall system performance including reliability vulnerability and resilience similarly ortiz partida et al 2016 studied reservoir re operation policy and reported that incorporating drought conditions in the operational rules would allocate water to humans and the environment in a sustainable manner according to the reliability index s2n will supply sufficient water for the study marsh and downstream demands the reliability of s2n compared with the baseline scenario other scenarios is considerably slightly improved in dry periods the maximum vulnerability of s1n and s2n decreased by 34 6 and 5 6 compared to the base scenario respectively it is in agreement with karamouz and araghinejad 2008 who indicated that drought mitigation in zrrb significantly reduces the system vulnerability during dry periods and increases the reliability of agricultural water demand allocation high vulnerability indices indicate that water allocations are highly unreliable under other scenarios the maximum vulnerability associated with z1 in wet and normal periods in s2n is 8 1 and 30 9 mcm respectively and is significantly lower than those of other scenarios contrary to normal and wet periods the corresponding maximum vulnerability of s2n in the dry period is 121 9 mcm which is the highest z1 objective value it is because this scenario moves to increase the reliability of supplying the demand while reducing the wdi the wdi in this scenario associated with z1 are 0 0 6 and 8 2 in wet normal and dry periods respectively which are consistently lower than the corresponding values in wet and normal periods in other scenarios tables 1 and 2 based on the simulated streamflow time series in the s2n scenario for the three hydrological drought states with water supply assurance rate of 100 and optimum e flow allocation the reliability reduction rate for z1 and op reached 65 7 95 5 to 29 8 and 58 99 1 to 41 1 respectively it indicated that the prolonged drought would endanger the safety of water supply in different sectors 4 4 minimum flow requirement in the study the 7q10 method was used to assess the adequacy of the suggested e flow based on the naturalized simulated daily flow at varzanah hydrometric station the 7q10 was estimated as 0 031 cms for the gavkhuni marsh in a similar effort sarhadi and soltani 2013 analyzed dry spells arising from upstream dam operation to construct the seasonal patterns of the nfr of the marsh and estimated 7q10 as 0 075 cms and mentioned that the 7q10 has an insignificant level of base flow which makes it unsuitable for determining the minimum flow requirement of gavkhuni marsh thus 7q10 might be unreliable for highly variable flow rivers in arid and semi arid regions however this study estimated the annual e flow volume equal to 281 5 mcm which is higher than that derived via the 7q10 method 0 98 mcm and even higher than the values suggested by sarhadi and soltani 2013 in the range of 2 36 via 7q10 method to 243 5 via flow duration curve mcm a year additionally the results showed that the seasonal variation of the simulated e flow followed the seasonal variability of the natural flow and differed from similar seasonal values calculated in a previous study sarhadi and soltani 2013 such discrepancies are rooted in the adopted methodology in simulating the e flow requirement as the past study used the flow duration curve and concentration discharge c d modeling while ignoring the natural monthly variation of the e flow 4 5 dealing with uncertainty as a highly uncertain variable reservoir inflow significantly influences the operational policies of the reservoir system ghimire and reddy 2014 in this study the model inputs include reservoir inflow nfr hydrological drought index and operating rules while model outputs are reservoir releases the uncertainty in reservoir inflow directly impacts the nfr and hydrological drought uncertainties to validate the swat model an increment of 8 improvement in p factor value ranging from 0 61 to 0 69 over that of calibration period indicates lowering of uncertainty range moreover bracketing most of the measured data within the 95ppu band ensures that most of the uncertainties in the conceptual model and inputs were captured by the parameter uncertainties arnold et al 2012 operation rules in the second scenario were evaluated for three distinct hydrological drought states with increasing the severity of hydrological drought the inflow exceedance probability for a certain amount of inflow increased while as shown in table 2 the performance indices decreased overall the proposed framework improved the system performance by developing separate reservoir operation rules for each of the three hydrological drought states it is in line with ghimire and reddy 2014 who presented different reservoir operation models for different inflow scenarios i e inflows corresponding to exceedance probabilities of 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 they indicated that the performance of the reservoir system decreased as inflow exceedance probability increased a similar result was reported by tegegne and kim 2020 who noted that in agreement with different hydrologic years the subsequent reservoir operation rules further improved the overall system performance and reduced the possibility of water allocation shortages to irrigation 5 conclusion this study presented a novel methodology for involving inflow uncertainty and hydrological drought state for real time reservoir water allocation e g downstream demands and monthly e flow requirements to obtain minimum dfa in this respect natural daily flow time series along the study river were simulated using calibrated swat model consequently the proportion of human impact on nfr was estimated as 84 over the baseline period moreover the downstream marsh is subject to continuous degradation should the business as usual scenario proceed without upstream reservoir re regulation based on the result of monthly ldrs nldrs reservoir policies nonlinear reservoir operation rules corresponding to various hydrological drought states were the most successful as the s2n scenario led to a better pareto front than other scenarios it confirms that using the inflow uncertainty in the development of reservoir operation rules could reduce the possibility of water shortages to downstream demands including environmental sectors generally the dfa improvement subject to monthly e flow variation was limited when allocating water among demands in the study basin during dry years moreover incorporating the hydrological drought state in reservoir policies improved supply and preserved the required e inflow into the downstream marsh in contrast to other scenarios the s2n scenario led to a much more reduction in wdi during wet and normal periods in the s2l scenario the reservoir release almost complied with zayandeh rud river nfr while the simulated e flow of the marsh closely matches the marsh aaf in the scenarios aimed at maximizing the benefits of the trade off between the two objectives only scenario ii improved the e flow indicators without sacrificing demands in addition an interesting observation was that the proposed simulation optimization framework minimally impacted the extreme flow characteristics as 79 of the extreme flow indices in the s2n didn t differ significantly from those of natural flow therefore the use of dfa appears an attractive tool to cope with extreme flow metrics in all shdi s consideration to develop the reservoir operation rule improves the resiliency of demand allocation and enhances the environmental benefits this study holds great potential for future solutions aimed at ensuring maximum multipurpose reservoir release benefits the findings of this study improve the understanding of the relationship between water allocation policies with ongoing drought states the authors recommend a further perusal of this study to address climate change impacts credit authorship contribution statement farshid zolfagharpour conceptualization

4414,negligence of environmental flow e flow has severe adverse impacts on wetlands additionally hydrological droughts compounded by mismanagement of available water resources and anthropogenic activities lead to water shortage and degrade wetland ecosystem however in dealing with reservoir operation re operation a few studies have addressed inflow uncertainty and hydrological drought state to improve the monthly operation performance of an upstream reservoir in coordination with downstream wetland needs hence the study objective is to adopt a linear nonlinear reservoir operation rule to hydrological drought states and e flow requirements so first the soil and water assessment swat model is applied to simulate the natural daily flow regime by eliminating human impacts then using the tennant e flow scheme the intra inter annual variability of e flow and the degree of alteration of the flow are measured afterward using the standardized hydrological drought index shdi the drought wet severity and duration are determined a linear nonlinear simulation model adopted for the presentation of reservoir policies and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii was employed to determine the optimal monthly operation of the upstream reservoir the simulated operation policies correspond to each hydrological drought state were evaluated with reliability resilience vulnerability and water deficit indices results indicated that incorporation of hydrological drought state could improve the overall system reliability by 23 over simply enforcing the monthly variable parameter nonlinear decision rules also the proposed methodology simultaneously maximized the downstream allocated water and e flow of the terminal wetland it also implicitly minimized the change in extreme flow metrics that are known to benefit ecosystem diversity the proposed framework supports reservoir re operation in regions subject to challenges in supplying water to different sectors while maintaining e flow during drought periods keywords hydrological drought natural flow regime monthly policy reservoir environmental flow zayandeh rud 1 introduction maintaining the ecological integrity of riverine ecosystems depends upon a variety of factors while such factors directly or indirectly interact with each other the natural flow regime nfr involving variation of hydrologic regimes must be satisfied to preserve the ecological integrity richter et al 1996 abdi and yasi 2015 up to now several e flow paradigms have been proposed for best preserving the ecosystem amongst them the tennant method tennant 1976 has received the most attention for the assessment of e flow requirements shaeri et al 2014 haghighi and kl√∏ve 2017 it is primarily due to its easy computation low cost dependency on historical flow records and convenient application to sustainable water resources management amrit et al 2018 goguen et al 2020 haghighi and kl√∏ve 2017 used the tennant method to design e flow regimes based on recommended flow distribution corresponding to good flow conditions they redistributed the monthly tennant s estimated e flow to overcome the water shortage associated with the periods with high water consumption the 7q10 flow the minimum average flow over seven consecutive days every ten years is the second most widely used hydrological criteria for the e flow evaluation tharme 2003 using the 7q10 as a lower threshold for e flow allocation ensures 10 of the average annual flow the lowest e flow recommended by the tennant method is not less than the threshold value of 7q10 the 7q10 flow is the minimum e flow throughout the year while it is far less than any minimum values calculated by alternate predictive methods and has been frequently used for water quality protection in the usa shaeri et al 2014 suggesting the e flow by this method makes no guarantee to preserve the optimum range of flow 60 100 average annual flow as the basis for water replenishment of a river ecological restoration so all monthly deviations from the natural state should aggregate into one reprehensive metric in this manner the hydrologic alteration factor supports sustainable watershed development by mimicking the pre impact flow regime reichold et al 2009 shiau and wu 2007 shiau and wu 2007 incorporated the intra and inter annual variability of the nfr to represent a pareto optimal solution for e flow schemes they used aggregated multi objective optimization by considering the overall degree of flow alteration dfa and shortage ratio and noted that the inclusion of the water year type in their proposed framework suggests a planning tool in real time applications dam construction has been controversial to allocate water to different uses such as irrigation industry drinking and the environment it also to some extent changes the climatic condition of the surrounding areas as dam construction is inevitable the ecosystem bears the burden of human needs and economic advances regarding the eco environmental values reservoir operation may minimize the impact of flow alteration in downstream areas to ensure the survival of existing wetlands safavi et al 2015 dutta et al 2020 adopting the e flow criteria in the development of reservoir policies has recently gained steam e g li et al 2018 ortiz partida et al 2016 the first step to consider both e flow and downstream demands is to determine a policy for reservoir operation purposes and to identify the range of possible decisions in this regard linear decision rules ldrs and non linear decision rules nldrs have long been used by researchers e g bhaskar and whitlach 1980 feng et al 2017 despite the introduction of other forms of operation rules it has been claimed that ldrs and nldrs are as good as or better than more complex rules in many cases bhaskar and whitlach 1980 liu et al 2014 simulation optimization models provide a powerful tool to allocate available water resources to downstream demands heydari et al 2016 support sustainable watershed development reichold et al 2009 and drive the adaptive operating rules feng et al 2017 using adaptable policies subject to different drought conditions may improve the operation rules in dry normal and wet periods li et al 2018 reddy and kumar 2006 used three inflow scenarios based on the deviation from mean monthly inflows to represent dry normal and wet periods and applied a bi objective optimization model in conjunction with inflow state scenarios thus containing 36 parameters to obtain the corresponding pareto optimal fronts similarly a study used different inflow classification methods to represent a unique linear reservoir response function for each defined cluster tegegne and kim 2020 they classified the reservoir inflows into distinct categories to provide the optimal operating policies associated with each class i e hydrological conditions hydrologic years and simulated outflows with the improvement assessment of reservoir operation performance however no study did incorporate different inflow states i e dry normal and wet to present a compromise solution with a comprehensive pareto optimal front the main contribution that differentiates the study from previous ones involves extracting the nfr to evaluate the e flow needs and to assess the hydrological drought condition in the natural state based on different time scales in this regard a suitable time lag of the proposed hydrological drought index that best correlates with the 12 month moving average precipitation 12mmap is determined 12 month rainfall may use to classify the moderate to severe hydrological droughts and specify the varying levels of reservoir response in the essence of the supply deficiencies changnon and easterling 1989 it also indicated that 12 month rainfall usually intermingled with streamflows and reservoir levels juliani and okawa 2017 svoboda et al 2012 while 6 month up to 24 month rainfall uses for hydrological drought analyses svoboda et al 2012 reported e flow studies on the zayandeh rud river basin zrrb focused on the e flow of gavkhuni marsh e g sarhadi and soltani 2013 safavi et al 2015 abou et al 2020 no specific study addressed a definite policy to supply the e flow of gavkhuni marsh based on its natural variability while considering hydrological drought state and reconsidering the zayandeh rud dam operation rules hence the n month hydrological drought index and the simulated e flow will be applied in the simulation optimization model to propose the reservoir policies in different drought severity conditions thus the main objective of this study is to develop a coupled monthly variable ldrs nldrs simulation optimization modeling framework for the extraction of reservoir operating rules as impacted by inflow uncertainty based on a hydrological drought index moreover the proposed methodology allocates water to different sectors while minimizing the dfa based on a subset of 12 monthly environmental water requirements besides a hydrological model e g swat is calibrated and validated to simulate the daily natural flow time series this time series converted to a monthly scale is used to derive the hydrological drought state finally adopting the shdi hydrological drought wet conditions within the simulation optimization of the reservoir operation scheme is explored and then the results are compared to those of the policies based on standard reservoir operation rules along with the originality and values of the proposed simulation optimization framework a few limitations are still present including 1 intensive computational effort is required 2 in tennant e flow estimation extreme flow conditions and timing of flow are not incorporated 3 in the nsga ii algorithm apart from usual parameters e g population size and iteration numbers tuning of mutation and crossover probabilities as well as reproduction parameters are required and 4 sediment concentration and water quality are not incorporated in the e flow policy 2 study area the zrrb is located in central iran fig 1 and drains an area of 41 500 km2 representing 2 5 of the total area of the country zayandeh rud river supplies irrigation drinking and industrial water to isfahan province one of the most important economic hubs of iran the zayandeh rud dam was constructed on the zayandeh rud river in 1971 with a storage capacity of 1450 million cubic meters mcm the reservoir release capacity is 380 cubic meters per second cms while the free spillway capacity is 1500 cms palasajan subbasin with an area of about 4 246 km2 is the main tributary of the zayandeh rud dam wheat barley sugar beet and alfalfa are the primary crops in the network of about 297000 ha of agricultural land in zrrb three diversion tunnels namely kuhrang 1 delivering 300 mcm of water annually kuhrang 2 delivering 250 mcm of water annually and cheshmeh langan delivering 120 mcm of water annually have been in operation since 1954 1985 and 2005 respectively a fourth tunnel will provide a further 250 mcm of water annually in the future 3 methodology the proposed simulation optimization model consists of four main components fig 2 1 a semi distributed model of zrrb simulating the dynamics of the basin state 2 a drought index model estimating 1 3 4 6 9 and 12 month time scale drought wet states to be compared with 12mmap 3 a multi objective reservoir simulation optimization model considering the tradeoffs across multiple objectives and 4 the interactions and feedbacks between ecological states of the study marsh drought condition and reservoir operation 3 1 simulation of natural flow regime the scenario based hydrological modeling sbhm based swat model adopted by zolfagharpour et al 2020 was used to simulate the nfr using the sbhm the simulated daily runoff disentangled by determining anthropogenic impact in zrrb swat is a semi distributed model that simulates the watershed hydrological cycles on a daily monthly or yearly time scale arnold et al 1998 the arcswat an interface between swat and arcgis for preparing the swat inputs discretizes the basin into several homogeneous hydrologic response units hrus based on topography land use and soil maps in this study the calibrated swat model was used to simulate the nfr throughout the zayandeh rud river zolfagharpour et al 2020 calibrated and validated the swat model for the study basin using meteorological and daily streamflow data for the 1985 2013 period at five hydrometric stations throughout the zayandeh rud river the spatial resolution of the digital elevation model dem land use and soil maps quantified by 90 2000 and 5000 m respectively model calibration was performed via the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup swat cup encompasses several parameter calibration techniques amongst them sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 a semi automated inverse modeling procedure for combined calibration uncertainty analysis was adopted the p factor and r factor were used to evaluate the performance of the swat model the p factor is equal to the percentage of observations covered by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu between the 2 5th and 97 5th percentiles band while the r factor reflects the average thickness of the 95ppu band divided by the standard deviation of the measured data sufi 2 iterated until more than 90 of the measured data fall within the 95ppu while the average distance between 95ppu percentiles is smaller than the standard deviation of measured data abbaspour et al 2004 the swat model performance is measured by the nash sutcliffe coefficient and coefficient of determination r2 in this study a scenario was designed to isolate the impact of human activity on streamflow during the simulation period this scenario involved current land use but with zero agricultural water uses moreover the zayandeh rud dam was eliminated in this scenario to simulate the nfr from 1985 to 2013 further information is available in zolfagharpour et al 2020 3 2 quantification of environmental flow requirements in this study in the absence of ecological data the hydrology based tennant method tennant 1976 was used to evaluate the e flow in the zayandeh rud river in the tennant method calibration data from 11 streams in three states in the united states formed the basis tennant 1976 in this method 10 of average annual flow aaf for sustaining short term survival habitat 30 to preserve good survival condition for most aquatic life forms and general recreation and 60 for excellent to outstanding habitat state are recommended see supplementary information table s1 the tennant method has been practiced in numerous studies e g amrit et al 2018 goguen et al 2020 presuming that the hydrological regime is interconnected with the ecological condition of a river system ultimately the selection of the tennant method in this study is mainly due to access to required data and ease of computation within the proposed simulation optimization model the optimum range of flow conditions 60 100 aaf was used to calculate the e flow objective function drawing from shiau and wu 2007 the dfa of each month considering the pre and post impact flow is determined as follows 1 d m n o m n e m n e m 100 2 d f a 1 12 m 1 12 d m 1 where dm is the degree of flow alteration in month m no m is determined by the simulated releases using the generated rule curves for each iteration of the nsga ii and is identical to the observed number of post impact years in which the m th monthly value fell within its target range the target range varies between the 25th and 75th percentile of the m th monthly tennant s value ne m is calculated based on the nfr and is equal to the expected number of post impact years in which the tennant value fell within the target range and 12 represents the number of months to use the alterations calculated by eq 1 in planning stage all dm values may be aggregated into one representative metrics as in eq 2 in which dfa is the total degree of flow alteration in the most downstream hydrometric station varzanah before the zayandeh rud river drains into the marsh according to tennant method to evaluate monthly e flows through the nsga ii optimization process the average monthly nfr values at the varzanah station were used 3 3 quantification of hydrological drought as a standardized and normalized variable shdi quantifies hydrological drought severity and is analogous to the well known spi dehghani et al 2014 the shdi is an effective tool to quantify the streamflow deficit at multiple timescales rivera and penalba 2018 upstream areas of zrrb receive ample snowfall and have relatively abundant but declining surface and subsurface water resources the basin has been altered intensively by human activities zolfagharpour et al 2020 therefore proper consideration of hydrological drought state in reservoir operation should involve naturalized flow conditions by evaluating the impact of human interventions on the streamflow which is further significant in the downstream areas here we adopt shdi to monitor the naturalized drought wet state of the study basin nfr is used to calculate the shdi according to the following steps 1 selection of a suitable probability density function that adequately fits the monthly streamflow separately for each month of the year in different time scales i e 1 3 6 or 12 months 2 transformation of the probability density function into the standard normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance in this study the shdi was calculated on a 1 3 4 6 9 and 12 month time scale however we did not focus on the distributions that best fit the monthly streamflow data in the study basin additionally any selective probability distribution is no more than an approximation rivera and penalba 2018 the empirical distributions of streamflow data have inherent skewness and hence gamma distribution is a preferred choice e g medda and bhar 2019 thus to simplify gamma distribution is assumed to be suitable for the study area and was imposed on monthly stream records the gamma distribution suitability test at a 95 confidence level was assessed using the kolmogorov smirnov goodness of fit test massey jr 1951 three aggregated hydrological drought states in this study are wet shdi 0 5 dry shdi 0 5 and normal 0 5 shdi 0 5 in this study the shdi series associated with the nfr at qale shahrokh station was calculated as the streamflow upstream of qale shahrokh station constitutes the main inflow to zayandeh rud dam naturalized inflow simulated via sbhm zolfagharpour et al 2020 for evaluating drought conditions through shdi 1 3 4 6 9 and 12 month time scales were derived and compared with 12mmap based on the correlation coefficient it has believed that 12 to 24 month precipitation deficiency is well correlated with the streamflow conditions changnon and easterling 1989 3 4 reservoir operation rules in this study linear and nonlinear operation policies represented by monthly varying parameters eqs 3 to 6 were developed and compared through loss functions a general form of eqs 3 to 4 introduced by bhaskar and whitlatch in 1980 and the researchers found that eq 3 is more suitable than an extension of the other forms of equations they also resulted that nldrs in a quadratic form of r a i s b i s 2 c give the minimum average loss per year eq 3 was also used by karamouz and houck in 1982 to simulate monthly reservoir operating rules additionally in this study the demand variable was aggregated into the nonlinear equation developed by bhaskar and whitlatch 1980 to investigate monthly varying reservoir operating rules eq 4 using the shdi eqs 5 to 6 were developed for further extending the application of the proposed reservoir operation rules for different hydrological drought states at various drought target levels regression coefficients of linear or nonlinear models were derived by nsga ii for each month so the obtained rules represent the mutual benefit of water users including downstream demands and e flow requirements when storage is lower higher than the minimum maximum reservoir capacity the minimum maximum water release constraint is enforced a similar criterion was considered for the water release considering the maximum release capacity the following equations express the proposed monthly linear and nonlinear policies considering the shdi respectively 3 r k a i

front among conflicting stakeholders objectives although multi objective evolutionary algorithms moea have higher performance on the optimization problems with more than two objectives nsga ii is more suitable for two objectives optimization problems liu et al 2020 contrary to nsga ii the performance of moea in a bi objective problem with a complex pareto optimal front will degrade significantly fig 2 shows the flowchart of the study procedure nsga ii deb et al 2002 is applied to multi objective optimization and consists of four key parameters population size probability of crossover probability of mutation and mutation rate in nsga ii the production of each new generation s members is based on a selection algorithm with three main aspects non dominated sorting density estimation and crowded comparison for each type of decision rules either ldrs or nldrs two scenarios defined scenario i of ldrs s1l based on eq 3 scenario ii of ldrs s2l based on eq 5 scenario i of nldrs s1n based on eq 4 including maximum 84 parameters seven parameters for each month and scenario ii of nldrs s2n based on eq 6 including a total 252 parameters seven parameters for each month and three parameters for each shdi s state 7 3 12 252 in scenarios i and ii monthly policies are optimized with a two objective nsga ii optimization model eq 7 by evaluating their effectiveness to overcome the substantial discrepancies between the two objectives and provide necessary information for the integrated watershed management the marginal rate of substitution a pioneering approach in explicit trade off analysis was used to select the optimal trade off a point in the pareto with the maximum marginal rate of substitution which corresponds to the maximum slope of the pareto front reddy and kumar 2006 was selected as the optimal point op this point represents the highest compromised net achievable benefits concerning both objectives 3 6 evaluation of policies reliability resiliency and vulnerability criteria were used as performance metrics of the proposed policies the reliability is equal to the probability Œ± that a system xt is in a satisfactory state s and is described as Œ± prob xt s hashimoto et al 1982 the resiliency Œ≤ is a measure of the ability of the system to bounce back from failure f to success s simonovic et al 1992 quantified resiliency by Œ≤ ns md nf where md is the maximum consecutive days of failure in a year ns is the length of the operating period and nf is the number of times the release enters a failure state in a year vulnerability is the likely magnitude of a failure here the maximum vulnerability œÖy is the maximum difference between the demand dt and the calculated value of release rt in time step t the mean long term vulnerability œÖm is defined as 14 œë m f 1 nf œë y nf œë y 0 i f r t d t m a x d t r t e l s e additionally the water deficit index wdi was used as a water availability performance indicator shiau and wu 2007 expressed by 15 wdi t 1 n m i n r t d t 0 t 1 n d t where n is the total number of months in the simulation period rt is the reservoir release mcm in month t and dt is the total water demand mcm 4 results and discussion swat links all factors impacting the basin water resources including precipitation temperature inflows reservoirs downstream water demands topography and many others here using the calibrated and validated swat model zolfagharpour et al 2020 the impact of shdi consideration and e flow allocation on the zayandeh rud dam was investigated the coefficient of determination r2 in the calibration stage at qale shahrokh and varzanah stations turned out to be 0 79 and 0 67 while nash sutcliffe of 0 75 and 0 65 were resulted respectively indicating overall satisfactory calibration furthermore the high p factor in qale shahrokh 0 85 and varzanah 0 66 stations indicate adequate bracketing of measured data within the 95ppu band the r factor was equal to 0 60 and 0 74 in qale shahrokh and varzanah stations respectively during model validation the 95ppu bracketed 61 and 69 of the observations in qale shahrokh and varzanah stations respectively illustrating that sufi2 can capture most of the historical streamflow series the r factor also varies from 0 20 to 0 13 during validation the model parameters with smaller p factor values are most sensitive the most sensitive swat parameter was ch k2 followed by ch n2 sol awc alpha bf sftmp smtmp smfmx smfmn and gwqmin the calibrated model parameters p factor values and sensitivity ranks are listed in supplementary information table s2 the monthly average the first and third quartiles of historical inflows to the zayandeh rud dam and the average monthly demands are listed in the supplementary information table s3 the assumptions in this study are as follows 1 gamma distribution is suitable to fit the monthly stream records 2 there are no substantial changes in agricultural land use and 3 the hydrological regime is intertwined with the river ecological condition comparison of monthly average values of the nfr and observed inflow into the gavkhuni marsh as measured in varzanah station shows that anthropogenic activities highly impacted the streamflow fig 3 assuming no irrigation the nfr of gavkhuni marsh during the baseline period 1985 1996 period i 1997 2006 period ii 2007 2013 and the entire simulation period 1997 2013 was simulated as 10 07 9 20 4 59 and 7 30 cms respectively moreover the values of the simulated evaporation from the reservoir and gavkhuni marsh were also extracted from the swat results see supplementary information table s3 the mean annual evaporation of the gavkhuni marsh is estimated to be 2676 6 mm which is 677 mm more than the evaporation of the surface of the zayandeh rud dam 1999 6 mm before performing the shdi calculation the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to assess the goodness of fit of a gamma distribution to monthly nfr time series accordingly the hypothesis that monthly time series follows gamma distribution was accepted at a 0 05 significance level for example the results for january and february streamflow are presented in the supplementary information fig s1 daily precipitation data covering the 1985 2013 period from 15 synoptic stations across the zrrb were provided by the iranian meteorological organization irimo four upstream synoptic stations namely shahre kord koohrang bon va saman and daran were analyzed because almost all streamflow in the zayandeh rud river originates from upstream parts specifically we sought to identify the lag time in months for which the correlation between the n month shdi e g 1 2 3 4 6 9 and 12 month at the qale shahrokh hydrometric station and m month moving average of precipitation e g 1 2 3 4 6 9 and 12 months at each of the four synoptic stations as well as the average of four stations was maximal the results showed that the highest correlation r2 0 63 occurs between 12mmap of four upstream stations and shdi 4 of the following month indicating that the accumulated precipitation of the antecedent 12 month period controls the 4 month hydrological drought state in the zrrb thus shdi 4 was selected for further drought assessment fig 4 c as expected the most frequently occurring drought was mild while the basin experienced its most severe droughts in 1997 2001 2008 2009 and 2011 the red colors in fig 4 a and b indicate severe drought while blue colors indicate wet conditions with different severity in the objective function a cost function is used to evaluate each criterion which provides a basis for the evolution of nsga ii selecting the appropriate penalty parameter value is important for handling the constraint violation in this study we imposed a value of 105 for every constraint violation out of the confidence interval the nsga ii operational parameters including population size generation numbers crossover probability and mutation rate directly impact the optimization process some researchers have previously evaluated the optimal population size of genetic algorithms according to literature it is common to set population size equal to 50 as it usually works well alander 1992 however some studies set the population size equal to the parameter s numbers huang 2014 in multi objective evolutionary algorithms tuning of mutation and crossover operators adds to the computational burden in nsga ii the mutation operator is the main mechanism of exploration as it introduces random changes in genes with the potential to drive local solutions to overall optimal solutions mirjalili and dong 2020 assuring the model results are optimal nsga ii parameter values are chosen based on their value s impact on the fitness values different combinations of population size 100 200 300 350 400 500 and 1000 mutation probability 0 05 0 02 0 01 0 005 crossover probability 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 mutation percentage 20 40 and 60 and iteration number 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 and 3500 were tested based on the best optimal fitness values of the two objective functions population size was set equal to 350 the crossover probability to 0 7 the mutation probability to 0 02 the mutation percentage to 40 and generation number to 3200 fig 5 presents the pareto fronts of the linear and nonlinear decision rules while there is an equal priority for all downstream demands and e flow of the gavkhuni marsh the developed model aims at concurrently maximizing the benefits from both objectives the tennant e flow approach didn t incorporate the magnitude duration and timing of annual extreme streamflow however environmental stress corresponding to extremes is expected richter et al 1996 davies et al 2014 surprisingly the results unveiled that the proposed simulation optimization framework minimally changes the extreme flow characteristics as 79 of the indices related to extreme flow conditions showed minor changes concerning nfr although this finding was out of the scope of the study the proposed methodology maximally allocated water to downstream demands and minimally changed the extreme flow metrics it appears that using dfa is beneficial to preserve extreme flow metrics extreme events can significantly impact upland rivers so erosion and re suspension cause higher concentrations of sediments although this will create new or disturbed habitats downstream this can be beneficial to upland stream ecology with natural formations of a wider range of habitats to support aquatic life whitehead et al 2009 future studies may further investigate the impact of sediment and water quality on operation policies in fig 5 the square boxes represent the optimal points for both ldrs and nldrs 4 1 scenario i results the optimized parameters of the nldrs derived from the optimal values of the first objective z1 the second objective z2 and two objectives in conjunction op are presented in the supplementary information table s4 within the optimization of s1n eq 4 all parameters except ci1 and di were derived as zero the derived policies applied to the zayandeh rud dam and the nfr hydrographs supplying maximum demand and minimizing the dfa are shown in fig 7 a and e in s1n the average long term allocated inflow to the gavkhuni marsh was 104 4 from 1 2 in dry years to 351 7 in wet years 187 57 403 range and 118 6 344 range of the total aaf concerning z1 z2 and op respectively fig 7 c in the s1l the corresponding values for z1 z2 and op are 115 7 range 0 395 182 range 33 411 and 121 range 2 391 respectively fig 6 a shows the periodic storage fluctuations that indicate the suitability of the selected model for optimal policy generation 4 2 scenario ii results the results of the s2n see supplementary information tables s5 s6 s7 are illustrated in fig 6 b as shown in fig 7 b d f and h incorporation of hydrological drought condition i e shdi 4 of qale shahrokh hydrometric station in the simulation optimization model eq 5 had a significant effect on the simulated release and the model could optimally meet the demand for both ldrs and nldrs for the ldrs the amount of long term average inflow to the gavkhuni marsh were 118 from 3 7 in dry years to 375 6 in wet years 175 range 52 418 and 122 range 10 364 of the total e flow needed to assure normal condition in the marsh when considering z1 z2 and op respectively fig 7 d the corresponding values for the nldrs were 105 range 1 95 348 9 171 range 26 395 and 140 range 30 355 respectively fig 7 h in this scenario nldrs are more consistent with the natural monthly variability of the marsh aaf fig 7 d and 7 h on the other hand in the s2n scenario while emphasis is on the z1 objective the model tends to allocate the e flow more parsimoniously in dry periods the white blue and pink regions in fig 6 indicate that the release in these regions is determined based on the policies developed for wet normal and drought conditions respectively concerning fig 7 b when minimizing the dfa in the marsh long term mean monthly release simulated with s2l over the 1985 2013 period comply with the mean monthly nfr on the other hand based on fig 7 f while minimizing the demand deficit the simulated release discrete green line with star marker entirely complies with the demand pattern fig 7 d shows the simulated inflow to the marsh in scenario ii when minimizing z2 the e flow of the marsh is more than in wet months or equal to the marsh aaf while it almost following the aaf corresponding to the normal condition 4 3 evaluating the performance of developed policies tables 1 and 2 show the performance of the developed policies the mean resiliency and the range of yearly resiliency generated in s2n are more than those obtained by the s1n when comparing the ldrs and nldrs s2n resulted in the highest mean resiliency and maximum yearly resiliency results from the base scenario also show that the mean resiliency is a bit higher than those of scenario i and lower than those of scenario ii in s2n when considering z2 or a compromised optimal point between the two objectives i e op the number of failure events 115 versus 116 are almost the same while all performance indices of the optimal point are better than the z2 point table 2 likely the total number of failure events remained almost the same while the magnitude and bouncing back from failure became the worst it indicates that using drought states in the development of reservoir operation rules will increase the ability of the reservoir to return to a satisfactory state this finding is consistent with those of tegegne and kim 2020 they suggested that compared to traditional reservoir operation approaches developing various reservoir operation rules for different hydrologic years improves the overall system performance including reliability vulnerability and resilience similarly ortiz partida et al 2016 studied reservoir re operation policy and reported that incorporating drought conditions in the operational rules would allocate water to humans and the environment in a sustainable manner according to the reliability index s2n will supply sufficient water for the study marsh and downstream demands the reliability of s2n compared with the baseline scenario other scenarios is considerably slightly improved in dry periods the maximum vulnerability of s1n and s2n decreased by 34 6 and 5 6 compared to the base scenario respectively it is in agreement with karamouz and araghinejad 2008 who indicated that drought mitigation in zrrb significantly reduces the system vulnerability during dry periods and increases the reliability of agricultural water demand allocation high vulnerability indices indicate that water allocations are highly unreliable under other scenarios the maximum vulnerability associated with z1 in wet and normal periods in s2n is 8 1 and 30 9 mcm respectively and is significantly lower than those of other scenarios contrary to normal and wet periods the corresponding maximum vulnerability of s2n in the dry period is 121 9 mcm which is the highest z1 objective value it is because this scenario moves to increase the reliability of supplying the demand while reducing the wdi the wdi in this scenario associated with z1 are 0 0 6 and 8 2 in wet normal and dry periods respectively which are consistently lower than the corresponding values in wet and normal periods in other scenarios tables 1 and 2 based on the simulated streamflow time series in the s2n scenario for the three hydrological drought states with water supply assurance rate of 100 and optimum e flow allocation the reliability reduction rate for z1 and op reached 65 7 95 5 to 29 8 and 58 99 1 to 41 1 respectively it indicated that the prolonged drought would endanger the safety of water supply in different sectors 4 4 minimum flow requirement in the study the 7q10 method was used to assess the adequacy of the suggested e flow based on the naturalized simulated daily flow at varzanah hydrometric station the 7q10 was estimated as 0 031 cms for the gavkhuni marsh in a similar effort sarhadi and soltani 2013 analyzed dry spells arising from upstream dam operation to construct the seasonal patterns of the nfr of the marsh and estimated 7q10 as 0 075 cms and mentioned that the 7q10 has an insignificant level of base flow which makes it unsuitable for determining the minimum flow requirement of gavkhuni marsh thus 7q10 might be unreliable for highly variable flow rivers in arid and semi arid regions however this study estimated the annual e flow volume equal to 281 5 mcm which is higher than that derived via the 7q10 method 0 98 mcm and even higher than the values suggested by sarhadi and soltani 2013 in the range of 2 36 via 7q10 method to 243 5 via flow duration curve mcm a year additionally the results showed that the seasonal variation of the simulated e flow followed the seasonal variability of the natural flow and differed from similar seasonal values calculated in a previous study sarhadi and soltani 2013 such discrepancies are rooted in the adopted methodology in simulating the e flow requirement as the past study used the flow duration curve and concentration discharge c d modeling while ignoring the natural monthly variation of the e flow 4 5 dealing with uncertainty as a highly uncertain variable reservoir inflow significantly influences the operational policies of the reservoir system ghimire and reddy 2014 in this study the model inputs include reservoir inflow nfr hydrological drought index and operating rules while model outputs are reservoir releases the uncertainty in reservoir inflow directly impacts the nfr and hydrological drought uncertainties to validate the swat model an increment of 8 improvement in p factor value ranging from 0 61 to 0 69 over that of calibration period indicates lowering of uncertainty range moreover bracketing most of the measured data within the 95ppu band ensures that most of the uncertainties in the conceptual model and inputs were captured by the parameter uncertainties arnold et al 2012 operation rules in the second scenario were evaluated for three distinct hydrological drought states with increasing the severity of hydrological drought the inflow exceedance probability for a certain amount of inflow increased while as shown in table 2 the performance indices decreased overall the proposed framework improved the system performance by developing separate reservoir operation rules for each of the three hydrological drought states it is in line with ghimire and reddy 2014 who presented different reservoir operation models for different inflow scenarios i e inflows corresponding to exceedance probabilities of 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 they indicated that the performance of the reservoir system decreased as inflow exceedance probability increased a similar result was reported by tegegne and kim 2020 who noted that in agreement with different hydrologic years the subsequent reservoir operation rules further improved the overall system performance and reduced the possibility of water allocation shortages to irrigation 5 conclusion this study presented a novel methodology for involving inflow uncertainty and hydrological drought state for real time reservoir water allocation e g downstream demands and monthly e flow requirements to obtain minimum dfa in this respect natural daily flow time series along the study river were simulated using calibrated swat model consequently the proportion of human impact on nfr was estimated as 84 over the baseline period moreover the downstream marsh is subject to continuous degradation should the business as usual scenario proceed without upstream reservoir re regulation based on the result of monthly ldrs nldrs reservoir policies nonlinear reservoir operation rules corresponding to various hydrological drought states were the most successful as the s2n scenario led to a better pareto front than other scenarios it confirms that using the inflow uncertainty in the development of reservoir operation rules could reduce the possibility of water shortages to downstream demands including environmental sectors generally the dfa improvement subject to monthly e flow variation was limited when allocating water among demands in the study basin during dry years moreover incorporating the hydrological drought state in reservoir policies improved supply and preserved the required e inflow into the downstream marsh in contrast to other scenarios the s2n scenario led to a much more reduction in wdi during wet and normal periods in the s2l scenario the reservoir release almost complied with zayandeh rud river nfr while the simulated e flow of the marsh closely matches the marsh aaf in the scenarios aimed at maximizing the benefits of the trade off between the two objectives only scenario ii improved the e flow indicators without sacrificing demands in addition an interesting observation was that the proposed simulation optimization framework minimally impacted the extreme flow characteristics as 79 of the extreme flow indices in the s2n didn t differ significantly from those of natural flow therefore the use of dfa appears an attractive tool to cope with extreme flow metrics in all shdi s consideration to develop the reservoir operation rule improves the resiliency of demand allocation and enhances the environmental benefits this study holds great potential for future solutions aimed at ensuring maximum multipurpose reservoir release benefits the findings of this study improve the understanding of the relationship between water allocation policies with ongoing drought states the authors recommend a further perusal of this study to address climate change impacts credit authorship contribution statement farshid zolfagharpour conceptualization
